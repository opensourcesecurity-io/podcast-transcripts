00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,309
December 19th. We're almost done. This feels like a slog.

1
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,690
It is, but it'll be over soon, just like this year.

2
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:08,789
-- That's
-- assuming anyone's still listening at this point

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,970
and they haven't all unsubscribed from the podcast.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,970
I wonder if anybody is going to binge watch these and I hope not.

5
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:15,590
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry if you do.

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:16,399
All right.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:16,969
TLS.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,629
-- Yeah. TLS. Certificate. Trust. What
-- does that mean?

9
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:20,620
You wrote this one down?

10
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:21,340
So, what is it?

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,280
I don't know.

12
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:22,590
No.

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,750
Ok. So

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,059
we talked about public key cryptography. It feels like yesterday.

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,079
But

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:35,669
I

17
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:35,979
swear

18
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,340
it's almost over.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,729
It's almost over.

20
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,400
But anyway, so I thought this is an important topic because

21
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:46,680
the internet runs on TLS.

22
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:48,009
Trust.

23
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,860
What does that mean? Right. Where do we get it from?

24
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,099
And so I would sum this up as we

25
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,779
get it from a website where we paid for it with our credit card

26
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,650
right

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,860
-- now.
-- And when you say that out loud, it doesn't sound very good.

28
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,380
-- Does
-- it, I mean, it, whatever,

29
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,500
what it,

30
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:06,010
what it basically comes down to is having a

31
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:10,269
certificate on the internet means that you proved you.

32
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,099
Are you

33
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,129
in some way?

34
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:16,330
Proved you have control of the aspects of yourself, which fundamentally

35
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,629
proving control of something is tantamount.

36
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:21,980
If you do enough of it to proving that you are that something

37
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,559
because that's just how it works. You know, if I can provide a DNA sample, that

38
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,019
is your DNA and I can provide a voice print, that is your voice print,

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,559
then effectively I can so effectively spoof you that I am. You

40
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,290
-- are, are ev certificates still a thing. Are those dead now? Absolutely.
-- Yes.

41
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,830
There's a couple of banks and stuff using them.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But more to the point,

43
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:45,870
there's a lot of organizations that specifically do not use them.

44
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,470
So my favorite example being Amazon, right, Amazon,

45
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,800
I think does a bit of online commerce

46
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:56,209
and they don't use EV cert and I think outside of banks, I haven't seen an EV Cert

47
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:56,830
in,

48
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:57,980
you know, forever.

49
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:59,519
Right. Right.

50
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,080
Well, and they're, they look weird. That's the biggest thing. Right.

51
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:05,120
They look weird because you get that big green thing in your title bar.

52
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:06,959
-- I don't know if it's still there even because I haven't
-- seen one in.

53
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,130
-- No, I don't remember it. I
-- suspect it probably caused people to freak out.

54
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,130
-- So anyway,
-- the point is the point of certificate trust

55
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,190
is that

56
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,559
the internet to use encryption, to use public key cryptography.

57
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,029
You need a way to basically say that I'm talking to

58
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,649
my bank and I'm not talking to a server cart owns.

59
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,509
-- Right.
-- Fundamentally Well, you're talking to

60
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:30,080
food.com and hopefully food.com is your bank

61
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,559
and let's assume it is because let's not,

62
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,360
let's not worry about all the weird corner cases because there's a million of them.

63
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:40,679
Well, the perfect example is just, you know, somebody registers your bank name.

64
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:44,139
Dash for real.com, you know, and then they get a certificate for it and,

65
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:46,479
and if you're not paying attention, you click on it and it looks like your bank,

66
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,720
they scrape the page and

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,339
well, to put it bluntly, that's why you need a password manager. But,

68
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,619
and,

69
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:53,839
and two factor off

70
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:57,539
the problem with TLS trust is TLS trust is about the

71
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,179
domain name or the proof of the thing that they controlled,

72
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,649
maybe an email address, but it's not who that entity is.

73
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,940
And that's in theory what extended validation and

74
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:09,699
organizational ov or organizational validation does where,

75
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,619
you know, they check your dunn's business number and blah, blah, blah.

76
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,500
But even that is,

77
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,419
you know, it's not perfect.

78
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,869
No. And there, there were many, many ways around it.

79
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,669
It was definitely security theater.

80
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,449
-- What is Burger King called in Australia? I
-- don't know. Is it Burger?

81
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,869
No, it's got a different name because isn't Burger King owned by some, like

82
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,070
some guy

83
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,089
it was

84
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,350
hungry Jack's

85
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,550
in Australia because some Australian

86
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:36,389
opened up a restaurant that serve burgers and called it Burger King,

87
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,690
which is a pretty reasonable thing to do.

88
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,869
And he beat Burger King to it. So tough.

89
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,710
I mean, yeah, it's, I'm not, it's not a unique name.

90
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,309
Yeah.

91
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,029
And,

92
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,300
but, but now at the same time, obviously, if you go to Burger king.com,

93
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,679
what the purpose of TLS does is it,

94
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,880
it doesn't even necessarily say you're connecting

95
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,830
to the Burger King organization.

96
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,300
It's saying that there's a level of trust

97
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:03,600
that can be traced back to another, a third party

98
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,009
that says the site you are going to

99
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,660
is the site you think it is, right?

100
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:11,360
And I think that is what it doesn't say anything about ownership.

101
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:12,779
It says nothing about trust.

102
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Interestingly, Burger king.com dot au, redirects to hungry jacks.com dot au.

103
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,329
-- So they did buy the domain name.
-- Interesting.

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,390
So they bought the domain. Well, good for them.

105
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,010
But no, you're right. It's,

106
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,239
and fundamentally that's a

107
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,589
we need, I need to know that I'm ending up at cnn.com because, you know,

108
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,570
I want to get my news or I'm at my td.com for my bank or

109
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,329
whatever.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,019
And because that's a, that's a thing in the physical real world.

111
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,299
When you go to a store,

112
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,049
it's usually whatever that storefront says, right?

113
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,380
People don't set up fake storefronts, take your money and run.

114
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,709
I mean, it kind of happens once in a while, but it's super rare.

115
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:49,470
-- Whereas online it's pretty common. We're,
-- we're basically out of time,

116
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,519
but I will tell you that the one answer to this question is now let's encrypt.

117
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,109
Yes.

118
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:55,579
Absolutely.

119
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,980
-- And not
-- just

120
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:58,679
-- let's
-- encrypt. Not just because,

121
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,929
because let's encrypt forces you to automate it and this stuff should be automated.

122
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,040
So,

123
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,269
it doesn't expire someday and break all your stuff

124
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,589
and their certificates have a very short lifetime.

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,059
So, even if an evildoer gets a hold of one,

126
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,829
it's not good for 10 years.

127
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,100
Yeah. And that again, speaks to automation.

128
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,089
Let's encrypt.

129
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,359
We're almost there.

130
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,230
They pick a

131
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,209
good domain name

132
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,350
and project name. Let's encrypt.

133
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,290
-- Time
-- to go.
