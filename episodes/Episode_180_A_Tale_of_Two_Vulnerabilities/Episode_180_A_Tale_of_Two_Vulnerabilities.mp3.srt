Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 180

1
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:13,079
-- with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh
-- Pressers.

2
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:16,979
-- Yeah, 180 is definitely not prime. How is
-- it? Because it ends in a zero?

3
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:18,500
Sure, that seems fair.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,209
But it's, I think it's still technically qualifies as quasi

5
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,485
-- prime because it doesn't have too, too many factors
-- not talking about this anymore.

6
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:26,674
No, we, we had a lengthy discussion of what quasi

7
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:30,284
prime means prior to hitting record and I understand

8
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:32,904
less now than I did before we started talking.

9
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:37,084
So we will not subject anyone to that conversation. So anyway, how are you doing?

10
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:40,465
Good, good, a little cold. But you know, that's life in January.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,599
That's right. When you, when you live in the Arctic circle, like it gets cold.

12
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:45,680
-- Who
-- knew

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,110
my,

14
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,639
my only real concern right now is the uh the Alberta Energy

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,180
Systems Operation Group is uh forecasting 100 and 1% energy demand tonight.

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,439
What does that mean?

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,709
Well, it means you have

18
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:59,040
100% of energy production

19
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:02,020
and they're forecasting 100 and 1% demand.

20
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,790
Yes. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you for

21
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,620
so it means you better turn some lights off

22
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:08,410
otherwise there might be some brown oats or blackouts.

23
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:11,730
-- Oh,
-- so people just don't get power is what happens the

24
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,849
last time. Ok.

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,550
As far as I know, there's never been like, like there's been,

26
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:18,830
I've had power outages but, you know, due to squirrels, that kind of thing, right?

27
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:22,690
Like local power outages or, you know, like a substation poops itself and

28
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,489
whatever,

29
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,879
but not, you know, like, um, remember the old, a couple decades ago, the, the,

30
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:28,930
the California rolling blackouts due to

31
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,110
Enron manipulating the energy market there.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,290
I said it, we all know

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,519
they had that like months ago because of fires.

34
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,959
Oh, and the fires? Yeah. Well, no, no, no.

35
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,139
That was because they wanted to prevent causing more

36
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,099
forest fires because they've cheaped out on their maintenance.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,370
And so in the wind, apparently when it gets windy there,

38
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,120
all the recruitment sparks and starts forest fires, which is fantastic.

39
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:49,430
So,

40
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:52,099
no, here it's just simply put, demand is really,

41
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,059
really high because it's currently, oh, it's actually up to minus 33 now.

42
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,900
Wow, it's warming up.

43
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,739
Holy cow.

44
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,860
So fun. Fact for everyone listening

45
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,699
minus 40

46
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,080
is the crossover point for Celsius and Fahrenheit.

47
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:08,520
So if it's minus 40 where you're at, you can just say it's minus 40

48
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,380
you don't have to explain if it's Fahrenheit or Celsius. It's

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,110
sad.

50
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,059
-- What about
-- Kelvin

51
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,860
man? Like

52
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,740
whatever

53
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,880
-- minus 40. Kelvin is it? There's not a minus 40
-- Kelvin. Exactly.

54
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,070
That's the whole point. That's the

55
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,039
-- joke is
-- there though. I don't know. I don't know.

56
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,470
Maybe there is. Maybe, I don't know

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,449
because my understanding was absolute zero was absolute zero.

58
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:33,330
-- Maybe, I don't know.
-- This, that was kind of the whole point of absolute

59
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,850
zero. Like you hit zero. There's, that's, it's absolute.

60
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:39,520
-- So why can't you have negative temperature?
-- Oh,

61
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,800
ok.

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,899
Yeah. No, six years ago, quantum gas glow goes below absolute zero.

63
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,009
You know, remember as a kid when there were like four states of matter, right

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,929
gas, liquid solid plasma, it was like OK plasma. Oh Fancy. And now I think there's 27.

65
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,970
-- I,
-- I have no idea. I don't, I don't keep track anymore. I've,

66
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,360
it amuses me but I,

67
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,880
I also recognize that

68
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:02,740
the

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,660
world has moved on so far beyond my level of understanding that

70
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:07,460
yeah, whatever,

71
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,649
whatever fine.

72
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,179
It's kind of like, you know what it always reminds me of is colors.

73
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,500
I have like six colors in my vocabulary.

74
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:14,720
So

75
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:15,309
people are talking

76
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:15,529
about,

77
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,509
oh it's just

78
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,720
blah. But you know the the a Taupe is my favorite.

79
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,020
I don't even know what Taupe is supposed to be.

80
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:21,539
-- But isn't that
-- what you get when you mix all your play

81
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,779
-- together?
-- I have no idea.

82
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,500
But

83
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,369
it's one of those things that I have like the the

84
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,410
primary colors mostly and if you start using other words,

85
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,210
I'm like I

86
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:33,669
explain it to me in one of the following six colors, please.

87
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:37,570
-- I don't know what you mean.
-- Taupe is gray with a tinge of brown

88
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:40,199
and then there's like pictures of khaki and cobblestones.

89
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,910
And I'm like, I don't think either of those are Taupe.

90
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:45,130
So it's brown, maybe tan, tans in my vocabulary.

91
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:48,210
But that's what I feel like sometimes when I start reading about

92
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,169
all of the

93
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:52,285
just crazy physics stuff that's been happening is

94
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:55,395
I have a primary color vocabulary and they're

95
00:03:55,404 --> 00:04:00,654
off inventing the Crayola 6000 colors and I have no idea what's going on anymore.

96
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:02,705
And I just like, I want a blue crayon. Please

97
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:03,225
hand me.

98
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:06,205
I remember what color Taupe is. It's named after moles in

99
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:09,804
the word for Mole in French is uh uh I can't pronounce it properly

100
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:13,384
-- in
-- no way. Does any of that information help me? Moles

101
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:14,494
are like a dark brown

102
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,238
-- because they live in the dirt. So it's basically the color of dirt.
-- But I'm

103
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,570
now I have to remember the French word for male to remember the color of a thing.

104
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,769
I can't whatever this is dumber than my

105
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:27,130
question

106
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,640
during French lessons in school. Oh, wait, you don't. Oh, yeah. No. Do you guys?

107
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,540
Hey, there's a question. Do you have like a mandatory second language typically?

108
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:35,510
Oh,

109
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,970
no, I actually took French when I was in high school and I learned very little.

110
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,489
So I would say

111
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,799
I have no functional French vocabulary.

112
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:45,420
That's fair.

113
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,059
Me too.

114
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,649
You, you live in a country where French is one of the,

115
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,410
the, the languages

116
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:52,589
of

117
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:52,720
the

118
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:52,880
two

119
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,720
languages.

120
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,630
And in fact, in the United States, we don't have an official language. So, go figure

121
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,750
that seems like a very American thing to do. It's just understood

122
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:02,700
American

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,829
or something. I don't know.

124
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,989
Anyway. All right, we should move on. This is

125
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:07,804
as fun as this is

126
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:11,325
related to. This is how the world has changed. We've got two

127
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:14,464
apparently pretty serious security vulnerabilities,

128
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,924
one from Microsoft and one from Citrix

129
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:16,725
and,

130
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,195
and I think the handling of these security vulnerabilities by

131
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:22,204
the two vendors literally could not be any more different.

132
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:23,100
I,

133
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,589
you keep

134
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,690
OK, so I'll, I'll fill the,

135
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,660
I just wanted to complain about Citrix

136
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:31,470
today because I think that the whole thing is a circus,

137
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,489
but Kurt insists on also talking about the Microsoft thing and

138
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:35,609
I'll let it go.

139
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,619
But just so, you know, it's the,

140
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,160
the Microsoft handling so far has been relatively benign and understood.

141
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,640
I think there was the what the minor leak a little beforehand but whatever, well,

142
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,769
-- the
-- leak of its existence because apparently what Microsoft was doing

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,450
is they consider this flaw so bad.

144
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,899
So it's a flaw in the crypt 32 dot DLL,

145
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,820
apparently something to do with ECC certificates and you can spoof them,

146
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:59,929
which actually is a show we're going to do some other day about, you know,

147
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,000
why crypto is so hard to get.

148
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,140
Right.

149
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:04,339
But anyways, spoofing ecc certificates is obviously pretty bad,

150
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,480
especially if you're, you know, relying on them heavily.

151
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:10,970
And apparently Microsoft shipped the security patch to some governments,

152
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,809
like probably the US government and maybe some other allies

153
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,119
and, uh, some large companies in advance,

154
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,829
which is probably how that kind of leak happened.

155
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,420
Right. Because,

156
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,000
well, let's put it bluntly right.

157
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,059
If you know, you tell two people it's not a secret anymore.

158
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,390
Yes. That is completely fair.

159
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,700
But on the flip side, they managed to keep it pretty quiet.

160
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,019
Like it's only within the last day or two that it started brewing.

161
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,470
Krebs

162
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,019
leaked it more than a day early and

163
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,700
-- I mean, who knows what he knew? But he
-- didn't leak any actual information

164
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:43,480
-- other than we know it's a crypto flaw.
-- Here's my take on that is don't tell anyone

165
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,100
because like you said, they're going to leak it.

166
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,839
But then how do you ship the patch early?

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,970
Right. It's one of those things

168
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,399
if you tell people and in fact,

169
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,989
there were people on Twitter who got this right

170
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,070
where before? Because basically

171
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,670
what, what was said was it, it's basically affects all windows from 2015 to now

172
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,230
and someone looked back and, you know, they added in 2015,

173
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,309
they added ECC encryption in 2015.

174
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,269
They were like, oh, it's probably something to do with ECC

175
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:11,350
and it's like,

176
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:15,230
it, it always reminds me, I forget which one it is, there was a security flaw,

177
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,029
one of the http

178
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:21,149
21 dot something TLS. Not att my brain.

179
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:24,399
One of the TLS one dot Something attacks.

180
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,839
It was like beast or one of those where

181
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,790
basically someone gave a little bit of info on Twitter

182
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,760
and a security researcher was like, oh, I bet it's this. And it was exactly that.

183
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,559
Well, part of that though is Survivor bias and that there's,

184
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,679
there's been a lot of speculation and if there's enough,

185
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,549
if enough people buy lottery tickets, one of them will win,

186
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,079
it's not that

187
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,859
people buying lottery tickets are all picking winning numbers.

188
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,799
I don't know, Kurt, that's not what those commercials say.

189
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,559
True.

190
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:52,019
But, um,

191
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,230
but no, I think, I think in general it looks like Microsoft, you know,

192
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,549
handled this reasonably well.

193
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,070
They got, uh, the patch out. Um,

194
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,489
it didn't really leak too, too much and, you know, now it's Microsoft Tuesday patch,

195
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,540
Tuesday and everybody's

196
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:05,709
patch in the

197
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:06,119
side

198
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:06,670
of

199
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:06,820
it.

200
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,429
That's fair. And let's frame this against Citrix

201
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:11,950
because the Citrix

202
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,220
-- flaw
-- remind me, when is that patch coming out for Citrix again? Is it

203
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,739
they took

204
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:16,440
at

205
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,700
the end of January and we're currently in

206
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,260
the middle of January recording this episode.

207
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,339
So we'll see, I guess.

208
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,549
And,

209
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,829
and that's only for some of the versions, the other versions will follow later.

210
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,308
Yeah, it looks because the, the, the, the firmware affected is 1011, 1213.

211
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,869
You know, that's,

212
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,989
oh, and

213
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,979
gateway, gateway firmware net scaler.

214
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,750
Like it's a big pile, like it basically looks like pretty much

215
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:50,390
-- all of their code.
-- So, let's explain this though. So, here's what happened.

216
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,479
Basically, Citrix

217
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,270
has a security flaw

218
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,369
that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution,

219
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,880
which as far as security flaws go is basically like the, the worst.

220
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,500
-- There's not,
-- that's the holy grail for Attackers. Yeah,

221
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,830
-- exactly
-- two things.

222
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,950
Number one, you can easily scan the internet for vulnerable systems or number two,

223
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,469
you can just spam the attack out.

224
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:13,710
Right. Right. Like once you have working exploit code, you're good to go. Right.

225
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,979
And so essentially what happened was

226
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,979
this flaw became known

227
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:18,960
and

228
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,780
Citrix released

229
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,559
instructions to mitigate it, but their instructions are monstrous.

230
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,320
My understanding is the mitigation also isn't 100%.

231
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,400
I don't know any details about that.

232
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:34,599
But if you, I'll put a link to the mitigation instructions in the show notes,

233
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,989
they're enormous.

234
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,669
It's funny because in some ways the flaw is really stupidly simple,

235
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,000
but because it's sort of one of those stupidly simple flaws,

236
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,059
actually fixing it will be kind of a nightmare.

237
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,219
And it's literally a dot dot Path traversal.

238
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,719
Uh Right. That's it. Like you literally go and ask for VPN slash dot dot slash VPN

239
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:55,460
and it goes, oh, ok. You want the contents of the VPN directory? Cool. Yo,

240
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,780
that's it, folks. Sorry,

241
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,260
I just gave it away.

242
00:09:58,429 --> 00:09:59,820
-- But
-- then there's another flaw

243
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,669
-- that lets you write files.
-- Yeah, exactly. So, yeah.

244
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,919
Well, the thing is you can get access to that VPN S directory or VPN directory,

245
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:07,679
whatever it's called.

246
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:10,669
And, yeah, and then you can, I mean, it's just so ridiculous that,

247
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,510
like, in this day and age, first of all, there shouldn't be a path traversal flaw.

248
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,130
Right. That stuff should be normalized before it goes to Apache and a path serves it.

249
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,570
That's

250
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,150
like,

251
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,320
like, haven't we been doing with saying that for 20 years?

252
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:23,760
Well, I mean, look, that's easier said than done.

253
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,700
I mean, people make mistakes and look, I'm not going to argue

254
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,429
whether this flaw should or shouldn't exist

255
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,190
-- because it does
-- basic fuzzing would catch this

256
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,859
basic http fuzz.

257
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:37,989
-- It
-- is irrelevant because I think talking about the source of the flaw

258
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:40,359
takes away from the response Citrix

259
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:44,179
has had to this because it has been atrociously bad

260
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,750
when you have a critical flaw in your product.

261
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,950
I think taking a month to get a fix out is

262
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:53,250
that is terrible, especially one of this magnitude.

263
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,679
And the best part is I'm looking through the workaround. It's actually reasonably

264
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:57,469
straightforward.

265
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:02,460
You add a responder to the web server to handle those dot dot things and you know,

266
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:03,900
make sure they don't get to the server.

267
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,169
But more of the point can't that at least be like usable

268
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,945
in an automated sense then like here's a web page with instructions,

269
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:12,505
I would think.

270
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:16,244
I mean, I agree with that's the first thing I thought of was why isn't this a script?

271
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:18,065
But then part of me also wondered,

272
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:20,594
is it not a script because it's

273
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:25,575
fragile or is there the potential to like, ruin something between steps?

274
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,104
Like I, I don't know it,

275
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:30,905
I agree though. It feels like why this should be a script you download and run.

276
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:31,760
Yeah.

277
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,539
And it's smart enough to detect what version of whatever thing you're

278
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:36,880
running like you have one script you just run because I mean,

279
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,320
remember when we were at Red Hat,

280
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,169
Red Hat started doing some scripts like this for someone,

281
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,729
I don't think they were fixing scripts but they were detection scripts for.

282
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,200
What was it? One of the intel ones, I think

283
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,340
uh for

284
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:47,020
-- a, a number of things.
-- Yeah.

285
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:48,630
And you know, I mean, it's not

286
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,900
easy but at the same time it's not rocket science

287
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,690
-- and it's
-- hugely useful because you do have people, I mean, look,

288
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,549
even if Citrix had a patch ready on day one,

289
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,710
there's going to be people who can't upgrade immediately, right.

290
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,859
And I mean,

291
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:04,039
part of the problem as well is that so they announced

292
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,630
it was an issue and then a couple of days later only

293
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,940
somebody had created an exploit, you know, a functional exploit for this.

294
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,679
And at that point like game over pretty much,

295
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,700
I don't know what their thinking was here.

296
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,179
If,

297
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,719
if they thought maybe it's not as bad as it is

298
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,080
or if they thought people wouldn't develop exploits for it.

299
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,539
One thing I've noticed

300
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:25,140
and I think it's sort of against survivor bias.

301
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,859
The kind of company that would have this kind of

302
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,599
flaw is also the kind of company that would think,

303
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:31,260
oh, these security flaws, they're really difficult and tricky.

304
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,119
-- Nobody's going to figure it out.
-- I

305
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,719
-- mean, maybe that's not unreasonable
-- because looking at this flaw, it's like, wow,

306
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:39,169
that's super simple.

307
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,150
-- Like this is not,
-- right?

308
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,549
This is not, you know, some 20 or well, not 20.

309
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,890
This is not some like five page email from a security vendor saying like, OK,

310
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,030
so in the Linux kernel when it's a full moon and

311
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,419
you plug in your USB and you know this blah,

312
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,280
you know what I mean? It's not one of those flaws

313
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,659
-- where it's complicated.
-- It's, those are my favorite. Yeah.

314
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:03,919
You know, it's, it's literally dot dot Path traversal with, yeah, like a file,

315
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:04,599
right flaw.

316
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,590
And then the thing just, it runs stuff that you tell it to

317
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:08,869
with privilege

318
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,559
like

319
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:11,140
that. That's it. That's

320
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,630
I've just described them like I've given you enough information that

321
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,510
you can go look at this product and write an exploit.

322
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,609
Well, and you know,

323
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:21,859
what else probably makes this really bad is I bet in a lot of

324
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:26,099
environments they poked a hole through the firewall to let the Citrix traffic in.

325
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:28,950
Yeah, you have to, right. If you want remote workers and the whole I mean.

326
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,280
And that's,

327
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:30,299
and that's part of the problem is like the

328
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,590
whole premise of a lot of these Citrix products is

329
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,210
you want to give quote unquote air, quote, finger wiggles secure quotes here,

330
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:38,049
secure access to your internal systems,

331
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,489
you know, presenting them so that, you know,

332
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,830
people can easily cut and paste data out of them or

333
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,969
run arbitrary commands or code or do whatever

334
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:49,750
in theory when Citrix works, it's actually not a bad solution.

335
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,130
It's just, it's pretty cool.

336
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,840
It just seems to be one of those companies that has like

337
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:56,789
a legacy code base that has a lot of technical debt,

338
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,469
especially security debt.

339
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,299
I have no doubt. I mean, I remember Citrix

340
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,570
being around,

341
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:06,650
it was what, the early two thousands, I think it kind of really, I mean,

342
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:10,710
that's when I, I remember it for, I don't, I'm sure it's older than that,

343
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,710
-- but that's kind of when it 19
-- 89.

344
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,429
What? That's bananas.

345
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:16,900
Holy cow.

346
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,210
Yeah, I would not have guessed 1989.

347
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,929
-- Like
-- did networks exist in 1989?

348
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,630
Not for most people? Holy cow. That's something.

349
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,119
Ok.

350
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:29,570
I,

351
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,280
I'm gonna hope

352
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:36,369
there's no code from 1989 still in use.

353
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:38,960
No,

354
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,780
don't do it. I know you want to but don't.

355
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,239
But, but regardless I think

356
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,309
I, OK,

357
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,210
I would bet that there is code or something in there from at least the late nineties.

358
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,109
I believe that.

359
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,830
And the only reason I say that is because Apache wasn't released until 1995.

360
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,380
Uh

361
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:58,950
-- Apache was released in 90
-- five. Initial release date. April 95.

362
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,229
I feel. Wow, that means I was using it shortly after it was released.

363
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,750
I guess I never realized that.

364
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,630
Well, it was either.

365
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,729
Well, like literally, you know, if you weren't using the N CS A one,

366
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,969
you were using the patchy

367
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,440
version of the N CS A one, which was better because they had patches

368
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,400
and, well, didn't son have a web server.

369
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:19,250
Everybody had a web server.

370
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:20,260
They were,

371
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,690
yeah, they were.

372
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:22,599
That's fair.

373
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:23,840
They're still terrible.

374
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,070
It's called,

375
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,219
I'm having like all these floods of terrible memories now.

376
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:34,400
-- But,
-- yeah, so, I mean, I, I love the fact that this is just OK,

377
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,460
spoofing encryption certificates

378
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,200
is bad

379
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,690
but it's typically at least a two stage attack.

380
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,309
Like, I'd have to get you, like, here's an, here's a signed update, you know,

381
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,299
check the signature on it before you run it

382
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,330
or, you know, something along those lines. Right.

383
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,989
Whereas this is like, ok, is your, is your Citrix machine on the internet? Well, yes,

384
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,570
maybe not directly on the internet. But is it on a network?

385
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,650
Well, yeah, because why else would you be running it?

386
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,099
-- That's, that's the point.
-- Exactly.

387
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:05,049
Generally of computers nowadays is to put them on the internet.

388
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:08,570
That's just sort of how it is. Uh, anyways.

389
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,080
So, are you vulnerable? Well,

390
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,590
yes. Yes, you are.

391
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:16,099
Unless maybe magically you have some like web application, firewall,

392
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,380
sing in front of it that happens to have

393
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,479
a rule of blocks dot dot directory traversals,

394
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:19,820
which

395
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,830
-- I think most of them kind of do.
-- I would hope so.

396
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,599
I mean, there's very few instances where dot dot slash should be in URL.

397
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:28,210
Never,

398
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:29,369
I should,

399
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:34,270
I want to write a web server that primarily deals in dot dots and slashes in the,

400
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:34,770
er,

401
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,989
-- maybe
-- Morse code.

402
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,159
Right. Right. I like it.

403
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:39,179
But

404
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,010
anyway,

405
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,530
and the fact is, I mean, you know,

406
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,940
like this is going to be a classic enterprise security patch and that Citrix

407
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,130
is going to release a patch for like the most up to date version

408
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,390
and maybe the, you know,

409
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,330
current version minus one and then maybe the current version minus two,

410
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,140
a few weeks later and then maybe

411
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,619
an older version that's also affected

412
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,179
later

413
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:06,420
so on. And so like they're going to dribble fixes out over a period of weeks or months.

414
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,949
Uh That's kind of what it sounds like. Also just a fun factor. I've been listening

415
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,930
dot

416
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,020
is E in Morse code and dot dot Is I,

417
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,699
so I don't know what we can do with that, but it sounds interesting.

418
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,060
Makes sense. But what really gets me is like

419
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,270
this is going to take Citrix,

420
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,420
-- how long to push a patch out.
-- Uh It's taking them a long time.

421
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,880
It's, it's going to be more than a month,

422
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,579
which is unacceptable for this sort of issue.

423
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:28,040
I mean,

424
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,609
I remember dealing with these and now I'm not going to

425
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,140
-- tell Citrix what they should or shouldn't be doing
-- internally,

426
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,819
they should drop everything and fix it is what they should be doing.

427
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,959
Yeah, that's, that's what needs to happen.

428
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,920
And if they, if they have dropped everything and it still takes a month, like,

429
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,079
you guys have some problems that you probably need to fix.

430
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,270
Yeah. I,

431
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:49,540
I the proof is like if I take my car in to the mechanic and he's like,

432
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,390
it's gonna be a month.

433
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,229
I mean, it better be an import where I need, you know,

434
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,989
parts delivered from Japan or somewhere

435
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,829
on a pack mule for that to take a month.

436
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:00,199
Otherwise it should take like two days.

437
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,260
Right. Exactly.

438
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,459
I mean, I, well, OK,

439
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:05,579
it can take longer than that because my favorite example here

440
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:10,319
for just terrible security issues is I remember working on Mozilla things

441
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,380
and like just building

442
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,229
Firefox, the web browser takes 24 hours

443
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,300
because it is gigantic,

444
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:18,939
right?

445
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:20,500
And there's only so much you can run in

446
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,939
-- parallel and
-- we didn't have fast computers back then.

447
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:23,410
Uh

448
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,550
Yeah,

449
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,750
I remember some of the machines people built to compile code and like

450
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,839
literally just shoving as many fast cores as they could in them.

451
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:35,489
And the problem being is that at some point you get diminishing returns.

452
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,670
Like the compiler is just like,

453
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,099
you know, the compiler is like 100 and 28 courses. Fantastic.

454
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:43,329
-- I only need like eight of them.
-- Well, and you know what? Always got

455
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,099
things like Fedora,

456
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:48,319
I'll pick on just because they're public and this is kind of widely known is

457
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,810
when you support lots of weird architectures, some of them are really, really slow

458
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,489
and you might only have one

459
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,354
and one slow machine

460
00:18:56,545 --> 00:19:00,214
-- like mps or
-- arm. Right. And so now you have to wait for it to build.

461
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,305
-- Yeah,
-- like the thought of even on a Raspberry four, which is a pretty fast arm.

462
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:06,074
CPU the thought of like recompiling a Linux kernel.

463
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:09,885
I wonder how long that would take? I haven't, I haven't built a kernel in a long time.

464
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:11,545
I can't even tell you what it takes.

465
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,239
So, so anyway, anyway,

466
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:15,339
the point is

467
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,589
I'll give him a week maybe because something like this, I think worst case scenario,

468
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,839
get it done in a week, right?

469
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:26,180
-- A month is ridiculous.
-- Well, or at least get an interim patch out that like

470
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:26,530
ha

471
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,390
fixes

472
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,170
work around

473
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,319
instructions. So that I know

474
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:30,160
that, you know,

475
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,270
because the thing I always hated with these configuration workarounds is,

476
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,609
are we sure it fixes it?

477
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:36,660
Like, are we sure I implemented it correctly?

478
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,589
See that's the advantage of updating a binary.

479
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,500
Like if I'm running that up to date binary with or up to date library or whatever,

480
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,349
then I'm almost certainly

481
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,170
ok.

482
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,810
But if it's a configuration change, well, you know,

483
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:52,510
now I need basically a defanged exploit to test it for me to really believe it.

484
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,250
And even then,

485
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,170
well, ok, so they got this one avenue. But what if it's like

486
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:02,739
slash VPN slash dot dot slash VPN slash dot dot slash VPN slash dot dot slash VPN?

487
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,089
-- Like what if I put two in or three in? Does it still work? Maybe? Let's
-- hope not.

488
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,780
But ok, so let's,

489
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,560
let's turn this around now because I feel like

490
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,579
we're just flogging the dead horse at this point.

491
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,239
So you wanted to compare this to what Microsoft has just released.

492
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,859
-- So
-- Microsoft working with partners, you know,

493
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:22,849
they found basically as far as crypto goes

494
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,699
in the crypto world, this is pretty much the worst case scenario right?

495
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,579
Here's a certificate, I can spoof it because you don't check it properly.

496
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,689
And this is why I don't like elliptical curve

497
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:33,209
cryptography is because it's so easy to get wrong.

498
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,300
And the problem is especially with stuff like

499
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,010
RS A&E CC is you can have an implementation

500
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,800
that is

501
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:41,250
security wise broken

502
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,020
but still works and interoperates with other crypto

503
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,290
implementations.

504
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,520
Well, and it should be noted here as well.

505
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,329
They're crediting the National Security Agency of the United States for,

506
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:53,689
for disclosing this.

507
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:55,040
I'm kind of wondering if those guys were doing

508
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,550
some crazy high level certificate fuzzing against implementation.

509
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,209
It could be, I mean, the thing that comes to mind always when the NSA

510
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,959
discloses something like this is either they found it a

511
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:08,305
long time ago and it's burnt now for whatever reason,

512
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:12,334
or they found an adversary using it so they want to burn it on them

513
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:15,145
or that they were doing legitimate research and found this and said, oh,

514
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:17,864
-- we better tell someone because this one's pretty bad
-- back to the problem.

515
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,074
The NSA has a dual mission, right?

516
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:20,584
To break into other people's

517
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:23,415
communications and to secure America's communications

518
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:28,074
and those two things are incompatible may not be the right word,

519
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,515
but that's the only word I can think of.

520
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:32,994
I always love it when I talk to someone from the NSA

521
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,050
and, you know, they be like, I work for the NSA.

522
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,310
Oh no, the part you like though, it's like, oh, ok. Yeah.

523
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,390
Yeah.

524
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,439
And the thing is, I mean,

525
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:43,180
the beauty is even though Microsoft did a patch today

526
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:44,859
and got a patch out early to other people,

527
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,140
I mean, it's not like this patch is going to have 100% implementation.

528
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,719
It isn't, you know, it's,

529
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:53,199
it's one of those classic S curves where you're going to hit 80% probably,

530
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,910
hopefully in a week or two,

531
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,219
90% in a couple of months, you know.

532
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,739
Well, this one comes with some mitigating factors.

533
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,290
So here's, here's where we can compare and contrast. So

534
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,900
we understand what's going on here, but we don't know what the problem actually is.

535
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,290
Now someone's going to figure it out in probably the next

536
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,099
24 hours is my suspicion from the time of release.

537
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:15,369
I suspect it might take a little longer because just

538
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,270
I'm guessing

539
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:18,349
if it's maybe something to,

540
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:20,890
it might be something to do with the math implementation.

541
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,650
So it's not just a simple but probably within a few days or a week or two at the most.

542
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,609
-- Let's
-- assume a week. Ok. I don't think it will be, but let's just say a week.

543
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,540
So now we understand the problem,

544
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,339
but now we have to figure out how do we actually exploit it.

545
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:35,880
And I don't know the details on what it looks like.

546
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,170
And of course, when we're talking about cryptography,

547
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,250
it could be a huge range of problems.

548
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,010
I suspect it's a tiny bit more complicated than putting

549
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,000
-- dot dot into your request
-- string one would hope so.

550
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,979
But now it's going to take people probably at least as long to

551
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:54,420
exploit is my assumption as it took them to understand the patch.

552
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:57,699
So let's say in two weeks, there's a functional exploit that's out,

553
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,339
right?

554
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:00,699
Even when that happens,

555
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:01,540
you have

556
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:05,464
a certain amount of lead time between patch release and functional exploit.

557
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,395
But then

558
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:09,834
this is also they've rated it important because like this,

559
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:14,494
you can't just connect over the internet and attack this one, right? You basically

560
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:17,385
from the

561
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,994
I shouldn't say that I shouldn't say that

562
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:22,064
from what I understand at this moment in time,

563
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:25,714
it is about code signing and running executables

564
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,150
which is not very internet friendly.

565
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,469
Well, that would be the most obvious threat vector.

566
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:34,099
But for example, if it's, if it's deep in the crypt 32 dot DLL, for example,

567
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:37,219
what if you're using ECC client certificates to authenticate clients?

568
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:40,000
And they don't say that can happen and I have

569
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,290
a strong suspicion they would say that if it could be

570
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,589
pretty, yeah.

571
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,760
You know what, I'm going to agree,

572
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,060
they've Microsoft has actually been pretty decent about

573
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:53,439
in the last I would say half decade, decade or so of, yeah, actually copying

574
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,780
the realistic exploits where there are certain other

575
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,640
vendors who shall remain nameless where they're like,

576
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,079
oh yeah, you can only do it this way and then of course, a day later,

577
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,540
you know, somebody like Tavis is like, what about this, this way and that way

578
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,020
-- in the next day? No
-- other way.

579
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,089
Yeah, exactly.

580
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:11,270
You know, and then like 17 avenues of exploitation later were like,

581
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,500
can you please fix the root cause?

582
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,790
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

583
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,829
And so I, I mean,

584
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,400
given that the NSA reported it to them and they looked at it

585
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,089
and I'm sure Microsoft didn't put the B team on this one.

586
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:23,439
Right.

587
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:27,300
Here's what's fascinating to me is Microsoft could have and the NSA,

588
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,589
I'm sure could have easily

589
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,290
gone, you know, with quote

590
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,359
unquote, an anonymous researcher. Uh

591
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,959
-- Right. I mean, if they wanted to, yes, they could have.
-- No, no, they couldn't.

592
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:36,750
Here's the thing

593
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:38,560
-- to say,
-- but

594
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,839
a reported, it makes this real people.

595
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,689
But at the same time, I think there's two sides to that.

596
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:47,069
There's the aspect of people who pay attention.

597
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,390
But then there's also the angle of you can,

598
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,319
you can't keep a secret, right?

599
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,760
If the NSA reported this to Microsoft and they're like, oh,

600
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,050
an anonymous researcher in

601
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,829
six months, we would all know it was the NSA 100% guaranteed.

602
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,780
And then the NSA has apr nightmare because everyone's going to be like,

603
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:06,359
so, like, were you guys hacking with this or what's the deal? You know?

604
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:08,099
Well, I would hope they were hacking with this.

605
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,709
Isn't that literally half of their job?

606
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,270
I'm not going to get into that.

607
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,680
Yeah.

608
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:13,560
Anyways, I mean,

609
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:18,349
the reality is if a country has a capability in their military or security services,

610
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:22,410
then they should probably be using that capability. Otherwise, why have it?

611
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,859
-- I,
-- man,

612
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,910
we could do 100 shows on this topic.

613
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:30,510
This is my, this is my German, half real politic coming out, you know,

614
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,030
good old Hindenburg

615
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:33,339
than Bismarck.

616
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:36,560
There's, there's so many views on this and I,

617
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,560
I don't have an opinion because my view is,

618
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:42,270
I don't understand the dynamics of this well enough

619
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,119
to say we should or shouldn't be doing this.

620
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,410
And I'm comfortable saying that and I'm comfortable letting other people

621
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,650
argue about it and that's pretty much where I stand.

622
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:53,920
I would say, I think at a minimum, we at least need to be maintaining that,

623
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,209
that capability.

624
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:59,520
Like we don't want to have the NSA not have any people who can, like, create exploits.

625
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,630
I feel like that would be really bad long term,

626
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:02,569
you know,

627
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,060
much like the US let go of their intelligence capability after world war one and,

628
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,530
-- you know, had to basically rebuild it for World War Two
-- and

629
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:10,560
now it sucks again. So,

630
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:10,859
yeah,

631
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:15,209
this, this whole thing with Citrix at first, I kind of thought it was a joke

632
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,109
in the sense of like, well, it can't be that simple and it can't take that long to fix.

633
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,530
Right?

634
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,569
I hear you, man.

635
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,229
And what's really interesting is there's,

636
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,500
there's other vendors like cloud flare has been doing a lot

637
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,839
of stuff and I didn't really get it at first where,

638
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:29,430
you know, so cloud flare will proxy your website, you know,

639
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,750
eat up your D dots attacks.

640
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,849
But now they're doing traffic sort of the other way.

641
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,569
They're actually saying, you know, we confront

642
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,699
for your SSH server and give you, you know,

643
00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:39,280
basically a secure SSH login that goes to your server

644
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,130
or same thing for applications.

645
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,060
We can basically act as a VPN slash W A for applications.

646
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,479
And then like your team around the globe

647
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,369
can, you know,

648
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,209
securely connect to whatever dot your Corp and

649
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,829
that's proxy through cloud flare super secure,

650
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,599
you know, much faster, you know, blah, blah blah.

651
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:58,160
And I was at first I was kind of like, I don't really get it,

652
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,640
but now having seen the Citrix thing, I'm kind of like, yeah.

653
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,119
Ok.

654
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,800
I'm beginning to understand that. I, I

655
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,229
think we're at the point where

656
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:07,290
this is just normal, right?

657
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,790
These enterprise software that have this, like, remote,

658
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,709
not only do they have a remote code execution

659
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,589
flaw and not only is there public exploit code,

660
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,390
but it's like you're going to have to wait a few weeks for the update. And

661
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:18,780
this isn't generally the kind of stuff where you can just

662
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,390
turn it off and live without it for a few weeks.

663
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:23,530
Because if you could do that, you would have done that,

664
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,540
you would have gotten rid of this it

665
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:26,660
thing that you don't need.

666
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,579
-- I
-- mean, actually, actually I hadn't even thought of that,

667
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:31,770
but I wonder how many organizations are going to use this as an opportunity

668
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,420
to just finally get rid of it and be like this is ridiculous.

669
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:34,689
I'm done.

670
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:37,060
The problem is with, with whatever Citrix is doing,

671
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,969
it's delivering an application to people that they by definition need.

672
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:41,400
Otherwise you would have killed it.

673
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,800
Like I'm in the process of the CS A of,

674
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,829
of getting rid of some old stuff like our mailing

675
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,949
list server finally getting to kill our mailman instance.

676
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,680
Hallelujah. So happy

677
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,839
-- which means I get to get us out of the business of handling email directly.
-- Right.

678
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:55,329
Right.

679
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:57,890
Ok. So I, I'm sorry, I'm going to interrupt you.

680
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,880
I saw a message on Twitter from the NSA about this,

681
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,959
this issue and it does say it says http S connections,

682
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:06,609
signed files and emails and signed executables.

683
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,709
So it probably does affect websites which is huge if it,

684
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,086
well, websites using client authentication with UCC certificates, which

685
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:18,365
if memory serves, what do those dut common access cards use?

686
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,956
I don't know if they use ECC. I'd be shocked if they don't.

687
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:26,245
Yeah, because kind of thought C A CS were using ECC stuff now because well,

688
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:27,696
smaller keys faster, more efficient.

689
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,196
-- They, they probably are, I'd be surprised
-- if they are.

690
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:34,365
So, yeah, I mean, if you found, OK, so for those of you don't know, don't know. The US

691
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,621
Department of Defense has this thing called the common access card

692
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:37,911
and it's essentially

693
00:28:38,072 --> 00:28:41,251
-- like a PK I smart card.
-- Everyone has smart cards.

694
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,452
Now, man, you got to like the hospital,

695
00:28:42,462 --> 00:28:44,592
you go almost anywhere and people have smart cards.

696
00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:47,062
So I feel like in that case,

697
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:50,952
the NSA would prefer to have all the dod systems secured rather than have

698
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,761
this exploit that they can use once and then hope Microsoft patches quickly.

699
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:55,241
Yeah, I mean, that's probably fair.

700
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:56,182
That's true.

701
00:28:56,989 --> 00:28:57,530
They

702
00:28:57,729 --> 00:29:01,780
had an incident a while back with authentication and everyone.

703
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,380
So,

704
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,400
right. Anyway,

705
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:05,869
-- so I
-- guess, I mean,

706
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,550
what's interesting to me though is Microsoft went from

707
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,319
literally being the poster child of not just incompetency

708
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:16,800
but basically malice and evil in the security world 20 years ago,

709
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:17,959
I would agree with that.

710
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:21,670
Like, literally where they were threatening people and they were, you know,

711
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,040
I remember those timelines coming over.

712
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,439
It's like I told Microsoft you're reading the timeline, you're like, oh,

713
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:27,010
they told them in January, that's not so bad.

714
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,829
And then you realize, wait, no, no, no, that wasn't this January.

715
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:31,800
You know, what year is that again?

716
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,439
And in some cases, it wasn't just like Microsoft took a long time to fix it.

717
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:37,680
It's like people would spend six months

718
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:40,319
trying to convince Microsoft they found a flaw and they'd be

719
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:43,750
like sent working exploit code to Microsoft and Microsoft you,

720
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,119
like, who are you, what are you talking about?

721
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,750
We've never heard of you before, right?

722
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,079
And not just random people but people in the industry with like a known track record.

723
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,199
And now they're pretty much,

724
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:57,229
uh, honestly, they're kind of as good as the cats, the

725
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,760
security response.

726
00:29:59,199 --> 00:29:59,469
Like,

727
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,390
you know, old me is just like

728
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,670
in a padded room right now rocking back and forth.

729
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:07,750
Well, look, I, I think, and we'll, we'll end it on this note because we're,

730
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,150
we're basically out of time.

731
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,260
But I think this is an example of what

732
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,530
happens when you shift your mindset from security is being

733
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:17,310
just an annoyance that costs money,

734
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:21,020
which is quite possibly like what Citrix is doing right now,

735
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,859
just given what I've seen versus Microsoft where

736
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,719
they view it as like doing the stuff,

737
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:26,150
right?

738
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,160
Is

739
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:31,180
it, it, it gives them a competitive advantage in the industry

740
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,469
because nobody can match them in

741
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:37,119
-- this regard.
-- If they want to maintain their leadership,

742
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,500
they have to.

743
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,709
-- Right.
-- Yes,

744
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,260
I, I think we'll end it there.

745
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, totally.

746
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:46,010
I like it. All right. So thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
