Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,460
and my partner in thinking about long term things. Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:16,569
I do think about long term things more often than I probably should.

3
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,510
I'll admit I have a, I,

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,250
I won't say it's impressive but I have a disaster recovery plan for

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,649
when I am the disaster and everyone else has to recover from it.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,379
It was funny because I got ac pu upgrade.

7
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:31,860
Uh, and I had the store do it because last time I did ac pu upgrade, I dropped it

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,299
and bent the pins and that was a $200 lesson learned.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,159
Oh, you didn't,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,709
-- you didn't bend the pins back and use it.
-- The pins on a modern CPU are pretty tiny

11
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:43,955
and these were pretty mashed over.

12
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,115
So, you did? Good, huh?

13
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:49,944
I, I, well, and I dropped it at like a 45 degree angle. So it just anyway, the point is

14
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:52,584
so I paid the store and of course the store is like, you know,

15
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:55,294
you only need your bit locker key. Do you have that? I'm like, yeah, of course, I do.

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,235
I have it like, printed in this and they're like, oh, ok.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,770
And it's funny because I had to sign this really,

18
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:02,169
like multiple initial thing disclaimer for like,

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,409
they're not going to back up my data.

20
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:06,209
I'm like, damn. Right. You're not backing up my data. That's my data. I'm keeping it.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,370
It's encrypted. I don't want you touching it.

22
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,019
But it's funny because I had to sign all and they're like, is this,

23
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,089
I'm like a back blaze and like, oh, ok.

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,349
-- You know, I mean,
-- but how do they know you're not just some new,

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,180
who has no idea what's going on?

26
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,250
-- Because I
-- initialed the form that says if they screw. Well, the thing is,

27
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:24,053
it's, it's to protect them. Right.

28
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,612
If they mess up my computer while they're working on it,

29
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:29,972
I initialed a thing saying, like, I don't have backups and that's, or they,

30
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,572
I didn't pay them to back it up before they worked on it.

31
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,102
-- Really? Right.
-- Oh, I see. That's what they were trying to do.

32
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:38,483
They were trying to scare you into buying a backup service from them, weren't they?

33
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:40,123
Well, maybe, I

34
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:41,333
don't know, don't care.

35
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:45,413
I just would have brought it in without a hard drive and then, like, here you go.

36
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:46,432
And I mentioned that to them.

37
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:48,475
I'm like, actually I would have removed the, the M two drive,

38
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:50,536
but then I'd have to remove the video card which, like,

39
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:54,375
there's so many screws to take out. That's true. Some of those do that.

40
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:55,536
Yeah, because my, my

41
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:59,216
PC has two video cards. So one video card

42
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,456
-- covers up the M two slot,
-- right?

43
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:04,776
-- Because you claim you're doing a, I
-- work, I am. It, it's quite funny.

44
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:07,136
-- I
-- suspect you're mining Cryptocurrency

45
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:10,235
-- like a net negative loss
-- monkey NFTS Kurt.

46
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:11,636
I think those are illegal now.

47
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:12,686
But

48
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:14,776
I think they're illegal. They're just stupid.

49
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:16,440
Yeah. So,

50
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,750
yeah, it's, uh,

51
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:18,419
it's,

52
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,520
it's nice though because I have 16 cores now and

53
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,600
this machine should last me probably two more years.

54
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,470
So you can play Minecraft like a

55
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,039
boss.

56
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:25,800
Yeah.

57
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:26,570
Well, see,

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,889
the thing is all the Ryzen 5000 CP US are

59
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,440
on sale everywhere because it's the end of the era.

60
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:35,179
So, either I buy it now on sale or I pay antique prices next year.

61
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:37,776
What comes next, Ryzen 7000 AM five?

62
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:41,416
Oh, ok. Right. And they're, they're great. They're affordable. They're solid.

63
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:43,335
-- But they don't run in this AM four board.
-- Oh,

64
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:43,886
-- I
-- see.

65
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:47,365
I couldn't tell you what my board has on my desktop.

66
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,785
I would assume it's, if it's less than a year old or if it's more than a year old,

67
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,865
it's probably AM four.

68
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:52,455
It's

69
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,136
about a year old.

70
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:55,246
-- I don't
-- m five

71
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:55,376
then.

72
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:59,151
Probably not because I'm a cheap skate. So I doubt I would buy the expensive stuff.

73
00:02:59,292 --> 00:02:59,302
Oh,

74
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:00,992
it's not that much more expensive.

75
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,332
It would have been there, you know. Anyways.

76
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,552
But, yeah, thinking long term.

77
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:09,751
So wordpress released a thing where they're basically going to, for $38,000.

78
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:14,501
I know, like, run your website for 100 years all in DNS, running the website,

79
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,031
everything.

80
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,160
Well, well, well, it's not 100% clear on the DNS side because, ok,

81
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,380
so somebody pointed out wordpress does own dot blog the TLD,

82
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,259
which makes sense. For example, like wordpress can't.

83
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,080
-- Well, for example, we have that GSD dot id, which is over $2000 a year,
-- right?

84
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:34,830
I'm sure you have to use a TLD they approve of because I mean,

85
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,710
it says on their website it's a century long domain registration.

86
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,759
A domain is blah, blah, blah, planned

87
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,880
you an opportunity to secure your domain for a full century.

88
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:47,050
Yeah, I assume it's like thought blog because they control the pricing on that,

89
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:47,250
right?

90
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,179
-- Of course,
-- because.com could

91
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,880
one day be 1000 bucks a month

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,419
or a year, whatever.

93
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,179
Sure. Whatever. I'm just gonna start this out by saying

94
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:57,779
there is no way

95
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,539
-- wordpress is going to be around in 100 years. All right,
-- see. And

96
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,899
ok, let me interrupt you for a second. What's older Canada or the New York Times?

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,960
-- I have
-- no idea. The New York Times is about 16 years older than Canada as a country.

98
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,979
Look 1851.

99
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,550
I'm pretty sure the New York Times in 1851

100
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:18,220
didn't anticipate being around in 100 and 50 years.

101
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,500
I bet they did. I bet they did

102
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,739
there are industries that I would be comfortable

103
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,570
saying will exist for 100 years now,

104
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,859
in a, in 100 years from now, will the New York Times exist?

105
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,980
And I would say no, because I think

106
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,820
the world of print media has changed drastically in 100 years. Will Ford exist.

107
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,730
-- Maybe, I don't know, it's hard to say
-- Ford's a financing company now. So, yes,

108
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,290
they're a financial firm with that happens to make cars too

109
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,130
unless people stop buying cars.

110
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,000
-- Yeah,
-- but they'll go into some other debt financing.

111
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:48,890
Maybe it's possible.

112
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:49,970
But anyway, anyway, OK.

113
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:50,359
G

114
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:50,880
capital. And

115
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,149
here is what I love.

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,700
Here's the thing I thought when I saw this and I'll just start there. Right.

117
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,410
Ignoring the fact that I just said wordpress won't be around in 100 years,

118
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,730
which I still suspect is true.

119
00:04:58,989 --> 00:04:59,399
But

120
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:02,404
when I saw this, it reminded me of,

121
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,285
remember when we were young and there

122
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:07,125
was the obsession with cryogenically freezing yourself.

123
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,244
-- Yep.
-- Still a thing.

124
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:11,364
-- It is still a
-- thing. I was actually watching a documentary on

125
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:14,154
and it's actually cheap now. It's like 200 grand. I mean,

126
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:15,204
sure

127
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:15,654
out

128
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:18,644
of your head. I think it's more if you want your whole body, just your head.

129
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,709
I don't know.

130
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:23,059
-- But the point is, well, think
-- about it, like a head is a lot smaller than the body.

131
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,880
-- Like,
-- well, but

132
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:24,950
here's the thing,

133
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:25,890
like how many,

134
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:30,440
there are an enormous number of those cryogenic freezing companies that went

135
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,980
out of business and no one knows what happened to the people.

136
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:37,679
-- They had frozen.
-- Technically, they're not people because they're dead.

137
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:38,480
I don't know.

138
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:39,654
You get the idea.

139
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,785
And I think

140
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:44,005
it is easy to say we're going to be around for a

141
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:47,635
bazillion years because every company thinks that it wants to be obviously.

142
00:05:48,204 --> 00:05:50,005
And I think as humans, it's easy to be like, oh,

143
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,825
I'll pay this company and they'll thaw my frozen corpse out in,

144
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:57,015
in 500 years and cure whatever horrible disease killed me or whatever.

145
00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:58,195
And

146
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,959
-- not very many of those are working out.
-- Right.

147
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,890
Well, it's interesting to me is in Canada,

148
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,859
we actually have some laws around lifetime membership stuff

149
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,600
and I know there's like a specific exemption for cemeteries

150
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:14,200
where they can essentially sell a thing. And

151
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,760
with the promise of this long term,

152
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:20,320
I don't want to say lifetime membership. But,

153
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,140
well, you know what I mean? Right.

154
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,399
Like this long term,

155
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,869
like you buy this plot and we'll own this land and maintain it and whatever.

156
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:28,619
Because if you look at K law,

157
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,059
my understanding is that the vast majority of leases

158
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,690
and contractual agreements are limited to 99 years.

159
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,660
-- I mean,
-- so

160
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,989
that's another good example of

161
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:40,570
things like cemeteries are valid until they're not.

162
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:42,250
So one of my favorite things I learned,

163
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,739
if you go to the east coast of the United States,

164
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,220
like Boston is an example, there's like cemeteries you can go tour, right,

165
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:52,059
and you walk around and they've got all the headstones and

166
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,100
you can see like famous people and all that stuff.

167
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,489
And at one point I made a comment about how

168
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,390
it was remarkable how the headstones were lined up. Very nice.

169
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:04,329
Even though there was a tree that probably wasn't there.

170
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:05,839
And the guy was like, oh, no, no,

171
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,399
these were like a, a shambled mess, like 50 years ago. We everyone like

172
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,119
tied up.

173
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,339
Yeah, they just basically stuck them in a nice straight row and we're like, there,

174
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,500
the headstones are in a row now.

175
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,579
Like no one knows where anyone has actually been

176
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:18,734
in that cemetery.

177
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:21,545
And I feel like a lot of this 100

178
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:22,475
year plan,

179
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:26,285
like this long term stuff is basically that like wordpress

180
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,415
says they're going to run your site for 100 years.

181
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:29,364
But it's gonna be like, oh,

182
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,804
we have to go pull all these headstones out of this pile in

183
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:34,154
the corner and we'll just line them up and make them look pretty.

184
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,494
Ok. Everybody, it's fine.

185
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:38,165
Well, you know, just take a static, it's like sea.org,

186
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,614
it's just a static blob in an S3 bucket

187
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,369
that I haven't updated in 15 or 20 years.

188
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,209
The DNS record and the MX record are the only two that matter, right?

189
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,880
Like, keep that DNS paid for and keep the MX record alive

190
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,609
and see this is the thing, people, I actually have a friend

191
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:59,470
who basically through no fault of her own forgot like she didn't renew her DNS.

192
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:00,480
Yeah, people do that all the time.

193
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:05,089
And so it has been an utter nightmare because for example,

194
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,059
if you want to change your name with the website, sure, no problem.

195
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,989
You want to change your birthday

196
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,445
probably. Ok. But you want to change your email address.

197
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:12,434
Well, you can't because that's key to your account

198
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:13,244
and,

199
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:16,654
and especially if you don't have control of that email address anymore.

200
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:20,684
Even if it's completely bouncing. Like this, it a spammer grabbed the domain.

201
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:22,075
I tried to buy it back. Didn't work,

202
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:26,415
you know. And so it's just gone. It's like seafood.com, I did not register it.

203
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,875
And then like a month after I registered seafood do work, somebody grabs sea.com

204
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:31,325
and now so for going on

205
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:34,664
20 fiveish whatever years,

206
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:35,484
like

207
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,849
it's just, it's this like weird dead

208
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,250
thing on the internet.

209
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,210
-- Like it just doesn't work. Yeah,
-- I know.

210
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,539
And so the same thing happened with, with me because I own breast.net and I,

211
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:50,859
I did it by breast.com and in fact, now it's for sale and it was for sale a long time ago.

212
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,130
I wonder how much they want for it.

213
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,809
Not that I'd pay for it. But

214
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,559
-- anyway, but like,
-- yeah, it drives me nuts because like the,

215
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,320
the domain name is like that is my number 10 my God.

216
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,440
I will get yelled at so much at work if I let Claude

217
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,059
career lines.org ever lapse

218
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:09,349
-- right. There will be so much yelling.
-- That would be a bad thing.

219
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,809
Didn't, then did that happen to like Hotmail or something?

220
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,400
And someone, like, bought it just to

221
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,760
fix their email and gave it to Microsoft?

222
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:20,479
So, I mean, and that's the thing you can, you can, you can

223
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,640
register your domain name up to 10 years out in the future.

224
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,270
-- And that's the rule I can't, doesn't let you do that.
-- I don't do more than 10

225
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,400
-- because I do it every year.
-- Well, you can't do more than 10.

226
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:34,119
-- Well,
-- but, but the point is I, I actually, I do it on purpose.

227
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,000
I only, I do one year at a time domain registration.

228
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:39,760
That way, I won't forget

229
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:40,750
because

230
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:42,830
I have 10 years to forget

231
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,330
that

232
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,099
every

233
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,049
year and that's fine.

234
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:48,979
Except I get a nag mail from my registrar.

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,849
Hey, you better do this, like you better do this right now.

236
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,130
And so I feel like it gives me that,

237
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,150
that sense of urgency.

238
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,630
-- I need to not forget and
-- seems like there's a lot of business stuff where, you know,

239
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,109
things need to be done once a year.

240
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,710
And I mean, this goes back to a lot of our discussions about security and how,

241
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,989
if you don't do something on the regular, you forget how,

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,630
like if you don't do something at least once a week,

243
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,119
you're gonna forget how to do it every year when I mow the lawn.

244
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,900
I'm like, uh, how does this work again?

245
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:15,789
You know, and I'm like, bashing my mower up against stuff and, you know,

246
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,179
by midsummer I've kind of remembered my mowing pattern.

247
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,469
I think the thing is

248
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,309
what I don't quite understand is what business or, or,

249
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,010
or organization or individual has $38,000 kind

250
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,969
of lying around to avoid this problem.

251
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:33,039
That is,

252
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,859
you know what I mean?

253
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:38,109
Like, like if I could buy a life, like if I could buy a 99 or 100 year,

254
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,729
uh safe deposit box at the bank, I

255
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:43,450
-- would consider that
-- some banks

256
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,450
will probably be around

257
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,989
-- well
-- and more to the point they're regulated.

258
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,739
So even if they're not around their next,

259
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,890
next next incarnation will still be around,

260
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:55,419
-- you know.
-- So. Ok. Ok, we, we uh this one is gonna be so hard to stay on track.

261
00:10:55,429 --> 00:11:00,849
What I'm trying to figure out is what is the market here who has $38,000

262
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:04,419
and kind of wants to set it and forget it and not have to worry about it.

263
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:04,989
Ok.

264
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,599
-- I think there's a market for this because I think,
-- well,

265
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:10,059
obviously they're doing it well, at least one person will buy it.

266
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,659
-- There's a rocket for pet rocks though.
-- I think a lot of people will, I mean,

267
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,400
look,

268
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:18,650
look at all of the foundations and charitable trust and all that stuff that exists,

269
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:19,150
right?

270
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,020
But you need,

271
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,309
like you need a scary amount of money to set up like

272
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,640
a proper charitable trust and foundation that survives for hundreds of years.

273
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,080
And those exist. Like, there's, there's what the Carnegie Foundation

274
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:29,950
and things like that. Those are really old now.

275
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,109
Just go watch public TV for a while and you'll get a list of them.

276
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,780
I watch a lot of public television,

277
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,450
Arthur Foundation. I'm like, what,

278
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:37,690
now?

279
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:42,469
My favorite is when the Coke Foundation donates to Science Channel

280
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,049
science shows. And I'm like,

281
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,950
that one's weird

282
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,469
but

283
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,369
good for you.

284
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,309
Good.

285
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:50,700
Yes,

286
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:54,219
it's fine oil. The planet loves oil. Everybody keep burning it.

287
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,070
So anyway,

288
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:56,309
there's,

289
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,919
there's a lot in between.

290
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,359
Right.

291
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:02,280
When you go from having like gazillions of dollars to set

292
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:06,890
up your crazy trust fund to people who basically die with nothing

293
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,690
-- or less than nothing. Well,
-- that's true.

294
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,880
But there's that, that slice in the middle

295
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,034
and I think

296
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:18,934
it is human nature to want to believe we will be remembered in perpetuity.

297
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:22,815
And there is almost certainly a group of people that will believe that

298
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:27,434
if I pay Wordpress $38,000 now that no one will forget who I am

299
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:31,890
and my offspring in 100 years will pay more.

300
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,090
I, I don't know, I don't know what the end game of that is like,

301
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,820
what happens after the 100 years does like?

302
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,549
And then they just delete your website,

303
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,429
-- but
-- you re up it like whatever inflationary triggered rate

304
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,130
you're going to be logged dead in 100 years.

305
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,340
Yeah.

306
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:45,929
Well, and that's why I love it.

307
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,530
It's, it says, like, literally, it says crafting legacies one century at a time.

308
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,450
Right.

309
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,869
So, I think you're right, they're going for that sort of

310
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,289
-- artisanal. Like,
-- I think it is like, right, nobody

311
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:58,289
will look at your website.

312
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:02,190
I can't afford a foundation but I can pay for this website. So

313
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,530
-- that's my suspicion.
-- You know what? Actually, now that you mention it.

314
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:10,530
Yeah, it, for some people, $38,000 for a conversation starter worth it. No, really.

315
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,229
-- But
-- you know what? You know what I love?

316
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:16,270
Here's a better question. Will the internet archive exist in 100 years?

317
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,780
I hope so.

318
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,020
I could see them getting sued out of existence by some media company.

319
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,090
That's what scares me right now.

320
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:27,539
And, well, they're, they're being sued by everybody right now.

321
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:29,900
They have an adversary that would love to see them die

322
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,059
just like kind of like those people that were like,

323
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:32,960
well,

324
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:36,450
maybe Elon Musk bought Twitter so that essentially a bunch of business

325
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,849
interests could kill off Twitter because they don't like it because it's

326
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,799
like, no Twitter historically

327
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,450
that

328
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,080
was used to pants and to like, really embarrass a lot of

329
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,650
that is significant

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,080
interest. I

331
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:51,669
ascribe almost always to the Hanlon's theory of stupidity over anything else that

332
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:52,450
I would

333
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,059
like

334
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:55,650
the guy.

335
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,940
I mean, the whole horse air

336
00:13:59,169 --> 00:13:59,909
travel.

337
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,059
Just, yeah, just Google Elon Musk. Horse, air travel.

338
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,530
-- I, I'm not even gonna say
-- the rest of the,

339
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,229
don't know what this means.

340
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:07,020
We're gonna look

341
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:07,200
it

342
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:07,619
up.

343
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,440
It's gonna

344
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,400
air travel.

345
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,190
Yeah.

346
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:17,969
-- Or horse bribe. Maybe horse bribe is better.
-- Uh. Oh, interesting. Ok. Whatever.

347
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,570
-- Yeah, exactly. Right. Like the man is clearly not, that, that's
-- fair.

348
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,599
That's fair.

349
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,750
-- That's
-- not impressive.

350
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,469
Anyway,

351
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:28,450
also, horses are expensive, like, they're literally a free horse is not a gift

352
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:29,080
like a

353
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,479
puppy.

354
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:29,690
But

355
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:29,919
anyway,

356
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,710
anyway,

357
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:32,609
-- I
-- feel

358
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:37,159
and maybe that's, I just again, I guess some rich person who, you know,

359
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,909
also would spend a quarter million dollars on

360
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,744
car again to have a conversation piece.

361
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,065
Right? So people have a lot of money and like you and I

362
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:48,395
-- spend how much on a cup of coffee?
-- That's very little because I'm a huge cheap skate.

363
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:51,734
-- So I purposely buy coffee in bulk and make it at home.
-- Ok.

364
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:53,744
Again, how much is that microphone you're speaking into?

365
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,684
The microphone is a different story.

366
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,000
It's totally justifiable.

367
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:01,840
-- It's just like this car.
-- It's not, it's not the, it's not the one I want.

368
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,299
We'll say that there's no good Lord someday.

369
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,580
But anyway, anyway,

370
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,969
so, I mean, it's, I,

371
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,919
but it kind of brings up this,

372
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:13,340
like if I could register a domain name like s.org or the Clouds

373
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,440
lines.org 100 years out, I totally would just to not have to worry about

374
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,270
missing that bill and like, oops,

375
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,549
but it is offset by like you were saying earlier about the whole,

376
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,349
having that sort of operational cadence of like, ok,

377
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,280
every year we do my birthday and DNS registration.

378
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,580
You know, like every year we have uh when is National Smoke Alarm Day?

379
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,210
-- That's in like spring, I wanna say, right. I,
-- the, the clock setting is what I use.

380
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:38,609
When you change your clocks, you change your batteries.

381
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,190
Uh oh, it's in October.

382
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,950
It's, and there's a test your smoke alarm day, which is probably not the worst idea.

383
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:48,000
I do like the modern smoke alarms. I have like a built in battery.

384
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,299
They last for 10 years and then they just chirp and beep until you get fed up and, like,

385
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,070
throw them away and buy new ones

386
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,359
because, like, 10 years is long enough that, like, I'm not, I don't remember, like,

387
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,750
I actually have taken to writing on the bottom now when I

388
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:00,669
put it in,

389
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,780
oh, mine come with, uh, the ones I have have a date, like,

390
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:06,309
stamped on the bottom of it when it was manufactured.

391
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,109
-- But
-- then it sat in a

392
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,979
store for six months or a year or two years.

393
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:12,530
Mine was installed very quickly after it was manufactured.

394
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,609
So

395
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:13,739
I

396
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:13,900
just,

397
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:14,869
it on mine.

398
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,679
Same with my fur,

399
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,030
my furnace filters. Actually, I've noticed now have a spot to write on them

400
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:20,109
for the date.

401
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,450
They've always had that curt,

402
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:22,309
have they?

403
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,510
Oh, I never noticed on the one inch ones

404
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,489
-- anyway.
-- Anyway.

405
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,849
Well, now that I'm buying those big five inch ones that are like,

406
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,840
-- cheap,
-- every furnace filter is made of cardboard.

407
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:33,830
-- You can write anywhere on it you like?
-- Well,

408
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,340
yeah.

409
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:35,330
No, I know

410
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,630
in principle, like, with a

411
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:40,250
given that I own sharpies, I can pretty much everything I can write on

412
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,450
-- of like, water.
-- I have so many sharp

413
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:45,215
because my kids keep taking them and I just keep buying more and

414
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:48,924
then every now and then they like appear and like there's 30 sharpies.

415
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:51,465
I was actually thinking about this the other day,

416
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:55,265
I had to buy more USB C cables because like I've run out

417
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,005
and I'm like,

418
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:58,085
-- thank you, thank you for reminding
-- me. No,

419
00:16:58,205 --> 00:16:59,625
you can do this when we're done.

420
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,510
But

421
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:03,929
like these USB C cables someday I'm gonna like clean

422
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,108
my house and find 700 USB C cables because they probably

423
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,709
under the couch or something. Ok. Anyway, 100 year

424
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,348
we, we are so off topic on this but I think it's a weird topic.

425
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,550
-- It's hard to talk
-- about it. I suspect

426
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,199
the number of organizations and people that will

427
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,569
buy this 100 year thing on wordpress.com.

428
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,760
Like I would guess low single digits percentage of them will still

429
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,858
be around in 100 years in some way shape or form.

430
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:30,420
-- I mean,
-- none of us will. That's the intent, right? Is that the people who buy

431
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,599
-- organizations
-- or families

432
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,569
or there's

433
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:33,890
no,

434
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,930
I mean, look,

435
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,380
this is, I think

436
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:37,560
a good

437
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:41,939
thing to think about in the context of disaster recovery. Right.

438
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:46,599
-- When we talk
-- about reg just regular operational, like paying your water bill,

439
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,400
like I just got my phone bill and it's double

440
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,010
because apparently I forgot to pay my phone bill last month.

441
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:54,209
That happens. Sometimes I could swear I paid it online.

442
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:55,609
I got to double check my bill payment.

443
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:59,680
-- I guess
-- you got to do that too sometimes because I, I know I've had instances where

444
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:02,939
the bank sends a check to the company because they didn't sign

445
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,319
up with like the magic bill pay thing and they lost my,

446
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,599
the check disappeared one time. I'm like, what happens if it appears

447
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,420
they were like, well, we're going to cash it. I'm like, then what,

448
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,229
like

449
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:13,579
on your

450
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,359
account, I ended up, I got the check canceled it, cost me some money.

451
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:19,000
But I'm like, I'd rather just cancel it and not worry about it anyway. Ok.

452
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:19,569
So

453
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,400
this is the perfect example of stuff falls between

454
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,449
the cracks and then your phone gets turned off.

455
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:27,410
But, but in this case, you just pay $38,000.

456
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,780
-- Nothing can fall through the cracks assuming Wordpress
-- exists.

457
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:35,160
I mean, look, let's pretend Wordpress exists in 100 years. Right?

458
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,250
And this is where I think

459
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,390
we can put on.

460
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,150
I mean, is IB ma 100 years old? I bet they're close

461
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,479
and look, it, maybe they'll exist.

462
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,329
Maybe they won't, I don't think they will but that's another story. 1911.

463
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,829
Like I have a suspicion,

464
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,130
the web as we know it will cease to exist at some point in the future.

465
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,650
But that's a different story.

466
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:54,715
I want to talk about this in the context of

467
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:59,426
disaster recovery because I think security people like disaster recovery,

468
00:18:59,436 --> 00:18:59,615
right.

469
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,836
Disaster recovery is, is a risk management tool.

470
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:03,426
Well,

471
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:04,906
it's one of the few boogeymen we have

472
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,456
because it does happen often enough and often makes

473
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:09,355
the news because quite a few of these companies

474
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,916
-- experience a disaster and then don't recover
-- who,

475
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,526
who has ever gone out of business because they didn't,

476
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:16,276
well, they weren't able to restore their data.

477
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:18,881
Like there's a company that hosting provider in Denmark

478
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,182
that just told all their customers,

479
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,501
like you better go to internet archive to get your websites

480
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:25,121
back because remember they got ransom word and it's all gone.

481
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:26,462
I don't remember that,

482
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:29,291
but that's probably a good example of

483
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,261
there are varying levels of disaster recovery,

484
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:32,771
right?

485
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:35,521
Someone like wordpress is going to have a vastly

486
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:38,271
superior disaster recovery program as opposed to you.

487
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:38,732
And I,

488
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,680
right,

489
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,219
you would hope so. I'm certain they do.

490
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:44,160
I'm certain they do from everything I've read

491
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,400
about wordpress and everything I know about wordpress.

492
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:48,000
They do a lot. Right.

493
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:51,880
They do a lot. Right. They're good. They're good and smart people.

494
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,489
Are you looking for the hosting provider that fails?

495
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,920
I'm looking for a list of, because I've seen a list of companies that, like,

496
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,770
had a disaster and then went out of business 6 to 18 months later.

497
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,060
In a lot of cases, the reason they go to business

498
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,449
is because they can no longer manage their cash flow.

499
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,969
They don't know who owes the money and they can't enforce it.

500
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,329
And of course, a lot of your customers, depending on what you do for a living,

501
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:13,760
probably aren't going to step up and be like, hey, we owe you money here.

502
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,689
It is for sure. No one does that right. They're going to keep a low profile and like,

503
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,750
you know, be like, I guess we got to find a new supplier for widgets

504
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,560
and look. Ok. So, so that's kind of the,

505
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,170
that's where I was going to go with all this I was hoping to get to is

506
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:30,439
if you look at wordpress 38 grand, right?

507
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,599
That's a lot of money today. 38 grand in 100 years.

508
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,920
Assuming we keep up with inflation the way we are, it will be a cup of coffee.

509
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,290
38 grand isn't going to be a lot of money. Probably the price of of what a

510
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:44,520
computer, maybe not even. I mean, it's hard to say, right?

511
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:53,012
You figure I look 100 years ago, a car costs like $500 and now a car costs $50,000.

512
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:53,723
That's

513
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:56,402
an interesting tact to take because for example,

514
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:59,873
also uh a house servant cost like X dollars,

515
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,083
but clothing was expensive and now clothing

516
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,552
is cheap and house servants are expensive.

517
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:03,892
Right. So

518
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:05,302
hard to.

519
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:08,633
So, uh here we go. The average rate of inflation over the last 100 years

520
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,875
in the US is 2.93%. So

521
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:11,845
3%

522
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:12,875
102.

523
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:13,745
What is that?

524
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:15,586
So, whatever that is in like

525
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:24,036
1.0293 to the power of 100 is about 18. so 38,000 divided by 18, about two grand in

526
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:25,115
100 years,

527
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:28,875
-- assuming the current rate of inflation and all that.
-- Right. Right. Right.

528
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:30,556
And, and that Wordpress is still there.

529
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:31,500
And

530
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,500
so from,

531
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,020
from a disaster recovery perspective of someone alive today

532
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:38,660
wanting to keep something alive for 100 years,

533
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:42,869
-- it's a pretty good investment in that regard. Right.
-- Well, it also

534
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,530
potentially, you know, I suspect the problem is more the organizational, you know,

535
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,239
institutional knowledge and stuff and,

536
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,319
and handing that off to Wordpress and just having them deal with all that stuff.

537
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:56,699
-- And
-- so that's where it starts getting more bizarre, I think is so, in 100 years,

538
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,949
what happens if you have some sort of next of kin?

539
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,430
Well, that's just it. Right. Right. Right. What happens then

540
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,839
I assume before then they start

541
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,709
making you to re up but you're dead.

542
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,030
Well, but somebody's gonna have, like, there's gonna be some

543
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,170
email address on that website or something or some log in to update it.

544
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,569
Or, you know,

545
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,229
-- like there'll be some ongoing contractual
-- gmail is deleting

546
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:20,209
Gmail accounts that are two years inactive now.

547
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:20,869
So the email will

548
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:21,069
just,

549
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,489
and it's fine.

550
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:24,170
-- But
-- I mean,

551
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:25,599
even myself,

552
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,189
I have a company I'm incorporated and I

553
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:30,239
have a 25 year relationship with my accountant.

554
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,089
Right. Like these, this 2550 year relationship

555
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,859
between businesses and individuals is not abnormal. It's pretty normal, actually

556
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:37,680
practical.

557
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:38,989
It is practical.

558
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,489
-- And
-- I mean, in theory, you know,

559
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,930
my son Felix will take over the mantle of doing it stuff and

560
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:47,609
you know, so like siefried and sons, I don't know,

561
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:51,770
-- I
-- have instructions for my family for my demise to take care of the,

562
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,689
the my domain because there are emails there too.

563
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:57,459
My accountant is his last name and associates and it

564
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,760
-- was his dad and now I'm with his son.
-- Sure.

565
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,359
Sure. Like, I mean, that's fair.

566
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:02,270
It's plausible.

567
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,250
Look, there's one other important piece to this,

568
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,699
I think where we're gonna run ourselves out of time before we get to it.

569
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:11,449
Unless I, I'm just gonna make us talk about it. We are standing on the precipice

570
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:15,329
of massive disruptive change coming to the planet.

571
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:16,489
And I don't mean

572
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:19,469
just like the internet being created disruptive change.

573
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:22,770
I mean, the fact you look at like we have climate change,

574
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:24,869
we have economic issues.

575
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,530
We have a generation of people that have been repressed

576
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,810
economically compared to their parents and grandparents.

577
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,290
-- They're not going to be able to afford
-- a house.

578
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,849
-- They, they can't afford cars right now. Like, it's true.
-- Oh, my God.

579
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:39,599
I actually, sorry, I got to interrupt,

580
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,930
over this weekend I was looking at cars online, used cars specifically.

581
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:47,670
My car is worth about 50% more than what I paid for it.

582
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:49,010
I

583
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,319
believe that

584
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:50,790
it's a,

585
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,599
and

586
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:54,890
here's what really got me in Canada, there's a thing called Go

587
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,760
Auto. They're terrible. They're terrible, terrible, terrible.

588
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,599
But they're like, nationwide and massive.

589
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,040
And for example,

590
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,589
they only have something like on the order of

591
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:05,880
just over 10,000 cars in their inventory right now.

592
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:10,900
-- Is that not a lot? I don't know,
-- 10,000 cars for a country of 40 million people.

593
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,319
-- Well, I assume you have other car dealerships, right?
-- But I mean,

594
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,270
go drive by them. The lots are not full of cars. Like they used to be like, there's

595
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,209
like straight up, you drive by, like, I live near dealership Row and like,

596
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:25,709
you drive down dealership Row, there's new cars

597
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,709
and, oh, that's the other thing that blew my mind.

598
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:33,060
Like, I drive a Kia optima like just a four door car with not enough cup holders,

599
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,270
but like a Kia Sport

600
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:37,489
ta for example, like, which is a totally bog standard SUV,

601
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,400
they're like 40 to $50,000 Canadian New now. And I'm like,

602
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,439
like in my brain,

603
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:48,170
a car that costs $50,000 has like a BMW or a Mercedes badge on the front of it.

604
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,640
Not

605
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,160
-- a random South Korean carmaker.
-- They used to.

606
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:55,219
-- Not anymore.
-- Right. And I,

607
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,619
like, I'll be blunt, I can't afford to buy a new car.

608
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:00,449
Like I literally,

609
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,199
I'm

610
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,280
not spending 50 grand on a new car. Are you insane?

611
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,819
And like a used car comparable to what I have would be 15 to $20,000 like

612
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:08,979
bonkers.

613
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,650
No, I know. I hear you, man.

614
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,869
I'm in the same boat. I don't like cars so I don't buy nice cars.

615
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,520
But yeah, it's, it's completely out of control for sure.

616
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,530
-- Yep. Yep.
-- Like there is because,

617
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,400
ok, look,

618
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,810
here's, here's the point, right? I'm getting us back on track.

619
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:25,530
This precipice of disruptive change is not going to end

620
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:30,010
in a way that is conducive to many of the existing

621
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,410
players in

622
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,089
the capitalist market,

623
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:33,650
right?

624
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:37,810
So like Wordpress has had massive success up to this point.

625
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:39,369
But I think

626
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,209
will they in 100 years? We don't know.

627
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:46,420
And I think this is really the question I think about is less so about like,

628
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,910
will wordpress exist in 100 years?

629
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,839
Will any internet companies exist in 100 years?

630
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:55,979
-- Will the internet exist in 100 years?
-- So, TCP/IP and htps will be around us like

631
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:59,255
10 digit phone numbers. Like that'll just still be a thing in 100 years.

632
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:01,194
Maybe we don't know that. I

633
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:05,204
-- mean,
-- I PV six will definitely still be kicking around.

634
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:05,425
We

635
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:05,625
don't

636
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:05,785
know

637
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:06,224
that I

638
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:07,265
can get off I PV

639
00:26:07,385 --> 00:26:08,694
-- four, I mean,
-- probably,

640
00:26:08,704 --> 00:26:12,775
but I PV four will probably still exist in 100 years at the rate we're going.

641
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:14,094
But you know what I mean?

642
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:16,555
Like this is, this is the things I keep thinking of is,

643
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:19,314
is thinking in terms of 100 years right now,

644
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,250
I feel like is a very

645
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:25,260
risky and unknown thing to do.

646
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,859
It's kind of like, again,

647
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:29,099
my disaster recovery example that we never actually

648
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,160
got into because we keep derailing ourselves.

649
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:31,670
But like

650
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,869
when I have a disaster recovery plan,

651
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,229
my disaster recovery plan is generally for one,

652
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,739
maybe two years of disaster recovery, right?

653
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:40,760
Because I know going past that

654
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:44,410
is a waste of my time and it really isn't going to matter

655
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:46,329
because in two years,

656
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,569
my company might be twice the size it is now, it might be bankrupt.

657
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:51,449
You know what I mean?

658
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,530
Well, and part of it a great example uh I love is a, I like all the things we wanted.

659
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,609
A I and thought a I would be good at like driving cars.

660
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:03,400
-- I know I'm so angry about that
-- turns out they're terrible.

661
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:04,239
But a

662
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:08,189
lot of things a I that nobody would have ever guessed like here I,

663
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:10,310
I keep abreast of all these new a

664
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,329
illm companies because there's some really cool stuff.

665
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,949
So for example, there's a new one out

666
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,739
and what they do is you take a picture of your plate.

667
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,770
And it does a calorie count.

668
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:24,569
So it does visual recognition of your food and roughly how much food is there

669
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:27,449
and what it is and gives you a rough calorie count of your plate,

670
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:30,199
which for a lot of people who are sort of trying to diet.

671
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:32,199
Well, when I go to a restaurant or something,

672
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:36,050
they don't all include their calorie counts or if I make it at home or whatever.

673
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,689
And so this is to me a, such a wonderful example of something that is so

674
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,079
unexpected and like, oh, wow, I never thought of that, but a 12th pitch of it is like,

675
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:47,550
oh, yeah, that's kind of a cool idea.

676
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,500
I would pay like a dollar a month for that,

677
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,119
which is easy, you know,

678
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,489
like there's all these A I things where it's actually really good

679
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,410
at these stupid little problems that actually solve real problems for people but

680
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:00,839
nobody ever anticipated.

681
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,030
Well, and that the technology goes like this. Like, it's

682
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,589
all this stuff that the web we thought it was going to do turns out no,

683
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,670
like people actually do just want to buy stuff online and like

684
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the whole,

685
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,589
the internet will help educate people because blah,

686
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,430
blah information will be freeing people.

687
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:16,680
Like,

688
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,569
like nos,

689
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,079
-- like the truth is paywall, then the lies are free.
-- Kurt. Exactly.

690
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,020
Well, the propaganda is free or worse.

691
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,739
They're fucking being pushed because right, they,

692
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,609
they're willing to pay to make people read it,

693
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,339
um, like that whole fif when I found out about that 15 minute city thing.

694
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm like, what now like,

695
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:38,339
and then the best part is they had a protest about the 15 minute cities locally

696
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:43,180
on the one street, White Avenue area. That is an actual walkable part of the city. I,

697
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,469
I love the idea. Like, I, I purposely built my life around the idea of a 15 minute city.

698
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,109
Did we talk about that? I don't remember if it was a podcast might have been

699
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,109
for anyone who doesn't know what we're talking about.

700
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,859
There's this concept,

701
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:59,310
some researchers created known as a 15 minute city being like,

702
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,949
yeah. Right. Like most, most cities will call it

703
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:04,000
where the idea is.

704
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,300
You should have like a doctor in a grocery store

705
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,910
and the things you need to live and survive a

706
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,310
15 minute walk from your house. Right.

707
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,780
Imagine, draw a circle around your, where you live 15 minute walk and you want like

708
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,640
the ability to survive within that circle.

709
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,369
But then

710
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:24,199
some insane right wing propaganda group said that the government's going to

711
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:27,349
make you stay within a 15 minute radius of your house.

712
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,130
And if you leave, they're gonna shoot you or something.

713
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,050
And it's like, oh my goodness, you people are like, you're so dumb,

714
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,760
it just hurts Steve

715
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,699
you about it. But anyway,

716
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:39,339
it, I, I love the idea. Like I want to live a 15 minute walk from everything.

717
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:43,339
Like I purposely, it's comical because my eye doctor and my,

718
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,339
the Pete Park lady who cuts my hair

719
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,099
and

720
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,739
there's my dentist and like an enormous number of things. I do.

721
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,729
I, I pick them because they're close to my house.

722
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:53,839
And then it's funny. It's like, oh, did you walk here?

723
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:57,859
I'm like, yes, because I can see my house from here. Like, that's why I had come here.

724
00:29:58,069 --> 00:29:58,500
Yeah.

725
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,540
And it's great.

726
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,290
But, so I think part of it is the, the, and maybe, and this is part of hedging,

727
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,979
your bet is

728
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:07,369
we as a person or an organization,

729
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,579
maybe can't handle 100 years worth of change very gracefully.

730
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,699
But in theory, a company, like wordpress,

731
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,890
a tech company that has handled quite a bit of change

732
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:17,449
hopefully does a better job of that than we do.

733
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:19,530
-- I mean,
-- you look, they might be able to,

734
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:19,839
well,

735
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:23,040
it's just the classic sort of outsourcing of risk and expertise because,

736
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,079
I mean, that's why I have an accountant because I don't

737
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,930
account,

738
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,660
but they won't be your accountant in 100 years. Kurt

739
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,160
because you'll be dead.

740
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,359
There's well, true.

741
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:33,739
But like,

742
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,770
there's a ton of companies that use the same accounting firm for like 100 years.

743
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,319
Like that's,

744
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:42,180
-- there's a lot of that.
-- I, I won't.

745
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,000
That is probably true. And I'm sure there are 100 year old accounting firms

746
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,550
in the world. Like, I don't

747
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,839
deny that

748
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,790
there are 100 year old things that exist.

749
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:51,969
My,

750
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:54,160
my other favorite quote I read about this story when I was

751
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,880
reading it was what did the internet look like in 1923?

752
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,939
I was like, oh, that's a good one. Well done, sir.

753
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,560
And I get it, I get it.

754
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,069
I, I feel like anyone who looks at this should be skeptical

755
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,219
because I think wordpress is

756
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,479
they, they pulled apr stunt and it worked because like even we're talking about it.

757
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:15,540
So Bravo, to you wordpress

758
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:16,609
in Fairness,

759
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:16,819
Van

760
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,270
Bush's essay, as we may think did come out in 1945 which is almost 80 years ago.

761
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:21,890
But

762
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,560
whatever. So that as we may think is sort of one of the considered one of the,

763
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,300
the,

764
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,119
I don't want to say cornerstones, but one of the founding

765
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:31,949
thought experiments around the internet, so to speak.

766
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:35,020
No, I would say that's like claiming the wheel

767
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,209
is when we invented cars.

768
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:37,369
Well,

769
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,430
I'm not saying invented but kind of where we started thinking about these things.

770
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,550
The wheel is not when we invented cars.

771
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,530
That's what I'm saying.

772
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,209
Anyway,

773
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,180
we've been,

774
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,119
we've been rambling on about this for a long time and I guess

775
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,369
all in all, here's what I'll close with Bravo wordpress, forgetting everyone

776
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,500
to talk about you

777
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,579
and you've done literally nothing

778
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,859
-- to accomplish
-- that.

779
00:31:56,989 --> 00:31:59,520
They serve something like 30% of the world's internet sites.

780
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,140
They do, but we take them for granted all the time.

781
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,930
Like the only time I feel like we ever talk

782
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:06,689
about wordpress is when there's some horrific security worm,

783
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:08,359
like ravaging the internet.

784
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:11,500
43.1%.

785
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,579
I believe that like, this,

786
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:17,300
this podcast is hosted off of wordpress because it's easy.

787
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,089
I pay them, like, $20 a year or something.

788
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,689
And I get a website out of it. Like, you can't beat that.

789
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:28,689
I, 43% of any market, especially the internet is,

790
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,050
-- that's a lot.
-- Well, it, ok.

791
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,040
No, no, not necessarily because they might host 43% of the websites.

792
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:39,729
But I bet they serve like 1% of the internet traffic.

793
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,040
-- I bet it's very low because it's random crap like
-- us. Hang on a sec.

794
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,930
Uh, Wordpress Power is 36.28% of the top million websites.

795
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:54,609
-- I bet
-- there are 10 websites in the top million that are 80% of the traffic.

796
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,180
Oh, yeah, there's a long sale.

797
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:56,670
It's proto

798
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,209
distribution. Absolutely.

799
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,920
But

800
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:00,459
still

801
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:04,130
almost, you know, 36% of the top million websites is a lot.

802
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,589
-- It,
-- it, it is an impressive company. I'm not gonna,

803
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:10,709
and I, I'm gonna pitch. There's a book I read called The Year Without Pants.

804
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:12,229
That is a,

805
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:15,109
this is literally the name of it because wordpress

806
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,390
was one of the first companies to have a,

807
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,000
a fully remote workforce for a long time.

808
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:24,089
And there is, this author basically took a job there as a manager

809
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,290
and worked there for like a year

810
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,199
and, well, maybe more than a year.

811
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:30,150
But then they wrote a book about their experience and

812
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,969
what it was like and how the company works.

813
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:32,680
And it is

814
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,810
a truly remarkable organization.

815
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:36,920
My favorite thing they do and they still do this

816
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,020
because I just talked to someone not long ago about it

817
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:41,069
when you get a job at. Well, it's,

818
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,550
it used to be called automatic. I don't know if it still is

819
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,239
the company behind wordpress.

820
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:49,699
Everyone start no matter what job you have, you spend like a month in support

821
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:51,369
like full stop.

822
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:51,500
Oh,

823
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,910
we talked about this like at the bakery they had their new lady who's

824
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,319
gonna be doing social media marketing stuff like working in the front of house.

825
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,989
I think it is hugely beneficial.

826
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,500
I mean, to be blunt,

827
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,829
that's why I have two video cards is so I can run A I workloads locally

828
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,550
and not speak about it hypothetically but speak about it from the sense of like,

829
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:10,478
yeah, six months ago, this was impossible

830
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:11,518
and now it's

831
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,789
a pain in the butt but it works

832
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,039
and it's steadily, you know what I mean?

833
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:19,248
Like and I've there is a real value to not

834
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:23,428
necessarily knowing all of the business or necessarily understanding it,

835
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,079
but at least having experienced it

836
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:28,158
and having maybe some empathy or compassion and thinking

837
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:30,569
about those 2nd and 3rd order effects of like,

838
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:31,768
oh, like

839
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,928
for example, like

840
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:34,158
banks

841
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:36,418
were like, oh automated tellers. That'll be great.

842
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:37,958
And then they realized, no, no, no, because the bank

843
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,149
can sell.

844
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,570
And so now when you go to the bank, they're always like, oh, we,

845
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,679
we've noticed you only have seven mortgages with us.

846
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:44,600
Would you like

847
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:44,800
a, uh,

848
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:45,379
an insurance

849
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,219
credit

850
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,360
card?

851
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,520
Right.

852
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,149
You know, same thing with Costco, right?

853
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,489
Like, I assume that they get a beating if they don't ask me to upgrade my membership.

854
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,360
And I'm like, I'm already an executive member. It can't upgrade. There's

855
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:56,870
no

856
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,070
like,

857
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,429
well, I get like 2% back and it pays for itself.

858
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:05,209
-- So I'm like, cool, I get all my pants there.
-- That's a weird correlation code.

859
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,399
But how many pants do you buy?

860
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:08,389
Like

861
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,070
probably two pairs a year from Costco

862
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,350
-- and then the rest from like Marks or Quarles? Because I'm a dad. Like
-- anyway, ok,

863
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:20,310
-- I literally dress like somebody who buys all their t-shirts at Costco because I
-- do,

864
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,949
I feel like every time I try to steer us on the track you

865
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:27,360
like grab the wheel and pull it as hard as you can into traffic.

866
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,229
That's my job.

867
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,409
I just,

868
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,320
I

869
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:36,300
think, I wish there was more of this long term type stuff.

870
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,000
But my fear is you get like a ba a back blaze situation where remember they just,

871
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,080
this week went from,

872
00:35:41,649 --> 00:35:43,679
there's a bunch of people using our unlimited business

873
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:46,179
plans to just abuse the bejesus out of it.

874
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:48,879
We gotta, we gotta stop this because it's killing us. Right.

875
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,800
Google did this a few years ago where we

876
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,320
were paying Google for works suite and unlimited storage.

877
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,050
And then now it's two terabytes per user, which I'm like, ok.

878
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:57,459
-- Yeah,
-- I do remember that.

879
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:01,699
Yeah, I know when I was, when I was at Elastic, we definitely abused that.

880
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,725
Like all of our Zoom meetings went into a Google Drive

881
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:07,844
and we had like literally terabytes and terabytes of Zoom meetings.

882
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:10,864
I have to back up our youtube channel and it's like,

883
00:36:11,284 --> 00:36:13,064
ok, Drake and drop,

884
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:13,534
you know,

885
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,844
because it doesn't fit and get unless I pay them

886
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:18,764
and S3 bucket will charge us like $2 a month.

887
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:19,804
-- That's what
-- glacier for.

888
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:22,685
You can put stuff in glacier for nothing until you have to take it out.

889
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:24,804
Which anyway, I'm gonna,

890
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:27,804
I'm going to bring this one home. It's time to be done.

891
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,544
I, I feel like

892
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:34,729
it is an interesting conversation piece that Wordpress has created.

893
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:39,399
And I do think there is a discussion point around like a digital legacy

894
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,889
which we did not really discuss today. But for example,

895
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,959
when our parents died,

896
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,379
I have an aunt who passed away not long ago and they gave me a

897
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:50,739
bunch of old like newspaper clippings and

898
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,899
scrapbooks and things she had put together.

899
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:53,739
I don't have this,

900
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,060
I don't know what to do with it really because I feel bad throwing it away.

901
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,260
But I also don't really want it

902
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:58,050
but like,

903
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:00,780
-- you know what I mean?
-- Is that content available on the internet?

904
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,459
Uh, most of it is, yes, it's mostly old newspapers.

905
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,459
But the point is like,

906
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,570
we can't give a box of pictures to anyone anymore and be like, here you go.

907
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,370
And so I don't think a website like,

908
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:17,270
like wordpress is doing is necessarily the answer

909
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:18,689
because from my perspective,

910
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:22,590
like my pictures I think are vastly more valuable than like my crappy website.

911
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:27,070
My website, I'm not gonna lie, breast.net is a work of art. But

912
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,620
other than that, no one, my kids have no idea what it is. They think it's dumb.

913
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:34,060
But if, if you looked at it, anyone listening would probably look at it and be like,

914
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,760
that's very nice.

915
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,459
Well done, sir.

916
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:36,379
But

917
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,120
the point is like, I do think that this digital legacy is an important topic that we,

918
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,389
no one really talks about

919
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,179
and

920
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,389
this isn't it?

921
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:48,610
-- But we see
-- and once OK, just to completely segue,

922
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:50,790
one thing I find fascinating about the downfall of

923
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,500
Twitter is all the people that have left Twitter but

924
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,429
downloaded all of their data from Twitter.

925
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,030
I did that and I personally did not, I started it and then I'm like, I don't care.

926
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,229
I deleted it and just deleted

927
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:02,260
and I realized

928
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:04,820
-- who cares
-- I did. I did. You know why?

929
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:09,100
Because I had some memes I had uploaded to Twitter that I knew I wanted.

930
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:09,979
And in fact,

931
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:13,889
I've I've now basically extracted them and put them into my meme folder on my phone.

932
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:17,179
-- So I have them for later. But
-- like, I really can't see that

933
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:22,229
personal Twitter data set outside of a very few corner cases being at

934
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:22,969
all.

935
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,209
No,

936
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,510
it's totally like family pictures of my vacation that I'm gonna

937
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,070
make people look at type stuff that no one really wants.

938
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,449
But,

939
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,189
but again,

940
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:32,100
all this digital content,

941
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,270
we have no way to preserve it.

942
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,229
Really like the internet archive is the only thing that exists today.

943
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,469
I don't think what Wordpress is doing is the answer.

944
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:41,590
But I think it's an interesting conversation

945
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,370
that we should have another day that is not today.

946
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:47,550
