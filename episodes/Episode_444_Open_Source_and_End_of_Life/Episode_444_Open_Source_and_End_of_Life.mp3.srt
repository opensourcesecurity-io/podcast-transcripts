Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:11,779
Kurt Siefried and my partner at Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,699
So you've heard the term

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,340
poor choices make good stories, right?

4
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:16,590
Uh

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,420
No,

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,020
-- you had never heard that.
-- I've actually never heard that expression.

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, it, it does and I've got a doozy.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,090
Well, assuming that the poor choice doesn't result in you dying then? Yes,

9
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,209
-- I did
-- not. I did not die.

10
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:32,590
I was mo mostly safe through the entirety of the

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,669
Kurtz aware some of it.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,069
So I had bees in the wall of my, I should say bees. I, I use the word bees.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,900
They were paper wasp or they were yellow jacket wasps.

14
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:45,159
They were not like honey bees. These were not friendly, nice bees.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,779
See, honey bees are nice.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,290
Honey bees are great.

17
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,069
And if I had honey bees in my garage,

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,400
I would call a beekeeper and have them like properly removed.

19
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:53,979
But these are not nice bees.

20
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,490
No,

21
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:58,310
I, I'll try to use the word wasp, but I'll probably say bee a lot like bees in my garage.

22
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,340
I just did it.

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,849
Yeah, I find that really weird that you have this like,

24
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,180
I, I don't know. I don't know. I call them bees, whatever. They're all bees.

25
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,370
-- Everything's bees.
-- Is that a thing you guys do? Like the bubblers?

26
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,750
I don't know. It might be. I live in a weird place. We have strange words for things.

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,470
I call everything bees anyway.

28
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,650
Bees

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,629
in my garage. Right. And,

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,339
-- well,
-- not in your garage, in the walls of your garage,

31
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:20,989
in the wall. Right.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,550
And I could see them on the outside

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,910
and I have a two story garage. So they're like way up high, like really,

34
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,960
really high. We're talking like probably four or 5 m give or take right? Like 20 ft.

35
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,151
It's quite a ways up. And so I can see the bees coming in and out of a hole for reference.

36
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,911
How big was this hole? I don't really small, like the size of a bee. Like,

37
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,591
well, just sometimes it's a big hole. Some of the small hole, I don't know.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,361
-- No,
-- it, it so funny enough,

39
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,791
it was a big hole because squirrels were getting in it and then I

40
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,551
made it a small hole and now bees were in it and I'm like,

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,191
I just traded squirrels for bees.

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,490
Like this is my nightmare also. People don't know this. I hate squirrels so much.

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,890
Like I,

44
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:57,912
my life is a constant battle against keeping squirrels from getting into my attic.

45
00:01:57,982 --> 00:01:59,931
But so I, I do not, I don't like squirrels.

46
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:04,861
So I've got a hole in my garage, bees are in it and I spray them a couple of times.

47
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:08,322
-- The bees don't go away. And I'm
-- like, ok, you mean the wasps? Wasps?

48
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:09,711
Yeah. Sure.

49
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:12,401
And so I'm like, all right, I need to get rid of these things and I,

50
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,382
one time called an exterminator.

51
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:18,231
And he had this contraption where he put the powder in like a chamber and

52
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:20,912
then he applied air to it and there was like a small hose on the,

53
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,013
it's obviously like blew this dust

54
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:25,462
out into the cavity.

55
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:27,233
And obviously, when you're blowing dust,

56
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:29,442
it like gets around corners and goes everywhere, right?

57
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:33,632
So it obviously got and it killed the other wasp I had in my house a couple of years ago

58
00:02:33,843 --> 00:02:36,792
and I'm like, I could totally build one of these things and

59
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:41,542
I can hear the bees in from, from the inside of the garage, right on the second story.

60
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,923
So I'm like, I'm not on a ladder. This isn't like scary.

61
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,313
I don't have to fear for my life.

62
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:47,533
And so I build a little contraption

63
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:50,134
and I looked at what the exterminator used and

64
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:53,164
it's literally the same like pesticide powder I already

65
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,154
have in the garage that my wife bought for

66
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:56,934
the garden like years and years and years ago,

67
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,953
I'm thinking, ok, I'm gonna drill a hole in the wall

68
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:03,833
and then I'm gonna stick my hose in and I'm gonna blow this powder in and I,

69
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:07,154
I built my contraption was a Gatorade bottle with a hole drilled in the side and the

70
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:10,033
top and the hose came out of the top and then I just poured in the powder,

71
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:10,434
right.

72
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:11,434
So

73
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:14,914
I do this, I drill my hole in the wall and like these

74
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:17,835
second, I remove the drill bit like bees start coming out.

75
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:20,744
-- I was about to say, yeah, I was gonna say you
-- immediately.

76
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:25,264
I thought I would have like maybe a second or two to put the tube in. No,

77
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,274
zero time.

78
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:26,755
If,

79
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:31,134
if you were sitting in your living room and like somebody smashed a hole in the wall,

80
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:33,205
you'd immediately stick your head through and be like, what the hell?

81
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:33,994
Right. Well,

82
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,315
-- so would a wasp.
-- Apparently.

83
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:40,074
So anyway, so the wasps are pouring out of the hole and I run away because I'm like,

84
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:41,875
I'm not gonna get stung and then I'm like, wait a minute,

85
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:46,399
I'm gonna have a garage full of wasps if I don't do something about this hole.

86
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,649
So, so I put on a hat and a coat and like, I cover up as much skin as I can.

87
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,919
And I, I got a pencil which was about the size of the hole and I like,

88
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:59,029
run up there and I shove the pencil in the hole and it fit nicely.

89
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,190
It was nice and snug and then I run away and I'm like, ok,

90
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:05,089
no more wasps can come out of the hole. But now I've got, like,

91
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:08,449
I probably have 100 wasps flying around the, the upstairs in my garage now.

92
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,740
Like, it was a lot. So, I'm like, what am I gonna do now?

93
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,539
And I thought, oh, I could wait for tonight and I'm like,

94
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,289
I don't want to wait for tonight because,

95
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:18,450
-- like, I, I, I've got 100 wasps but they're just
-- gonna, how does waiting help?

96
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:21,760
Well, at night they go, like, to the, they, they can't fly in the dark.

97
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,980
But, yeah, exactly. I'm like, how am I gonna find 100 wasp in the, in the dark? Right.

98
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:28,980
-- Sorry,
-- pause, pause, pause, pause. You think wasps can't fly in the dark?

99
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,239
They don't, no, they don't.

100
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,250
Most

101
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:34,959
flying bee type insects, wasps and bees and stuff they,

102
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,959
they can't see at night so they don't fly.

103
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,369
I'll be damned. Uh, no, it's because they become sluggish.

104
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,600
Usually with the, without the warm sunshine

105
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:45,019
-- that
-- could be so they will become sluggish and only

106
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:47,510
become alive one activity when there is warm sunshine around.

107
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,040
So you can safely sleep after the fact that they

108
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:50,779
will not fly around or sting people after dark.

109
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,799
-- Right. Right.
-- Today I learned.

110
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:53,600
So anyway,

111
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,160
I then took my shot back and started sucking bees out of the air with a shop

112
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,170
back which is a considerably harder task than I expected it to be for what it's worth.

113
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,079
But I did not get stung. I emerged from the end of that chain of events

114
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,559
with, with nothing to show for it except, um, a story, a

115
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,820
pencil in your wall labeled. Do not

116
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,089
look. And I, I sent a text to my family.

117
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,899
I'm like, do not take the pencil out of the wall in the garage. Like bees will come out

118
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,100
and then

119
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,739
I waited till dark.

120
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,940
I pulled the pencil out and it's like, I,

121
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,049
I definitely did like the Indiana Jones swapper.

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,119
Like there was, there was no clearance for anything to come out of that hole.

123
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,700
And then I sprayed my stuff in and

124
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,980
as best as I can tell the, the, the Wasps are dead,

125
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,440
I cannot hear them or see them anywhere.

126
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm going to wait a couple of days before I declare like, complete victory.

127
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,200
But yes, my poor choice is made for a ridiculous story.

128
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,660
-- Well,
-- that kind of leads to this conversation, which is

129
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,799
sort of where is,

130
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:54,670
no, no, no.

131
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:59,350
But like, seriously where, where do people, like, where does a software vendors

132
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,480
sort of responsibility begin and end with respect to

133
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:04,410
end of life and taking care of stuff?

134
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,790
Right? Because you live in your house right now.

135
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,149
So you want to take care of it because you don't want to share your house with Wasps.

136
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:09,239
Yes.

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,230
But

138
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,589
in theory, if you were selling that house next week,

139
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,010
you might just put a piece of tape over the outside and be like,

140
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,059
we're not going to talk about this.

141
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,179
I would, that's illegal. That's fraud.

142
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,309
You can't not tell people about things, you know, wrong with your house.

143
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,429
That's a gray area. Because did you know,

144
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,399
you could say with a straight away

145
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,059
that would be a bad time to claim you

146
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,190
didn't know about it after recording this podcast.

147
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,589
Yes. After recording my story. Although at the end of the story, I was successful,

148
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,709
-- I
-- think, no, you think you were successful?

149
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,820
I, I'm 80% certain.

150
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,940
I'm 80%.

151
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:43,238
Yeah,

152
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,328
that's what I'll say. 80%.

153
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:52,238
By the time this podcast goes out, I'll be 100% certain or, or I succeeded

154
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:52,618
or

155
00:06:54,167 --> 00:07:00,768
so. So there's a story about Google Chrome not working in an old version of Ubuntu.

156
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,518
-- It's an LTs from uh 2000
-- 18

157
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:04,958
Ubuntu 1804,

158
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:07,967
which is pretty damn old. Like we're on, we're now on to

159
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:08,308
Ubuntu

160
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:09,545
24.

161
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:14,705
Yeah, because the, the, the number is just a year. So 18, it's from 2018,

162
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:18,145
24 means it's from 2024

163
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:18,936
and Linux

164
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:21,346
has changed a lot in six years.

165
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,015
Well, and, and not just Linux,

166
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:25,985
but the user space, right? Which is kind of what this is really about,

167
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:27,506
-- right?
-- Because it was, I think a

168
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:29,946
glib c conflict or something that

169
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,865
it was like 4.1 and they,

170
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:33,985
they need a slightly newer

171
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:35,153
-- or something like that.
-- Yeah.

172
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:39,764
And, and this topic I like because especially our history,

173
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,694
I know we talk about red hat all the time on the show.

174
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,414
But like this was a huge thing at Red Hat because Red

175
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:47,753
Hat would say we support a Linux distribution for 10 years.

176
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:48,894
-- Uh
-- 13.

177
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:51,854
Is it 13? Now? It was 10, I think back in the day

178
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:56,204
it's, it's been 13 for a long time and it's actually a bit longer than 13.

179
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:57,884
That could be. And, and whatever

180
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:01,082
they're saying, we're support a thing for a really long time.

181
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,361
And now chrome is in a weird place because Chrome

182
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:05,881
is supporting

183
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,321
their thing on someone else's system.

184
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:09,562
At

185
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:13,312
-- least at Red Hat, it was our stuff.
-- Let's talk about why Chrome exists.

186
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:15,011
First of all, Chrome exists to protect

187
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:15,691
goals

188
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,832
uh to protect Google's ad revenue. Basically. Yes.

189
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:23,161
And also to Google has a history of trying to push the industry forwards,

190
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,842
like for example, with Google fiber.

191
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:25,390
Yeah,

192
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,119
trying to shame and, and

193
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,880
that did not work.

194
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,020
But basically everybody else got high speed internet for different reasons.

195
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,630
But Chrome originally remember when it came out

196
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,890
and the V eight javascript engine

197
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,659
-- blew the socks off of everything else to an absurd degree
-- and look at the sandbox,

198
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,049
they did, their security was top notch.

199
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:45,419
Yes.

200
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:51,809
And so so that people forget, but there was a time where Google docs ran pretty OK?

201
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,840
In Chrome. And

202
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:56,200
I, I cannot use words without you having a bleeper button

203
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:58,840
to describe how poorly they ran in Firefox and

204
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:00,960
Microsoft Internet Explorer and all those other things.

205
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:05,030
Yes, it was terrible for sure. No, it wasn't terrible. It was completely unusable.

206
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,679
Right. It was utterly unusable. It was so slow

207
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,239
and the web in general Google saw the future,

208
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,989
which was these javascript apps because like

209
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,679
the front page of CNN is like a megabyte.

210
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,710
So obviously delivering a big chunk of javascript

211
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,479
and some data is not a problem anymore.

212
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:23,349
Right. Right. And the future is these web apps as like I spend all day in web apps.

213
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:23,880
And I, I,

214
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:24,549
you know,

215
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,690
I know people who honestly prefer the web

216
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,609
apps to the native desktop versions of things.

217
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,090
There aren't many desktop apps I prefer anymore.

218
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:37,750
-- There is Microsoft Office and Slack.
-- The Slack app is just a web page

219
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,390
which infuriates me because if you change your

220
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,919
user agent to pretend you're the Slack app,

221
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:46,049
you get like the in the proper Slack experience

222
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,440
-- in the web page.
-- I know. Right. That's

223
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,989
why do I have to install your crappy stupid app to use your stupid service? Like it

224
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,239
-- drives me. I could complain for hours.
-- I

225
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:56,770
don't know.

226
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,830
I know because they want to track the crap out of us. That's why

227
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:04,669
so Chrome exists to basically protect Google's ad revenue streams and to

228
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,669
protect their like to make sure that their apps work like,

229
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,250
well, we'll say just to push Google's agenda,

230
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,119
their ad revenue is part of their agenda.

231
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,989
Security is part of their agenda.

232
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,950
-- Part of their, it's, it's 90% of their operating profits
-- to,

233
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:17,270
it's

234
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:17,869
a

235
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,289
big

236
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,309
part of their agenda,

237
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,359
but they also like their security work. They do, they have multiple agendas. It's,

238
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:27,049
yeah, and some of them align with what you and I want. So that's great.

239
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,479
Like they want better security because they're tired of doing, you know,

240
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:32,820
fixing people's accounts and dealing with cracked accounts and all that stuff.

241
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,219
And so challenges though,

242
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:38,320
sometimes their agenda doesn't line up with other people's agendas, which is,

243
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,159
for example, they want to keep Chrome kind of moving forwards, right?

244
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:46,400
Like they, they, they do a lot of releases like kind of every week or two and

245
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,880
they're constantly pushing out new

246
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:48,909
features.

247
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,489
And for example, they're, you know, they're,

248
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,609
they're putting in trust to death this fall by, you know,

249
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,619
removing their certificate from the root trust store,

250
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,770
which we talked about a couple of shows ago.

251
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,369
And so like a lot of things Chrome does some things they can just deploy like, hey,

252
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,570
we support this new web feature

253
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,729
and some things they have to kind of stage and deploy like, oh, you know, we're,

254
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:11,700
we're killing this.

255
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,250
So

256
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:15,429
you're gonna have six months or 12 months or whatever to deal with.

257
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,450
And the problem is

258
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,400
if you keep backwards compatibility,

259
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:25,799
that will utterly hobble your ability to move forwards for a lot of things,

260
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,059
it for sure does

261
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,799
-- supporting old things is very expensive.
-- Well, it's not just that it's expensive.

262
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:35,559
It's that supporting old things means some oftentimes you can't have the new thing.

263
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,679
-- It
-- can.

264
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,239
Yes, I've seen that before.

265
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,539
So a perfect example of this is a lot of people are like we need to support Python Two.

266
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,489
that thing needs to die

267
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,700
-- if
-- they choose that.

268
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,820
There's so much and, and they choose not to support Python three.

269
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,559
Their app is like there's so much that's just going

270
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,460
to be a horror show of compatibility and unicode support.

271
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:55,929
Yes,

272
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,580
it just, it's end of life like Python two is dead.

273
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,159
Well, and the Python project decided that and they can.

274
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,859
But the thing is the problem is Chrome runs on top of other stuff that Google

275
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,659
doesn't control or have any say that's correct.

276
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,520
Does Google have some sort of duty

277
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,289
to keep supporting platforms that they have supported? It's that simple.

278
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,599
-- So,
-- here's my take on this.

279
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:21,309
It's easy to dunk on Chrome right now

280
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,909
because obviously it's been doing some dumb stuff

281
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,640
like with the Manifest V three and just kind of some of the other attitudes.

282
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,440
But I think at the end of the day,

283
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,080
like, I don't blame someone like Google for end of life in something old.

284
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,479
It sucks maintaining it

285
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:38,549
and my suspicion, I don't know this for sure

286
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,429
because I don't run

287
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,440
ubuntu. But I, I'm pretty, I, I bet you can use a snap or something on

288
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,229
ubuntu 18 and,

289
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,489
and basically get Chrome to run and if you can't in all seriousness,

290
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,770
like upgrade freaking

291
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,109
Ubuntu, like there, there's, there is a path around this.

292
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,020
You can either run Firefox or upgrade

293
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:58,755
Ubuntu. So I, I don't think Google is out of now.

294
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:01,335
They should have given some warning, which my understanding is,

295
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:03,575
they just killed it one day and people were like, holy crap,

296
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:05,065
-- what's going on
-- more to the point?

297
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,375
Why is Google

298
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:08,664
the one in trouble here when it's a

299
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:09,755
btu's operating system?

300
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:13,375
And if people, if there's a package of software that is very popular,

301
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:14,515
should that kind of be a

302
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:15,594
Btu's job to

303
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,934
-- make sure it works.
-- Not anymore.

304
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:21,044
I mean, so this is something Google did with Chrome actually is

305
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:25,500
they took on the, the maintainer ship of that for nearly everything.

306
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,099
So like I, I run Fedora,

307
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,849
I uh the recording thing we use for podcasting is called Riverside and

308
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,419
it only runs in Chrome which drives me crazy and I hate that,

309
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,099
but I have to install chrome.

310
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,289
Do you know how much easier life is if you support one

311
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:41,299
web browser and it's chrome and you tell everybody install it?

312
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:44,179
Yes, I'm, I don't like it, but I understand.

313
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:50,309
And I, when I install Chrome, they gave me an R PM that then set up the app package

314
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,070
repository for fire for, for,

315
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,549
for Chrome.

316
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,669
That then every time I do ad NF upgrade,

317
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,590
I get the new chrome that Google has in their repository.

318
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:05,320
It's kind of clever now I could use like the flat pack, for example.

319
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,000
And that would, but I don't because I don't know,

320
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,979
I'm worried about the cameras and microphones and all the weird crap we

321
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:13,700
do like working correctly because flat packs have security on certain things.

322
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,000
And

323
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,330
so I just don't deal with it.

324
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,229
But,

325
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,630
but yeah, like Google did that and I suspect they did that to make sure

326
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:22,200
that the version of Chrome you were getting

327
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:23,989
when you were a user

328
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,669
was the experience they wanted you to have.

329
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,630
Because one of the things that happens is

330
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,559
when you have a distribution repackaging software,

331
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,520
they can make decisions, we'll say well,

332
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,809
or just the maintainer goes away on vacation.

333
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,799
That's true. You could, yes, someone could not upgrade it for sure.

334
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,799
That's I had to take over a PHP package in,

335
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:47,359
in uh Fedora because I needed an up to date version that actually worked.

336
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:48,830
And the person who was in charge

337
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:52,169
it previously, it just kind of abandoned it and walked away from Fedora.

338
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:52,809
Sure

339
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:53,710
it happens.

340
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:54,650
I mean,

341
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,890
I don't think for a major package you'd see an issue like that, but

342
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,450
it

343
00:14:58,619 --> 00:14:59,729
could happen. Yes.

344
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,729
Anyway, Google controls their destiny, which I have no problem with.

345
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:06,020
Like there is absolutely nothing wrong with doing that

346
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:08,210
and it's not like you can't, I mean,

347
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:11,130
I know this is one of those classic like, well, you can,

348
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,630
technically it's open source and build it yourself and blah, blah, blah.

349
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,330
I mean, realistically, no God, no,

350
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,049
-- it's so
-- much work. You can't build. Chrome is not open source.

351
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,179
Chromium

352
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:19,650
is

353
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:19,869
open

354
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:20,940
two mixed up.

355
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,049
Yes, Chromium.

356
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:22,380
In fact,

357
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,559
you can install Chromium and it would not surprise me if Chromium still runs on

358
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,179
Ubuntu 18 because someone is building it there.

359
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,619
But Chrome which is based on Chromium is not open source.

360
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,299
It just uses a lot of open source.

361
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:41,030
So I always get those two mixed up. I forget that Chrome is like a binary only version.

362
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,179
And that's why everybody always, because I knew my brain.

363
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm always like, why is everybody so sour about this thing?

364
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,260
-- It's open source but it's not,
-- not open source.

365
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:47,710
Right.

366
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:50,609
Well, and that's probably the other thing is a lot of the distributions, like,

367
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:51,830
especially Fedora,

368
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,429
you don't package binaries in Fedora. That's not how Fedora works.

369
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,280
You, you build source.

370
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,489
That is how it works. And I don't know if ubuntu is quite as strict.

371
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,710
I know they were a little looser back in the day. I'm not sure if they've changed, but

372
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,869
same idea.

373
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,469
Like, they don't want to take your binary blob of crap because in reality,

374
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:13,070
if you take a binary blob of crap from someone,

375
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,289
you, there's nothing you can do. Like, if there's

376
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:16,530
a,

377
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:17,969
or something doesn't work. It's like,

378
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,719
sorry, I,

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
I don't know what to do.

380
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:24,760
And that's an infamous problem with, like, a lot of hardware drivers.

381
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,609
-- Yeah. Yeah,
-- for sure. You know where the, the wind modems? Oh, God, the wind modems.

382
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,469
Yeah. Well, I remember the network.

383
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:35,020
I, I had this conversation yesterday with someone, I don't remember who it was now.

384
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,349
But,

385
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:39,359
yeah, like, so for, for, for all you young uns who have no idea.

386
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,429
Like, back in the day we're talking about 20 years ago, give or take. Probably

387
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,559
you would buy, like, a laptop

388
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:48,400
and it would have a wireless card in it

389
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:52,520
for Wi Fi, which was novel at the time, not everyone had it.

390
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,849
And in order for Wi Fi to work on Linux,

391
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:58,770
you usually needed some terrible binary only driver from the manufacturer.

392
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:02,330
And this was actually one of the places that ubuntu, they were like,

393
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,839
we are going to support all of these drivers.

394
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:05,729
And if you install

395
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,199
ubuntu,

396
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,209
like your computer is just going to work and that captured a lot of the

397
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:13,380
hearts and minds of people back in the day because like I could install Deb

398
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,890
or, or, or Fedora

399
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:20,390
and then I can spend a week trying to get this stupid Wi Fi card working or I can install

400
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,800
ubuntu and it just works.

401
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,790
See, it, it's interesting to me because I,

402
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,108
I just had basically a very parallel situation with my car, right.

403
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:32,000
My car has a Hyundai GD I engine from the years where

404
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:32,819
they

405
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,540
occasionally blow up or seize up or catch fire, even if you take care of them

406
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,010
I took care of it

407
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,939
and now Hyundai, well, uh Kia sorry is replacing the engine

408
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,459
on their nickel,

409
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,020
which is like five or seven grand.

410
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,459
That's a lot of money. The difference being with

411
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,630
chrome, for example is,

412
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:56,060
well, you still have a working version of chrome on Ubuntu 18. It's just

413
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,819
-- out of date.
-- No, I don't think that's, I would not say that. No.

414
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,829
What I'm about to say though is

415
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,150
software is different,

416
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,500
especially web browsers because you can't have an out of date browser.

417
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:08,890
-- I mean,
-- I would, I don't

418
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,310
think

419
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:14,189
-- like you can't, you can't browse the web safely.
-- I'd compare it to a gallon of milk.

420
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,709
Right?

421
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,349
You have a gallon of milk in your fridge

422
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,189
and you can do nothing

423
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,729
-- and it will still become unusable eventually.
-- Exactly.

424
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:27,250
Uh, well, not just unusable but like actively a biohazard. Probably.

425
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,329
Right. No, no. Like sir.

426
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,339
And that's the thing though is it's not like chrome,

427
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,040
just kind of degrades and stops working.

428
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,170
No, it becomes an active.

429
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,530
It's dangerous

430
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,165
if you actually like if you browse the web with a version of chrome from two years ago,

431
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,714
-- I hope you have some good antivirus on that system
-- that won't help you.

432
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:48,954
I mean, this is why people say softer ages like milk, not like cheese

433
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:53,314
because old cheese. Well, even that you'll say is iffy, but

434
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:56,954
yes, I've had very old cheese and it's quite, quite nice.

435
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,194
So, but that's the thing, right. Is this,

436
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,099
you can't just be like, oh well, you still have the working version, you're fine.

437
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,739
Keep using it. No abs like stop using it.

438
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:07,780
So actually you say that

439
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:12,369
that is not something I heard anyone say once and

440
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,979
all of the things I read about this particular thing.

441
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,170
I think it basically came down to

442
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,430
Google stopped supporting chrome on a really old version of ubuntu.

443
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:23,000
A bunch of people got angry, Google was like, all right, we goofed up,

444
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,959
we're going to make it work.

445
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:26,810
And then in, like, I think they said six months, they're gonna,

446
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:27,569
they're gonna kill it.

447
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:28,089
And, like,

448
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,609
I respect that. I think they handle it pretty well in all seriousness

449
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,239
or this was the plan all along

450
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,949
instead of giving six months warning and dealing with the blowback. Now they just,

451
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,790
they do this shenanigans. I doubt they're that Machiavellian. But whatever,

452
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,329
I'm skeptical, they, they're that with it, but that is a, that would be clever.

453
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,349
Well, it's just also, that's,

454
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,979
you know, Ockham's razor,

455
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,109
right. It's stupid. So, it's probably true.

456
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,439
My suspicion,

457
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:56,989
my guess having done a lot of this kind of work at some

458
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,560
point in the past is they were building the new version of chrome

459
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:02,000
and they were like, it fails on point

460
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:05,839
to 18 and they were like, ah, whatever. Barely anyone uses it there. Who cares.

461
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:09,479
And they were like, great. We're dead now and then it turned out

462
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,079
like,

463
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,439
yeah, people were using it

464
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,839
well, and that's the thing. It's possible it was like 100 people

465
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:18,160
-- but they were just really loud like,
-- well, and that's,

466
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,239
that's the case with a lot of things nowadays is you get

467
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,979
these like a small group can sound very loud online and,

468
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,530
and especially like dunking on chrome is cool right now.

469
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,260
So like,

470
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,619
I, I get it like it was easy to run with this one.

471
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,589
-- But
-- that's, that's one thing you mentioned. That's

472
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,459
is, yeah, we, we've, I think we've basically trained people in large part but

473
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:40,180
web browsers especially

474
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:45,819
also a lot of server software has to be up to date and patched or else it's toxic waste.

475
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:50,790
-- I mean,
-- just software, I think software in general is kind of viewed in that way now

476
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:51,880
the,

477
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,819
but especially software that interacts with other public

478
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:58,069
stuff that you don't control like the web

479
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:00,540
or, you know, like your mail server accepts in coming.

480
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,119
Like I always love when people are like, you know, hey,

481
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,609
can we like set up our email server?

482
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:05,410
So it only talks to trusted people. And I'm like,

483
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,239
not really like, unless,

484
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,339
unless there's like three companies you got to talk to and you,

485
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:13,300
they'll give you their IP ranges and then you'll never get email from anyone else.

486
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,599
Like

487
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,959
that sounds actually kind of lovely. Like I,

488
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,040
you know, somebody at the CS A was like, hey, Kurt, can you lock email out?

489
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,800
So only people we know, talk to us. I'd be like, oh yeah, yeah, we can do that.

490
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,839
So it's funny you say that because actually there's,

491
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:27,839
there's another story I'll link to in the show notes where

492
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,069
uh Linus Torvalds at some conference somewhere.

493
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,780
I don't know where he, he went on and on about a whole bunch of stuff.

494
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,339
And one of the things that came up was all of the

495
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,920
CD ES going to the Linux kernel because it's a lot.

496
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,160
-- It's what, like 60 a day, I think on average now.
-- No, no, no,

497
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,819
not 60 a day. It's,

498
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,180
um,

499
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,530
it'll

500
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
-- about
-- 60
-- a week.

501
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,071
Roughly it'll be about 4000 ish or something a year. Yeah. Give or take that.

502
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:51,590
That's the,

503
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,711
with about a 3% rejection rate, which is pretty damn good.

504
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:56,720
-- Yeah. Oh, they're doing, I think they're doing
-- a

505
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,191
good job.

506
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:59,110
Yeah, I think it was like 2.7 actually.

507
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,071
So, it's funny, uh, uh,

508
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:04,701
Daniel from Curl basically looked at number of lines of code in curl,

509
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:07,340
number of lines of code in the kernel and the ratios

510
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,360
pretty much line up from the number of CD ES.

511
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:09,661
Curl

512
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,360
has had a number of CV S A kernel has had based on lines of code,

513
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,822
which I found pretty interesting.

514
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:19,261
-- Well, the thing is if they're within an order of magnitude, they're
-- very close,

515
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,332
it's not even an order of magnitude apart.

516
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:25,352
-- I
-- have a suspicion. It's not so much about how many bugs there are.

517
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:29,102
It's about how many people are looking at the code and updating it

518
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:31,371
for. Exactly. Because curl

519
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:35,812
and the Linux kernel are both stupidly active projects

520
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,072
in ways that most other projects are not.

521
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:40,131
-- Yes.
-- And they're very receptive. But my,

522
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,822
I, I want, I would like to do some more work in this because if the,

523
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:47,532
it's, it's right now, I think like 13,000 lines of code per CV E per year,

524
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,532
like do the math.

525
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,333
If that is true,

526
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:55,052
that would be a super useful number that we could apply all over the place.

527
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:57,243
I have a suspicion that, that, well, that,

528
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:01,272
that number applies to C and that for other programming languages, like for Python,

529
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:01,873
it'll be a much,

530
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:06,243
that's a good point. It'll be a smaller number for Python because Python is denser.

531
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:09,894
Um because somebody did a really fast thing of for every line of code,

532
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:12,443
the developer writes essentially how many lines of

533
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:14,404
machine code gets spat out the end.

534
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:15,973
And of course, like c it's

535
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,524
a bunch and in Python, it's like a whole bunch because, you know,

536
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:21,683
people do like import pandas and then

537
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,073
that's like 10 megabytes of software right there.

538
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:27,524
And so I have a suspicion though that between

539
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:29,124
I'm going to use the word density,

540
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:31,443
the density of the language and the information it holds.

541
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:35,024
So Python is higher density than say C right? Because Python, you can,

542
00:23:35,183 --> 00:23:35,514
I'm

543
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,084
willing to make this claim without any evidence.

544
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:40,114
But I, I have a suspicion for Python.

545
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,655
It'll be a lot less than 13,000 lines of Python per year per CV.

546
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:45,775
Oh, you think it'll be higher? I don't know.

547
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:49,834
Well, no, no, I think like Python will be like 1000 lines of code per CV per year.

548
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:51,454
Maybe. I don't know. It'll be interesting.

549
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:55,114
I need to find some good projects to do the research on anyway. Ok. back to line.

550
00:23:55,145 --> 00:23:58,685
So Linus basically, like this was all pointed out and he said, like,

551
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,474
stop running old kernels

552
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:03,505
and that like this is the message coming out of the

553
00:24:03,796 --> 00:24:06,005
kernel is like stop running these old kernels.

554
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:09,036
And then he also made a comment about like all the, the Chinese

555
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:13,556
4.9 hardware manufacturers still running like the 49 kernel.

556
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:17,786
This really goes to the fact of especially with open source

557
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:20,576
unless you're paying somebody like red hat a butt load

558
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:23,066
of money to back port stuff to keep it stable,

559
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:27,166
but no open source projects really gonna want to do that or care.

560
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:28,385
And we talked about that where, you know,

561
00:24:28,395 --> 00:24:31,265
all these companies want people to take on this engineering,

562
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,130
you know,

563
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,849
um sustainment work.

564
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,719
And like, weirdly enough

565
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,560
that doesn't excite a lot of people.

566
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:39,380
It's pretty boring you have,

567
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,609
that's definitely one of those things you have to pay people if you want it done.

568
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:46,310
I mean, 100%. And I know like this is something tide lift is trying to do

569
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:47,719
where you pay tide lift money.

570
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:49,969
Then tide lift goes to open source and says, like,

571
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:52,609
please take care of this old stuff for money.

572
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:56,060
And I think 20 years ago, you absolutely could do this with the Lenox girl quite soon

573
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:56,574
mainly.

574
00:24:56,584 --> 00:25:01,234
But now with the size of Len kernel and the change velocity or something like curl,

575
00:25:01,244 --> 00:25:03,765
I it's going to become less and less possible in that.

576
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:05,954
It's just gonna become so much more expensive.

577
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,064
Well, and, and infrastructure is different now.

578
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:11,655
I mean, look, this is like the crowd strike. Delta story

579
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:14,074
of Delta obviously had

580
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,630
their infrastructure was not modernized to a point, they could roll things back or,

581
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,099
or fix problems remotely.

582
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:23,390
They were sending people, you know, people were schlepping USB drives around

583
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,349
to unlock computers and, and roll things back.

584
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,270
And

585
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:28,229
I think

586
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,229
back, you know, 1020 years ago

587
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,630
when something broke, you had to send someone out to fix it.

588
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:37,469
Whereas now a lot of infrastructure, like if something breaks,

589
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,270
you can roll it back without too much effort.

590
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:43,790
And I think this is part of what's helping drive this. Like let's just freaking

591
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,949
concurrent because it's a lot easier than trying to

592
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,160
maintain all this old crap and if it breaks,

593
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,430
we'll just roll it back.

594
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:49,650
Well,

595
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,089
something remember with an entity like Delta is

596
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,920
like they'll have their own network with Ilo,

597
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,819
you know, integrated Lights out management.

598
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,910
Oh man. Oh, I'm not blaming them. I'm just,

599
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:03,439
the thing to remember is, for example, they'll have a bunch of kiosks or signs

600
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,819
at the airport network

601
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,160
but where they can't maybe have long.

602
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,020
And so,

603
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:09,469
yeah, how do we fix it?

604
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:12,839
Well, Gary needs to go out there with a step ladder and, like, fix it.

605
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,900
Yeah, I, I, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not smashing on Delta here.

606
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,880
Like I, I get it, like, running an airline is hard. I don't know how it works. It's ok.

607
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:22,449
Uh,

608
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:26,859
so, but back to this, like, I think the reality is, is

609
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,319
there the cost

610
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:33,060
of maintaining a delta a change between you

611
00:26:33,189 --> 00:26:37,339
and sort of upstream is getting to the point where it's no longer sustainable.

612
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,540
-- Not in very many things. I agree with that,
-- you know,

613
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,219
and

614
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:45,170
because the reality is, it's not just a delta of one thing,

615
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,030
it's a delta of multiple things that are interlinked.

616
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,030
And so I think it's,

617
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,959
you get this kind of network effect of complexity where if

618
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:54,989
something is 1% out and only one thing was 1% out,

619
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,969
then you're 1% out.

620
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:59,069
But when you have 100 things that are linked together and 1% out,

621
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,194
I feel like you're much more the one percent out of sort of the delta.

622
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:04,555
And I think that's

623
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:08,354
because I look at the complexity of software. Like I had,

624
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:10,555
uh the A, I write me a bunch of html,

625
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:14,314
five web pages to do some clever image manipulation for my son to make per

626
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:15,305
bead patterns.

627
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:19,704
And like when I kind of look at what's being called library wise, it's like

628
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,510
I'm literally doing

629
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,319
image

630
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,750
manipulation and recognition in like 200 lines of html code

631
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:27,920
and javascript

632
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:30,560
and it's just calling a bunch of magic libraries.

633
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:31,800
OK. You know,

634
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,680
and that's a simple thing compared to say, oh, I don't know a web browser like Chrome.

635
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:40,439
Where, Right? How many lines of code is Chrome?

636
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:43,479
Web browser in total with all the libraries it pulls in now

637
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,400
tens of millions. At least.

638
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,500
I bet it's, it's a lot. And, and so you bring this up.

639
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,689
Uh I remember I was at Red Hat when

640
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,219
we would back

641
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:57,380
for the security vulnerabilities in Firefox every

642
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,989
time there's a new Firefox that came out

643
00:27:59,150 --> 00:27:59,540
and

644
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:02,920
we were part of, we helped fire Fox do security work.

645
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,089
So we usually, we knew what the patches were

646
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:10,170
that were security relevant and it was like a couple, it was like 10 or less, right?

647
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,910
And I remember when we hit the point where it was like, we can't do this anymore.

648
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,750
We have to just start taking Firefox and upgrading

649
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,209
it and that's the way it's going to be.

650
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:18,810
And it was like,

651
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,660
it was very contentious and there was a lot of

652
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,239
back and forth and stuff and it's like we,

653
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,209
we have no choice

654
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:23,619
and,

655
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,209
and I think the Linux kernel is the same story

656
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:28,530
like you have no choice anymore like you're taking it,

657
00:28:28,614 --> 00:28:29,015
that's it.

658
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:31,334
-- Well. But
-- also if you want the new features,

659
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:34,435
ignoring new features, I don't even care about new features.

660
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:36,594
Just keeping the lights on

661
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,755
means you're going to have to upgrade same.

662
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:42,994
I mean this is the same deal like chrome is the same story like you upgrade chrome,

663
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:47,114
you don't, there is no plan B like you take what they give you

664
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:48,505
well and something to remember though

665
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,415
is with Chrome.

666
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:50,035
For example,

667
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:52,655
I have to be compatible with the website serving

668
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:54,635
the content I want to see and interact with.

669
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:57,234
I have to have those new features. Or else

670
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,400
my web browser becomes useless.

671
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:00,760
I mean to a degree

672
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,540
on this,

673
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,619
do you think an old version of Chrome is going to work with this riverside thing?

674
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:08,060
II, I don't know where they would put the cut off.

675
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:12,339
-- I I bet they know and they would tell me if I looked it up
-- but at some point, they,

676
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:14,410
they started using a feature in the video that

677
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,969
didn't exist in the previous version of Chrome,

678
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:16,219
right?

679
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:17,380
And I just looked,

680
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,780
the Chromium browser code base contains over 32 million source lines of code.

681
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,219
But is that just the browser or is that I bet that's not the dependencies?

682
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,949
-- I bet that's just the Chromium
-- browser

683
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:27,060
which is

684
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:27,930
I

685
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,290
bet if you add indep dependencies multiply that by a number

686
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:32,170
like

687
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,650
it's probably 100 million lines of stuff when it's all done. I bet.

688
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,060
Yeah. Which is like mind boggling.

689
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:41,449
Um, that's the world we live in now. That's how everything works.

690
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:42,619
And that's why I can have this, like,

691
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,709
image of you on a screen and talk to you and record it.

692
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,579
I know. And you're,

693
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,099
and I'm not

694
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,449
like, it's wild.

695
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:48,780
It

696
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,510
is, it always amusing to me, like all the things we can do now,

697
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,400
like we can we complain and, and

698
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,339
oh Zoom is broken like the world is ending. It's like

699
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:58,020
10 years ago. Like

700
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,290
I remember when like 480 video

701
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,020
was like, oh my God, this is amazing. And now,

702
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:07,780
so we were talking about that one day.

703
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:12,170
It was me and some friends and we were mentioning to the kids

704
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,569
about how like when the Star Wars episode one trailer came out,

705
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:20,530
we all watched it off dial up and it was like this itty bitty

706
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:21,849
video

707
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:25,619
running on like Real Player or something and it was just terrible.

708
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:27,329
I know. Right. Buffalo

709
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:27,959
that

710
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,719
everyone hated real player.

711
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:31,739
Yes.

712
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,920
Yes. Anyway. Anyway.

713
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,790
All right, we're kind of, we're, we're running out of steam on this one.

714
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,619
I think I just keep coming back to the world is so

715
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,569
much more big and complex in terms of scale and software abilities.

716
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:45,979
And

717
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,689
getting into that being in a delta, a change like out of sync with

718
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,430
reality with upstream.

719
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,290
It's just,

720
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:58,640
yeah, you can do it and and there might be some short term benefits where like, oh,

721
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,449
we don't have to do updates because we're doing this.

722
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,410
But it,

723
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,979
I just don't see a way forward that doesn't involve

724
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,290
keeping everything up to date all the time and,

725
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,910
and investing in testing frameworks and testing rigs and all

726
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,760
that stuff so that you can catch stuff right away

727
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,920
and work with upstream or with both upstream. Because

728
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:16,939
what I'm seeing a lot more is like, um

729
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,469
not a flaw per se, but like this thing now interacts with this thing in a weird way

730
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,829
where it doesn't work,

731
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:23,589
right?

732
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,380
And you know,

733
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,670
those two projects may not even know each other exist.

734
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,030
Let alone, there's a another thing that gloms them both together.

735
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,869
-- Well,
-- and look man again

736
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,229
to 18,

737
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:39,250
that's from 2018. We're in 2024 right now at the time of recording. So like

738
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,900
that's a long time ago. And,

739
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,510
and it kind of also,

740
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,910
I don't want to tell people what to do, but I feel like

741
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,030
if you're running a desktop based on technology from six years ago,

742
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,510
-- like your desktop is gonna suck
-- the thing to remember.

743
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,209
No, it's not about the desktops.

744
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:58,949
It's, it'll be about um like CNC milling machines that have a web interface,

745
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,020
-- things like that.
-- You think they're running a bunch of 18 on that crap stuff.

746
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,760
Remember that? A

747
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,000
web

748
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:04,859
browser?

749
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:07,949
Yeah, because it's a cheap way to write an interface.

750
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,229
I don't know you're

751
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:10,790
OK.

752
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,550
By definition,

753
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,449
if you're building something like AC NC milling

754
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:15,739
machine or a cell counting machine that runs Linux

755
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,699
and has a gooey interface,

756
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,400
building a web based interface versus trying to teach

757
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,520
these people how to use like GTK or something.

758
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:29,430
-- I
-- feel like running latest chrome on that system is not how it's working.

759
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,739
I just, I've seen a lot of stuff where web browsers get used and stuff that you,

760
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,550
you wouldn't like, think of being a desktop.

761
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,890
-- But
-- yes,

762
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,890
and I also suspect the developers who create

763
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,089
those particular systems cast that web browser in amber

764
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,849
and it's never updated ever because updating it might

765
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:51,569
break whatever fragile thing they've constructed beneath it.

766
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,770
If there's one thing I've learned from all of the,

767
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,109
we'll say like

768
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,770
industrial systems I've interacted with and it's not a lot

769
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:08,290
-- is they never change anything once they get it working, like it's set forever,
-- the,

770
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,410
the cost of an outage is significant.

771
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:17,359
Like I remember the story where somebody n map scanned uh a network and brought down

772
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:20,010
a production line for cookies and they had to throw a day's worth of cookies.

773
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,229
I believe it. I believe it. I, I know

774
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,699
like MRI machines at hospitals, everyone's like do not like they,

775
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:28,599
they tell the pent testers stay away from this IP

776
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:31,239
address because the MRI machines aren't running on that like

777
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,949
I get it. It's

778
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,099
and yeah, the MRI machines also running Windows 95 So

779
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:37,589
what,

780
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,099
how it works.

781
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,930
Uh It is what it is.

782
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:43,270
I mean, I don't know, I think all in all like, yeah,

783
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,959
it's easy to dunk on chrome right now but I, I don't, I don't blame him.

784
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:47,359
You know,

785
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:48,579
it

786
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:49,459
is.

787
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:53,569
At least now there is the possibility for software updates because for example,

788
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:57,069
stuff used to run hardware that was so limited that whatever code they gave you,

789
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,540
that's what you had

790
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,130
full stop.

791
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:02,979
And now, for example, you can just chuck a raspberry pie into something

792
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,780
and

793
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,689
there's a possibility of like upgrading Linux to

794
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:09,129
something reasonable even probably 10 years from now.

795
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:12,929
Maybe, I don't know. I'm not going to trust that once I get something running.

796
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,889
Actually my 3D printer in the basement,

797
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:16,728
it is a boron.

798
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,600
It runs a Raspberry pi as the

799
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,010
primary interface for the printer.

800
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:26,320
I've never upgraded it and I don't want to touch it because in fact,

801
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,100
my kid upgraded it once and it broke everything and it took us three days to fix it.

802
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,040
I'm like, never upgrade Linux again on this computer.

803
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,370
Like it will be whatever versions on it forever now.

804
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,815
And I'm literally a security guy.

805
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:41,016
I'm like, don't upgrade it.

806
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:43,895
But the thing is you probably have compensating controls like

807
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:46,094
it's sitting on a trusted network behind a net,

808
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:47,025
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

809
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:47,186
I

810
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,176
don't trust my network,

811
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:51,156
but you know what I'm saying? Like it's not plugged into the

812
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:51,364
internet

813
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:52,255
-- and
-- the internet.

814
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:53,735
But it's definitely,

815
00:34:54,074 --> 00:34:55,324
it's not like when you go to show

816
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:57,845
dot IO and look for like, remote desktops

817
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:59,451
software and it's like all there,

818
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,541
-- here's
-- my compensating control. I just realized we ended on this

819
00:35:02,681 --> 00:35:03,342
is

820
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:05,981
there is no authentication to the system and you

821
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:08,261
can open a shell in the web interface.

822
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:10,062
So it doesn't matter how old it is because you

823
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:13,092
can already turn into root on the 3D printer.

824
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:13,602
So it's fine.

825
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:14,382
So there you go.

826
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:19,251
My compensating control is the complete and utter lack of compensating controls.

827
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,179
Yeah,

828
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,360
I guess if, if we give everyone root,

829
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,739
we don't have to worry about someone becoming root.

830
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,820
-- It's fine. Everybody,
-- it's not a bug, it's a feature.

831
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,629
-- It's intentional. We
-- solved security.

832
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,250
Well, it's like that whole CV thing. They don't do CV. S for intentional backdoor.

833
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:37,435
But if you make a mistake, they'll give it a CV. And it's like,

834
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:40,375
but when an attacker intentionally puts a back door into something,

835
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:42,435
shouldn't we want people to know about that?

836
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:44,745
We're gonna have a show all about this.

837
00:35:44,754 --> 00:35:48,794
So, actually I was contacted, um, I don't know the guys, I forget his, his real name.

838
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:50,965
Um, he, he listened to the show, he goes by Grimm

839
00:35:51,104 --> 00:35:51,875
on

840
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,094
Mastodon

841
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:55,975
and he is the paint maintainer of Pigeon

842
00:35:56,225 --> 00:35:59,614
and he got a hold of me a couple of days ago. I was like, hey, I have a plug in.

843
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,570
That is a backdoor.

844
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:04,229
Well, I think it's a backdoor. Do you know anyone who can help me?

845
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,330
And I was like, let me, let me ask around, I can look for some people and I,

846
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,250
I contacted some folks, but it turned out uh Johnny

847
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:09,760
Xus,

848
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,260
who's a uh like a legendary gamer hacker guy. He's in the Chicago area.

849
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:16,100
He worked with them

850
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,000
and, and yes, it was in fact a keylogger

851
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,295
and now, but now pigeons like, OK, how do we try to, to bet some of these plugins stuff?

852
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:26,686
I'm like, we should talk about all of this, this whole story.

853
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:28,865
Like the whole saga would make a marvelous show.

854
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:32,065
So yes, we're going to talk about exactly this because I think it's gonna be amazing.

855
00:36:32,236 --> 00:36:34,696
And yeah, it's like he also says, should I get a CV for this?

856
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:39,025
I'm like, you can try but it's against the rules, like, which is stupid.

857
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:43,145
Crowdstrike didn't get a CV. And it's like only the most important security related

858
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,201
thing that happened. It happened this year.

859
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:49,142
I love Xe did and it shouldn't have and people were complaining it got a CV.

860
00:36:49,152 --> 00:36:51,761
And it's like, shut up, like, do not talk.

861
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:55,721
It is the best thing in the world that we can have automated scanners,

862
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:58,511
find this stupid thing and tell us if we're running it like

863
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:00,922
you're an idiot. Stop complaining anyway,

864
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:01,172
I'm

865
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:01,632
calling it.

866
00:37:02,231 --> 00:37:05,812
I want to know if they lose criminal of security vulnerabilities. Ok. We'll do that.

867
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,139
I remember for the longest time people were like the, the

868
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,439
new

869
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:10,370
Scel refuses to do CV S and then L was

870
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:14,739
like, oh, ok. Well, we'll do them like, oh, not like that, right? Like,

871
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:15,639
because

872
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,669
like, like you said, like, it might be a milking machine.

873
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:21,510
-- It might be the Mars Lander, they
-- use the monkey paw,

874
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,260
like, don't use the monkey

875
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,899
and make wishes everybody, you get what you want.

876
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,479
All right.

877
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:29,370
