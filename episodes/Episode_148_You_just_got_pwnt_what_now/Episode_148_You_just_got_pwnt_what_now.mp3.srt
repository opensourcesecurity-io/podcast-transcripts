Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,069
where we take your privacy and security seriously.

2
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:11,779
Episode 148.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,090
-- What?
-- No, we don't take anyone's privacy and security seriously. That is a lie.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:16,819
-- Yeah.
-- Well, yeah.

5
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:20,770
Yeah, actually that is, that is true and not just for us,

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,090
but for most people that say that

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,709
that's right. I will sell all of your data for any amount of money.

8
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:29,209
That's actually not true. That

9
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:31,780
and I guess in full disclosure, we,

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,599
we've been approached by various organizations asking to fund us and we're like,

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,939
-- no, we like being a hoes to everybody so you don't own
-- us.

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,470
It's not going to be worth the hassle

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,130
and then people are going to burn us on Twitter and rightly so,

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,319
so I guess the reason Kurt opened with that, which was unbeknownst to me is

15
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:52,630
we decided to do a show talking about

16
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,959
disclosure, disclosure of breaches and security incidents.

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,380
The thing that kicked this all off is there's a friend of

18
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:03,110
the show named Dave Hall who sent me some Twitter messages showing off

19
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:06,510
some breach notifications he got from a company called Canva

20
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:11,230
and I'll put some links in the show notes to the replies. But it's like, holy crap.

21
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,589
Don't let your marketing department write your, your,

22
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,669
your release about the security incident you just had.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,650
So, ok, well, why don't you tell us what happened at Canva? All right.

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,750
-- So,
-- from what I understand and I did some, a bit of research,

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,089
probably not as much as I could have,

26
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,089
but obviously there's just not a lot out there at this point either.

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,220
They had some sort of incident. They don't seem to exactly know what happened.

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,900
There were email addresses and passwords that were probably stolen.

29
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,650
And the first email they sent to people was basically like a nice

30
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,860
paragraph of marketing material before they told them what was going on.

31
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:45,730
And it's like what, I guess they, they did send a follow up email.

32
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,089
I give them points where they sent another

33
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,220
one that didn't have the marketing material,

34
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,739
-- but it's still a bit
-- fluffy.

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,900
It does seem a bit like, you know,

36
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,019
those companies that have their negative release on

37
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,459
Friday a minute after the stock market closes.

38
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,330
That's R A

39
00:01:59,620 --> 00:01:59,940
stick.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,730
Right. Right. And, and so anyway, but the point is I read this, I was like, holy cow.

41
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,709
This is crazy.

42
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,089
And then Kurt and I started talking and we were like,

43
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,070
we should talk about this because actually disclosing,

44
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,610
I guess terrible news really is what, what a security incident is,

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,460
-- is, is
-- hard and there's a second piece too.

46
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,949
It's not just disclosing this,

47
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,649
the breach of the incident and informing your customers and giving them, you know,

48
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,050
hopefully actionable advice,

49
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:29,850
but there's also steps and things that the provider should be doing.

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:30,600
Yeah.

51
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:32,690
And so I think, and, and I'm just going to read.

52
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,639
So they, they actually updated their website here.

53
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,330
Uh, update May 28th.

54
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,179
Our teams have been working around the clock to

55
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,250
investigate the attack and communicate with our customers.

56
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,229
Ok. That's good. I I'm ok with that.

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,009
Do that.

58
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,000
We are continuing to investigate and are being thorough and methodical with

59
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:48,960
our examination in order to understand all aspects of the incident.

60
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,399
Ok, so far the sentence is good. I like it

61
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,505
and provide the best advice to our customers.

62
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:56,464
We have also engaged forensic experts to investigate the incident. So

63
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:58,854
that falls down because the problem is they

64
00:02:58,964 --> 00:02:59,865
in their original email,

65
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,615
they basically say people should change their password at the site.

66
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:04,304
Right?

67
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,395
No, no, that's wrong. That is so very wrong.

68
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:10,544
No, you, you send out a password reset email to everybody

69
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,720
and you force them to change the passwords.

70
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:13,729
Like I just went through this,

71
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,399
I was trying to download a statement of my uh my retirement account,

72
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,600
whatever you know, from the company it's at and try to log in and it won't let me so.

73
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,970
Ok, it's like you haven't logged in for a long time, like reset your password.

74
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,070
Ok. It's been a while.

75
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:31,039
Can't reset my password because I forget my secret question answer.

76
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,759
So I phoned them up,

77
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,720
go through that whole song and dance, you know, blah, blah, blah.

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,839
And that's the correct thing to do

79
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,720
is, you know, you force people to change their passwords,

80
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,580
especially when you think they've, well, when you think when,

81
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,160
you know they've been breached, right?

82
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:48,149
And not only because here's the thing forcing them to change the

83
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,869
password number one is the right thing to do because like they're,

84
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,240
even if their password is salted and hashed and all of that stuff,

85
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,520
they may have used a weak password and more to the point, it's the right thing to do.

86
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,919
And their mail says they had

87
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,570
salted passwords that were hash with decrypt, which is, that's great. Do that

88
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:06,169
the correct way.

89
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:11,960
Right. But no, I, I agree if your hash gets out, even if you have a scary good password,

90
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,320
you should definitely change it just because it is one of those,

91
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,690
it's better to be safe than to be sorry, sort of incidents.

92
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,940
Well, more to the point.

93
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,839
Why not?

94
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,660
No, no, seriously, why not force users to change their password?

95
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,190
What possible reason is there

96
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,829
to not force users to change their password?

97
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,029
I, I can think of two reasons that they wouldn't do this.

98
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,630
Number one is it's going to be technically difficult for them

99
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,869
to add that feature to their system because it doesn't exist,

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,709
which if I had to guess, might be

101
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,399
-- reason
-- they must have a password reset feature.

102
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,160
They might have a password reset feature.

103
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,480
But do they have a password reset feature for all of the users?

104
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:50,820
Dude,

105
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,660
I don't care if you have to hire interns to

106
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,609
hit the website and manually do it or script it.

107
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:57,910
No, that's your responsibility as a provider.

108
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,959
I will not disagree with you, but I'm, this is just a potential excuse.

109
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,040
I'm not saying it's right.

110
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,350
Well,

111
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,630
more to the point you can script this up and add this as

112
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,329
a feature and write this as a feature in less than a day.

113
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,670
Well, those are famous last words.

114
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,690
But I think the second potential reason

115
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,059
is you have a user base that is potentially non technical

116
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:22,709
and you are concerned at their ability to change passwords.

117
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,290
Um I don't buy that. I'm sorry.

118
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,200
But if your users are so technically

119
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,540
incompetent that they can't change their password,

120
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:30,369
then how did they get on the internet?

121
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:31,959
I won't disagree with you.

122
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,809
I'm just saying those are two very weak excuses I can think of

123
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,500
and I can't think of any other good ones and those aren't good,

124
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,579
but they're at least something.

125
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,100
No, it's um

126
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,299
yeah,

127
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,670
so, so I guess here's what we should do.

128
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,149
Let's stop picking on these guys because having an

129
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,329
incident is really hard and it sucks and,

130
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:50,109
you know, good luck everybody involved.

131
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,239
We, we feel for you.

132
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,269
Well, and in fairness the good news is at least it was salted hashed passwords. And

133
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,929
one thing that drives me nuts is whenever people are, like,

134
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,390
email addresses were exposed.

135
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,100
I'm sorry, I can't get excited about that because it's an email address.

136
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:03,980
I agree.

137
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,559
-- I'm in the same boat
-- if it was your

138
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,579
birthday or your social security number or something.

139
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:07,910
Sure.

140
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,739
Yeah, then you can get annoyed and excited your email address,

141
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,100
something that by definition you're typically handing out and

142
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,859
giving. I, I mean, I get that. Ok. I get that.

143
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:18,500
In principle,

144
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,420
people should have control over their email address and who has access to it.

145
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,929
I agree with that in principle, but in reality,

146
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,630
that's not how the internet and the world works and

147
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,390
we need to stop pretending that it is that way.

148
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,170
I, I tend to agree. I'm not saying we shouldn't,

149
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,739
you know,

150
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,529
do things like GDPR and give users control and the right to forget realistically,

151
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,290
we, we need to build systems that take this into account,

152
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,529
right? This is like

153
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,459
I would compare it to having your phone number or address listed in the phone book.

154
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,929
Back when we had phone books.

155
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:49,160
It is, you could get it delisted.

156
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,440
But even if you delisted it,

157
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,019
it's really not a secret and it's probably not that hard to find.

158
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:54,859
And so

159
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,859
I, I agree with you.

160
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,579
I think pretending it's a secret when it's not,

161
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,540
is more dangerous than just admitting.

162
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:02,619
This thing is everywhere. It's like a bad rash deal with it.

163
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,059
Well, the reality is, you know,

164
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,946
something stops being a secret,

165
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:09,776
-- it stops being a secret.
-- Well, and you can never put it back. Right.

166
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:14,145
It's that old, like, I still love the old hacker saying information wants to be free

167
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:18,786
and it's so true. Once it's out, it's out, you can't undo it ever no matter what.

168
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:19,165
Right.

169
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:21,786
And then if you try, you usually end up with the Streisand effect,

170
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,946
which is even funnier than any other possible option.

171
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:25,855
But anyway, anyway,

172
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:27,295
I want us to take a step

173
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:27,992
back

174
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:31,671
and let's just talk about some of the kind of fundamental

175
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:35,872
I'll say best practices or reasonable steps one could take if

176
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,742
you find yourself in the middle of an incident because I know

177
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:42,951
I have been through more of these than I want to remember.

178
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:43,911
And

179
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:47,191
it's always hard because I guess the thing that always happens is

180
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:50,552
you learn about something has happened and then the question always becomes,

181
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,109
well, what do we do now? Like the first thing I, I, we always think of it.

182
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,750
How do we, how do we cover it up?

183
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,010
-- Well,
-- or for the, you know, one of the first arguments would be ok.

184
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,019
Something has happened.

185
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:03,750
Do we have anything actionable to tell people or is it just the buildings on fire?

186
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,309
Sure.

187
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,609
-- Yeah. Yeah, that, that's part of it.
-- Right.

188
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,940
And that's the first thing because,

189
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,350
and I see it both ways because part of me is part of me wants to say

190
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,769
full transparency, tell people sooner rather than later.

191
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,029
But the problem is if you're telling people

192
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,010
something and you don't give them actionable information,

193
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,950
you're just stressing them out and adding to their alarm fatigue.

194
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,200
-- So
-- you say that's your first step. But

195
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,700
you and I have been through this,

196
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,739
so we have a different view.

197
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,469
But if you take someone who maybe hasn't been through many incidents or any at all,

198
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,929
-- their first reaction isn't going to
-- be, it's going to be. Can we cover it up? Right.

199
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,859
How do, how do we hide it?

200
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:40,460
It's kind of like,

201
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,520
I remember when I took forklift training a million years ago

202
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,440
when I worked at the factory and they were like,

203
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,979
what's the first thing you do when you get in

204
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,010
with your forklift?

205
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,630
You know, you hit something and everyone's like, oh,

206
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,669
you call someone or you do this and he's like, no,

207
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,659
you look around to see if anyone noticed and they didn't, you drive away, right.

208
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,070
And we all laughed hysterically. But reality, that's what happens.

209
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,049
And this is the same thing here. Our, our first reaction is, do we have to tell anyone?

210
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,229
Is it that bad? Can we pretend it didn't happen?

211
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,070
And I, I will tell you now,

212
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,539
that is an easy question to ask and it can be very

213
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,950
easy to convince yourself it is the right thing to do.

214
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:17,650
But in almost 100% of situations it is going to end badly.

215
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,909
Well, more to the point,

216
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,840
not so much whether it's the right thing or the wrong thing to do,

217
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:23,150
but people think they can cover it up and get away with it.

218
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:25,090
Yeah, you're not going to get away with it.

219
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,520
You can't get away with it. It's someday

220
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,289
something is going to come out.

221
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,969
And if it's a, if you're a big enough popular enough company,

222
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,919
you, you cannot hide it.

223
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:36,799
If you're, if you're a little tiny no name company,

224
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,559
you might be able to get away with it for a while.

225
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,159
But even then I guarantee someday

226
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,789
someone's going to figure it out.

227
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,159
So assuming the company kind of wants to do the right thing,

228
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,109
it is a very challenging problem that sort of race between,

229
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:50,760
we know something bad happened, but we don't know exactly what, like

230
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:52,770
how much was exposed, what was exposed?

231
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,570
Was it a subset of the database or the whole database,

232
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,900
which databases and trying to figure that out

233
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:59,690
and balance that with telling people what happened?

234
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,320
Because you don't want to tell people every 15

235
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,549
minutes and give them an update every 15 minutes.

236
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,440
-- That's, that's kind of useless. It
-- is completely useless.

237
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,169
I would, I would say here's

238
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,320
my advice.

239
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,270
Always in a situation like this is like very

240
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,479
hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy step one is,

241
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,380
don't panic.

242
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:16,719
Well, that'll only make it worse.

243
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,830
-- Uh, Right.
-- Right. You end up like, doing something dumb

244
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,969
and it's not that you meant to, it's just,

245
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:24,440
you weren't quite thinking because your head isn't in the right place

246
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:27,719
and you make mistakes and you can often make things worse.

247
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:30,169
-- You can always make things worse. Right.
-- Right.

248
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,090
You end up with like, oh, I'll shut that machine down.

249
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,369
But now the rest of your infrastructure is failing because, like,

250
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,710
it needs that machine or something

251
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,830
or the evidence you need, it is gone.

252
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,750
Yep. Yep. That happens a lot too. And we'll get to evidence that that'll come later.

253
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,549
But no, I, I think don't panic is really kind of step number one.

254
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,109
And it, it's, it's easy to say,

255
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:52,969
but it's hard to do because I've seen so many people make so many mistakes.

256
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,710
-- Well, that's human nature. Right. We make mistakes.
-- Right. Right. Yep. Exactly.

257
00:10:56,719 --> 00:11:00,530
And then kind of my step two is always, let's assume the worst. Right.

258
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:03,210
Let's start at the worst and work, walk our way back.

259
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:07,710
Don't start at the best and walk your way forward because it is very easy to

260
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:11,794
protect and something isn't a problem or to miss a minor detail if you're saying.

261
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,684
All right, let's assume they don't have anything.

262
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:16,994
Let's try to figure out what they got versus, let's assume they have everything.

263
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:19,395
Let's try to figure out if they didn't get something.

264
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,715
And, well, and the reality too is most

265
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:26,755
providers and most, most infrastructure is not set up with

266
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:28,955
having an incident in mind.

267
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,270
Right. How many places get robbed? And then they're like, yeah, we have cameras.

268
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,159
Oh, wait,

269
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,859
we had to put tapes in the machine.

270
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,590
Ok. And this shows how old we are,

271
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,320
um, or, well, not tapes in the machine but, oh, you know, the system was broken, or

272
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,619
one thing I've really noticed is the difference between, like, modern,

273
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,820
like, I was at a gas station

274
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,015
a few months ago

275
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:53,094
and I happened to notice their security cameras covering like the gassing up area,

276
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:56,135
the resolution on them was insanely great.

277
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:59,265
Like you could read on the license plate, not just the number of the license plate

278
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,354
you could see the year of the expiry take

279
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,304
and that's like a, you know, that's like less,

280
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:06,054
that's about two centimeters or less high text.

281
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,760
Uh You could really see people's faces and it took like kind of that.

282
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,859
It didn't take continuous video.

283
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,909
It took like a kind of like an image every second or two.

284
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:17,590
But like, man, I, you know, this is not the station you want to gas and run up.

285
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:20,099
Their, their video quality was seriously great.

286
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:21,260
Conversely, you know,

287
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:24,409
I've seen a lot of other gas stations where the video quality is,

288
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:24,809
you know,

289
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,469
something that was like VHS recorded and coded and shoved on to youtube and

290
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:33,159
then somebody recorded it on their iphone in like landscape mode and then like,

291
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:36,349
you know, just it got mangled and most computer infrastructure,

292
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:39,299
most people barely have good logs, let alone,

293
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:45,599
-- what's the word I want to say? Like, forensically acceptable logs,
-- nobody has

294
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,429
forensically acceptable logs.

295
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,309
I think there are very few organizations that have that and,

296
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,390
and a lot of them probably don't need it

297
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,780
either. And I think

298
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,590
that this is one of those challenges I always see is you have to

299
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:00,590
draw a line somewhere between good enough and like getting your work done.

300
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,109
And I think

301
00:13:02,219 --> 00:13:07,609
security people, what I see too often is they go into perfect mode

302
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,369
and then everyone else says this person is nuts and I'm

303
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,489
not going to listen to them and then they just do nothing

304
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,210
instead of kind of again, starting at eight. This is the minimum we need.

305
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:23,190
-- Let's at least try to do this.
-- These complex systems require a lot of care and feeding

306
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,570
-- unfortunately. Well,
-- a great example, Pixar, right?

307
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,450
They almost lost toy story, the original movie.

308
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,479
-- The second one, it was the second one. Was
-- it the second one? Ok. Sorry,

309
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,450
it was the second one.

310
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,580
They almost lost it because I forget what

311
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,179
somebody like deleted the file structure in production.

312
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,890
-- So
-- somebody was cleaning up temporary files

313
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,609
and they basically accidentally like RM dash RF

314
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,739
the disc.

315
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:43,340
And

316
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,659
by the time they realized what had happened

317
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,630
and they stopped it,

318
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,159
-- a nontrivial amount of the movie was gone
-- and

319
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,349
then they found their backup infrastructure wasn't working.

320
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,130
As expected.

321
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,150
And the only reason they saved it was

322
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,390
one of their animation directors or something was

323
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,679
pregnant and had a workstation at home with a recent copy of all the data,

324
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,469
which is

325
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,679
crazy. Lucky.

326
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:05,640
-- I
-- just, I can't imagine the amount of lost man hours and,

327
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,030
and women hours and time and effort

328
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,090
if you like nuke AC G I film like two thirds of the way through there.

329
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:17,250
Yeah, that's when you, there's a lot of people looking for a new job after that.

330
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,830
I mean, that, that's how that ends, end of story.

331
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,849
And again, I mean, this kind of comes back to some of the, the resiliency of backups.

332
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:24,580
Well, and,

333
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,229
and backups. We've been, we've known about backups for a good 5060 years

334
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:29,530
and we still suck at them.

335
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,969
You know, when the last time anybody here restored a backup to see if it worked.

336
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:35,369
I do it occasionally for fun because I'm

337
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,094
weirdo, but I don't do the whole thing, but I also use cloud backups because I,

338
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:42,544
I got rid of all my hard drives and tapes and stuff because they're very unreliable.

339
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:46,294
-- And if your os burns down, you're still up the creek.
-- That's right. Well,

340
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:47,715
I had a complicated system.

341
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:48,534
I wouldn't be,

342
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:51,554
but we'll say I'm happier with the cloud because

343
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,164
I don't have to think about it very often

344
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,934
and then every now and then I will

345
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:57,635
-- restore some files and
-- there's that maintenance piece.

346
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:01,614
-- Right. Yes,
-- exactly. You know, it, it's expensive and time consuming. Yeah.

347
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,075
Right.

348
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:02,455
Right.

349
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:06,590
So, so anyway, anyway, let's keep talking about in instance.

350
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,599
So let's assume

351
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,739
you've decided to do the right thing.

352
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,219
You kind of started at the beginning or, I guess at the worst possible place,

353
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,330
you've walked yourself back a little bit, you've collected a little bit,

354
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,590
little bit of evidence and now, you know, you have to tell.

355
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,030
Oh, no, no, I'm, I'm gonna have to disagree with you politely.

356
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,109
You used the term you've collected some evidence?

357
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,590
Yes, that's true. We did not collect evidence.

358
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,380
-- You have not collected evidence.
-- That's true.

359
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,659
-- If I put my, at best,
-- you have some random

360
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,070
files. If I put my

361
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,669
hand on evidence is a very specific thing. And

362
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,000
unless you are literally a forensic,

363
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,520
even ignoring the lawyer hat that the quality and the

364
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,500
content of stuff I've seen people do is so laughable.

365
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,390
Right. Right. And, and that's, we'll get to that. But basically,

366
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,400
unless your job is forensics,

367
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,479
you are almost certainly unqualified to collect evidence

368
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:56,080
and

369
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,119
some people don't understand that either, but we'll get to that a little bit.

370
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:03,280
So anyway, anyway, let's assume it's time to tell the world.

371
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:04,849
What do you tell them?

372
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:05,039
Well,

373
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,440
I would back up a step actually and say one of the first things

374
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,679
you need to do is are you going to bring in outside help?

375
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,789
Are you going to call the FBI? Are you going to call the police.

376
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,359
Are you going to call a private firm?

377
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:14,599
And the answer,

378
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:17,739
I think outside of there's a handful of organizations

379
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,020
that have the competency internally to do this.

380
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,599
But they're very rare.

381
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,520
Generally speaking, you're going to need to go hire somebody who, you know,

382
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,520
probably has some obscenely high consulting contracting rates.

383
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:30,820
And I'm sorry,

384
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,559
but that's how that is if you actually want to do this properly because

385
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,289
the reality is like you and me have been doing this for over 20 years

386
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,859
and if you said Kurt,

387
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,140
somebody has done something on your computer

388
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,989
and you need to image your computer

389
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,520
and figure it out, I would say, ok, right off the bat.

390
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,869
I know that I cannot safely image my computer because I don't have a right blocker.

391
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,169
Like I don't have a physical right blocker to take the disk out,

392
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,109
put it in the right blocker and image the disk and copy

393
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,770
it and read it only and not write anything to it.

394
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,890
Like I know enough about this to know that

395
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:05,130
I,

396
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,979
I can't even get step one which is making a copy of the data and also

397
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:12,060
smart enough to know that I need to make a copy of the data to work on

398
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,780
-- the original.
-- You don't know what you don't know. Added.

399
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,400
Yeah, exactly.

400
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,760
And, and so let's, let's pretend we're not worried about outside help just yet.

401
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,180
Right?

402
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,380
Or maybe at all because let's face it in many instances,

403
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,140
you're going to have an incident and you're not going to call on

404
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,089
the FBI or police or something to press charges,

405
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,890
you're just going to clean up the mess and move on.

406
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,369
Well, especially not with a breach.

407
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:36,260
So anyway, let's talk about communicating to the world,

408
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,699
right? How do you decide what to tell them?

409
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,270
What, what is an acceptable amount of information?

410
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,109
What do you, and don't you tell them that happened?

411
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,630
And I think that's one of the hardest decisions to make.

412
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,790
One thing I would say is you want to

413
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,390
tell them things

414
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,619
and not tell them about the absence of things. I'm, I'm going to go with one of my

415
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,219
favorite examples.

416
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,739
A non-financial database

417
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,489
right now. If anybody Googles that they'll know who I'm talking about.

418
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,339
But fundamentally

419
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,880
what's a non-financial database?

420
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,890
I've never heard, I've never heard that term before. I, I have no idea

421
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:13,160
by definition what a non-financial database is. If you think about set theory,

422
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,589
it's everything except for this tiny little circle of financial databases,

423
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,949
that's probably what it is.

424
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,430
And as it turns out it was, it was bad but not as bad as it if you're

425
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,385
of thinking about it, like, oh my God, what could this be like worst case scenario?

426
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,206
OK. It's not financial database but what could it be? That was really bad.

427
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:33,566
-- So
-- I would, I would argue that's a bad term to use because it creates ambiguity,

428
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:34,005
right?

429
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:35,105
Well, and that's what I say.

430
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,365
You tell people things, you don't tell them about the absence of things.

431
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,485
-- Yes,
-- that's fair. I agree with that.

432
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:43,255
Well, unless it's something like you can say, like for the sake of argument,

433
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:45,426
let's say you actually do have a database with really good

434
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:47,822
production logging to a remote system that can't be tampered with.

435
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:50,552
And you can say conclusively that for example,

436
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:53,192
the attacker got access to your email addresses

437
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,281
but not to your hashed passwords. Right?

438
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,352
Then you should say that, then you should say categorically, you know,

439
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:01,501
the attacker got access to your emails but not to your hashed passwords.

440
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:01,802
But we,

441
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,421
you know, and I would still in that case

442
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:05,592
because me being me, I would still be like,

443
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,592
and you're still going to have to reset that password, right?

444
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:08,212
You are,

445
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:09,442
you know, because,

446
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:10,342
um,

447
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:12,979
you know, when I go in public and I come home,

448
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:17,469
-- I still wash my hands even if I didn't touch anything weird,
-- I agree with that 100%.

449
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:18,469
And

450
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:20,390
I, I feel like

451
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,060
when you see a term like non financial database

452
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:27,099
that reeks of lawyers to me.

453
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,260
And my advice always for security people writing these sort of releases is

454
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,170
don't let marketing write it.

455
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,880
-- The security team needs to write it.
-- Don't let marketing initiate it.

456
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,670
-- Maybe marketing can, they, they
-- can review it.

457
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,329
Don't let the lawyers write it. The security team needs to write it

458
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:47,170
and then you let the lawyers and the marketing team and

459
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,500
whoever else might need to review and sign off on it,

460
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,939
you let them review it but you cannot let them write it because if you do,

461
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:55,430
you end up with terms that don't make sense.

462
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:55,959
-- Well,
-- and,

463
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,260
and it's really clear to anybody in the industry and

464
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,569
even to people who are not in the industry,

465
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:03,520
it just reeks of something that was written to write, shift blame and guilt

466
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,270
and, and that's part of it too. I mean, blame is important.

467
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:10,180
Sometimes you're done, screwed up and you need to eat that sandwich

468
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:10,839
and

469
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,599
you just do it right because here's the thing,

470
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,319
you're better off to be as open

471
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,589
and blame yourself as much as you can at the very beginning

472
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,770
because people are going to be far more forgiving at

473
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,790
that point than in six months when you're like,

474
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,160
oh, and by the way, actually, this is what happened,

475
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,359
we basically lied to you before.

476
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,479
That's when people get really mad.

477
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:33,780
-- I think
-- Leonard French, you know, he's the famous copyright attorney on youtube.

478
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,000
I think he said it best. And it's basically to,

479
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,780
it's,

480
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,599
if you have to eat crow, it's best to eat the crow while it's young and tender.

481
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:42,699
Not when it's old and tough.

482
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,119
That's a good comment. I like that,

483
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,560
you know, and I don't think he created that, but that's where I first heard it.

484
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,920
And I'm like, yeah, like if you have to

485
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:52,719
own up to something.

486
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,420
Yeah,

487
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:59,000
people are going to be much happier that you owned up to it sooner rather than later.

488
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,680
You know. It's like, well, think about kids. Right. Kids do something

489
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,729
and if they own up to it, ok.

490
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:06,839
Yeah, it's still gonna suck for you. But,

491
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,250
you know, if they hide it,

492
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,550
you know, then, then, then there's the, the,

493
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,349
the aspect of what did they intentionally lie about this, which,

494
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,410
you know, now you've committed two crimes,

495
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:17,760
so to

496
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,869
speak. Exactly.

497
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,250
You know,

498
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,910
I get why these places do end up with

499
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,229
marketing and lawyers writing these things because again,

500
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:27,140
they want to make sure, you know, they want to avoid liability

501
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,119
and I get that right. Like avoiding liability.

502
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,780
That's, that's a very fundamental human thing.

503
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,380
You know, we all want to avoid liability.

504
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,530
-- The,
-- the other thing,

505
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,209
here's a really important thing that happens in these incidents also is

506
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,810
lawyers are used to dealing with weird stuff

507
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,030
and so a lawyer can show up and seem like they

508
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,829
know what they're talking about and to a degree they do,

509
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,099
but they're still not the right people to write your public statements

510
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,630
because they're lawyers

511
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,604
-- unless you magically happen to have a technical lawyer on staff
-- and,

512
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:00,234
and they exist and they're awesome

513
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:03,755
and their hourly rate is even more obscene than the forensics.

514
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:05,905
-- 70
-- bazillion dollars.

515
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,435
Well, and one thing I would say too is you need to pick,

516
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:12,275
I would say two communication channels at a minimum.

517
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:13,494
And that would be ideally

518
00:22:13,724 --> 00:22:15,385
some form of push communication,

519
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:19,364
be it email or text message or whatever way you have to push to these people.

520
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,459
And number two, you need, you want to have a web page, either

521
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,579
status sites or like if you have a security status site

522
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,650
-- and
-- that's exactly the right way to deal with it is you have one,

523
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,140
push you annoy people once and then you give them a place that if they care,

524
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,719
they can go and look to understand what's

525
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,560
happening as things unfold because things often unfold

526
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,260
and I would encourage you to update your status

527
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:44,449
at least once a day.

528
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:47,890
-- Just so, I mean, depending upon many things, just so
-- people know it's being updated,

529
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,069
right?

530
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,010
And they know you're doing something, right?

531
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,969
It's not like do they even care?

532
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,410
I would actually disagree slightly with the one push I would there,

533
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,099
there must be at least one push.

534
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,520
And I would say actually you can have more pushes if

535
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,069
something really actionable or really important kind of comes out like,

536
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,689
you know, for example,

537
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:06,689
oh,

538
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,530
they also accessed

539
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,380
X or Y or Z or oh,

540
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,329
we actually have a specific technical step you can take to protect yourself.

541
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:19,619
Oh And by the way, offering people the cheaper credit monitoring for a year or three,

542
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,260
right?

543
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:25,359
-- Man, that makes me angry. I
-- have never reclaimed that once and I've heard of so many,

544
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,719
these companies getting broken into themselves.

545
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:32,790
-- It's almost certainly not
-- good, famous fun story. You know, um,

546
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,280
Equifax, remember they

547
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:36,150
was it Equifax after their breach?

548
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,719
They were trying to Upsell people on the credit

549
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:39,520
monitoring when they were giving the quote unquote,

550
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,609
free credit monitoring away.

551
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:41,050
Right.

552
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:41,390
That's

553
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:41,770
right.

554
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:42,810
Good job.

555
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,599
You know, I don't know if you can hear my deep sigh there but there was a very deep sigh.

556
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:47,939
I, yeah, anyway,

557
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:51,030
this stuff is hard. It is never fun.

558
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:55,630
-- And
-- that leads to one really complicated thing is, should you, then

559
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,729
I guess, offer support and help to these people be on just a web page.

560
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:03,270
Like, should you actually have them be able to email you chat at you or, or

561
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,550
phone you

562
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,640
to get assistance in some way, for example, with changing their password?

563
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:13,040
I, I think for what it's worth if you do your job. Right.

564
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:14,849
The answer should be no,

565
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,290
because you should be able to

566
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,050
enable or disable whatever technical controls you need.

567
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,520
You should be able to communicate concisely what has happened.

568
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:27,890
And yeah, if they need to change your password, like it's like you said, if, if,

569
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,479
if you don't know how to change your password, you know,

570
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:30,689
how did you get on the internet?

571
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,040
And

572
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,079
II, I feel like if you need to follow up with people individually,

573
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:40,079
you probably have done something terribly wrong

574
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:43,619
along the way. And that should not be the outcome.

575
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,280
Well, there are breaches and incidents where, you know that.

576
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,130
Well, Mount Gox is a great example of a place where, you know, a

577
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,535
lot of people lost a lot of money and they just fold it up and walked away, you know,

578
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,864
technically, probably what should have happened.

579
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,744
Well, this assumes Mount Gox was one properly, so it wouldn't happen in the

580
00:24:58,844 --> 00:24:59,375
first place.

581
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:00,665
Kind of a bad example.

582
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:03,915
So there are breaches and incidents that are sort of how do I put,

583
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:08,295
they're kind of high value, but there could be this level of hand holding.

584
00:25:08,484 --> 00:25:10,625
Um, you know, and because when I heard Equifax was, you know,

585
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,494
setting up phone lines so people could call them and figure out what happened

586
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:15,949
that that's just going to be a disaster right there

587
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:18,800
because so many people were affected by the Equifax breach,

588
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,069
even if like 1/10 of 1% called them in the first week,

589
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,390
that would have still been

590
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,609
hundreds of thousands of phone calls.

591
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,760
I don't know anybody that can set up a call

592
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,170
center to handle that kind of volume anytime soon.

593
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,619
Right. Again, I go back to, I think

594
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,890
there can be situations where it makes sense to do some

595
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,729
sort of hand holding for a certain subset of your customers.

596
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,030
But I think in general

597
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,770
you need to make sure you don't have to do that because that's just going to

598
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,349
-- put you in a worse place than you were in when it all started
-- well,

599
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:51,239
and it's probably not going to work and customers are going to be on hold for 10 hours,

600
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,010
-- you know. So, it's just, it's going to make things worse.
-- Exactly.

601
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,010
And, and I guess you just hit on

602
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,010
the thing that is most important, I think is

603
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:02,010
when you have an incident of any sort,

604
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,699
I think the thing you need to always keep in mind is

605
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,849
don't make it worse for your customers. Right.

606
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,089
You can make it worse for yourself maybe along the way.

607
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:13,930
But your real goal is don't make it worse for them. Right.

608
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,609
Because something has already happened that is potentially your

609
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:19,800
fault and your intent is to clean up the mess

610
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,810
and make sure you don't make their lives

611
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:23,770
more terrible than you've already made them.

612
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,030
And I think that is where a lot of this falls

613
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,449
apart because I think a lot of organizations worry about protecting themselves

614
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:33,270
as opposed to protecting their customers if you work for a company

615
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,630
that's more worried about itself than it is about the customers.

616
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,479
I have a suspicion that company is not going to be around for a real long time.

617
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,229
Uh, well, I'll disagree with you there because there's lots of,

618
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,849
plenty of evil companies out there.

619
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,410
But I was gonna say, um,

620
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,170
the reality is for most of these security incidents and breaches that

621
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,604
the, the stress and the hassle and all that, that stuff that you're, you know,

622
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:55,175
you can dump on, you can dump it on to your customers and it's an externalized cost

623
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,974
and they can't do anything to recover it from you so

624
00:26:58,104 --> 00:26:58,425
bad.

625
00:26:59,145 --> 00:27:01,505
I mean, a great example is like this, oh, you know,

626
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:04,224
free credit monitoring for a year or two or three.

627
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,385
no. How about you mail me a check for 50 bucks

628
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:08,265
and let me decide what to do with it.

629
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:11,224
-- And of course, no company is going to do that if they have a breach.
-- Right.

630
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:14,545
Well, in, in the right answer is to freeze your credit because

631
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,224
the credit monitoring,

632
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:19,709
yeah, your, your data could be out for five years before someone uses it.

633
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:23,930
You don't know. I mean, and even then the, the credit monitoring is isn't very good.

634
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,770
Well, again, it requires the user to take additional active steps and do.

635
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,160
It's one more thing they got to do in life and not forget to do and blah, blah, blah,

636
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:36,430
dude, I don't check my credit report for weird stuff.

637
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,050
I've done it like twice in my life.

638
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,920
I hear you. I hear you.

639
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:43,084
So let's, let's wrap this one up. We've got what, what does our advice look like?

640
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,974
We've got uh don't panic, which is always great advice.

641
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,484
Be honest

642
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,734
and ideally be honest

643
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,694
in ways that are actionable,

644
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:53,974
you know, try, try to,

645
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:58,425
it's, it's better to help people than to just let them know that their house is on fire

646
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:01,375
-- and show up with a bucket of water.
-- I agree with that. I like that.

647
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:03,494
And, and I think the one thing we didn't really talk about

648
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,420
is if you need help from law enforcement or someone like that,

649
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:09,739
get them involved early and don't mess with the

650
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,939
-- evidence because you're going to screw it up
-- well,

651
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:18,640
or hire a firm that is certified in your jurisdiction to do this kind of work.

652
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:18,920
Right.

653
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,489
That's fair. That's fair

654
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,829
and important words,

655
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,859
certified in your jurisdiction because the laws and rules of evidence vary

656
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:30,364
-- significantly in some cases
-- and it's hard and even if you think,

657
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,905
you know what they are, you probably don't.

658
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:32,905
So there you go.

659
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,925
-- Well,
-- I don't even want to think about like all my stuff in Amazon, East Coast.

660
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:38,074
I don't even know what state it's in.

661
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,464
I think it's Virginia and some of it's in California.

662
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:45,064
-- So like, so I don't even know which jurisdictions apply at this point. Nobody
-- does.

663
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:45,574
Fine.

664
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:47,625
That's true. Right.

665
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:48,415
So, yeah,

666
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:50,584
but yeah, hire some outside help

667
00:28:50,785 --> 00:28:51,984
because if nothing else,

668
