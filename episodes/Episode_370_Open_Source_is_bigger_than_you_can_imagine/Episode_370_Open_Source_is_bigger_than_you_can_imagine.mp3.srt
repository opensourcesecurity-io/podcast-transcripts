Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,930
Kurt Siefried and my partner in looking suspiciously at packages.

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:12,409
Josh

3
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:13,060
reser.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,970
Why are you looking suspiciously at packages?

5
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,680
Because for example, I, you know,

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,760
I go to pi pie and I type in a search term and I

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,360
get a whole bunch of results of which some look a bit dodgy.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,610
Some are horrifically out of date.

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,329
You know, I haven't been updated in five or 10 years. Some

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,840
are like really 0.0 0.2 and you know, hopefully the big one with lots of poll is legit

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,540
because how else do I assume? Like, how else do I tell which package is quality?

12
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,310
And I literally just which ones was downloaded the most times.

13
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:48,270
So when you said packages in my mind, I was thinking like stuff delivered to my house.

14
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:48,860
Not,

15
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,729
-- not those
-- kind of

16
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,009
that stuff open it,

17
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:51,729
it's fine.

18
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:55,310
Yes, it's perfectly fine. There could be nothing bad in it.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,979
-- Hey,
-- well, like I got my flipper zero. This thing is sweet.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,470
Oh, you did get one. I still

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,319
haven't ordered one I

22
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:00,560
need.

23
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,180
There's talk of making them illegal because

24
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,319
well,

25
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,010
you know,

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,830
aren't,

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,779
I think all the,

28
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:07,019
all the designs are open

29
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,910
source. I could probably just make my own.

30
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,169
Yeah.

31
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,220
But do you want to do that or do you just want to fork over some money and have it show up?

32
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,300
-- I
-- love making stuff. It's very exciting.

33
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:14,919
I'm

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:15,580
ok.

35
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,500
But the thing is, this thing has such a nice physical

36
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:20,730
and

37
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:21,919
-- well, look,
-- yes.

38
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,849
If I make it,

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,150
it's going to be a giant 3d printed brick thing that's going

40
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,449
to be hideous and cut you if you hold it wrong.

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,150
But that's ok.

42
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:34,639
This is just so nice, like the way, like the way it fits in my hand and you know, oh man,

43
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:35,419
I know,

44
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:35,660
I

45
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,940
know.

46
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:36,690
Anyway,

47
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,879
-- anyway,
-- so what

48
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,889
actually, well, not pipe. We should talk about N PM packages.

49
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,250
I want to start with N PM. And the reason I want to start with N PM

50
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,040
is

51
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:49,400
I have been talking about the N PM data I've collected for like

52
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,550
more than a year now, probably almost two years.

53
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,260
And I finally just wrote a blog post that goes

54
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,319
into some of the detail of some of the data.

55
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:00,660
And it was published on Anchor's blog because that's where I wanted to put it.

56
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:01,639
And

57
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:05,379
it is horrifying and beautiful at the same time.

58
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,839
And so I think it's absolutely lovely.

59
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,279
And then the second half of this is like literally the day after I published my blog,

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,800
there is a research paper that comes out from the Sandworm dot Dev folks

61
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,350
that basically say half of the new N PM packages are Seo spam,

62
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,779
which Seo is search engine optimization.

63
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:29,039
And I was like this is

64
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,350
poetry

65
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,649
well and and Seo spam is a lot worse than people realize

66
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,970
like a perfect example is we use that circle platform from higher logic

67
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,729
and you can sign up and basically it's linkedin think of it

68
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,690
as linkedin combined to a bit with Facebook for business and stuff,

69
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,750
you know, for serious business.

70
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,289
Anyways, the point is you sign in you create an account

71
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,050
and you can create your profile and have links in your profile

72
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,889
and

73
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,979
you know, and you can post discussions and stuff

74
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,820
and we got hammered with spam and of course, I immediately was like,

75
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:00,070
ah

76
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,520
you know,

77
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,910
and I go dig around the settings and there's a couple of settings to help like,

78
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,050
you know, require first time post moderated

79
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,630
and then after that, let them post, you know, the usual kind of anti spam stuff.

80
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,889
But what's interesting is about four or five days later,

81
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,789
we got an email from from higher logic saying essentially like

82
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:16,820
we're sorry, we've had to change some defaults,

83
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,139
like basically reading between the lines,

84
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:23,070
all the higher logic customers got nailed by this big time.

85
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:23,949
Um you know,

86
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,910
thousands of accounts being created thousands of comments for for backlin span,

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,619
right? So that's the thing like these Attackers.

88
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,320
What happens is they find something that works,

89
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,179
you know, they find some site that juices their seo

90
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,470
and

91
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,860
-- they come through like a, a herd of wildebeest.
-- Oh, yeah.

92
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:44,710
Yeah, I remember probably a decade ago now.

93
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,350
I ran a,

94
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,589
what is, is it media wiki, wikimedia, whatever the Wikipedia wiki is. Right.

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,710
I ran that

96
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,449
and I had no

97
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,000
authentication on it because obviously being a public wiki,

98
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,960
I wanted everyone to edit it and, yeah, one day,

99
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,320
like some seo spammers got a hold of it and I shut it down

100
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,460
at the end of the day because at first I tried to save it.

101
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,330
-- I'm like, you know what it's over like I
-- lose.

102
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,830
-- No, you just have to burn it with fire
-- because I couldn't even clean it up.

103
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,520
I didn't have a good backup that was worth using

104
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:15,970
and there,

105
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,589
there was so much garbage and I was too dumb to figure out

106
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,910
how to just basically say like delete every transaction that's happened today.

107
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,950
And I was like, you know what I'm done like this is it, I'm out and I gave up anyway. OK?

108
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,190
Before we, before we go down that rat hole,

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,429
I want to talk about my N PM blog post because I think it's, it's very exciting.

110
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,269
So I titled it Open Source is bigger than you can imagine.

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,950
And the reason I did that is because

112
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,899
I have talked to an enormous number of people

113
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:45,690
over the last couple of years. About open source software.

114
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,109
And there are enormous perception problems around open source, I think.

115
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:55,890
And it's generally on one hand, no one realizes how just completely gigantic it is.

116
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,190
You know, what really sort of interrupt.

117
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,010
But what really blows my mind is we had the log for J event we had the the Dutch,

118
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:04,519
forgive me, I can never remember the name of their service.

119
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,290
And with that sorry, massive github

120
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,119
list of affected products.

121
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:10,589
Like

122
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,309
I know the plural of one data point is not

123
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:14,309
data,

124
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,390
but that log for Jay is a compelling data point that says,

125
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,170
yeah,

126
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:22,470
-- open source is everywhere and
-- II I cover that

127
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,779
and that was one package

128
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,350
of one language ecosystem being Java which is kind of the boring corporate one

129
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,109
and

130
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:32,290
like, yeah PHP Python, all of those are just the same now

131
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:37,980
-- like it's everywhere.
-- So I cover this in the post I call log for Jr Kaiser Soze

132
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,570
moment

133
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:40,820
which if you've never seen Usual Suspects,

134
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,850
I'm just going to spoil the crap out of it for you.

135
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,170
So too bad. You should have seen it.

136
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,940
But basically at the end, yeah, when,

137
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,190
when the detective is looking around the room and he

138
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,279
sees like all the things that the the story was about

139
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,049
and he's like, oh crap like this dude was Kaiser. So

140
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:58,309
like, oh my goodness, like the phone calls are coming from inside the house

141
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,760
and that's what

142
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,410
it was funny too because as someone I work

143
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:04,670
yelled at me. They were like, no one young knows what Kaiser Soze

144
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,809
means. I'm like, I don't even care like

145
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,079
they can look it up. It's too good not to use.

146
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:14,140
But anyway, anyway, so there's the enormity of the size of open source.

147
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:17,350
Does that make sense? The enormity of the size? There's the enormity of the size.

148
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,279
I'm just going with this.

149
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:23,779
Then the other piece of it that is not understood is how much of this is

150
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,679
one person or as you're going to say just now is less than one person.

151
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,700
Because technically,

152
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,179
yes, technically correct is the best kind of correct. We all know.

153
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:37,559
But you get the idea most open source like and this is true of literally everything.

154
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,464
This isn't like just N PM isn't just like crappy little packages

155
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:46,654
every way I have tried to slice and dice this data to prove myself wrong has failed.

156
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:51,295
Open source is predominantly one person doing something

157
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,734
-- and
-- well,

158
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:53,595
-- but
-- no, I'm serious.

159
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:56,855
Do you know how hard it is to convince another human being to have a sandwich,

160
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:58,295
let alone to write software?

161
00:06:58,575 --> 00:06:59,674
But here's the thing,

162
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:02,845
the perception of everyone you talk to

163
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,809
is that open source is this gigantic,

164
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,809
healthy community where there's lots of people doing lots of work.

165
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,450
It's survivor bias because

166
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,170
the projects,

167
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,809
the kind of projects that you're using

168
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:16,709
are things like

169
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,190
Cooper Nets

170
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,649
-- and a patchy blank.
-- That's right. And those get the attention

171
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,010
but,

172
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,410
but worse you're looking at the pier and ignoring all the stuff underneath of it.

173
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:28,463
That's right. Exactly. 100%.

174
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:31,222
Here's what I want to describe this as because I was talking to

175
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:34,553
someone about it and the XK CD Comic of course comes up.

176
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:35,393
But here's the thing,

177
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:40,143
the XK CD comic is wrong because it shows one package holding things up.

178
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:44,092
The reality is the XK CD Comic is a beautiful tower

179
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:49,752
standing on top of 10,000 single maintainer packages all stacked on top

180
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:53,476
of each other three miles into the sky.

181
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:55,355
And it's teetering there.

182
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:57,805
That is the reality of open source.

183
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:01,015
It is not the XK CD comic because that gives a

184
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:05,186
hint of it only being one thing instead of literally everything.

185
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:08,566
Well and, and the thing is though you can remove some of the packages,

186
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,835
you can live without fine, like no big deal

187
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:13,045
and some of them, if you remove them from

188
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:13,226
a, a

189
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,940
the dependency chain, everything just horrifically breaks.

190
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,730
I don't think you can say some of them you can live without,

191
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,950
-- I think
-- well or rather you can live without them in the

192
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,579
sense of it'll degrade but not to the point where it breaks.

193
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,179
I don't know how true that is.

194
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,029
I think the vast majority of people let's, and again,

195
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,390
I'm picking on N PM because it's very popular and their data is very good.

196
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,219
But I have looked at this data in the Python ecosystem in the

197
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:39,443
ecosystems. And they're very similar like this M PM is not special.

198
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:43,414
Well, but that's the first thing people say is they say, oh

199
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:47,883
N PM is special. For some reason, Python will be completely different.

200
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,963
Every time I talk to people about this, they create

201
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,924
mental gymnastics to justify why this is not how all of open source works.

202
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,153
And I'm saying I am

203
00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:58,794
very confident

204
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:04,229
-- this is open source. This is not special.
-- Here's a perfect example. Curl on github.

205
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:04,469
Uh

206
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,659
We got,

207
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,859
wow. Yeah, we got Daniel with 17,223 commits.

208
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,140
Then the next person is 2586 commits.

209
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:17,489
-- Then 1911 100 it's going
-- to be a typical power distribution curve.

210
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:17,979
It's

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,419
a really steep power

212
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,299
distribution curve.

213
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:23,219
Like by the time we get to number five,

214
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,739
we're at 659 commits by the time we get to the bottom,

215
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,039
like to number like number 30 is 24.

216
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,260
I'm not surprised

217
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,859
that is a vertical wall that is open

218
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,479
source, Kurt.

219
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,809
And that's what I'm saying.

220
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,859
It's like curl is easily one of the most popular, widely used things on the planet.

221
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,640
And to put it bluntly,

222
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,719
if he didn't get any contributions from anybody

223
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,049
that would be like looking at the numbers here. OK.

224
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,369
Well, this one person actually did do a lot.

225
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,210
But if you basically, if the top four contributors to curl

226
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,950
did all the work and everybody else went away, we probably wouldn't notice.

227
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,979
But that's, that's how all of this works.

228
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,119
And, but that's true for almost all projects, except for maybe the Linux kernel,

229
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,739
that one.

230
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,169
Linux

231
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,340
has really scaled sideways quite well.

232
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:10,380
-- I think about that one a lot.
-- But also the kernel is special in that.

233
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,890
Like I can write an Ethernet subsystem and it has no

234
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,659
bearing in relation to your sound card or your whatever.

235
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,960
And I think that's one thing that makes the Linux kernel special is

236
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,723
it is so massive. It's like city sized, but they're also

237
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,403
in some ways, although they're tightly coupled obviously because it's the kernel.

238
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:28,283
But like, yeah, I mean,

239
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:29,872
I can do whatever I want my Ethernet driver

240
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:31,533
and that's not going to affect your sound driver.

241
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,953
Now, I say that and I'm actually struggling with the windows, you know,

242
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:35,043
my sound blaster,

243
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:37,963
Odyssey FX is completely pooping the bed and I figured

244
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:40,362
out why it's because the drivers are from 2015,

245
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:40,682
that's

246
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:41,482
fine.

247
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:46,723
And the minute I enabled PC I bifurcation to put in my um my uh M two card

248
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,966
PC I bifurcation, I don't even know what that means.

249
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:55,666
-- PC
-- I bifurcation lets me take a 16 lane PC I slot and break it up into four by four.

250
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,705
And so I have a card that has four M, two slots on it

251
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:02,026
and each of those gets four PC I lanes. So I have four

252
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:06,245
M two drives each being driven up for like, so it only takes up one slot physically.

253
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:09,786
And the moment since I've enabled PC I bifurcation, I been using that card.

254
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:10,676
My sound blaster oy

255
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:11,625
has just been

256
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,109
garbage

257
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,299
and it's a driver issue and there's no new drivers since eight years ago.

258
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,210
So,

259
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,250
you know, I have a new

260
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,729
uh sound thingy on order and there's nothing you can do.

261
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:26,960
But yeah, I think, but the thing is even the Linux kernel is still, you know,

262
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,140
the top 100 or

263
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,354
1000 developers is the vast majority of work compared to

264
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:32,554
probably

265
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:37,104
like this is like commercial software houses where you hire 10,000

266
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,875
people and all make them work eight hours a day.

267
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:42,405
Now, I have a question that you are forbidden from answering.

268
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:44,304
This is for the audience, I'm going,

269
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:44,950
I,

270
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:47,159
I think about this all the time and I would love to

271
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,750
know what people think like just add us on Mastodon or something.

272
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,099
And, and maybe we'll talk about this in the future but

273
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,539
is part of the Linux kernels. Massive cooper

274
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,539
success. Is that a word Cooper Cooper success?

275
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,859
Is that because it's GP L versus Apache two do

276
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:02,169
not

277
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,219
answer. I see. No, no, I can see.

278
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,719
I can see

279
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:05,059
that's

280
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:05,179
a

281
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,630
good question because licenses

282
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,700
-- licenses matter.
-- Anyway, now we're not talking about that today.

283
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,729
We're talking about N PM today,

284
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,770
but maybe another day we could discuss that because I, I

285
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:16,280
I think about that one a lot. And I

286
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,239
-- will say I go back and forth on a regular basis
-- and let me ask a follow up question

287
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,099
with respect to the GP L, the Apache and the BS D license, who's the user?

288
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:28,659
And it's a lot more subtle than most people think

289
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:29,359
that

290
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,109
-- you could write a thesis. A phd thesis on that question. Oh,
-- more than one thesis

291
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,659
anyway, it's moving along

292
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,099
right. N PM. OK.

293
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:38,950
So

294
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,330
we talk about the size of N PM gigantic.

295
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,809
I will say though the one thing I want to add, I'm,

296
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,179
I'll have the link to my blog post in the show notes,

297
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,780
like go and look at the picture or maybe I'll just make this the,

298
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:53,229
the image for the podcast because like holy crap,

299
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,844
it isn't most beautiful graph you will ever see.

300
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:59,414
Even though now we know half of them, half of the new packages are seo spam.

301
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:03,494
-- Like it's a gorgeous graph
-- though. One quick question, the seo spam packages.

302
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:06,054
Do they ever do updates or do they just one and done?

303
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,255
It sounds like they're very one and done and I wouldn't expect updates.

304
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:10,674
My follow up question would be

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,059
is, are you able to differentiate the seo spam from the people

306
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,580
doing the tutorial of uploading a package?

307
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,580
Uh I probably, I have a suspicion that the N PM folks have the ability to do this,

308
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,570
but I don't know if they'll want to because their incentive is really around show

309
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,465
growth.

310
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,664
Oh yeah, we have 3 billion packages,

311
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:36,604
right? Like we want to be, we want to show the most growth of any repository ever.

312
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:40,184
So they like is there really a downside to seo packages?

313
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,924
Like are they violating the terms of service? I don't know,

314
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:46,335
but I I have a suspicion they're not going to push hard on this because

315
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,085
growth at all costs, man. Like that's the way.

316
00:13:49,174 --> 00:13:53,005
Well, it's kind of wild to me because N PM, js.org is clearly won like they don't,

317
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,650
it's like github or

318
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,809
you know, like

319
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,000
no, but, but here's the thing. Ok.

320
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,700
So the growth I think matters in an environment like this

321
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,210
because what happens is one of the reasons I think N PM overtook Ruby is N

322
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:10,239
PM was showing massive growth while Ruby was

323
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,520
showing a more constrained growth at the time.

324
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,760
And now we probably know that that was because Ruby was a little harder to get into.

325
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,580
We'll say N PM was a little bit

326
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,000
more of the wild West

327
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,119
useless on its own. You need rails full stop anyway.

328
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,979
But I, I think in the case of NP MA lot of people saw the growth and they were like, well,

329
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:30,979
this is clearly the future because it's growing so much faster.

330
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:38,349
And I think if N PM slows their growth and another ecosystem has larger growth,

331
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,630
people are going to say, oh,

332
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:44,940
this new ecosystem is the future. Now, we should all learn rust or

333
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,479
whatever. I don't even know what the new languages are.

334
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:49,200
Everyone's pointing at except Rust.

335
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:50,440
Oh my

336
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:50,659
God.

337
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,840
You get the idea though, right.

338
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,429
There's a lot of perception issues that I think are going to come up in any,

339
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,039
any kind of discussion like this.

340
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,700
So, and, and

341
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,750
we talked about a couple of episodes ago,

342
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,239
I thought N PM was a foundation N PM is owned by Microsoft.

343
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,760
So Microsoft from a business perspective also

344
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,580
has an incentive to show enormous growth.

345
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,880
Right.

346
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,719
Well, the, the manager of it, I'm sure one of their KPIS is

347
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,229
make that number go big.

348
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:17,719
Yeah,

349
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:18,340
I

350
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:21,719
mean, I've dealt with this, you know, I'm not going to name names but I mean,

351
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:24,320
dealing with that online service that they wanted more user sign ups.

352
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,260
And so we had lots of user sign ups and it was 99 to 99 and

353
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:28,570
a

354
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:31,719
0.8% spam and scams on the

355
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:32,919
thing on the

356
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,539
Kpiki.

357
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:37,349
I

358
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:38,219
tried

359
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,979
-- for
-- cleaning the service and was smacked down hard

360
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:41,940
and

361
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,880
then I realized, oh yeah, it's linked to their bonuses. So it's not happening.

362
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,099
Yep, it's cobra effect 100%.

363
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,039
Ok. Ok.

364
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,820
So we cover the data a little bit and,

365
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,919
and the one other thing I want to bring up that's

366
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:56,000
probably people are going to say is they're going to say,

367
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,570
oh, this data,

368
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:04,260
the one maintainer packages that only applies to N PM because it's so big.

369
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:09,609
And if we look at only the important N PM packages, the trend doesn't hold the trend.

370
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,669
100% holds,

371
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,869
it's the same power distribution. A, a, an enormous amount of a single maintainer.

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,119
This is like the top 5% NP MP

373
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:21,799
or

374
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,109
exactly. It's stuff like that. 100%

375
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,309
-- dot Js or colors Js or whatever it was.
-- Uh right there, there's tons of them.

376
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,469
And so that's the point is every time I have tried

377
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,570
to find a, a

378
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,530
a trapdoor in this data to explain it away.

379
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,030
Every time a person has suggested I have to

380
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,330
look at it some other way because I'm wrong,

381
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,489
this graph is held and so I'm,

382
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,690
I am completely confident this is the way it is. It just is.

383
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,770
Well, to be honest, it,

384
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,750
it jives with all my research I've done over

385
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,099
the last 20 years into various ecosystems for security purposes

386
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:58,450
of it's

387
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,929
the exact same thing.

388
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:05,858
All the ecosystems are a ridiculously steep power distribution curve,

389
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:07,829
not just for the packages and popularity,

390
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,540
but the contributions to packages for the

391
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,368
security advisor zone packages for ad nauseam.

392
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,780
-- And
-- actually, so, you know what else?

393
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,150
I have a, I have a script, I wrote a long time ago that can take a G

394
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,239
repo and put it into a plastic search and I

395
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,378
can generate similar graphs to this open source stuff.

396
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:24,618
And you just reminded me when you're talking about Linux kernel,

397
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,538
I did this with the Linux kernel at one point.

398
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:29,499
And Linus of course, was the number one contributor unsurprisingly.

399
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,619
But the funny thing was I remember looking at the data,

400
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:33,588
you can tell when Linus goes on vacation because

401
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:35,848
there's like a noticeable dip in kernel development.

402
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:38,359
It's like, oh I get it.

403
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:39,328
And

404
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:40,458
I, I should,

405
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:42,058
I should do something similar to look at what

406
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:44,338
the contributions look like because I have a suspicion

407
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:47,058
the power distribution curve is going to be similar.

408
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,880
These power distribution curves are essentially

409
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,839
a symptom, not a cause

410
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:59,079
and the cause is more sort of just fundamentally how humans organize.

411
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,199
No, that's it. Like that's it.

412
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:06,349
-- Uh I I, I'm OK with it
-- because this holds true across every endeavor of human,

413
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,310
everything that I've ever seen, like the number of places that are not a power like,

414
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,369
like what is it that like um the,

415
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,839
the the square root of the organization does like half the work.

416
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,489
So if you have like an organization of 100 people,

417
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,319
like 10 people are doing half the work, stuff like that.

418
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:18,890
-- Like it's
-- just

419
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,959
I believe that when, when I

420
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,380
was at

421
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:23,449
elastic,

422
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,099
I remember looking at some of this data at one point because

423
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,329
it was part of my just have fun with elastic search program.

424
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,369
And

425
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,900
I remember looking at all of our contributors and yeah,

426
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,739
like there were basically a handful of developers

427
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,969
that accounted for an enormous number of the commits

428
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,859
to all of the elastic products across them all.

429
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:43,109
To go back to what Tomas said,

430
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,939
like to properly understand a code base and be able to contribute

431
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,339
to it both at a deep level or just in general,

432
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:49,709
more than a few lines of code

433
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,579
that is

434
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,380
thousands of hours of understanding and knowledge.

435
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,219
And if you have three or four people that have done that work and understand it,

436
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:58,619
why on earth would you have more?

437
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,229
It's hard to do

438
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,770
-- and it's
-- not just hard to do.

439
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,150
But if those people can do that work,

440
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,020
wouldn't it be better to have them look at some other code base that you use and get,

441
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:07,989
you know what I mean? Like

442
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,709
you have three or four experts in a code base. Why would you want 10 or 20?

443
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,630
Well, and especially, and then we're talking about an organization with no money.

444
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:16,819
I want to clarify something on this point though.

445
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,119
And because I think you also,

446
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,209
this is a reason people get scared off sometimes and they think, oh,

447
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:22,670
I have to invest all this time.

448
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:25,469
You don't approach something like this saying,

449
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,260
I'm going to become an expert and that hundreds and

450
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,699
hundreds of hours it slowly creeps up on you.

451
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,920
And my story I use here is minecraft.

452
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,260
When I started playing Minecraft with my kids, I was like,

453
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,859
I just want to dig holes and build fun things.

454
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,239
I'm never going to need to do like this Redstone crap or I'm never

455
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,000
going to worry about enchanting or I'm never going to have to worry about,

456
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,439
-- like, farming,
-- making a water elevator with signs.

457
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,119
That's right.

458
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,800
Yeah, exactly.

459
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:49,920
And so anyway,

460
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,520
obviously I started playing and playing and playing and

461
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,880
after I probably had hundreds of hours of playing

462
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,290
I would be like, oh, I want to do this fun thing.

463
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,270
Oh, I have to learn how Redstone works now.

464
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:03,530
And yeah, by the time I'm done I have like, right, like mob farms

465
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:09,209
that are using the water elevators to kill, but I wouldn't completely kill the Mobs.

466
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:10,150
I would mostly kill them.

467
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,810
So then I could murder them with a stick or something and then get all the experience.

468
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,280
And I had like an automatic chicken cooker that would like,

469
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,839
it would lay eggs, the eggs hatch, the chickens grow

470
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:24,802
-- so they're automatically
-- fed into a hopper. Let's not be night like let's not.

471
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:27,672
-- Oh,
-- there were hoppers and every, it was all completely automated. Like,

472
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,892
yeah, and when, when too many chickens died,

473
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:32,703
it would like send new eggs into hatch new chickens that,

474
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:35,662
that were only there to lay eggs for the sacrificial chicken.

475
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,282
Like it was this incredibly

476
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,422
complex machine I built

477
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:43,503
and I remember thinking at one point I'm like, I have like, I have become the thing.

478
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:46,942
I, I made fun of years ago when I started but, but

479
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:49,475
that's how it works. Right? Is you slowly turn into that.

480
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:51,566
And before you know it, now you're like maintaining a

481
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:54,316
popular package on NBM or something.

482
00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:58,026
So, I think for anyone listening and anyone, you know,

483
00:20:58,036 --> 00:21:00,245
like you can't approach it with a, oh,

484
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:02,536
I don't want to do this because it's gonna eat all my time or oh,

485
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:03,676
I can never be that smart.

486
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:05,375
Like you, you grow into it

487
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,556
-- if you want
-- to

488
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:08,875
remember. This is

489
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:10,936
sometimes,

490
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:11,836
sometimes

491
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,026
there have been

492
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,760
more than once

493
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,280
that I found myself

494
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,239
in charge of something that I'm like, how did this happen?

495
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,010
And it's because

496
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,569
usually I told the people in charge they were a bunch of idiots and

497
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,680
they dared me to run it and then I did and then I'm like,

498
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:27,800
oh crap like they,

499
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,239
they Tom Sawyer and me. It's too late now. But anyway, anyway, OK, so back to M PM.

500
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:36,589
I want to set the stage here. So now we know NBM is gigantic, right?

501
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,140
Open source is gigantic.

502
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,800
There's no denying it's bigger than you can imagine, right?

503
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:46,729
We also know that we're seeing seo spam in others, seo spam and N PM.

504
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,900
I 100% guarantee there's seo spam

505
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:49,449
all

506
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:50,530
and

507
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:51,410
everything.

508
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,010
It's,

509
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,319
that's why you can't put a URL in your Twitter bio.

510
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,560
They don't allow URL S on Twitter bios. I guess I didn't know that I don't,

511
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,760
-- no,
-- they do not.

512
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,180
I haven't run Twitter in so long, man. Like

513
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,489
I was

514
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,599
trying to put a URL to the thing and then I just put the OO

515
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,510
whatever for the Mastodon thing.

516
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,089
-- Wait.
-- No, I put a URL to my Mastodon account. It's

517
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:11,290
not,

518
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,880
it's not clickable.

519
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,689
-- No,
-- it's not clickable. I know that that's fine.

520
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,339
That's what I mean. You can't put a on

521
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,089
anyways.

522
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:17,250
I

523
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:17,849
understand.

524
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:20,229
Yeah, you can put the text in. But

525
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,910
yeah, yeah, I'm fine with text. That's fine.

526
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,619
I, I should, I need to shut down my Twitter account at some point.

527
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,560
That's another story.

528
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:26,609
Anyway.

529
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:27,829
OK,

530
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,270
so what was the point

531
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:33,949
we've just yammered on about kind of what does setting it all up?

532
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,900
Well, just that the data is the data, there's a power distribution curve,

533
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,939
it is what it is.

534
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,910
And I think here's my take on it.

535
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,000
It's not gonna change like you were involved in that group was like that was like,

536
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,560
what is the correct number of maintainers for open source?

537
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,819
It should be more than one. And it's like my response to that is

538
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,719
that's like asking for cows that don't fart methane. Like it's just

539
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,829
-- gonna
-- happen.

540
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,040
That was the open SSF

541
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,229
and the open S SS F is trying to

542
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:00,760
do things like scoring what constitutes good open source.

543
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,619
-- And so now you get into these questions like, oh well, it
-- needs

544
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,760
more than 1000 people use it this week.

545
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,589
There's

546
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,079
maybe, but like these are good questions.

547
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,680
These are the kind of things we you have to wonder however

548
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,560
at the end of that conversation,

549
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:16,439
it doesn't matter if there's some scorecard or something, it's,

550
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:20,520
if a developer finds something that solves their problem, they're going to use it.

551
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,920
Like they don't care if it has four downloads,

552
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,959
they don't care if it hasn't been updated in four years, they have work to do so now.

553
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:29,599
Ok, here's the real reason

554
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:32,040
I really wanted to talk about this

555
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,280
and I have an ulterior motive

556
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,319
And it's because I think

557
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,500
we have reached a point in the open

558
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,089
source universe where everyone is looking around,

559
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:45,079
everyone is noticing they're using open source in literally everything.

560
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:45,170
Our

561
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:45,650
Kaiser

562
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,849
Soze

563
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,319
moment again, I'll keep bringing that up because if,

564
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:51,479
if you haven't seen the usual suspects like go watch it.

565
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:51,979
It is

566
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,079
a magnificent piece of art.

567
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:55,869
But anyway,

568
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:56,790
so

569
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,719
there is this perception I think especially amongst many of the large corporations

570
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:06,910
that they can control open source if they try hard enough.

571
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,010
Because

572
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,390
historically, they've been able to like that is

573
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,910
the whole point of six Sigma is control everything, control all the variables,

574
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,959
control all the factors

575
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,349
and get that like six nines of

576
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,209
whatever it is you're producing, reliably out the door.

577
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,109
If we look at some of the things like the Linux kernel or Kubernetes or

578
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,530
the, the G new

579
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,969
C compiler and, and Lib C and some of this other technology,

580
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,400
a lot of big organizations were

581
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:35,880
able to exert control,

582
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,760
look at red hat red hat exerted enormous control

583
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,560
over open source for a long time for decades.

584
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,199
But that is done now.

585
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,780
That's not how this works.

586
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,859
And so the real purpose behind all this data, the real reason I wanted to publish this

587
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,060
and, and this is even,

588
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,650
I'm even seeing this in the open ssf where there's people talking about,

589
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,119
how do we control this?

590
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,609
-- How do we measure this and say like good, bad,
-- how do we? It's too big.

591
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:02,750
Of course, it's too big. But people don't understand how big it is, right?

592
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,390
The point of all this.

593
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,969
And this comes back to the conversation with Tama comes

594
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:09,849
back to our open sources and natural resource discussion like

595
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,310
this is all so huge. Now

596
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,339
there is nothing we can do but consume it.

597
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:20,310
We have to consume it and then look at consumption, we can't control consumption

598
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,270
because its consumption is too big.

599
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:25,989
Like the German Sovereign Tech Fund, we can influence a few

600
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,400
critical things that we've identified.

601
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:29,359
And I'm saying

602
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,189
influence not control

603
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:32,910
and they don't want to control it

604
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:33,599
is

605
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,910
-- exactly
-- right. They're smart.

606
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,550
No, seriously, they're smart like that,

607
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,890
that slide deck is like I went through it like wow, yeah, they

608
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,380
out of that, you know, it's

609
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,209
no, absolutely. But again,

610
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,849
I think this is where when you look at a lot of regulation,

611
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:55,609
there is regulation, that's very yes, yes, no type. But most regulation is about

612
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,119
influence, not demands, right? There are things like safety regulations.

613
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:00,969
I'm fine with that.

614
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,869
But many other places it's really about,

615
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:08,859
we're going to suggest you do this thing and here's the reason and here's how,

616
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:12,089
what happens if you don't, like, you don't get tax breaks, you don't get

617
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,329
government funding, we're not going to buy things from you.

618
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,510
-- If you don't do the things we want you to do
-- or

619
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,890
insurers say, oh, you didn't,

620
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,430
you don't own, like, you have a building without a fire sprinkler system,

621
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:23,040
right?

622
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,589
Yeah, we'll insure it. How much is the building worth? Ok, that's your premium.

623
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,270
No, I

624
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,750
that's why you can't buy overland flood insurance

625
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,109
in North America.

626
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:32,670
Right? You can't

627
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,760
because the cost of the insurance is like, ok,

628
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,650
what's the value of your home and its contents?

629
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,660
-- That's your yearly premium basically?
-- Right.

630
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,790
Right.

631
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:45,459
And, and I, yes, I, I think that's exactly it. And I think that

632
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,469
the point of all this is, I think we have to think about

633
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,540
how we use open source, not in the context of controlling open source,

634
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,709
but how we use open source in the context of

635
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,630
I need to first understand what I have.

636
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:01,829
And then it's not as much about telling people what they should or shouldn't

637
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,109
do as it is keeping an eye on everything happening in my universe.

638
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,689
And I think

639
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,520
-- that is more important.
-- This kind of reminds me of the discussions around rewriting

640
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,380
memory, unsafe language software into memory,

641
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,280
safe language software in the sense of

642
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,630
like, you can't

643
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,160
stop using the open source, you can't get rid of it.

644
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,510
And I'm not, I,

645
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,849
I think part of it might be even less about like inventorying

646
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:28,400
it all and understanding it all and maybe part of it is

647
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,069
like faking it till you make it in the

648
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,280
sense of let's start adopting more mature practices,

649
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:33,650
like

650
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,359
using source control because not everybody uses source

651
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:39,739
control yet or using source control correctly.

652
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,739
Right. Again, not all places like there's a lot of places using github

653
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:44,530
and then you see how they're actually using it.

654
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,770
And it's like, no, that's absolutely not how you're supposed to use git and

655
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:48,339
github.

656
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,130
You know,

657
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:51,050
um like my favorite being

658
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:54,849
the organizations that like disable issues so you can't file

659
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:57,449
issues and there's no path to like reporting breaks.

660
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:58,030
And it's like

661
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,969
this is not how you open source,

662
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,260
you know, you let the community at least talk to you and complain once in a while

663
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:08,349
or, oh, I was, I was trying to use uh Sendgrid library

664
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,800
and there every single thing in github was like, please don't file an issue,

665
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,170
please use our support for whatever.

666
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:16,810
And one person straight up was like

667
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,900
plug this error message into your support for and nothing

668
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,890
useful comes up like your support for does not,

669
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,380
the search doesn't work like it's useless

670
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,520
and

671
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,180
you know,

672
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,660
yeah, anyways, but I think that's part of it is,

673
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,819
it's kind of like cloud computing, people just started using it because,

674
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:37,329
and especially open source, like you can't really stop people because

675
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,300
it's not going to show up on a spending report, right? Like it's,

676
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:42,849
it's not like I need to go sign contracts and

677
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:45,689
get approval from legals before they'll ship it to me.

678
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:47,119
-- Well,
-- and here's my other favorite.

679
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,780
So when, when you and I started at Red Hat,

680
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,199
there was a technology called SC a source composition analysis

681
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,660
that's all about, oh, we're going to find the open source your developers are using,

682
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,160
right?

683
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,170
And they would scan source code and the

684
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,439
things were very slow and inefficient and they,

685
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,869
they worked well enough and they would look for a common open

686
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,479
source because it's easy to measure if someone say using N PM.

687
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:10,119
But what if they're copying and pasting coming off N PM?

688
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,540
Here's the thing 20 years ago,

689
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,319
you could do this because the amount of open source was

690
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:19,819
like literally like a millionth of what it is today.

691
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:20,800
Oh, it fit on a CD,

692
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,479
like

693
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:23,410
face

694
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,760
but like a Linux distribution fit on a CD with spare room

695
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,130
and

696
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,189
everything.

697
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,449
That's right today.

698
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,260
That is anyone telling you they can scan for

699
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,130
any open source in your product is they're,

700
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,339
they're, they're lying.

701
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:39,930
They either don't know they're lying to you, which is scary

702
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,339
or they know they're lying to you, which is also scary,

703
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:46,109
right? Like just absolutely not. There's too much of it. It's too complicated.

704
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,439
It's completely out of the question.

705
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:50,339
And especially with things like stack overflow, like

706
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,170
it's everywhere. Like you can't, you can't scrape all the stack overflow. All of

707
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:03,579
un copyrightable code count as open source. Is it quasi public domain?

708
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:05,180
-- We
-- are unqualified to have that.

709
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:07,010
And I'm not going down that path because we are

710
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,459
-- nearly out of time
-- because now that you say that I'm

711
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:12,050
wondering like what is all the output of chat GPT count

712
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,900
us because if that counts for the open source universe,

713
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,260
man, we are up the creek.

714
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,689
The courts have to decide that at the moment A I generated

715
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:22,219
source code carries no copyright because it has no human owner.

716
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:24,589
But that is going to be a discussion for the

717
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,089
courts that we are not going to have until the courts

718
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:31,609
decide because we're basically two talking idiots versus the judge

719
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:34,170
who will say probably also doesn't know what they're doing,

720
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,449
but

721
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:37,969
that's another problem anyway. All right, I wanna, I wanna take this one home.

722
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:38,729
So

723
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,569
going back to my sc a topic and I want to end it on.

724
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,250
This is in the past, I would say we, you could think of something like source code,

725
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,449
source composition analysis as you had

726
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:49,130
the big scary open source world

727
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:52,989
and you had the developers and sc a like sat between the two,

728
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,729
right where you're trying to control what developers were taking from the outside

729
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,229
that doesn't work anymore.

730
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,780
So now the way to think of it as you've

731
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,400
got developers and then you have whatever they're doing,

732
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,199
going into some sort of production

733
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:07,410
and it's really that step from developers going to take

734
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,209
whatever they can find and they're going to use it.

735
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,270
And I think trying to control developers is probably a lost

736
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,500
cause for many reasons that we could discuss at length.

737
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,540
Well, you can, but you're going to hobble them so hard.

738
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:20,079
They just aren't,

739
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:21,619
they're either going to quit or they're gonna find a

740
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,489
-- way not to
-- unless

741
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,719
-- you're
-- like a government agency,

742
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:25,400
your competitors gonna raffle stomp you.

743
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,339
Right. Right.

744
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:29,760
And so now it's really about how do we go from having a,

745
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,719
a thing that the developers built to at least doing some sort of

746
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:38,270
reasonable effort of verification prior to going into production.

747
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,630
And I think that's what we're at now, right? Like we have to move our tooling

748
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:43,380
after the developers

749
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,050
and we have to make sure that

750
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,329
we have good environments to run in.

751
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:50,290
We have to use technologies and languages that don't let them like,

752
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,650
shoot themselves in the foot.

753
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:56,369
And so I think that's the key now is trying to control developers will fail.

754
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,349
Like if you think it's right, like it's just, you've already lost

755
00:31:59,619 --> 00:31:59,890
it.

756
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,680
-- It's
-- also
-- not cost effective. Like,

757
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,199
OK, I'm gonna

758
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:06,420
talking about seo spam. OK? The cloud security lines has a DEV

759
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:09,089
ops working group that has the six pillars of DEV

760
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:09,810
ops

761
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,579
and they're currently or just about to be done updating it. Basically,

762
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,050
it's like cloud computing

763
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:16,959
in that

764
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:19,849
you can either fully try and control it or you can accept

765
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:22,000
that it's going to happen whether or not you like it.

766
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:26,670
And so build for like my host got hit by a car right a couple of years ago

767
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:31,489
and I literally did a bit of research into boards and some other possibilities to

768
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,760
prevent because I actually do kind of live the way the streets are laid out.

769
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,719
There is a potential for another car to drive into my house.

770
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,050
And I'm like, I don't really like this,

771
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,109
but I'd have to like, put boards across my front driveway, which I'm like, well,

772
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,040
that gets really expensive really fast to have the ones that go up and down.

773
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:46,510
So I'm like, whatever, I'll just live with the risk. Yep.

774
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:50,459
Because fun fact, if a car is going to drive through my garage and into a wall,

775
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,630
-- it's going to be the wall right next to me here, which
-- no one can see because

776
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,760
if you ever see me get crushed by a car, please call the cops or something.

777
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,109
I will do my best.

778
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,260
-- But
-- basically like with this de

779
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:01,079
ops thing,

780
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:02,869
yeah, you can either

781
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,819
pretend you can control it and say like we're going to have spherical cows,

782
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:08,270
we're gonna have these rules or you can say realistically,

783
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,550
here's what's actually going to happen.

784
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,810
People are going to suck in a bunch of open source.

785
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,140
Let's at least make sure, like, yeah,

786
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,030
we are aware of it and we're going to poke them when it's got a known security flaw.

787
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,729
And let's make sure we're shipping stuff often

788
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:22,040
enough so that we can actually update it.

789
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,160
Right.

790
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,199
Because that's the thing that always these discussions

791
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:26,699
seem to quietly ignore is none of this matter

792
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,489
-- if you can't actually update and ship the software or service.
-- Absolutely.

793
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,689
And it's, it's bigger than you can imagine. All right, I'm going to call this one.

794
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,770
That, that was fun.

795
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,709
I don't feel like I have a lot of great answers, but I do,

796
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:39,890
I do still maintain like we can't control it.

797
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,369
