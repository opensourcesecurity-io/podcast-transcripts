Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:11,210
Siefert and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,920
-- So
-- we're going to talk about the Matrix today because we wanted to do that last week.

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,629
-- And then life
-- happened

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,399
and to be clear,

5
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:21,049
-- it's the uh the movies
-- 12 and three because it is quite

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,590
possible someone will find this after the fourth Matrix comes out,

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,729
which if it follows the current trajectory of the Matrix movies,

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,080
it's not going to be very good at all.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,720
I would argue that the first movie was excellent.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,900
The second movie was like, I don't know about this and the third one was like, wow,

11
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,700
that second movie sure was good.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,409
So

13
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,340
yeah, I saw the trailer, I am not happy about this.

14
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:49,009
Uh Really, I, I'm indifferent.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,779
I think I, I feel like the trailer gives me nothing to work with.

16
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:55,150
I feel like it's super formulaic and it's going to

17
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,290
be exactly kind of what people want and nothing,

18
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:02,299
-- I mean, interesting or challenging.
-- As long as it amuses me,

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,909
it's

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,470
like,

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,160
see, that's what I like about. The first movie is the first movie did

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,489
I think two things. Well, one day has some groundbreaking visual effects, right?

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,449
Bullet time. That was new. That was,

24
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:14,879
yeah,

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,010
I, I remember seeing that and I remember my brain just going. Huh?

26
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:22,050
Yeah. Like, how did they possibly do this? And then when you see how they did it with

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,779
like, what 200 cameras? It's like, this is ridiculous.

28
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,529
-- Yeah. And
-- it's like, oh, that's actually really simple and clever.

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,250
Like, in terms of like building a nuclear weapon is simple.

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,330
Like you just take a chunk of uranium and compress it quickly,

31
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,370
I don't even think.

32
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:35,599
No,

33
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,184
-- you just have to find 300
-- cameras and get the

34
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:40,504
timing right and get them in the right position and the

35
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:40,684
green

36
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:41,404
-- screen,
-- all that

37
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:41,644
stuff.

38
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:42,175
That's

39
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:43,154
easy. Now

40
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:44,964
it probably wasn't. But

41
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:45,175
yeah,

42
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:48,334
but uh so it, it had some groundbreaking vision,

43
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:51,444
special effects and what I love too is it's really clear that

44
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:54,114
they basically blew the budget halfway through the film,

45
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,605
right? So they have this mixture of really wow,

46
00:01:57,775 --> 00:02:01,805
special effects followed by like just some good old fashioned Hong Kong Wire work.

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,779
The kung fu is really good in that

48
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,879
-- movie and
-- there's nothing and to be clear,

49
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:10,639
I love high quality Hong Kong Wire work.

50
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,830
I love those films with that, like just that real good physical comedy,

51
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,039
violence dance

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,399
thing going on, right? Like it's just, it's poetry in motion

53
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,220
with people, you know, they do those flying spins and it's just like, wow,

54
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,000
man, that, like, I'd be puking my guts out if you spun me that quickly in the air.

55
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,639
Right. Well,

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,199
this is, we've never trained for wire work.

57
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,919
-- I imagine if you had some training you could easily do it
-- and there's, you know,

58
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:38,339
the tricks like figure skaters do.

59
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,080
But anyways,

60
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,929
so, and then secondly, it told a very,

61
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,520
the first movie told a really interesting story.

62
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,369
Right?

63
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,089
Because it was kind of like a really nice sort of

64
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,889
kafkaesque. What if waking up is a bug in a room kind of thing? Right? But in reverse,

65
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,720
you know, the whole,

66
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,820
instead of going through the looking glass,

67
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,940
-- looking glass
-- just in case

68
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,539
I'm gonna, I'm gonna say this now and maybe I'll put it at the beginning, but

69
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,899
-- we're going to spoil the crap out of this movie. So if you've ever seen
-- the

70
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:06,789
Max, I

71
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:07,800
mean,

72
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:10,779
I'm just for the sake of

73
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,589
I, I just being a decent human.

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,520
Actually, I was listening to a Star Wars podcast the other day

75
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,580
-- and
-- dude, it's old enough to drink.

76
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:19,320
I agree.

77
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,279
I know there are people though who mentioned this at the beginning of

78
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,839
a Star Wars podcast if we're going to spoil it for you,

79
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,119
even though it came out in 1979.

80
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,250
-- Anyway. Anyway,
-- yeah, the Matrix came out in 99. Like

81
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:32,779
I know,

82
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:34,759
I know I actually did a lot of reading on

83
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,270
it and I rewatched a whole bunch of Matrix stuff

84
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,440
over the last week. It's been quite fun. It's the movie,

85
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,559
the first one holds up better than I, I expected it to.

86
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,960
-- Well,
-- because again, good story

87
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:51,509
and, and some very subtle touches like the whole the dojo scene with the hand wave,

88
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,039
right? Like that's become a meme that's become a cultural icon.

89
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,750
I mean, no, there's no way that's from The Matrix.

90
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,729
-- That's got to be from some other kung fu movie.
-- Probably,

91
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,990
-- I'm skeptical it's from The Matrix.
-- The

92
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,600
-- Matrix
-- made it popular

93
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,589
in, in modern day.

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,610
Sure. Sure. So anyway, we want to talk about the security of the matrix.

95
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:12,630
-- Not just like ramble on about random matrix stuff.
-- Ok. Now, quick question,

96
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:16,238
what is Cannon? Ok. Obviously the three movies are cannon, right?

97
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,570
I don't care

98
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,010
about

99
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:18,640
the,

100
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,108
what about the Pre Matrix? The cartoons

101
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:21,690
are

102
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,290
those cannon?

103
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,660
Do I care? No,

104
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,429
they're important if we're talking about the security

105
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,459
of the Matrix and those poor little.

106
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,299
So I don't remember those. I know I watched them but I couldn't recollect them.

107
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:35,750
Nor were they part of my research? So if you want to talk about them, that's great.

108
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,140
But I'm going to be a flopping fish.

109
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,570
Ok. Well, I'm going to say the Animatrix is canon because it was

110
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,100
part of the back story.

111
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:44,279
I'm fine with that.

112
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,309
I'm fine calling the video games can actually the

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,989
video games are really good when they came out.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,299
-- I hope they make some new ones, you know,
-- did they ever come up with a VR one?

115
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:52,519
Because that would be interesting.

116
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:57,880
Uh, not that I know of. I remember playing it on, like the Playstation or something.

117
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,760
It's been a long time

118
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,359
anyway.

119
00:04:59,739 --> 00:04:59,929
Ok.

120
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:00,970
So

121
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:04,640
here's where I want to start talking about the security of the matrix

122
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:05,989
is number one,

123
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,640
I think anyone who

124
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,260
came into,

125
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,630
into being in the nineties

126
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,329
and wanted to consider themselves a hacker.

127
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,489
This was one of the movies you watched

128
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,500
and it definitely was something you kept in mind at all times

129
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,500
because hypervisor security matters

130
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,549
not for that reason because it was cool. It looked cool and there was hacking in it,

131
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,130
right.

132
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,239
This is, it's like the movie hackers,

133
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,410
which we should talk about someday too just because it's so much fun and epic.

134
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,519
I do love that film.

135
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:43,950
-- Like
-- that was another one you watched. It, it was part of who you were at the time

136
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,690
and it, it, like I remember watching them actually so fun fact

137
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:50,600
when I went to see The Matrix in the theater,

138
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,470
I literally had no idea because I

139
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,790
was purposely avoiding everything about the Matrix.

140
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,200
I could at the time

141
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,399
-- I sat in the seat with no clue what was going to happen. It was amazing.
-- No, it's,

142
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,519
uh

143
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,820
I mean, there's actually n map made it into the films. Remember in the second or third

144
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,109
one,

145
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,290
we'll get to that. Um Well, they used an ssh exploit. But

146
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,399
we'll get to that. We'll get to. That doesn't matter.

147
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:12,929
All right. So, anyway, anyway,

148
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,279
first of all the cultural aspect,

149
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,910
but then I think the, the secondary part of this

150
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,899
is,

151
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,250
I think it,

152
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,649
it's very

153
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:28,019
nineties in a lot of ways where, for example, there's an obsession with the hard line

154
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,850
because you watch it now and you think, I don't get it.

155
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:33,769
But in the nineties there were cell phones and

156
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,279
there were landlines and landlines were seen as like

157
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,140
the, the old trusty landline. This will never let me down.

158
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,510
Whereas your cell phone was like, maybe it'll work, maybe it won't, we don't know,

159
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,470
cell phones were crazy unreliable 20 years ago compared to now.

160
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,950
Right. Like, I remember,

161
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,950
like, now it's funny because there's like a,

162
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,839
there's about a 34 mile long dead spot on the way to my parents' cabin in a valley

163
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,820
and it's always just shocking because I'm driving and I'm like, oh, I,

164
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,160
I better not crash because I will die out here alone.

165
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,429
Right. Because I'm so used to having cell coverage everywhere I go.

166
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,500
Right. It's just a given

167
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,489
until you don't have it.

168
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,290
And then it's kind of like,

169
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:15,359
remember this summer I went to that place in or not this summer.

170
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:15,670
Sorry.

171
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:16,790
Yeah, it was in June.

172
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,440
I went to that place in BC that had no cell

173
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,260
phone or internet coverage and I was kind of like her.

174
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,940
Right. Right.

175
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,149
No, I know it's like,

176
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,000
it's like no electricity now where I feel like

177
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,649
no electricity and no internet are functionally the same.

178
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,619
I can, I can bring candles. I cannot bring internet with me.

179
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,040
Right. If there's no electricity, you also have no internet. That's a double whammy

180
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:37,730
man.

181
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,679
At least my refrigerator works

182
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,359
when I have electricity.

183
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:42,579
That's nice.

184
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,519
So you get one of those fancy fridges that will die.

185
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:47,269
And that's another show why the ads, whoever is dying is a problem.

186
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm never getting one of those anyway. Ok. Matrix. Talking about the Matrix

187
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:51,549
and

188
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,510
now we're talking about refrigerators

189
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,250
anyway. Anyway. Ok.

190
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,519
So I've got a bunch of notes that I

191
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,899
scribbled down and there's a handful of interesting events.

192
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,170
But since you already mentioned it,

193
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,220
we should bring up the end map and SSH Exploit, which is,

194
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,269
it's at the very end of the second movie,

195
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,940
I'll let you explain it because you brought it up first.

196
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,709
Uh, so long story short, they need to,

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,480
uh, break into a building with a floor where no elevator goes

198
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,140
-- and this floor is full of doors or whatever.
-- Stop all the

199
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,880
metaphorical crap. They need to shut off the power.

200
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,940
-- Yeah,
-- they need to shut off the power to shut off the security system.

201
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,959
It's classic diehard trope.

202
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,579
It's

203
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,479
very heist movie. Right. Absolutely.

204
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,950
And so, uh Trinity basically breaks into the power company

205
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,239
and

206
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:43,179
hacks the power company to shut down the power grid.

207
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:45,189
But what's cool is on the screen,

208
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:48,879
you see the end map, the end map command literally being run.

209
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,658
And you see there is an SSH exploit they used,

210
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,559
that was a real SSH exploit that had been fixed.

211
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,679
I mean, many years prior to the movie. But you get the idea which,

212
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,189
yeah, because the power company would never

213
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,939
ever have out of date software.

214
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:05,799
-- So
-- here's what's funny, you just said that and you just made me realize

215
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:07,518
when I watched that,

216
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,679
I was like,

217
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,229
there's no way anyone would be running software this out

218
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,900
of date because it was very out of date.

219
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:13,299
Right?

220
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,859
And I was like, there's no way a power company would be online.

221
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:22,219
And now in 2021 I'm like, both of those things are completely reasonable to accept.

222
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:26,530
-- Not just
-- reasonable, man. There, we have documented instances of this.

223
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:32,299
-- We do now we did it in 1999. Well, it was probably, what, 2000, 2000 one,
-- right?

224
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,099
People kept that stuff quiet back in the day. They weren't posting, it's

225
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,179
a or whatever,

226
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,719
maybe whatever. I, I, we would have heard if someone hacked a power plant, I

227
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:45,580
-- shut up the power.
-- True. But I, but on the flip side,

228
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,090
I,

229
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,539
I know a lot of anecdotal stories where stuff was

230
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:52,070
swept under the rug and put out as like,

231
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,700
oh, you know, uh, unanticipated maintenance event or whatever.

232
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,080
Right.

233
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,690
Whatever, whatever we're going on. I don't care. I don't care. All right.

234
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,260
So that was really cool because that's a real actual thing.

235
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,559
And then they, of course, went on Matrix E and they

236
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,559
had a dude make a key and open the door, which I think all of the,

237
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,760
the bizarre symbolism they use.

238
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,000
The second one was really,

239
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,270
really heavy in the symbolism and the third one to a degree as well

240
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:16,679
was

241
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:21,445
this is one of those things that I looked at at the time and I feel like it,

242
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,924
it reminded me a lot of, like, Neuromancer, for example,

243
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:26,765
where it was just one of those things that

244
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:31,924
felt surreal. I think when I, I experienced it in the nineties. But now

245
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:34,395
I think using these,

246
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:35,844
I, I guess

247
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,780
I, I don't even know the right word for it,

248
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,270
but like these symbols of the virtual to the

249
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,830
real seems like something more expected and practical now.

250
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,880
Whereas in the nineties it felt strangely science fiction.

251
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,419
Well, here's a good example,

252
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:53,119
this whole concept of having sort of God in your ear saying, you know, walk left,

253
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,570
turn right, go down the stairs.

254
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:58,599
Well, yeah, I mean, we have security cameras everywhere. We have cell phones. It,

255
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,820
that's a thing that, you know, in reality

256
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,989
that happens.

257
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:03,969
Right. Like,

258
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:07,440
it's not a matter of just blindly trusting your luck and

259
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,510
hoping the security guard isn't where you want them to be.

260
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,320
It's like, no, no, no security guards on the fourth floor. Go now.

261
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:13,150
Right.

262
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,789
Because we can see them on the security camera, how,

263
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,789
because we hacked this camera system,

264
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,760
you know, again, in the nineties, that was a ridiculous notion.

265
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:20,900
Well,

266
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:26,260
and now we have the NDA A act which explicitly bans Chinese security cameras on us.

267
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,159
Government property.

268
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:29,119
I had to read the

269
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,719
doesn't matter, but you keep going. We got a lot of crap to cover here.

270
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,369
One thing I also love is I'm just,

271
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,200
I pulled up a screenshot of Trinity hacking and it's like straight up the old

272
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:44,609
and when I say Mac O si don't mean like the Mac Os, you and I,

273
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,609
and everybody else thinks of,

274
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:49,469
I'm talking about the Mac Os on like the old timey boxes with the, you know,

275
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,789
the two boxes and the, the horizontal lines,

276
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,450
that terminal interface, like it is

277
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,299
-- old, tiny, old, it was
-- a nineties yo,

278
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,369
well, that interface stuff was probably from the early nineties because, you know,

279
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,390
it's not like movies,

280
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,859
they still use all that weird kind of old it stuff to,

281
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,059
you know, show

282
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,659
like my favorite is Office Space. We'll talk about that movie someday.

283
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,380
-- I don't think that's that good of a
-- movie.

284
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,299
Fractions of a penny, just like Superman,

285
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,080
whatever, whatever. All right.

286
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,979
So anyway, anyway, OK, so we got covered the hard line.

287
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:22,309
Now, the, the other thing that I think was really interesting

288
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,260
was

289
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,909
the notion of hacking

290
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:29,669
the way they portray it because I think it's kind of two pieces to this.

291
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,590
There's the actual, like, hacking of computers, like, we might think about it.

292
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,539
And I remember,

293
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,869
well, not remember.

294
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,880
I literally just watched this when Neo's computer gets hacked by Trinity.

295
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,460
And it's just like, text and it's like, knock,

296
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,030
knock Neo and there's a knock at the door.

297
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,309
Right.

298
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,229
Which

299
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,570
back then it was like, that's, that's not reasonable.

300
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,700
There's no way you could do that.

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,030
And now you think about it and like back during someone's computer

302
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,270
-- totally reasonable
-- and

303
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,059
they have a web camera, I mean, there's,

304
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,469
they didn't have a webcam back then.

305
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,390
I mean, we'll assume they had weird matrix knowledge or something. But

306
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,760
I mean, like the Pegasus spyware, right? Like this stuff is everywhere now.

307
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,989
But back in the nineties,

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,609
the idea of infecting someone's computer to the point you could like,

309
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:11,169
print arbitrary text to them

310
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:11,719
was

311
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,280
I think I viewed that as sensational and ridiculous.

312
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:17,530
And now it's like, yeah, that's fair. That's,

313
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,090
which is funny

314
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,330
because

315
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,919
once you have command execution on the computer especially,

316
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,640
well, anything before 2000 running a Microsoft product was,

317
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,890
-- you know, there was no concept of user, an admin,
-- really

318
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:29,409
whatever.

319
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:30,530
I'm sure Neo ran Linux.

320
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,849
Let's not pretend

321
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,020
it was text based.

322
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,960
I thought it was always, I just assumed it was like ad Os box or something,

323
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,340
-- whatever
-- it was,

324
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,049
we're going to say it was Linux because he was

325
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,690
cool and cool people ran Linux in the nineties.

326
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:45,710
-- They still do mind you. But that's not, I don't
-- know that cool is the word I would use.

327
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,849
-- But sure, yeah,
-- I'm comfortable using that word.

328
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,659
So, anyway, but then there's also the hacking aspect,

329
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,869
which I think is very amusing of they, they call it,

330
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,989
like bending the rules where they can jump

331
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,469
really high and move really fast and whatever.

332
00:13:59,479 --> 00:13:59,909
And,

333
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:05,030
and this one I always struggled with, I think a little bit where

334
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:08,070
this is how Attackers do it on systems. Like, oh,

335
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,380
you'll let me enter the password, password. Ok.

336
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,330
What about password, full quote greater than blah, blah, blah, blah,

337
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,820
blah. Oh, look at that at

338
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,270
the table of your database,

339
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,010
right?

340
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,340
And that's, and that's been my experience. A lot of hacking is

341
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,849
ask politely

342
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,969
-- and then ask, you know, like a little nibble, a little nibble,
-- like a simulation

343
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:33,965
that has physics rules and they're violating what? What's straight? Wait. Ok.

344
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,364
So let me, let me rephrase this.

345
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:40,104
It's, it's obviously in a massive physics simulation that they've created, right?

346
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:40,885
And then

347
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:44,465
there's apparently rules that everyone has to follow.

348
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:48,594
And there's a handful of people who have the ability to bend the rules but be

349
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:49,544
quotes

350
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:50,664
and then,

351
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,989
but, but only certain things like why can they jump really high?

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,479
But they can't fly, you know what I mean?

353
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,369
-- Like, I don't know, he
-- does Superman later on.

354
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:02,020
-- Well, Neo does, but none of the other people can because
-- they don't believe enough.

355
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:02,820
Right.

356
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,010
Ok. But then that, like,

357
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,349
uh, oh,

358
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,489
I hate this

359
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:07,200
party. Right.

360
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,299
It's, this is like, ah,

361
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:10,270
well,

362
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,979
here's my take on it is think about a

363
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:14,979
modern system and how ridiculously complex it is.

364
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,530
And there's

365
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:20,460
like a web app and there's all these little fidgety places where you can do cross site

366
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:23,979
scripting or cross site request forgery or header injection

367
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,940
or prototype pollution or all these weird things.

368
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,109
And if you 0.10 hackers out that system,

369
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:30,299
are they going to come up with the same set of vulnerabilities?

370
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,619
No, absolutely not. They're all going to come up,

371
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:37,719
you know, with this wonderful 10 dimensional Venn diagram of like Europe in

372
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,789
the middle of world war two, basically,

373
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,239
maybe, I mean, OK.

374
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,900
OK. May maybe, maybe I'll let this one go, but I always felt like that was

375
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,869
just a bizarre thing. And then there's agents who supposed it.

376
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,140
Although,

377
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,799
although we learn at the end that the agents are probably basically just pawns

378
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,539
in

379
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,739
a bigger story.

380
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,940
Well, they're part of the simulation of the second layer.

381
00:15:58,109 --> 00:15:58,979
-- Yeah.
-- Right. Right.

382
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,780
And, and so whatever that's,

383
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,260
we'll,

384
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,890
we'll kind of ignore them a little bit because I

385
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,825
think agents from the storytelling perspective are obviously just a

386
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:09,614
plot point because there's tons of stuff they can and can't do.

387
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,815
They shouldn't be, you know what I mean?

388
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:14,614
-- It's
-- this massively complex system with multiple A is running around it.

389
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,984
And don't you think that, like

390
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:19,775
by definition, you have two A is running in a compute infrastructure.

391
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:23,994
Like logically one A I would try and murder the other A I to get

392
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:27,215
all the computer instance because that's what the other A I is going to do.

393
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:29,284
I mean, that's kind of the plot

394
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,619
you have all these competing A is that

395
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,510
are kind of struggling trying to find exploits,

396
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,190
trying to, you know, get more power, get less like whatever.

397
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,789
So I, I think it actually

398
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:38,859
having,

399
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,030
let me put it this way.

400
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,349
Remember when Sony sued itself,

401
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:44,260
right? Like

402
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,260
when you get a large organism, a human body is a perfect example, right?

403
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,940
We have an autonomic nervous system.

404
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,510
We have, we have an immune system, we have all sorts of stuff going on

405
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,770
and you can have autoimmune diseases. Like my favorite example of this is

406
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,950
OK, cool. I'm gonna go eat some tasty, delicious spicy food

407
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,909
and then eight hours later my body's like, no,

408
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,340
you know, they're like, nope that, that

409
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,449
not go well or I, I smell something and I start sneezing like why? Just why?

410
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,420
Because we're stupid bags of meat. This is a computer.

411
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,910
-- They could have gotten it right?
-- My appendix tried to murder me many years ago.

412
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:14,989
Why is,

413
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,819
why would a bunch of a is running around a computer system be

414
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,790
any different than an A I trying to murder the whole system accidentally?

415
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,589
I mean, that happens and that, that's the plot.

416
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,849
Ok. Ok. So I, I got another interesting

417
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,290
note I wrote down

418
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,890
is so in the very beginning of the very first movie,

419
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:33,770
the,

420
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:39,069
the main character Neo works at this big stuffy corporate programming job.

421
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,199
And in the nineties, I remember at this time, like,

422
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:47,319
that's what my first job felt like where it was, you had to dress nice.

423
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,780
You had to go into the office. There were business people in charge

424
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,540
and it was very stuffy and it was very followed the rules or else.

425
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,150
But there,

426
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,689
but there also wasn't like this vibrant start up culture

427
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,430
that we have now of like dress like a hobo.

428
00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:01,765
-- No one cares.
-- Well, the

429
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:03,944
sort of culture was underground at that point.

430
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,214
Right? It was on the fringe.

431
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:07,234
It wasn't part of mainstream now start ups have gone

432
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:09,574
mainstream because if you want to be a billionaire,

433
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:14,834
you do a start up or you inherit it and most of us don't have inheriting it as an option.

434
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:18,435
I mean, look at like the, the freaking NSA or the dod,

435
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:21,175
like the hackers are allowed to wear whatever they want.

436
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,964
-- Everyone else has to wear suits.
-- A bunch of these places.

437
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:26,594
Roll back the rules on testing for cannabis.

438
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,810
Yeah, because they had to, because the war on drugs was won by the drugs.

439
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:31,869
I mean,

440
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,839
no, I know, I know.

441
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,619
I, I totally, although I don't think the FBI has done that yet,

442
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,640
-- but they're going to have to because there's no one to hire
-- tech stuff.

443
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,430
They were because,

444
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:41,239
I mean, I,

445
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,520
I remember even 20 years ago working at a place and I

446
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,859
was actually kind of curious because it was based on DC and

447
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,770
they actually did not have drug testing policies. And I was a Canadian.

448
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,219
I'm like, I'm used to that because

449
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:55,020
it's, well, up here you can really legally only test after an incident.

450
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:56,069
Right.

451
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,189
So somebody drives a forklift into a wall and then it's like, ok, go pee in this cup,

452
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,550
you can't pre-test legally, which is not to say it doesn't happen.

453
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,109
Now, it's actually quite a common thing. Now.

454
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,869
It's a thing but most places up here aren't union shops so tough.

455
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,060
But, um,

456
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,660
yeah, like the, the company straight up said, you know, we, we,

457
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,869
we consciously don't have a drug testing policy because we know, like,

458
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,560
-- yeah, we can't get rid of half of you. Right.
-- Right.

459
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:20,689
So, anyway, anyway, I, I found that interesting and it's, again,

460
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:23,339
this is one of those things that when you watch it the first time

461
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:23,979
it's just,

462
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:28,060
it doesn't register because it was just normal and now it's not normal at all.

463
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,589
It used to be normal that everybody smoked everywhere.

464
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,630
I mean, yeah, I know. Right.

465
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,300
Yeah.

466
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:38,760
Yeah, I remember playing with the, I remember one of my favorite things to do

467
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,560
on a 747 was to play with the ashtray.

468
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:44,739
I've never been on a plane with an ashtray. I'm sad to say.

469
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,900
-- But anyway, anyway, a long
-- time

470
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,219
ago,

471
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,680
so

472
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,040
there's so much to talk about

473
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,479
in so little time.

474
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,589
-- That
-- sweet, sweet nokia phone.

475
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,150
I know. Ok. Yeah. Yeah.

476
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,160
-- So the cell phones are, I think a great topic and so explain the phone they
-- use,

477
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,229
they use a nokia phone.

478
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:06,280
I forget which model it is. But it doesn't matter because it's a nokia phone.

479
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,760
It's a, it's a custom phone.

480
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,275
They, they made that phone just for the movie.

481
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:13,925
-- No, nokia phone, like slid down like that.
-- Ok. I was wondering about that,

482
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,785
but the point is it was a nokia phone.

483
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,944
So at some point during the heat death of the universe,

484
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:20,104
those phones will finally cease to exist.

485
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:21,734
Well, look in the nineties,

486
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:26,635
-- there were no smartphones.
-- I had a nokia, I had a nokia phone. It did not break

487
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,834
-- ever.
-- Well, who cares? There is no smartphones in the nineties. Oh man.

488
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:31,204
T nine.

489
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:35,025
-- Texting was awesome though. Like where
-- you, but they don't even text ever. Do they

490
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,439
uh in this movie though?

491
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:39,310
They don't text because texting wasn't a part of culture because

492
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,239
you had to learn how to text back in the day.

493
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,560
Like, remember you had to learn how to do T nine text entry.

494
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:46,719
Yeah, it's just all, it's all phone calls, right?

495
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,560
They're calling each other constantly.

496
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:51,760
Which is also funny because when was the last time you called someone?

497
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:56,709
Uh Well, ok. Uh, ignoring, like my parents and my kids

498
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,079
basically.

499
00:20:58,579 --> 00:20:58,829
Yeah.

500
00:20:59,250 --> 00:20:59,839
Never.

501
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:02,229
Uh,

502
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,079
I know, like, if someone calls me

503
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:10,569
-- do incoming spam calls count, I
-- mean, maybe, but, you know, like that's it.

504
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,890
The only time I saw a funny meme that was basically

505
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,770
how do I know when I'm getting a spam call?

506
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,810
My phone rings.

507
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:17,119
I

508
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,369
know I'm getting a spam call.

509
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,069
So they have this wild phone,

510
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,689
they made just for the movie because it looks

511
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,969
cool because the movie had a look about it.

512
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,449
And in, in 1999

513
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:29,560
like cell phones weren't common.

514
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:30,640
So if you had a cell phone,

515
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,010
you were probably a drug dealer or a hacker like that was basically,

516
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,770
or a serious businessman.

517
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:39,530
I actually met a cell phone number broker back in the day.

518
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,890
So basically this guy had an in with the phone company

519
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,849
and he managed to basically bribe people to give him cell

520
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,229
phone numbers that he could then resell to doctors for like

521
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,229
five grand because the cell phone debate and these are like,

522
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,369
we're talking back in the days of big

523
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,790
phone where like having one of those was a status symbol. Like I have a cell phone.

524
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,609
You do not,

525
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,150
right?

526
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,089
Um And so literally he would like bribe people at the phone company to

527
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,280
release cell phone numbers to him that he could then resell on for,

528
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,489
yeah, like five grand a pop

529
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,760
wild.

530
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:11,380
I was watching a documentary on uh AT&T on the original,

531
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,300
not cell phones but radio telephones.

532
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,630
And they, so they had these big radio towers set up in New York and all over the place

533
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,150
and there were three channels for all of New York City.

534
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:24,640
Yeah, because six people probably own the things. Yeah.

535
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,560
And so obviously AT&T is like, this is a great technology but, you know,

536
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:30,489
we'd like for more than three people at a time to be able to use it

537
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,520
and then we got sped rectum and all that magic going on. Right.

538
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,880
But

539
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:36,400
no,

540
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,349
yeah, I, again, I, I remember I actually had a pager before. I had a cell phone

541
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,469
because I could not afford a cell phone

542
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:44,739
when I was,

543
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,880
I remember that

544
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,920
I remember that man, those were the days, weren't they?

545
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,339
And that self that pa

546
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,030
was,

547
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:52,300
it was indestructible and pretty awesome.

548
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:52,569
Yeah,

549
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,520
they were all indestructible because people cared about that stuff back then.

550
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,260
Now everyone just buys expensive cases to put

551
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,880
their expensive phone in and it's fine.

552
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,760
Alright. So anyway,

553
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,800
uh we'll keep going. Uh hacker handles.

554
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,010
I suspect this movie was one of the first time

555
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,319
a lot of people were introduced to hacker handles.

556
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,079
Yeah.

557
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:10,359
No. Yes.

558
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,040
Yeah. Well, and thinking about it again, in popular society,

559
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,489
anybody

560
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,670
basically have two options.

561
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,469
You can go by a nickname and it has to be like

562
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:21,790
well known like uh like Richard and Dick or William and Bill

563
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,359
or you have an alias in your criminal.

564
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,199
And there's no third option for not going by your real name. Right.

565
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:32,910
And there's, it's back to that trope of real names and your name have power. Right?

566
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,619
Knowing somebody's real name, like Rumpel Stiltskin has power.

567
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,310
And I think that's where a lot of this hacker handle thing came from. Right.

568
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,390
Is people wanted to have an online persona

569
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:42,689
that, you know, didn't get them arrested

570
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:47,270
-- to a
-- degree because I remember one guy I knew he hacked into

571
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,250
the Edmonton public school board system and left his freaking name on it.

572
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:55,680
So that's a perfect example of where you should have used a hacker handle.

573
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:58,270
-- Tell
-- him
-- to come talk to me for the hacker History podcast.

574
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,680
That sounds like a really good story.

575
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:01,199
It was so long ago and

576
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:02,739
it wasn't even really hacking.

577
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,709
It was more like, it was like the war games hacking, like, oh, the password is pencil,

578
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:05,930
tap

579
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:06,209
out.

580
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:07,459
I mean,

581
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:13,660
there's so much of that though. People forget how, how dumb everything used to be.

582
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,900
Well, it's not that it was dumb. It's just that how like hacking into a computer

583
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,030
was like

584
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,890
mission impossible where you had to physically gain access to it because there was,

585
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,790
there was no internet.

586
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,160
Well, there were, there were cell phones. I mean,

587
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,310
you know, that's my favorite scene from hackers where it's like, ok, you know,

588
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,290
it's the box by the computer with numbers on it.

589
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,319
You know, he's trying to describe them to turn on the modem and, like,

590
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:36,319
hook it up and everything.

591
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,510
But

592
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:38,839
I,

593
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,579
part of it is just

594
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,489
like I look at smartphones, smartphones only existed since 2006

595
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,770
and they went from 0 to 60 like, basically five years and they were pretty common.

596
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,290
And now,

597
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:54,699
yeah, if I see somebody without a

598
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,849
smartphone, it's kind of like, wow, that's like retro, like, you're,

599
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,430
you're committed to that old phone.

600
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:02,050
-- Like, I mean,
-- cool. Maybe it, well,

601
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,160
they work, right and they,

602
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:05,569
and for some people cool.

603
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,189
But the point is things like, how long did email take to take off?

604
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,540
Like, I remember having an email address and a web address and people were like,

605
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,550
what is that good for?

606
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,150
And now of course, it's normal.

607
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,890
No, no, there's, there's a really important thing that to think about here. So

608
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,130
I think the best

609
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:23,060
comparison to use for that is going to the moon

610
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:23,969
where

611
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:27,750
in the sixties, humanity went to the moon

612
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,069
in spite of the technology we had.

613
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,729
Whereas if you look at the tech we have today going to the moon

614
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,069
is infinitely easier

615
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,010
and the reality is,

616
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,349
and I think email is the same and the same thing with smartphones is

617
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,729
like, we had weird screen smart devices back in the nineties.

618
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:47,329
I mean, do you remember like the Apple Newton and the Palm

619
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,150
Pilot and all that stuff?

620
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,810
I remember the Apple Newton because we, nobody was allowed to,

621
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,410
to write on it because it had finally learned Kevin's writing.

622
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,410
That's right. It did learn your writing.

623
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,569
I remember it expressly forbade anybody else from writing on it because it was like,

624
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:02,430
screw it up and he wouldn't, it wouldn't understand him.

625
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:04,969
That's right. But anyway, you get the idea right.

626
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:09,739
And like this technology was created in spite of everything else.

627
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,329
But then by the time

628
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:13,650
cell phones, well, smartphones came around,

629
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,689
there was the cloud and internet and mobile data and

630
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:19,699
all the things you need to actually make it succeed.

631
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:22,439
And I think like going to the moon today in 2021

632
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,699
is a very similar story where you could technically do it in the sixties,

633
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,640
but it was an enormous amount of heavy lifting.

634
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,430
But now in 2021 like,

635
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:30,959
we have cheap rockets,

636
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,010
we have the ability to get things into low earth

637
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,119
orbit for millions of dollars instead of trillions of dollars.

638
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,670
Like the, the difference is drastic.

639
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,780
And so I think if we go to the moon now it's going to be like, oh, that was neat.

640
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,839
You went to the moon instead of holy crap. We went to the moon.

641
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,599
-- You know, it's like
-- Mars, how many times have we been to Mars now?

642
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:53,160
-- A lot.
-- Exactly. It's become common enough that you don't know the number.

643
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,449
-- Yeah, I agree. I agree.
-- We even put a little helicopter up there.

644
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,949
And so anyway, anyway, but the reason I bring this up,

645
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,770
there's actually this is part of part of,

646
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:09,069
I love how we always go off on these weird tangents. This one was on purpose. So

647
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:14,344
when the original Matrix movies were made, those movies, the technology,

648
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:17,444
I think the special effects were made in spite of

649
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:19,604
what we had available at the time, right?

650
00:27:19,614 --> 00:27:22,045
They did amazing things and they still look ok.

651
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:25,915
But now the thing I'm waiting for with the current one, when we make this new one

652
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,525
are the special effects going to be in line with

653
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:32,165
the kind of expectation of society of Oh OK.

654
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:34,795
We get this or are they going to push the envelope?

655
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,165
And that is going to be the question.

656
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:37,079
Well,

657
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:41,520
there's a third option where you essentially do the Star Wars thing of essentially

658
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,130
using all the possible modern special effects like the the volume, right? The

659
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,130
the volume is this thing where essentially it's a sound stage

660
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,150
covered in L CD screens.

661
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,339
Yeah, they use it in the Mandalorian and I'll try to look at

662
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:54,510
the

663
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,060
story about

664
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,530
the V FX artists react have a really great article on it

665
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,359
on you.

666
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:04,359
Um And so, but none of the thing is it's not just a sound stage with an L CD background,

667
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,170
it's a sound stage with an L CD background

668
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:09,880
and a computer controlled motion camera all synced together.

669
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,280
That's the magic part,

670
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,479
you know, that's the complicated bit.

671
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:19,670
And essentially, so you get these amazing new special effects,

672
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,449
but you keep it in line with the feel of the older stuff.

673
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:24,790
Otherwise you're going to annoy people. Right?

674
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,890
So, same thing with Star Wars where they d aged,

675
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:28,689
um, Luke Skywalker

676
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,119
and then turns out, you know,

677
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,849
they actually a I generated it and then the guy online did a better job of it.

678
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,219
So they hired him blah, blah, blah,

679
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,069
you know.

680
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,949
And so that's my hope is that they essentially use

681
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:42,280
all the, the tricks of the trade that are available today

682
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,069
but keep it in the feel and the, the

683
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:49,109
gestalt, I hate to use that word because it's German and it's pretentious. But the

684
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,400
gestalt

685
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,709
of the original three movies.

686
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,949
-- Yeah,
-- I mean, I would, I would accept that. I, I hope so. I,

687
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,380
I'm, I want to like it.

688
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,729
That's what I just keep saying, but I,

689
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,060
I'll never forget

690
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:07,500
going to see the second Matrix movie in the theater and being like,

691
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,040
that wasn't a very good movie.

692
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:12,780
And then I went to see the third movie and I remember walking out of it and I said,

693
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:18,060
I feel like I've been stolen from, for buying a ticket because it was so bad.

694
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:21,140
And that's why I won't watch any of the newer Star Wars films.

695
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:24,319
I've seen like all the Star Wars stuff, but I,

696
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:28,449
I feel free after the last one because it had space horses.

697
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:32,900
And so now I have no qualms if I if I watch another one, great.

698
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,250
-- If I don't watch another one, that's ok too because space
-- horses,

699
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,119
I feel like at this point watching all the Star Wars is like completing chemo.

700
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,150
Like yes, that's

701
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,189
if you have to do chemo, you should complete it. But if you can avoid it, just, yeah,

702
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,849
that is not a fair comparison in any way.

703
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:53,359
I'm not saying Star Wars the later films cause cancer. I'm heavily implying it.

704
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,819
They were bad.

705
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:56,569
Oh

706
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:57,819
It's

707
00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:58,839
that,

708
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:01,859
that's my fear of the Matrix Four. Like I saw the trailer and uh

709
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:06,810
so we're running ourselves out of time. We only have a few more minutes

710
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,390
and I feel like we've touched on nothing of

711
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,079
the things I was hoping we would talk about.

712
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:11,910
But that's ok.

713
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,900
So I guess here is the question

714
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,069
that we can all think about

715
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:21,319
as we end. This one is so if you look at

716
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,839
the Matrix movies, we find out at the end that supposedly this was all planned

717
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:28,750
and this has been done a bunch of times

718
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,780
and it's just kind of how it all works.

719
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:34,569
Yeah, because the human body is not a power generating battery.

720
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:38,099
Well, we know that it was supposed to have been actually in the original script.

721
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:40,290
It was meant to be like compute power

722
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:43,500
and they, the the studio thought

723
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:46,530
audience wouldn't understand that which they may not have back then.

724
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,579
So they wanted to call it, oh, it's a battery. Instead.

725
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:50,930
But obviously everyone knows like love thermodynamics.

726
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:54,099
There's no way a human body can generate more power than it consumes blah blah, blah,

727
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:54,420
blah blah.

728
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:59,119
But so in my brain, I just always think about compute devices and batteries.

729
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,949
So anyway, anyway,

730
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,609
we find out about like the architect and the

731
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:04,640
oracle and this was all planned and whatever blah,

732
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,319
blah, blah, blah blah.

733
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:06,430
And

734
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:07,560
it, it,

735
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,369
it, it really makes me think of the fact that like

736
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,900
you are a compute system, you are an artificial intelligence,

737
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:19,329
you are theoretically infinitely smart

738
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:25,300
and this is the freaking best you can do. This was a terrible society.

739
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:26,380
And

740
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,869
what just ii I don't know.

741
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,500
Yeah, like if you want to keep the humans in tanks,

742
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:35,900
put some plexiglass over the top of them instead of that gooey stuff.

743
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:36,800
I don't know anyway.

744
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,599
But I guess that's part of it as well is in any story,

745
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:41,459
there's always going to be plot holes.

746
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:45,530
And I feel like the super intelligent A I isn't very super intelligent, which

747
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,439
-- I guess well,
-- and maybe put this in the journals.

748
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,430
But if you want to see some or read some

749
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:53,829
in my opinion, more interesting more, I don't want to say realistic,

750
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,750
but I think well thought out, yeah, we're going to go with well thought out

751
00:31:56,969 --> 00:32:00,890
science fiction along these lines. Charles Strauss's Story Glasshouse

752
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:04,390
is really intriguing. I have not read that one.

753
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,239
It's, it was not a commercial success.

754
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,109
How do I know this because he actually wrote about this on his blog last week.

755
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,130
But it was one of my, it's one of my favorite stories from him.

756
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,780
And it's funny because the actual real British Glasshouse is

757
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,430
the reason I now make my bed every morning.

758
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,280
There was a British drill sergeant. She was talking about

759
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:25,319
one of the reasons they have this discipline is because

760
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:28,339
when you make your bed in the morning, no matter how crap your day is

761
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:29,280
when it's done,

762
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,160
-- you have a nice bed to go home to.
-- I agree. I do the same because I find

763
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,270
that having

764
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,520
a, a made bed at the end of my day

765
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,199
definitely is helpful. Um

766
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,859
So, ok, so the thing I always think of that if you want to talk about like, what I,

767
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:47,800
what I envision A is to really be, it's um what is the, the, the book?

768
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,020
Um I have no mouth and I must scream. It's what a Harlan Ellison

769
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,250
short story

770
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,579
that's like every time I think of a I, I'm like, that's it.

771
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,780
That's the story

772
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,619
of how it should have turned out

773
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,910
pretty much. Well, that's the other thing is I hate the term A I because

774
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:08,920
like, are we talking general A I, are we talking like evil terminator? A I?

775
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,219
Are we talking happy

776
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:14,000
A I is clearly some sort of self-aware giant

777
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,900
computer system that apparently only goal is to perpetuate,

778
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,560
-- perpetuate its existence,
-- right?

779
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,800
And we've had a bunch of those A I movies and stories where, you know,

780
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,739
they keep the humans alive.

781
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,640
Why? Because that's what we do.

782
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:25,989
Uh,

783
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,170
well, that's not what they do though.

784
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,660
They hate the humans, they just, they need them for their compute power,

785
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,390
apparently.

786
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,099
I mean, I mean, more in general terms of A I stories, you know,

787
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:37,390
where they're keeping the humans alive.

788
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,000
-- Why? Because that's what we do. Right. It's tradition.
-- What, what is that?

789
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,640
The thought experiment of? You?

790
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,660
Tell an A I job is to make paper clips

791
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,040
and it turns the whole universe into paper clips pretty

792
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:49,630
much. Actually, I'll put a link in the show notes. There's this, like,

793
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:53,910
there's this amazing game called universal paper clips on the internet and like,

794
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,430
if you want to get fired from your job,

795
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:59,170
go play this game because it's amazing and it's like all button pushing text.

796
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,500
-- It's, it's phenomenal.
-- There's an even better one.

797
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,439
The TV, show Lex has those self replicating.

798
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:07,530
Please tell me you've seen the, the TV series, Lex.

799
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:09,659
I watch like, no TV. You know, this,

800
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:12,850
-- well, this is from 30 years ago. It doesn't
-- matter. I've never seen it.

801
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:13,590
I

802
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,208
know it, Lex is,

803
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,899
it's only one of the best ever weird

804
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:20,580
Canadian science fiction TV shows

805
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:21,070
all

806
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:21,889
of.

807
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,199
Yeah. Well, oh, worse. The series is a Canadian and German Coro.

808
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,840
Yeah. You've never heard of it? And I'm, I,

809
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,199
-- I, yes, this is
-- why I've heard of it.

810
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:33,060
I've just never watched it because I don't watch very much TV.

811
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,820
-- Is there a book?
-- I read the book.

812
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,620
I don't think there's a book.

813
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:42,149
So if you're a TV, producer or a movie maker, write the book,

814
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,699
so I don't have to watch your stuff.

815
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,120
That

816
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:45,139
sounds, that sounds mean.

817
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,540
Um, anyway, all right, I'm going to call this, this,

818
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,590
I feel like was a super rambly weird episode.

819
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,389
But man, it was fun and if nothing else, I had a blast researching all this. So

820
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,629
if you made it this far, go watch the Matrix movies again,

821
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,010
you'll only partially regret it when you get done with the third one.

822
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,050
