00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,689
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

1
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,520
Kurt Siefried and my partner in taking pain over the counter pain medication. Josh

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,710
-- Reser,
-- I didn't take any over the counter.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,819
So Kurt is laughing because I don't, maybe I'll leave it in. I don't know.

4
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,549
But right before we started recording, Kurt's like, oh,

5
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:25,530
I should go take some ibuprofen quick and then he like left to go take medicine,

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,329
which is just,

7
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,790
I guess that's being old.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,490
-- Well,
-- I just, I have to train myself now that like if I'm in pain, like sore body pain,

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,669
I, I need to take Ibuprofen or Aspirin or something because

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,990
I hear you.

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,409
I'm, I'm older now and I'm out of shape and it's just,

12
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,009
I'll feel better if I take Ibuprofen.

13
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:42,042
It is true.

14
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:45,213
You know, that's one of the funny things I recognize now that I'm a bit,

15
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:50,733
we'll say older when I was young, I was obsessed with not taking medicine and

16
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:53,423
not wearing coats when it's cold. And

17
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:54,573
you know what I mean?

18
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:58,623
Like, just being a general moron and now if it's cold,

19
00:00:58,632 --> 00:01:00,373
I turn the heat on and I wear sweatshirts

20
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:02,713
and coats I don't wear shorts outside and when I

21
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,896
or I take medicine and I rest and sleep and

22
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:08,255
it's nothing at all like it used to be.

23
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:11,945
I, I generally, yeah, like, it's funny because I was brought up to layer.

24
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:13,466
So I never had that thing with like

25
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:15,536
not wearing clothes outside when it's cold because also

26
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:16,255
Canada.

27
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:20,536
And, but what I do notice now is I see younger people walking around

28
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:24,045
and I literally want to open my car window and shout at them like zip up your jacket,

29
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:24,816
it's cold out

30
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,610
or like, you know, hand them some gloves or something.

31
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,779
-- I think that's as old person as you can get like literally,
-- yeah,

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,089
like I just want them to be warm.

33
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:34,849
So,

34
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,949
yeah, well, that kind of leads to today's topic, right?

35
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,449
Which is,

36
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,569
so you and I have been back and forth kind

37
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,650
of discussing this idea of open source specifically as,

38
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,150
as

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,349
how it relates to natural resources and,

40
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,800
and essentially how do you manage natural resources?

41
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,730
So you don't like strip mind the planet and you know,

42
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,269
destroy it, right?

43
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:57,620
Well, I mean, so there's a little bit of background to this actually. And

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,099
I mean, we've talked over the last probably couple of years.

45
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,360
I mean,

46
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,500
at this point about kind of how open

47
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,990
source works from a larger community perspective and

48
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,350
kind of in the last few, I'd say the last six months,

49
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:20,779
there have been a lot of banter amongst open source developers

50
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,360
basically pushing back a little bit uh along this like whole supply chain.

51
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:28,039
I am not a supplier

52
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,820
like I don't want to use multi factor authentication to use your ecosystem.

53
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,279
Like I just want to develop stuff and not worry about any of this other crap. And

54
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,580
there was I I forget I'll try to find the post. It was

55
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,839
what was the latest one titled? Like I am not your supplier or something like that.

56
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,160
That,

57
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:44,289
yeah, I'm not your supplier.

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,169
Like I don't have a contractual like,

59
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:48,820
and that's what always gets me is not only am I not your player?

60
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,419
Like I don't have a contractual relationship with you.

61
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,779
My license explicitly disclaims any warranty and,

62
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:58,809
or responsibility I have for the software because

63
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:02,589
otherwise I would be sued into oblivion and be broke because at some point,

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,240
everybody's software has had a bug that cost the company several $1000 to fix.

65
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,339
And if the company decided to, you know,

66
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,970
sue that person for several $1000 they would probably lose.

67
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:15,190
But that developer's life or project would be wrecked for several months.

68
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,000
I mean, probably

69
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,399
you want to deal with that stress.

70
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,600
No,

71
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,740
no, I do not.

72
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:25,759
And so conveniently enough,

73
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,110
it's covered by the license which what and what really offends

74
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,830
me too is that all the commercial licenses also do this,

75
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,139
you know,

76
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,820
where they explicitly say like you can't use

77
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,630
this for nuclear software control because there's,

78
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,750
there's regulations in that space on the software.

79
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,149
So

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,309
you can't use Java.

81
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,800
But I was,

82
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,130
so I've been thinking about this and I think I have two sort

83
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,350
of a thought A and a thought B which might help frame this.

84
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,750
So

85
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,699
the first thing is if we're going to compare this to natural resources,

86
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,589
then there's that whole thing of managing natural resources

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,679
and sort of the fact that some natural resources are

88
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,990
finite, like very finite

89
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,619
and some are basically infinite. So a good example of this would be

90
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,509
if you want to look at a mountain

91
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:04,580
that's essentially an infinite

92
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,169
resource. And I caveat that I'm making air quotes here.

93
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:07,830
So for example,

94
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:11,229
you can take a picture of that mountain and distribute it infinitely.

95
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,770
No, no problem, right?

96
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,190
And that's sort of what software is like in

97
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,149
that making that first copy is kind of tricky.

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,858
But once you made that first copy,

99
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,748
distributing it and you know, you just stick it on github

100
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,199
and everybody can download it however much like the natural world.

101
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:28,188
If 10,000 people decide to go see that mountain in person, now we have a problem,

102
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:28,678
right?

103
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:29,278
I mean,

104
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,259
and so I think part of this leads to the second thought of,

105
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,968
part of the problem is that we have this

106
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:36,859
infinite supply of like software say which yeah,

107
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,598
I can distribute the software millions,

108
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:41,118
like open SSL everybody on the planet uses it.

109
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:42,348
Basically if you own a TV.

110
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:47,204
But what that leads to at some point is TV, man, manufacturers, TV, users,

111
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:51,114
whatever people going to the open SSL people and wanting them to do stuff.

112
00:04:51,154 --> 00:04:54,285
And that is a very finite resource. And I think this is,

113
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:59,785
but we have this infinite resource but it leads to usage of these finite resources.

114
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:00,744
Yes,

115
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:01,954
because to put it bluntly,

116
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:04,744
if people just used open SSL and didn't complain and didn't

117
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:07,755
demand bug fixes and left the open SSL developers alone.

118
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,375
Cool. I think that's the dream. A lot of open source developers have.

119
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:13,454
Well, it's simple, just don't put your email address in there.

120
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,510
I don't disagree

121
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,380
with everything you said.

122
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,480
And I don't know if mountain is

123
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:25,480
the right way to think of this even it's,

124
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,519
there's like so many pieces

125
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:32,040
and the thing I keep thinking of is when we think of open source,

126
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:36,000
it's often thought of in a very supplier context, right?

127
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:43,209
Not as a I am going to a place and acquiring resources. And I think that's

128
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,869
the thing I keep thinking of here is

129
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:49,630
when people talk about like the secure supply chain,

130
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,329
open source is a huge part of it versus

131
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:55,040
I am acquiring a resource

132
00:05:55,679 --> 00:06:01,540
outside of my organization that I then have to shape into the thing I'm going to build

133
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,260
if that makes sense.

134
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,519
Well, I think the more the point of my observation is that we can't

135
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:08,820
separate

136
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,089
the finite and infinite.

137
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,589
They are tightly linked like a simple example is, well, Mastodon is a great example.

138
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,329
They have over 3000 issues in their github

139
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:19,459
and it's just out of control. It's a giant

140
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:22,795
of fire to the point where basically your choices are either, you know,

141
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,674
kill it with fire or

142
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:28,984
get 1000 volunteers to handle three issues. Each. Good luck with that. And so

143
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:33,424
I think the problem is, is that a lot of people focus on the infinite side of like, oh,

144
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,494
you just download the software.

145
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:37,894
What's the big deal? Well, yeah, there is no big deal until

146
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:41,554
one in 1000 people ask for the developers five minutes of time

147
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:43,515
and all of a sudden the developer runs out of time.

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,910
Right. Well, and they're doing it like for free,

149
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:48,079
you know,

150
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:51,160
-- you don't,
-- the majority of them are. Yeah, or actually at a

151
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,010
cost to themselves.

152
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,390
Right. Right. Yes. Absolutely.

153
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,609
And I think that's the thing I keep trying to untangle in

154
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,480
my brain and this is where I don't have a good,

155
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,470
a good way to look at this. I, I, so it, it's funny too.

156
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,600
I put a thing on Masted on a couple of days ago basically saying I am

157
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:12,250
interested in information about how companies at the

158
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,890
start of the industrial revolution before we had

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,839
many of the rules we have governing like clean air

160
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,579
and clean water and pollution and things like that.

161
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,690
Like how these companies basically ravage the resources around them for

162
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,559
their benefit with just blatant disregard for everything around them.

163
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,829
Well, and worse what they did to their workforce.

164
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,350
Well, ok. So here's the thing and that's what everyone keeps coming back to.

165
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,489
Everyone keeps coming back to the workforce.

166
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,220
And I think workers' rights while very important are not.

167
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,690
Well,

168
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,850
I don't think that's a valid comparison and

169
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:44,929
in this context and I think it distracts from

170
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:48,070
what open source should be. It's not about treating

171
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,130
the workers correctly. It's about thinking about this as a resource.

172
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,690
You are just like destroying along the way.

173
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:58,100
But workers are a resource and, and I guess one comment there is that

174
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,519
workers are a resource that can stand up for themselves and mountains can't

175
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,480
unless somebody champions the mountain.

176
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,109
That's exactly it. Right. That's exactly it is

177
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,170
like there's no open source union,

178
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,029
there's really no way for all of the open source developers to come together.

179
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,079
I really and truly think this is much closer to like a forest of trees

180
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,079
where it's a,

181
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,179
a bunch of independent things that don't

182
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,940
even necessarily want to interact with each other

183
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,040
that we are treating as a singular entity.

184
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,230
-- And, and we're cutting them all down
-- well.

185
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:32,630
And the other kind of vibe I'm getting from a lot of these arguments is it kind of

186
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,630
reminds me of the whole arguments around famous people

187
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,909
and how famous people sort of have this duty to

188
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,479
like, let you take a photo with them or sign, you know, if you go up in front of them,

189
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:44,619
like can you sign this and they have to sign it because they're famous and they,

190
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,580
if they want to continue being famous, they kind of have to pander to their fan base,

191
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:48,969
right?

192
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,099
But that is not the case with most open source developers,

193
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:57,039
most open source developers do not want to be famous. They don't, you know,

194
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,390
they just, I needed a library to do acts.

195
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,960
So I, I wrote one and I just, I released it because, you know,

196
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:04,239
that's a decent thing to do.

197
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,760
You know, like the person who wrote Lib JP,

198
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,349
it was part of his thesis defense. As far as I can tell

199
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,119
the guy, I don't think he was planning for it to be here 25 years, 30 years later,

200
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,520
you know, embedded in everything,

201
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,049
you know. Right.

202
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,729
And,

203
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,760
and that's the thing I keep coming back to with a lot of these arguments online of,

204
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,520
well, the developer should act otherwise

205
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,770
like people won't use their software and it's kind of like, well, OK,

206
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:30,669
I know for myself if you don't like my software and don't want to use it. Oh

207
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:31,849
OK.

208
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:37,049
Like I, I'm not bothered and if you want to fork it and do it yourself, uh cool again,

209
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,729
we can't treat everybody with the same

210
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,510
or paint everybody with the same brush I think is the expression.

211
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,570
But fundamentally, I,

212
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,609
I feel like I just keep coming back to the

213
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,859
fact that these open source developers don't owe anybody anything.

214
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,789
And again, the licenses explicitly disclaim this kind of responsibility.

215
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,969
They, they do remember XML has

216
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,049
a uh has hash dos,

217
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,989
right? It happened a few months after I started at Red Hat, right?

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,659
And I remember tracking down that one developer and

219
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,530
straight up, he's like, yeah, I can fix this,

220
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,270
but I don't have like a free weekend for two months.

221
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,469
And so we're like, OK, well, we'll, you know,

222
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,900
we'll do it because we need this sooner than two months.

223
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,590
This is I think a really important point that you just brought up

224
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,200
and this is something I've been also thinking about. So

225
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:18,530
if you look at the

226
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,890
kind of the history of open source, you see organizations like Red Hat and Google,

227
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,849
I'll pick on those two just because I'm very familiar with them.

228
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,210
You see these organizations like Red Hat and Google

229
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:28,900
that

230
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,669
used open source in amazing ways,

231
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,979
but they also were not taking from open

232
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,010
-- source, they were involved in open source,
-- right?

233
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,570
Well, they understand sustainability that, I mean, that was a big mantra at Red Hat.

234
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,989
And that's one of the actual useful things I took away from my uh tenure at Red Hat was

235
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:49,549
the sustainability aspect of everything,

236
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,440
especially open

237
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,719
-- source projects.
-- That's the thing is

238
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,150
when you're a Red Hat or a Google and you are sending

239
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,770
developers into the world to help it is vastly different than when

240
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,150
you are a consumer of a piece of open source and you're

241
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,479
sending bug reports back and now there is nothing wrong with that.

242
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:11,570
I'm not trying to say like using something and sending bug reports is bad.

243
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,669
But I think

244
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,820
there's definitely an aspect of

245
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:18,239
how do we balance that?

246
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:18,590
Because if,

247
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:22,780
if every let's say you pick on something like curl that has literally millions,

248
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:24,580
probably billions of users.

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,229
If, if a million people each file a bug in curl,

250
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:34,750
like it's probably what do you, you know what I mean? What do you even do with that?

251
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,080
And I think that's, that's the thing.

252
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,429
I keep wrap trying to wrap my head around is there's nothing wrong with using curl.

253
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,070
And I'm glad millions of people use curl.

254
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,710
But if a million people filed a bug all of

255
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:49,000
-- a sudden now it becomes a disaster
-- and that leads to

256
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,349
another thing I was thinking about. So I was thinking about offensive speech,

257
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:53,950
just bear with me for a minute.

258
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,940
So if I say something to one person,

259
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,099
I can probably tailor the message to not offend them.

260
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,469
And we've talked about this in the past where

261
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,000
if you say something to 10 million people,

262
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,820
like I had ice cream for breakfast,

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,760
some of them are going to be offended like, hey,

264
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,109
I'm lactose intolerant or that goes whatever.

265
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,309
And again, I think that's part of the challenge with open sources.

266
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:14,020
If I write some software and release it and 10 people use it.

267
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,349
Cool. That's probably ok.

268
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,219
But the problem is when a million people use it, it's gonna number one,

269
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,659
they're gonna find a whole bunch of edge cases and corner cases.

270
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:23,539
And curl is a great example because Curl talks to everything.

271
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,900
And so, you know, all these people are like, I could rewrite curl in a weekend.

272
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:32,150
You know, I would love for Daniel to do like a probably a 17 hour talk on.

273
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,659
Like here's the top seven, you know, top 17 edge cases we found

274
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:38,515
-- and curl
-- 17, there's,

275
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,015
well, the top 17,

276
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:43,664
-- right?
-- I mean, there's, there's millions, that's literally the whole code base

277
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:46,705
is, is a catalog of exceptions, right?

278
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:48,614
And so I think that's part of the challenge too,

279
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,434
is as a software becomes more popular, it interacts with more other software.

280
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:55,784
You get more bugs, more feature requests more, hey, you know,

281
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:58,655
the the standard now implements this, can we also have G

282
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:00,344
compression or can we have

283
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:03,744
whatever, whatever, whatever, right? And, and curl implements like,

284
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
well, everything like literally like you,

285
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:07,799
it's a scary man page,

286
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,559
right?

287
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,580
And that's, I mean,

288
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,380
it's a perfect example of a successful open source project in that.

289
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,409
How many options does it have? Well, all of them, that's the answer, right?

290
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,190
And if it's missing one, they'll add it.

291
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,979
And again, this goes to sustainability

292
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,679
of OK.

293
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:26,159
So if I file a bug report am I making more work for them or am I kind of a net benefit?

294
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:27,669
Well, the answer is you're making more work for them.

295
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,880
Whereas if you come to them with a,

296
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,270
like a bug report and maybe like a patch, maybe the patch isn't great,

297
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,549
but it's maybe less work for them.

298
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:35,780
So

299
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,919
I guess it goes back to sustainability of like,

300
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,489
it's like having a little kid help make breakfast,

301
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:46,669
right? It's not usually actually that helpful.

302
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,650
But if you also want that little kid to grow

303
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,380
up and learn how to make breakfast on their own,

304
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,409
you got to deal with this.

305
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,099
So again,

306
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:57,080
this whole sustainability long term thing kind of like is this a net benefit?

307
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,369
Well, in the next month, no, in the next 10 years,

308
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,840
maybe this company does grow up and do better.

309
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:05,179
Maybe they don't, maybe they just keep causing those problems, right?

310
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:06,460
And I think that's part of the,

311
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:09,900
the thing is right now we're at a stage where all these companies are like,

312
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:13,159
I want breakfast and some of them are like, I will help make breakfast.

313
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,840
Look, I put the eggs in the toaster,

314
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,659
it's cooking, I'm helping, you know, and it's like, OK, no, we,

315
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,140
we don't cook eggs in the toaster,

316
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,929
you know,

317
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,609
and so I think the next few years are going to be very painful for open source because,

318
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,969
well, OK, OK, you can't say that though.

319
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:28,210
-- Everybody's
-- using it

320
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:29,809
like everyone is using it.

321
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:30,679
But,

322
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,580
but it, it's like saying the next few years are going to be painful for the trees,

323
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,330
you just cut them down, they're gone. They're,

324
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,849
well, and that's the question is how many open source developers

325
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,659
go? II I quit or I give up or I don't need to deal with it.

326
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,169
That's right. That's right. Exactly. That it isn't going to be zero.

327
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,489
And that's the thing I keep thinking of is

328
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,320
we are ravaging open source in an unsustainable manner today, I think,

329
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,289
and

330
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:01,130
it's only going to get worse. The thing I keep thinking of

331
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:02,210
is

332
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:06,309
if you pull in a bunch of open source into your product today

333
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,950
in five years,

334
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,280
it's gonna be a lot harder to

335
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:13,000
upgrade assuming you haven't been upgrading constantly.

336
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,719
You know what I mean?

337
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,599
And I think then

338
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,650
you're going to see like, like in five or 10 years,

339
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,559
I think you're going to see a lot of technical debt is gonna come due.

340
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,520
And

341
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,479
if we don't do anything,

342
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,309
it's going to create

343
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:30,280
a nightmare scenario for a lot of developers.

344
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:33,549
And I think they will quit because they're gonna be like, I'm sick of these bugs.

345
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,919
I'm sick of talking to these people like I, I don't want to do this anymore.

346
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:40,440
-- It's not fun.
-- Well and worse. That kind of what you're describing is LTs, right?

347
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,419
Long term support.

348
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:44,349
And that is a thing, for example, with ubuntu and Red Hat, you know,

349
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,659
my favorite example being Red Hat, where when I explain to people,

350
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,500
Red Hat's life cycles and what it really means.

351
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,075
So very simply put Red Hat will release a version of Linux

352
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:52,875
that they will support for 13 years.

353
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,114
And when I say they will support it,

354
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,565
they guarantee that your accounting app that they have never seen

355
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:59,325
and will never see will run on it for 13 years.

356
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:01,275
And, and that's amazing when you think about it.

357
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:06,255
And the thing is that is not sustainable for the vast majority of projects.

358
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:10,494
Like I I, I'm not going to have an LTs version and a feature,

359
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:12,015
full version of my software.

360
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:14,715
I'm not going to maintain that slow fork because

361
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:16,994
to put it bluntly, the people that want that

362
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,270
I don't,

363
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,429
they're the kind of people I don't want to

364
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,380
deal with because they're not upgrading their software.

365
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,960
-- They're, you know, they're making crazy corporate demands
-- and,

366
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:27,000
and they pay for it in many instances.

367
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,409
I mean, Red Hat, it's not cheap to get proper LTs support from the likes of redhead

368
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:31,539
Ur

369
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,270
Muntu

370
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,789
as it shouldn't be.

371
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,830
And

372
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:41,080
I think that's one of the places we've become kind of spoiled in the world of it

373
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,099
is

374
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,909
the likes of Microsoft and, and Red Hat and ubuntu

375
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,669
have made a lot of this very long term functionality.

376
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,469
I think it's ruined some of our expectations.

377
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,010
Whereas when you get something from open source, it is, it is completely plausible,

378
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,890
you will import a dependency and

379
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:00,099
tomorrow

380
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,979
it will have a breaking change. You know what I mean?

381
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:06,719
That's just how it works sometimes. And that's great.

382
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:10,638
Or that version ceases to be supported because they went to 4.0

383
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:13,759
-- well,
-- and I think in, in the vast majority of open source,

384
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:15,138
there's no concept of support.

385
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:17,818
It's always amusing to me when you look at like open SSL

386
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:21,378
where they usually have like the current version and they support the prior version

387
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:24,298
where the vast majority of open source projects, like they,

388
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,138
they don't really even support the current version.

389
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,749
They support whatever is running out of G

390
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:29,739
and like, you know,

391
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:31,862
much less old versions.

392
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:35,822
And this goes back to, you know, again, we can't paint them all with one brush.

393
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:37,062
But if you,

394
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,212
it's just so bizarre to me, it's like you're, I guess, fundamentally

395
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,862
maybe part of the pro two is survivor bias in that the I, what do I call them?

396
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,151
The sort of the sustainable,

397
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:49,741
responsible users of open source are not the ones making

398
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,371
problems and causing grief. So

399
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:53,703
never hear from them and see them.

400
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:57,354
And it's only sort of the demanding people who stick out because

401
00:17:57,364 --> 00:18:00,053
they're the ones filing bugs saying like I want long term support,

402
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,264
I want you to fix this bug.

403
00:18:01,274 --> 00:18:05,364
I want a so like I want a SOC two report on your development process,

404
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:09,043
-- I want salsa signing, I demand two fa
-- I mean, I don't,

405
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:12,284
I think there's some of those cases and they, of course,

406
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,774
get brought up and we all laugh at them and be like, ha, ha.

407
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,875
What a silly person. I don't think that's, is that common.

408
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:20,406
-- I think we just, it's, it's very survivor bias.
-- No. No.

409
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,706
What I'm saying is the survivor bias aspect of.

410
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:24,245
Yeah. Yeah. But, but hang on.

411
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,026
But I think the important part is that

412
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:31,786
nearly every open source project that has a reasonable amount of use.

413
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:33,836
It's just death by 1000 cuts.

414
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:36,625
It might not be someone saying, fill up my sock to report for me.

415
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:37,666
It's just

416
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,040
this constant flow

417
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,569
of bugs and complaints

418
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,920
because let's face it. Every piece of software has bugs.

419
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,290
It's gonna do something, someone, it doesn't do something,

420
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,400
someone wants whatever.

421
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,390
Well, or it needs enhancements. Like,

422
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:53,640
like the fact that master on you can't undead people, you know, and the guy,

423
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,199
it's in the bug report, his cat killed the user by stepping on the wrong key,

424
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,959
which is really funny. But,

425
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:02,800
and, and the solution is we'll fix it in the database

426
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,819
-- which look, it's open source
-- technically is a solution. But that's,

427
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:09,500
that's like saying, you know, my car's broken, we'll go fix it like,

428
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,689
-- yeah, but
-- that's a really good analogy.

429
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,380
You say your car is broken.

430
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,260
-- I say, go get it fixed and you say I want you to fix it for free.
-- Well, no, no.

431
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,930
But what if that part keeps breaking.

432
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:23,140
-- Maybe that part needs to be re-engineered and
-- I mean, potentially.

433
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,300
-- But ok, so that's another example.
-- If the cars keep catching fire, then maybe

434
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,310
-- you as the manufacturer,
-- this is what I was hoping.

435
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,390
I was hoping to talk to Kurt and refine my thinking on this topic because

436
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:35,510
nothing

437
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:37,109
refines my thinking

438
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,459
like Kurt's stories. Now that that's an excellent example.

439
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:42,270
So let's say you have a product

440
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:44,790
and a piece of it keeps breaking,

441
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:45,819
right?

442
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:49,479
You're going to go to the, the whoever made the product and say you need to fix this.

443
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,640
Like there's warranties,

444
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,099
there's consumer protection laws like you can't do this now yet.

445
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,390
Don't you dare interrupt.

446
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,569
Now, if the reason it's breaking

447
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,209
is because I went to the forest and I'm using the wrong kind

448
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:05,859
of wood or I mined the wrong mineral or something like that.

449
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,280
No one's gonna say, hey,

450
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:11,285
you screwed this up. You should be doing a better job.

451
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,545
They're gonna say, no, you're the manufacturer.

452
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:14,704
You got the thing,

453
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,314
freaking get the right thing like this is your responsibility to fix it.

454
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:21,224
And I think that is the disconnect in some of

455
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:25,864
these instances is we have end users using a thing

456
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:26,785
and then

457
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:27,574
the,

458
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:29,785
the company making the thing

459
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:35,665
is going through the forest and demanding or asking for

460
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,660
a different solution. And I think that is the crux of what we see today.

461
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,979
Well, and also the user going directly to the forest and you know, you, you see those

462
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:47,660
bug reports of like

463
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,449
literally like uh he's got that statement on curl like, no, I didn't hack you.

464
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:55,609
It's called open source.

465
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:56,770
And that's like, no,

466
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,849
because literally this is why my name isn't the thing that you're using.

467
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,750
It's I didn't hack your car.

468
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,239
I remember the Apache Software foundation used to get tons of emails like that where

469
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,290
when you stood up Apache, you had the default page and people would,

470
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:15,589
they'd stand up a site and when something would go wrong with like DNS,

471
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,369
it would show the default Apache page instead.

472
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,650
And they're like, oh, you hacked us and it's like, no,

473
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,400
you screwed up DNS don't use DNS.

474
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:22,310
But

475
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,750
anyway, anyway.

476
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,630
But, and I think that's part of it is, there's this,

477
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,989
it's this weird and wonderful ecosystem

478
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,349
and there are not really official relationships

479
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:36,010
and I guess maybe that's part of the problem is companies

480
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,329
and commercial entities really

481
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,130
aren't used to dealing with that.

482
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,530
You know,

483
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,810
because like most companies don't kind of get a bunch of volunteers

484
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,140
in on the manufacturing floor to help them build cars like that.

485
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,890
That's just not a thing, I hope.

486
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,099
Right.

487
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:51,599
Right.

488
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:52,459
And

489
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,699
whereas in the software world that is completely normal and how

490
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,130
you do it because how else would you do it?

491
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,900
Right. I'm not writing my own web server. I know how complicated that is.

492
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,910
But like I said, I think the problem is,

493
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,619
is it's coming to a head where people realize now that open source is everywhere.

494
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,859
The bill, essentially the bill is coming due.

495
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,280
Kind of like with environmentalism, it's like, uh you know,

496
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,579
uh like a perfect example is forestry companies

497
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:15,020
finally realized it was cheaper to actually replant

498
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,660
the trees because then they have more trees to harvest sooner than to just clear,

499
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,569
cut it and like

500
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,010
leave it to

501
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:23,119
erode and be destroyed.

502
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,969
I wonder sometimes how much

503
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:28,199
of the company doing the right thing sometimes,

504
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:30,609
like in the terms of forestry management or,

505
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,890
or water management or whatever is because they have to,

506
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,099
or because it's, it's more economical. I have a suspicion.

507
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:40,160
-- It's because they have to,
-- uh, it's, it's a bit of both.

508
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,030
Like, so, for example,

509
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,030
locally there's a lot of talk of now using drones to plant seeds

510
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,609
to regrow the forest because

511
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,920
part of the beauty is like when you plant a seedling, like a small, you know,

512
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,310
little baby tree, like you got in great school, I'm guessing, you know,

513
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,439
that costs a couple bucks to plant and only a few percent make it.

514
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,689
Whereas you, you fire seeds out of a drone and yeah,

515
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,180
if only even 1/100 of a percent make it.

516
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:01,530
It's so ridiculously efficient.

517
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,599
It works.

518
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,079
I think part of the other problem too is,

519
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:06,359
is a lot of companies are sort of hoping or

520
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:08,800
expecting other companies to pick up the slack and,

521
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,160
you know, we have this free rider problem.

522
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:13,229
Like you can only harvest a tree once,

523
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,000
right?

524
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,319
You can only cut down the tree once,

525
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,260
but you can make an infinite number of demands to some poor

526
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:20,660
open source developer or project.

527
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,819
Well, you can't because they will quit,

528
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:26,459
-- but until they do,
-- right, they,

529
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:29,660
they kind of hold all the cards in that regard is they

530
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,540
can make the ultimate decision of like I'm out and that's it.

531
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,400
A lot of them though seem to be putting up like a lot of them.

532
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:40,209
It's, it's kind of like reading on Reddit, you know, am I the asshole? And it's like

533
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,790
some of these people are in clearly abusive relationships and it's just like, wow,

534
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,869
you need to get out and I'm, I'm not just talking about Reddit, all

535
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:49,119
the asshole I'm talking about some of these open source projects where

536
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,760
like I look at some of these projects and what they deal with.

537
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,010
Why do you keep doing this? You know, why, like the time zone guy,

538
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:58,750
literally one person holding together the world's time zone files.

539
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,170
Like, thank you.

540
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,250
But also

541
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:05,030
I would have maybe gone on strike for a month and like let everybody kind of

542
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,959
figure out that I'm important and they should all send me a dollar in the mail.

543
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:12,180
Uh Maybe, maybe, I mean, so here's another good example.

544
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:16,239
There's a, a new story SJVN wrote about it. Um

545
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,589
It was, it was shortly before Christmas. I think.

546
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,640
And there's a, a go project called Gorilla

547
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,040
and Gorilla basically said

548
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,569
they, they do, it's like a web, I think it's a web uh handling framework like HTP,

549
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:31,599
request, things like that.

550
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,359
And anyway, they basically said

551
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,479
we, we don't have time to do this anymore. I need help. No one helped.

552
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:40,310
And then they were finally like, we're, we're done, we're gonna basically,

553
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,599
this project is end of life.

554
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:42,770
They put a message on their

555
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,430
github.

556
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:45,510
And of course, there have been

557
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,109
some people,

558
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,119
I mean, some people basically were like, oh, I wanna help.

559
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,469
But at the same time, you can't just like hand the project over to

560
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:55,199
any random person,

561
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:59,050
right? Especially a well used project because like, where is that person from?

562
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,900
What are their intentions?

563
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,780
Are they actually going to help or are they going to help for a week and then give up

564
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,180
or install a crypto miner in it?

565
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,550
-- Right.
-- Exactly. And that literally happened somewhere else.

566
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:12,770
But anyway, and so there's this piece about, oh, what are,

567
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,589
what are we going to do about projects like this?

568
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:17,359
And of course, there's the usual, oh, just go get involved and like,

569
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:19,390
it's not generally that easy.

570
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,260
And additionally, the other thing I keep thinking of is

571
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,880
if there are a million

572
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:31,290
users of your library and each of them send one person like Mythical Man Month,

573
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,560
right?

574
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:35,540
You don't suddenly have a million times of the productivity. Now you have a mess

575
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:39,680
and you can't plausibly deal with that much stuff. And additionally,

576
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:43,130
if your project has 5000 dependencies,

577
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:46,650
you're not going to hire 5000 developers and send each one to a project.

578
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,270
-- Like that's just not a realistic thing to do.
-- Well, I think it's worse than that.

579
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,180
And by definition, any successful project has solved all the simple problems.

580
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:56,579
So only the complicated problems are left,

581
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:00,310
which means anybody that's going to get involved needs a level of expertise, right?

582
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,550
I'm always reminded of. Well, again, like environmental remediation is now a

583
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:06,469
per like it's a four year degree at university now,

584
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,650
you know, like when you look at a stream and you're like,

585
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,599
let's make this stream healthier.

586
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:12,359
What can we do?

587
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,390
And it's not like just a simple matter of like, let's pull out all the trash.

588
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,599
No, it's like let's spend several million dollars,

589
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:18,579
you know,

590
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:19,839
doing stuff to it.

591
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,719
Research, you know, maybe we need to put in a weir,

592
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:24,359
maybe we need to take out the weir whatever, right?

593
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:25,160
Put more rocks and

594
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,359
rocks in, you know,

595
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,920
all sorts of crazy things.

596
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,219
And I think that's a big challenge with a lot of these projects because that

597
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:34,959
everything is complicated now, like all the

598
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,229
there's no simple stuff. For example, I was looking

599
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:44,520
for some simple Red Xs to validate uh social media account names like Twitter, uh

600
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,760
reddit, whatever.

601
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,900
And what's fascinating is most of them don't actually properly document it unless

602
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,400
you actually go to the page to create one and then it'll like,

603
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,160
you intentionally create a mangled one and it's like, no, no, no, you,

604
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,500
you can only have 2 to 39 letters and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

605
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:01,699
And what's fun fact. So, Twitter says it has to be like 4 to 20 letters,

606
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:06,459
but there are one letter you, uh I DS on Twitter, like there's twitter.com/,

607
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:07,859
that's what the grandfather did, I guess.

608
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:08,489
Right? Because they're

609
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,739
like, go to twitter.com/a letter

610
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,380
and, you know, the account's more than 10 years old for sure.

611
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,209
Or every,

612
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,250
every account with up to four letters is already taken.

613
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,079
So they just

614
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,650
-- ignored that because that saves you a database. Look up now.
-- Yeah, exactly.

615
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:27,479
Yeah. It's, it's something even quote unquote simple like that.

616
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:30,280
I could not find a good resource for it and then I started building it and I'm like,

617
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:30,489
wow,

618
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,930
this is actually kind of complicated because there's rules like it can

619
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:36,239
have hyphens but it can't start with or end with a hyphen.

620
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:36,609
And then,

621
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,329
so just collecting

622
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,520
the actual, where is the rule posted about this social media network

623
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,989
that took me about half an hour each to actually find like an authoritative source,

624
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:51,430
right? And then I realized I just had to go through the workflow of them and

625
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:52,829
actually, you know,

626
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:55,030
but like, with Twitter, I had to also make sure I'm like,

627
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,869
I'm pretty sure I've seen shorter than four.

628
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,969
So then I had to, you know, this is a nontrivial.

629
00:27:58,979 --> 00:27:59,109
So,

630
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,400
so something that is quote unquote simple is a very nontrivial amount of work to get.

631
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:03,829
Right.

632
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,849
And you have to know what to look for in corner cases and, and I'm still left to wonder,

633
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:10,069
like, is there a twitter.com/ampersand,

634
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,760
do you remember in the Pearl book back in the day in the camel book?

635
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,780
They had the regular expression for validating email addresses in the

636
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,250
back and it was like 2.5 pages of regular expression.

637
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:23,810
Yeah, I know.

638
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:26,770
I mean, and I have one of those and I, I have a simplified one and it's just,

639
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,859
you know, for example,

640
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:31,810
I don't allow symbols in my email address names even though that's legal.

641
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,390
I'm like, I'm not dealing like

642
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,540
your email address better be less than 100 and 28 characters.

643
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,510
I think that's a reasonable max.

644
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:41,650
And like I've, you know, kind of filtered out some of the, uh,

645
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,239
the fancy characters that are allowed.

646
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,170
I'm like, no, that's

647
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:48,170
-- get a real email address. You know what
-- my favorite was, was back in the day.

648
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,890
I had an email alias of Star underscore Star, which looks like a little

649
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:52,430
face.

650
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:54,579
It broke so much stuff.

651
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,290
It was so good. It's totally valid. Like that's fine.

652
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:57,839
But

653
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:00,500
that's the thing when you learn what is actually a valid email address,

654
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,479
it's horrifying.

655
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,489
It's horrific. But ok,

656
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,180
but,

657
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:04,780
but

658
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:05,250
that,

659
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:06,020
that's part of the

660
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:07,130
resources.

661
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:10,010
That's part of the challenge is even if people want to help.

662
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:11,520
Yeah, it's great that you want to help.

663
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,109
But again, it's like my son, my son wants to help but like to fix the file server.

664
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,569
So, like, can you just be quiet while I do this?

665
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:18,949
I just,

666
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:24,109
I just had that over the weekend where I was fixing some computer stuff

667
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,000
and they're basically like, what can I do? I'm like, don't bother me. I

668
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,329
-- know.
-- Right. I feel

669
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:28,829
terrible.

670
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,949
But, you know, this isn't like we're not tailors and it's like you can just,

671
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,189
you can sweep the floor

672
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,579
and, you know, that would be helpful.

673
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,050
Yep. Yep. Like, no, it's just

674
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:40,949
like, ok, daddy's got to go fix the Z pools,

675
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:41,719
you know?

676
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,310
But what I, ok, this is,

677
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:45,180
yeah.

678
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,869
You know what, this reminds me of.

679
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,390
There's, I'll try to find this, there was a speed run of,

680
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,969
um, what, whats the

681
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,439
guesser? I think it's called the game where you have to figure out where you are

682
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:56,280
and,

683
00:29:56,449 --> 00:30:00,180
and there was, they were doing like a demo of this at a, at a games done quick,

684
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:03,599
which actually this podcast comes out on the first day of games.

685
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:06,119
Done quick. Awesome games done quick. I'll put a link in the show notes.

686
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,619
You should totally spend your week watching. Awesome games done quick.

687
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,270
But anyway, they're, they're doing this like,

688
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,880
demo of this and one of the guys is like, this is Japan.

689
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:14,939
There's too many reasons to explain.

690
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,520
I'm like, that's so good.

691
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,359
And it was funny because to me it, it just looked like a random road somewhere but,

692
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,989
like, to that guy, like, he knew exactly what was going on.

693
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,239
-- What's
-- funny
-- to me is when I watch those and they sort of like,

694
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,790
especially sort of eastern Europe slash a bit of western Europe.

695
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,400
I, there are cues for me, like the way buildings are built, the way the

696
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,750
gates, the fences, the just, there's, there's cues and hints.

697
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,949
Ok. So I, I guess, I don't, I don't think I have a clear picture.

698
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:47,099
I'm still not clear enough in my mind that I'm willing to write any of this down yet,

699
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:48,969
but I am comfortable

700
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,780
with

701
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,939
kind of some of the conclusions we have. Right. Like, obviously I, I still think

702
00:30:55,219 --> 00:31:00,189
it's more correct to view open source as a natural resource, like

703
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:03,339
water or forest or air whatever.

704
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,780
And I think

705
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,839
it's difficult maybe to

706
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,819
maybe apply pollution directly to it necessarily, or just, uh,

707
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,540
I think that's an aspect of it.

708
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,739
Yeah, I, I don't, I need to figure that one out.

709
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,069
I would say it's actually, it's not so much a natural resources,

710
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,859
it's part of an ecosystem of different natural resources

711
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:25,739
and it's all to quote the, it crowd, it's all interrelated, you know, you, you chop

712
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:27,339
down one tree in the rain forest and,

713
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:34,430
yeah. Yeah. To, I mean, to a degree, regardless. I think we all agree that

714
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:40,270
the way open source is being consumed today is on a path of unsustainability.

715
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:40,579
I

716
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,599
I think for me,

717
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:46,709
the biggest takeaway here is that the sort of the infinite use piece of this,

718
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,709
like looking at the picture of the mountain

719
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,640
is linked to the finite piece, right?

720
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,650
Because if a million people look at a picture of a mountain, at

721
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:58,520
least a few 100 of them are gonna want to go see the mountain in person.

722
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,520
And

723
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,280
I think a lot of people forget

724
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:04,479
that a successful open source project

725
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,030
is

726
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,469
1 to 5 people or less than a person dealing with the law of large numbers

727
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,959
like curl is a great example of that.

728
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:13,910
It's

729
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:18,510
right or Mastodon, right? You got a couple of core people dealing with

730
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,869
literally millions of new users now.

731
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,800
Good luck.

732
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:23,560
Yeah.

733
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:24,680
Yeah, it's,

734
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:30,369
it's tough, man. I, I'm gonna keep thinking about this one because

735
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:33,489
I feel like if, if nothing is done, I do think you're right.

736
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,729
I don't think open source will like collapse and die.

737
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,609
But I'm also not comfortable being like, yeah,

738
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:41,050
it's ok if some of these people like their lives get ruined and they're,

739
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,079
they're mentally crushed like that's fine.

740
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:45,250
That's just open source like that's not ok either.

741
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,569
-- So
-- I think part of it is we need to help them and enable them.

742
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,329
But at the same time, fundamentally, these are adults

743
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,430
who get to make adult decisions.

744
00:32:55,689 --> 00:32:58,500
They have agency, they get to choose how they live their life.

745
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:03,459
And I think a lot of these people need to put their foot down a bit and say no

746
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:07,530
and, or otherwise I don't want to say meaner, but be a bit firmer.

747
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:07,920
I mean,

748
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,819
that's maybe a fair point also because I do think

749
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:13,140
a lot of open source projects are way too nice

750
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,099
where they,

751
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:16,060
they listen too much maybe.

752
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:19,770
And I, I guess this is part of, this is part of how it all works.

753
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,079
Like,

754
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:24,410
do we want our future open source to be a forest overrun with weeds

755
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,310
and gargoyles or do we want a nice place people want to go?

756
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:28,569
I,

757
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,579
we're gonna find out, I guess I, I'm, I don't know, I don't know.

758
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:35,280
All right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna call this one. I need to think about it more.

759
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:35,439
Well,

760
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:37,180
I'm sure we'll be back here again in

761
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,459
the near future talking about this particular topic.

762
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:39,800
