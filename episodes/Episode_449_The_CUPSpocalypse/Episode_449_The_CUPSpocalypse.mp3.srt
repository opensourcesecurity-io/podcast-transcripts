Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:12,670
Kurt Siefried and my partner in reminiscing about the past Josh Pressers

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,270
-- reminiscing. It's, this is the freaking future, man.
-- No, I'm gonna read something

3
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:19,260
I wrote over 20 years ago

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,190
that applies to this.

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,149
Linux has gone through a series of firewalls. The most recent is IP tables.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,989
Most of the people listening to the show probably don't know what IP tables is.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,170
Thank goodness. But I continue

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,533
sometimes to his net filter preceding this was IP

9
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,263
chains and preceding this was IP firewall admin,

10
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,423
which I'm guessing.

11
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:40,823
Absolutely nobody knows unless you've been using Linux since

12
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:41,943
the nineties

13
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:43,213
as well.

14
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:46,583
There are a number of other files such as IP F and Sinus Firewall,

15
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,893
some of which only work on 2.0 and 2.2 series kernels.

16
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:51,932
So are largely obsolete.

17
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:54,923
I would recommend using a 2.4 kernel with IP tables

18
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:57,502
if possible since it offers state full packet inspections,

19
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:58,513
which makes firewall

20
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:01,655
calls such as DNS and FTP properly a lot easier.

21
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:02,456
OK.

22
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:02,936
And

23
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:08,045
that is a lot of the context for like our discussion about Cups today. Is it,

24
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:08,975
it is because

25
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,496
OK, here's the thing. So

26
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:15,655
remember like I found a remote massive code execution that affects all Linux

27
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,886
by default, blah, blah, blah. And it turns out to be a fla

28
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:18,636
cops,

29
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:20,096
right? Like,

30
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,846
which is funny because you had looked at kind of like, what could it be like?

31
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:24,986
OK, system D

32
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,290
uh I forget one or two other things. And then you said cups

33
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:28,879
and

34
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,199
I remember looking at the cups get history

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,400
and like half the commits for the last two months,

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,080
literally just like glancing at them.

37
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:40,239
I'm like that they all smell like CV ES because they're all like, no, they're,

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,550
they were horrifying

39
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:45,720
and I don't think those were any of the security fix. I think one of them was.

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,449
Yeah.

41
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,980
But yeah, they were things like

42
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:51,614
this thing crashes because of this magic number that we

43
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,004
now account for like it raps to zero whatever and

44
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,425
oftentimes those tend to be security flaws. So

45
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:57,294
the,

46
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:00,684
the long and the short of it is if you're attaching

47
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:04,894
a system to the internet with a public facing IP address,

48
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:10,255
it probably shouldn't have that many public facing services

49
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,880
unless they're like, really kind of well hardened things like a web server

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,119
and to put it bluntly cups is not one of those.

51
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,960
-- And
-- that's easy to say.

52
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,460
It is

53
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:20,800
-- easy
-- to

54
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,210
-- say and it's also
-- correct.

55
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,330
It's bold of you to jump to the end with your conclusion

56
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:29,210
-- and semi actionable advice
-- and it also boils back to my,

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,289
remember me saying, I don't care, argument where this is a perfect example of, like,

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,309
I don't care because

59
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,850
if people actually understood kind of what cups is and does,

60
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,179
they would never expose it to the internet.

61
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,139
I suspect most people didn't do it on purpose.

62
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,740
That's my guess.

63
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:48,600
Yeah, they just attached a thing to the network and, and,

64
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,580
and they might not even know it's running cups.

65
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:53,139
I think a lot of them probably don't.

66
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:59,979
And I bet a lot of printers run cups by default. Now there's all this wild software.

67
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:01,520
What else would they run? Like

68
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,123
you think a, the company is going to write their own printer software when they

69
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:06,123
grab cups,

70
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:07,643
they're already running Linux.

71
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,802
I want to rewind us to the beginning of this whole

72
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:17,292
debacle because I don't think Cups by itself is very interesting.

73
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:20,522
I think the chaos surrounding this entire event

74
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,522
is vastly more interesting to talk about.

75
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,763
And it is a case study

76
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:28,723
in how not to disclose an issue.

77
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,203
And the ironic thing is we

78
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:33,776
just literally as of yesterday also have

79
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:34,945
Akamai and Larry cash

80
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,095
dollar guest of the show. In the past,

81
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:39,535
they published that blog entry where

82
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:41,216
uh long story short,

83
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:43,315
you can send one UDP packet to cups.

84
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:46,345
And of course, Cups very helpfully replies with a whole bunch of stuff.

85
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:47,505
And

86
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:51,856
the trick is because it's UDP, it's trivial to spoof because there's no TCP,

87
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,546
sequence number to guess or anything like that.

88
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:54,906
And so

89
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:55,115
a

90
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,906
I published this blog saying basically, you know, you can, you can,

91
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,419
you can use this for traffic amplification to a degree that is,

92
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,039
yeah, it's a problem. And of course, being

93
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,809
Akamai, they, they released this kind of in a very boring like here it is everything,

94
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,899
you know, here's the fix, here's the problem, here's the explanation, blah, blah,

95
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,179
blah.

96
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,259
And that was kind of the more in my opinion,

97
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,700
professional way to handle something like this,

98
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,850
right? Well, then Larry's done this many times before. He definitely understands.

99
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,720
We'll say the the process.

100
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,500
Now, whether the process is right or wrong, it's wrong

101
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,660
is part of the discussion.

102
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,779
Also, I would agree and to be clear when I said professional,

103
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:36,299
yeah, may not necessarily correct or the best way

104
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,410
I wanna, I wanna tell the story.

105
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,179
Let's tell the thrilling tale as it unfolded because I think it is,

106
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,140
it's interesting.

107
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,549
Well,

108
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,339
it starts out with a couple of mastered on tooths

109
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,980
which in the past it would have been tweets.

110
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,100
-- Technically Twitter.
-- Oh, was it Twitter? First?

111
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:51,209
The person in question evil socket.

112
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:52,779
They do not have a Mastodon

113
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:56,220
-- was one of those republish things.
-- Ok.

114
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:56,760
Yes,

115
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,570
because I think I retweeted,

116
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,859
I don't Twitter anymore.

117
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:01,329
I mean

118
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:06,179
-- X sorry, X,
-- who cares? I'm calling it Twitter until I die. I literally don't care.

119
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:07,670
So, you know, this

120
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,500
interrupt, somebody pointed out that this gives whoever acquires Twitter slash X.

121
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,790
The easiest way to fix the brand, which is we're dropping X and going back to Twitter,

122
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,630
I, no one's gonna acquire it.

123
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,390
It's, it might be, penny's not like

124
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,010
-- it's not gonna be that expensive to
-- acquire.

125
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,684
I'm willing to purchase Twitter for $17.

126
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,684
Actually, the thing is, it has such a negative value. Now,

127
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:35,575
the cost of running it versus the actual revenue is,

128
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:39,845
have they sorted all of their lawsuits with their employees or former?

129
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:45,315
I'd be shocked if they have anyway. Ok. So this person Evil Socket,

130
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,045
they, they tweet

131
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,380
that they found in.

132
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,459
I'm I'm gonna read the some of the, the highlights here because it's, it's,

133
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,619
it's spicy.

134
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,500
They say there's an unauthenticated R ce remote code execution

135
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:59,660
in all the new Linux

136
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:00,190
like that.

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,380
They put the canoe there,

138
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,100
all the new Linux systems plus others in parentheses disclosed three weeks ago,

139
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:06,470
right?

140
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,130
First of all,

141
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,989
if you're a security person that is like your

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,980
spidey senses just went off and you're like,

143
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:13,299
oh, what's going on?

144
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,361
And then they say full disclosure happening less than two weeks still,

145
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:20,272
no CV E assigned there should be at least three, possibly four, ideally six.

146
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:22,212
Ok. What do we get? Four out of this? I think

147
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:26,372
anyway, still not working. Fix which whatever.

148
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:30,492
And then it says canonical redhead and others has confirmed the severity 9.9

149
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:34,532
check screenshot and then they have a screenshot of some CV SS calculator

150
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:37,821
because as we all know, screenshots cannot be faked,

151
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:38,451
obviously,

152
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:41,652
who cares? You can just make up crap. It's the internet.

153
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:44,312
Well, it's, it's, but this is an interesting thing because I've seen

154
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:44,492
a

155
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:47,683
of people posting screenshots and posting videos of things to like,

156
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:48,954
prove that it's real.

157
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:51,644
And I'm like, like we've literally remember at Red Hat, like I had,

158
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:55,234
we had people sending in videos of like, hey, I found a flaw in Linux.

159
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:56,924
Here's a video of me

160
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:57,644
exploiting

161
00:06:58,223 --> 00:06:59,324
for a long time.

162
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,933
And I remember when I worked at Elastic and I, I was,

163
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:04,403
I built their bug brownie program and we stood it up.

164
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:08,084
We at first didn't have a policy of like no videos

165
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,364
and people were just sending us videos with no other evidence.

166
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,003
And we're like, this is meaningless to us. We need like

167
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:17,316
something, send us a a URL to test, send us anything.

168
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:19,835
And so we had to say like no videos. But anyway,

169
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:23,446
so then, but here's, here's the bit that I think is most interesting.

170
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:26,235
It says I've spent the last three weeks of my sabbatical,

171
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,096
working full time in this research, reporting,

172
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:31,635
coordinating and so on with the sole purpose of helping and pretty much only

173
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:34,006
got patronized because the devs just can't

174
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:37,305
accept that their code is crap responsible disclosure

175
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:38,436
no more.

176
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:40,876
Uh The other thing is uh which devs

177
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:43,808
specifically he talking about because cups is forked,

178
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,178
no cups is not forked.

179
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:47,828
There's only one cups. There's the open printing cups.

180
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:52,428
-- Yeah, that one because, but then there's the original one that's not
-- cups anymore.

181
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:52,808
Apple,

182
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,787
apple bought cups and then they spun it back up. So that is, that is Cups.

183
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:59,967
Well, yeah, because they had like, one commit in like, five years or something.

184
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:02,928
-- Goofy.
-- I still don't know why they bought that but whatever.

185
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:04,488
Oh, well, because it runs on Mac O,

186
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:08,588
-- like, that's the Mac O printing subsystem. But now
-- here's the thing.

187
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:10,148
So this person

188
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:12,089
puts this tweet out

189
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:13,529
and of course,

190
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,989
the first thing that any good security person is going

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,429
to do is they're going to start like looking at,

192
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,540
what is this person putting out on Twitter?

193
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:22,549
What are they talking about? What's going on?

194
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,640
What's their history? And

195
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:28,279
the thing is though, if you look kind of back in time a little bit,

196
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,279
this person had a handful of other tweets where

197
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,650
they talked about some of the things they found,

198
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:34,558
right?

199
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,000
And they were talking about

200
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:40,601
this is from a couple days before the, the the thing I just read

201
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,611
where they just said, I'm finding myself in a situation I've never been in before.

202
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,320
I don't know what to do.

203
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,870
I found an unauthenticated R ce on a very

204
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,791
common good new Linux network service enabled by default on

205
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,351
ubuntu in several other majors.

206
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,640
That's data point number one,

207
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,440
right?

208
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,921
Already confirmed public facing services, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

209
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:58,370
the main author

210
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,054
bonded, blah, blah, blah, blah blah. Should I just go public disclosure?

211
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:01,953
What am I supposed to do?

212
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:04,164
And it sounds like they ended up going to cert and,

213
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:06,164
and kind of letting cert help with the disclosure.

214
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:10,703
But here's the thing. First of all, they said it is enabled by default on ubuntu.

215
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:13,533
So obviously, what's the first thing we do?

216
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,354
We install

217
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,684
ubuntu and we say what are the things enabled

218
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:18,823
by default that are also listening on the network?

219
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,403
There are two things, there is system D and there is cups.

220
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:23,726
And I remember when,

221
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,546
when I think I, I sent you the first tweet

222
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:28,135
and then we had a little chat and I'm like,

223
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:30,736
I think it's system D because obviously like

224
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:34,976
from the perspective of difficult developers installed everywhere,

225
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:37,325
remote RC, I'm like, it's got to be system D.

226
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:38,606
System D has,

227
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:42,166
has a legendarily difficult to work with upstream and it's a little better.

228
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:44,176
Now, some of the, the original developers left,

229
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,005
there's some new blood in there that's a little easier.

230
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:46,325
But

231
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,049
what's sad

232
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,789
to me is this kind of stuff poisons the well around system D.

233
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,010
And you know, there's been a lot of pushback on it. But it's like,

234
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,440
trust me when I say we do not want to go back

235
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,869
to writing shell scripts to make your GPS USB device work.

236
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,030
When you plug it in like system D is the future

237
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,659
-- we had to move to
-- it. It already won

238
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,210
it.

239
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,710
So anyway, OK, so they do that right? And I'm thinking, OK,

240
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,510
then,

241
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,030
then they, they put a,

242
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:19,830
an image up of a showdown, I query search. I don't know of a map, right?

243
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,940
And obviously that is meant to be proving how widely deployed

244
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,330
the service they just found the the issue in was,

245
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,409
but here's the thing when you look at it, it's a really weird map because Korea

246
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:33,650
has

247
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,059
-- like
-- to be clear, South Korea, is

248
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,575
-- it
-- it, what did, what does it

249
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:38,034
say?

250
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:38,325
Well,

251
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:41,104
because can you imagine if we actually found a service that was heavy in North Korea?

252
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,994
-- That would be extremely weird.
-- I, I don't know.

253
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:46,375
Let's look at that. I have a picture actually.

254
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:49,835
-- Let me, let me look at, yeah,
-- Republic of Korea. So South Korea Republic of

255
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:50,114
Korea.

256
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,034
Yes. Korea comma Republic of Yes. Ok.

257
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,000
So, and it shows 20,000 and the next is US with 10,000.

258
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,250
So like that's a pretty significant grouping, right?

259
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,700
So the first thing I do is I'm like, well, I'm gonna go check show Dan,

260
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,940
so I check show Dan.

261
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,840
And

262
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,530
if you search for cups,

263
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,650
I got almost exactly the same results.

264
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:13,799
The numbers were a little off which was filtering time of day, whatever it,

265
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,419
it could be a million things right now.

266
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:17,159
It says 14,000 for the US.

267
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,270
Does it for cups?

268
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:22,450
Well, they probably turned their cup scanner up to an 11, right?

269
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:23,369
And then

270
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,700
you look at

271
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:25,890
like system D

272
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:29,570
and there's literally nothing, nothing, nothing reports back as system D,

273
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,190
which doesn't mean it's not on the internet.

274
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,429
It more means system D doesn't report back in a meaningful way that shin

275
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:36,549
can interpret.

276
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,400
So I look at all this and I send you a message, I'm like, it's cups,

277
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:40,729
it's definitely cups.

278
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:43,010
And so then of course, you know, you start poking around in the cups, github

279
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,640
repo and stuff. And actually a, a guy I work with

280
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,299
made a comment to me that

281
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,859
he read this person's comments

282
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,989
and then the first thing he did was he went

283
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,820
and looked at what repos has this person recently forked?

284
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,940
I'm like, oh, that's brilliant. And they'd forked all of the cups, repos.

285
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,130
So it's like, oh, it's obviously cups.

286
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,140
But so here's, here's what I love about. This

287
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:09,059
is when you are trying to privately disclose, disclose a security issue.

288
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,210
If you say anything in public, no matter how inconsequential you think it might be,

289
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,650
you're leaking valuable information. And here's the thing, I'm not that smart.

290
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:23,169
There are people who do this kind of research every day, all day

291
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,440
that I'm sure they saw the first tweet and probably

292
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,210
had it figured out in like less than 10 minutes.

293
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:29,950
This all took me like two hours.

294
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:33,400
You know what it reminds this reminds me of is like the Geoguessr

295
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:37,739
where they learn just all these obscure facts of like, how are roads mark,

296
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,059
what do road signs look like?

297
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,880
The plants, the vegetation, the dirt

298
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,450
and like,

299
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,059
that's like what you and I have done when it comes to like open source security.

300
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,380
-- Oh, no,
-- not me. I'm not gonna pretend I have that.

301
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,059
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

302
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,349
But you have an inherent knowledge of open source. And you know,

303
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:57,679
for example, the fact that if somebody says, hey, this guy just recently cut forks,

304
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,729
you're immediately like, 00, ok.

305
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:00,020
That's

306
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:01,039
like, you know what I mean?

307
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,650
That brings alarm bells for you.

308
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,280
You might not have thought to do it yourself.

309
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:08,299
But when somebody says it out loud, you're like, oh yeah, I get it.

310
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:11,739
That's and also saying like it's, it's installed by default that

311
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:13,119
tu like firing a boon.

312
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:13,419
I

313
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,780
actually had to download the IO I did not have an

314
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,659
Iso boom too. I've been running almost all de

315
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:18,469
and lately but

316
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:19,539
download the

317
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,729
ISO install it. Look at it, run that stat like boom, I see it right away. Right.

318
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:24,440
Like it took,

319
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,690
I don't know, 1520 minutes maybe.

320
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,700
And most of that time was just spent because I was on

321
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:32,429
Wi Fi instead of my wired connection on that particular computer.

322
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,159
And that's the thing when you have these kinds of skills and this depth of knowledge.

323
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,070
Yeah, this is really easy.

324
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,460
It's like the lock picking lawyer, you know,

325
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:43,900
all his videos are like five minutes or shorter.

326
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:47,659
That's what always gets me. I'm waiting for the day he posted a video

327
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,940
that's like 20 minutes long. And then that's like, ok, now I know which lock to buy.

328
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,739
I doubt it. I doubt there's any lock he can't pick in 10 minutes.

329
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,539
But that's the thing. Right. Like it, you're right though, is even, even

330
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:03,744
just tiny hints like 100%. You can find my house on satellite imagery. Why?

331
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:07,344
Because I have two trampolines in my backyard. Boom. Like I've talked myself,

332
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:12,044
you figure you live in Edmonton, which is not a secret. You've talked about it a lot.

333
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:12,784
And yes,

334
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:14,604
you say you have two trampolines in your yard and there

335
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:18,224
are probably some like Geoguessr types that could find your house in

336
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,739
less than an hour. We'll say probably a lot less than an hour.

337
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:25,390
I'm not going to dig up the video, but I remember on my games done quick.

338
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,780
They had like a Geoguessr, I don't know, game or match or something where these,

339
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:31,830
these two people were just cooperating.

340
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,289
Basically,

341
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,239
they were playing the two player Geoguessr game

342
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,520
where only one person can see the screen,

343
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,979
the other one can see the map and you have to like, explain to them what you see

344
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:41,495
like.

345
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,935
Right. Yeah, you have to like, figure it out.

346
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:48,085
Well, no one person sees the like road view and the second person

347
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:48,645
has.

348
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:49,606
No, they, they, they had,

349
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:52,745
they're zooming in on the map trying to figure out what the other person and they,

350
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,385
they can only communicate with voice, right?

351
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:55,736
You can't see each other screen.

352
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,926
But anyway, they did like a, a demo before this, right,

353
00:14:58,935 --> 00:14:59,846
where one of the users were like,

354
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,825
here's how this works and he would open a screen and be like, oh,

355
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,111
we see this on this side and this over here and there's over here like this is,

356
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,471
and they're driving on the left.

357
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:10,512
This is Germany or this is Ireland or whatever. My favorite, he pulls one up.

358
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:14,791
He's like, this is Japan for too many reasons to explain. He just moves on.

359
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:17,961
-- And I'm like, oh, my goodness. That's so funny.
-- Well, that's the thing, right?

360
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:20,952
Like, for example, if you drop me in Germany,

361
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,461
I can tell you how far north or south I am based on the shape of churches.

362
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:26,609
No,

363
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,150
the more,

364
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,669
the more onion doughy they get.

365
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,049
Oh,

366
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,200
interesting.

367
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,200
Interesting. Anyway. Ok. So

368
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,039
that, that whole, like, don't, don't talk about what, you know, like,

369
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,289
-- that's obviously really hard as humans and
-- don't even talk about that.

370
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:41,929
You're doing that

371
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:42,950
because

372
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,859
there are people who, when they say I found a vulnerability, I'm like, oh,

373
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:48,820
you found another vulnerability and x and they're like,

374
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:51,609
yeah, I'm like, because that's what you do,

375
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:52,549
right?

376
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,799
There are some security researchers that are like, that's,

377
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,140
there's like they have a specialty.

378
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,809
So when they say I found something, it's like,

379
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,640
well, it's probably the thing, they found stuff in the last 50 times.

380
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,820
-- So
-- I remember there was some time ago when I,

381
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,349
I can't remember which particular TLS bug this was, but there was

382
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:11,719
one of those TLS bugs back when people were, like,

383
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,229
able to take

384
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:16,034
like, compress TLS streams and things like that and,

385
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:18,625
and just discern information about them.

386
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,794
And someone basically says, like, oh,

387
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:23,934
I found a bug in this TLS version with this um this library.

388
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:26,914
And I remember some of the really smart security researchers were like, oh,

389
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:28,354
it's probably this bug

390
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,179
and they were completely right and,

391
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,890
and it leaked basically because someone gave out

392
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,840
what seemed like no useful information at all.

393
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,590
And the experts were like, yeah, we know exactly what this is.

394
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,309
This is almost definitely this problem

395
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,520
and it's, it's fascinating and wild and, but now as humans,

396
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,020
we love talking about what we're doing.

397
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,979
-- Like there is nothing more exciting than learning.
-- I have a secret,

398
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:51,596
right?

399
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,476
Or learning a new thing and being like, let me,

400
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:56,875
let me show you the new thing I'm doing like this is exciting and fun

401
00:16:57,135 --> 00:17:00,075
-- and it, it's a very human thing. Well, they
-- want validation for

402
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:00,955
sure, for sure.

403
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:01,716
It's just, it's,

404
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:03,916
it's part of what makes humans so interesting is

405
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:06,036
we have to talk about what we're interested in.

406
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,494
Well, I mean, and maybe we'll post a link to it,

407
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:09,244
but remember Will Wheaton talking about like,

408
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,336
what is a geek and what is a nerd that famous?

409
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,234
I think it was Comic Con talk he gives

410
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,112
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Maybe post that.

411
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:18,411
-- But that is the essence of this for
-- sure, for sure. Now

412
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,491
there's another piece of this

413
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:23,362
that I think is an interesting conversation and

414
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:27,011
that is the whole responsible disclosure no more.

415
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,682
You and I both

416
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:32,371
have been part of probably hundreds or thousands

417
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:35,452
of we'll call them co ordinated disclosure events.

418
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:36,890
I'm not going to use the word

419
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,010
responsible disclosure because responsible disclosure is a term

420
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,650
that was co opted by Microsoft to me do what Microsoft tells you to do.

421
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,219
And if you don't,

422
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,489
-- we're going to yell at you
-- well or not pay you a bug bounty or not put you on the

423
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,589
list or not give you credit. And that,

424
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,329
that was a huge thing like when I worked at Isight and I defense

425
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:53,500
that

426
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,040
credit was like

427
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,150
they would do whatever they needed to get

428
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,310
that credit because that credit sold subscriptions.

429
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:00,939
Right?

430
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:02,469
Well, and, and that's even, I mean,

431
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:05,780
bug bounties work the same way where if you don't play by the bug money rules,

432
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:09,780
actually, technically, this was just at the cusp of bug bounties because actually,

433
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,560
was it eyesight

434
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:14,400
burners was the first company to pay for exploits like to pay a bug

435
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:14,579
might

436
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:15,109
have been.

437
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,540
No, we, we were, we, we were like, well, the first legal,

438
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:19,285
obviously

439
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:22,045
the black market was doing it before us

440
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,255
but, and it was funny too because we were like,

441
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,675
we, we immediately tell the vendor to want to get it fixed.

442
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,405
Like that's our whole shick and everybody thought we

443
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,364
were being evil and it's like we're not evil,

444
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,525
we're not rich enough to be evil.

445
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:32,244
I remember that

446
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:33,425
anyway.

447
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:34,364
But here's the thing,

448
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:38,574
it is really hard to be part of any sort of coordinate disclosure event,

449
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,944
especially if there's a large company involved.

450
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:44,484
And obviously, in this case, there's a, there was a a again

451
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:47,180
another image posted to Twitter

452
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,020
that showed the screenshot of the companies

453
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,250
involved on the cert reporting platform.

454
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,780
And

455
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:56,219
Apple was on the list. HP was on the list. Dell was on the list.

456
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:59,579
Like these are not small organizations,

457
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,500
they are legendarily large and they're going to be hard to

458
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,979
work with because they also have

459
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,050
-- significant resources internally
-- what's happened.

460
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,280
And uh open SSL is a perfect example of this

461
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,109
where Open SSL has learned that they cannot work with these

462
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,599
vendors because every single vendors like we're big and important and

463
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,719
we have like three bajillion TV S running this vulnerable thing

464
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:20,619
and thus the world will end if you don't let us do it our way.

465
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:23,500
And of course, they all want it done their way, which is like,

466
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,540
can we basically hold off on this as long as possible

467
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,760
without having to actually do anything?

468
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,050
And so like,

469
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:33,189
I believe at one point openness sl straight up said like

470
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,630
you kind of, everybody gets the same notification.

471
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,500
We don't do like pre notification because we just can't, it's, you know,

472
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,459
same thing with the Linux kernel.

473
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:46,109
It's like we can't make a tier list of like who's more and less important.

474
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,739
Like, obviously to some degree you could like,

475
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,589
like steam de or maybe less important than

476
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,280
all the oil refineries in the world. Running Linux.

477
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:53,569
But at the same time, like there's

478
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
all the stuff running Linux,

479
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:59,920
like breaking it out into what's critical and not critical. It's, it's impossible

480
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:02,699
-- and it's subjective.
-- It is, it's an impossible task.

481
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:06,260
And right, and this is exactly why open SSL ended up doing what they did.

482
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,880
And I get that, I'm completely receptive to this.

483
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,359
Well, because also it, it kind of comes back to the,

484
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:14,510
even if you want to do it the way the companies want you to do it, it,

485
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,150
-- it won't
-- work and it never does.

486
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,800
You end up, well,

487
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:17,295
you leak,

488
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:20,125
you leak crap all the time because there's someone talking about something.

489
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,604
Well, companies leak stuff. We've had that happen. Right.

490
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:24,785
It's, it's persistent for sure.

491
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:27,324
My favorite always was, I remember when we were at Red Hat,

492
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:29,385
we would watch lots of other bug trackers

493
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,185
from different Linux distributions and projects and things

494
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:33,814
and it was very common.

495
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:37,675
They would file a public bug and then hide it and we would catch it before they hit it.

496
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:42,265
Well, that happened with oracle and Myers QL and they totally, you know, II,

497
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,724
I was like, literally just like,

498
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:44,119
I

499
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:48,310
want to sign this anyways. They were a nightmare to deal with and I just gave up.

500
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,989
But I mean, the other thing to remember is like,

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,369
it's not a secret once you've told 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 companies,

502
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,550
I'm not even gonna say people because there's like, more than

503
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,550
that number of people. Like, there's,

504
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,150
it's just, it's a, it's, it's ridiculous to me that,

505
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,349
yeah, like every time government conspiracy stuff comes up, I'm like,

506
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,689
all that stuff ends up being public at

507
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:12,239
some point because people suck at keeping secrets.

508
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,119
Right?

509
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,459
And I, my favorite is always if someone asks one time, it's like,

510
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:18,780
do you actually think the government is competent enough to have done that?

511
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,439
And they're like,

512
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,550
no.

513
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,920
-- Yeah, the government is just people like us
-- basically

514
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,739
back to the. So

515
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:25,219
I,

516
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:26,235
yeah, that's the thing.

517
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:26,515
So the,

518
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:29,475
the whole thing leaked and of course it turned out to basically be a nothing burger.

519
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:33,576
I feel like the co ordinated disclosure like let's keep secrets. Thing

520
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:37,345
is definitely on a downward trend these days because

521
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:39,296
a lot of things just come out well,

522
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:40,456
it doesn't work anymore.

523
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:42,265
It probably never did occur.

524
00:21:42,706 --> 00:21:46,651
It also with the number of vulnerabilities we're handling.

525
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:47,261
-- Now,
-- do

526
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:50,712
-- you
-- remember when Google Project Zero said 90 day embargo,

527
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:51,751
-- no questions
-- asked.

528
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,011
People lost their minds.

529
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:55,901
Right? And then it turned out everything's fine.

530
00:21:55,952 --> 00:22:01,832
And I think this is an example of, back in those days you would have organizations,

531
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:05,352
especially the big ones, like a Microsoft or an Oracle or someone like that.

532
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:08,500
-- That would literally take years to fix a bug.
-- Oh,

533
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:12,510
yeah. Those timelines were bonkers. Like, I think one was eight years with oracle

534
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,670
and it was a normal

535
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,550
code execution. It wasn't like a minor thing.

536
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,260
Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly. And, and if you think

537
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:19,500
the

538
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:21,609
A PT style Attackers

539
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:24,420
didn't know about this stuff, like you're, you're fooling yourself.

540
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,400
Of course, they did. They have people on the inside, they're watching everything.

541
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,369
I mean, heck, I remember when we, we knew vendor

542
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:30,670
se

543
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:30,910
the,

544
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:35,569
the, like, secret mailing list for Linux distributions, we knew it was backdoor.

545
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:36,689
Well, and it was,

546
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,900
it, I mean, not to throw solar designer under the bus, but it's run by a guy in Russia.

547
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,819
-- Like, no,
-- no,

548
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,989
no. So solar designer runs the distro list now.

549
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,430
I don't know if he's moved the servers out of Russia.

550
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,109
I know he was trying to get funding from the,

551
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,280
the Linux foundation to help with that vendor

552
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,949
se was run by, um, Germans.

553
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:57,989
It was the sous guys and we knew it was hacked and we couldn't do anything about it.

554
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,520
And that's actually because eventually we just shut, the vendor

555
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,140
was just killed and like, we can't fix it like it, it's dead by.

556
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,270
And that's when solar then set up Os S security

557
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:11,670
and distro list which now there's like a bunch of distro list variants,

558
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,250
which is where the distributions can speak in private about various things.

559
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,369
Why is this run by a single human being?

560
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:20,310
Because he's the only one who is willing to do it.

561
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,670
Here's the reality. This is like you and I argue about this in private all the time.

562
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,000
Like the whole, this is the security, the market wants.

563
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,160
That is the security, the market it wants because when,

564
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:35,380
when Red Hat or Su or anyone else was asked to step up and help with this,

565
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:36,400
none of them did.

566
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,160
But solar designer was willing to do it and it's no doubt been significant cost

567
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,829
and time on his part over the how many decades he's been doing this now?

568
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:45,890
Well, I mean, case in point,

569
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,400
you can see Red Hat CV as she once falls off a cliff after I left

570
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,239
like it's done.

571
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,780
I, yeah, that doesn't surprise

572
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:51,910
me

573
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,750
again though. This is what is, what is the market want? Right?

574
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,260
And, and the market doesn't want good security. The market wants good pr,

575
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,760
well,

576
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,790
I think the market wants good security but also I want the good

577
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,140
-- security without having to pay for it or do anything or
-- no,

578
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,670
that doesn't.

579
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,369
That's not how the market works. That means the market doesn't want

580
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:10,489
it.

581
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:11,099
Yeah.

582
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,869
Well, the market's not willing to pay a market rate for it like there.

583
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,150
-- Then
-- the market doesn't want it. That's how that works

584
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,630
anyway. Anyway. So, here's my take on this.

585
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,859
I do think the researcher

586
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:26,420
-- is a little complaining.
-- Oh, there was, there was way too much drama.

587
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:29,949
It was very drama filled. And I think the reporter was definitely part of that.

588
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:33,500
I'm not going to put this, let, let this person get off the hook by any means.

589
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,380
-- No, 100
-- percent. Like they, they created this drama.

590
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,540
But here's the thing

591
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,180
I think given the way everything has been working for

592
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,680
the last 20 plus years in the world of security,

593
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:47,979
I do think embargoes are less important than they maybe were in the past.

594
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,969
I feel like most of the truly impressive security vulnerabilities we have

595
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:56,510
seen in the last couple of years have not been privately reported.

596
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,319
There was not time to patch and, and test and all this.

597
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,250
We were thrown into the fire and quite

598
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:04,826
frankly, I don't think they turned out that bad.

599
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:08,625
Well, there's also a lot more compensating controls now, like back in the day,

600
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:09,286
having

601
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:11,306
firewall was like, whoa,

602
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:15,196
-- you could buy them. People sold firewalls.
-- Yeah.

603
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:15,465
Well,

604
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:18,026
like literally the Linux administrator security guide talks

605
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:20,786
about stuff like turning off default services,

606
00:25:20,796 --> 00:25:21,026
right?

607
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:23,215
That was a big deal in the nineties that was like

608
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:26,745
-- a major way to do security was turning
-- off the cups.

609
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:27,871
Resolver

610
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,871
is one of the ways to mitigate this.

611
00:25:30,911 --> 00:25:32,832
But then that became like an industry standard where,

612
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:35,472
remember at one point finally Red Hat was like, yeah,

613
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:38,371
everything's turned off by default except ssh, so you can SSH.

614
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:38,602
N

615
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:43,671
and that took a major amount of teeth gnashing because customers are like,

616
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,722
I have to turn stuff on and it's inconvenient and it's

617
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:47,391
a pain in the butt and it just doesn't work,

618
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:47,832
you know,

619
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:51,192
and we have a lot more compensating controls now where

620
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,969
the reality too is everything. Every piece of software we have,

621
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,369
we know has remote code executions in it

622
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,829
because it did, like, and

623
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:05,030
-- they're not all fixed or gone,
-- they will never be fixed if it's written in C,

624
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,660
even if it's not written in C, it probably has problems.

625
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,550
Yeah, I was gonna say, even if it's written in rust, you'll still have logic bugs.

626
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,020
It, yeah, it just takes away the memory safety issues.

627
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,699
Uh, but the thing is like, we, we can't make a perfectly safe, secure the world.

628
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:19,130
Right.

629
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,469
We just recently had an oil well, catch fire and explode and, like,

630
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:26,410
really harm five people down in Calgary,

631
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,689
uh, made the news and it's like,

632
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:29,699
obviously,

633
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,060
you know,

634
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:31,859
there's an incentive to make these things somewhat safe

635
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:33,780
because they're really expensive when they blow up.

636
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,469
But, you know, we can't make them 100% safe

637
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,000
and for sure to do, like, we talked about that with the house fire stuff.

638
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,219
Like,

639
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:43,579
could we build fireproof buildings with fire suppression that can't burn down?

640
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:44,699
Absolutely. We could,

641
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,060
would it be cost effective? No,

642
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:47,810
no,

643
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,290
no, for sure, for sure. But I mean, this is the concept of risk.

644
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,800
I mean, this is one of the things I think

645
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:59,849
the infosec universe has gotten wrong over the years is we try to eliminate risk.

646
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:03,869
We don't try to reduce and control it. I think it's getting better in recent years.

647
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,180
But I think fundamentally

648
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,290
an enormous amount of our industry was built around this concept of elimination,

649
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:10,589
which doesn't work.

650
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,089
I think what and what you just said is, it's,

651
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,310
I think the problem is not trying to eliminate risk.

652
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,729
It's thinking that we can

653
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:17,560
and we can

654
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,780
and that's,

655
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,670
that's a maturity step of saying, you know, like,

656
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,069
yeah, we can't accomplish this perfectly. But can we make it bearable?

657
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,020
Can we make it? So,

658
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,900
you know, the world works basically, like,

659
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,959
we don't have constant major cell phone outages like Verizon

660
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:34,339
or Rogers here in Canada did that one time,

661
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:35,900
you know, maybe we should have some change control.

662
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,974
-- So we don't push out a bad B GP route. Take down the half the internet
-- or crowd strike.

663
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:41,645
Yeah.

664
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,625
You know, like,

665
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:45,194
and apparently crowdstrike had really poor internal testing

666
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:47,625
and gating of updates and everything and like,

667
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:50,974
and, and, and, but here's the thing, I would point out it was totally fine

668
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,535
until the one day it wasn't.

669
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,619
That's right. That's right.

670
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,859
And I mean, that's, that's kind of the story of disaster. It was fine until it wasn't.

671
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:03,260
Well, I mean, I've, I've accidentally left my front door unlocked and then, like,

672
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,099
come home

673
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,160
and gone to grab a package, you know, go into the garage,

674
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,260
come out through the front door and look at my front door as I'm leaving.

675
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,540
And I'm like, oh, I didn't lock it. Oops.

676
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,699
You know, and it was unlocked for a couple of hours.

677
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:13,349
Like, granted,

678
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,849
I would have gotten doorbell alerts that somebody came to my front door

679
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,689
and I would have noticed if somebody, like, walked in through my front door. But

680
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,640
the reality is,

681
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,719
it's not like people are constantly trying to break into my house and, like,

682
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:24,540
jiggle the front door and see if it's unlocked.

683
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,969
-- Right.
-- Right. Well, and this is how disastrous work is, is

684
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:29,000
there is

685
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,880
generally speaking, a disaster isn't like one

686
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,219
singular event.

687
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,770
It's like 10 things that all went wrong at

688
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,579
the same time that led to some horrific disaster.

689
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:40,229
Yeah.

690
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,390
And we don't think like that in security. We often think of singular events.

691
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,329
So, anyway. Ok.

692
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:44,819
Ok,

693
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:47,270
we're kind of running ourselves out of time here and I feel

694
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,469
like we have danced all around this because that was the point.

695
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:52,349
-- I
-- have
-- a proposal.

696
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,599
The new metric for

697
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,229
vulnerability disclosure

698
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,500
should be measured by causing the least amount of drama. I mean,

699
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:02,020
no,

700
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,560
and, and I don't mean like you, you're gonna roll over and play nice to the companies.

701
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:09,000
I mean, things, like, for example, Google saying 90 days

702
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:09,790
done

703
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,910
and, like, the companies threw tantrums and Google's like, no, it's like a parent,

704
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,079
right?

705
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,729
Like I hear you screaming. I see that you're upset.

706
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,430
-- I'm still not buying you seven candy bars.
-- I mean, so, look, Google was in a position.

707
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,170
They could

708
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:25,550
exert that pressure with impunity.

709
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:30,150
They, they weren't worried about very much if you are a security researcher.

710
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,430
That's part of a bug bounty.

711
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:34,630
Yeah, you're not going to get paid if you don't play by their rules.

712
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,729
That's how that works.

713
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,790
Yeah. Well, and that's part of the not causing drama. Like

714
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,900
they have set these rules if you want to get paid, you do it their way.

715
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,910
I, I guess that's fair

716
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,010
if you don't agree with it, you can also just push it out publicly and not get paid.

717
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,300
I mean, and, and that's kind of this sort of situation, right.

718
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,469
This is an example of the researcher

719
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,829
to the best of my knowledge was not compensated in any way for this

720
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:58,510
and they tried to do the right thing and they

721
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,880
got hung up in the madness of coordinate disclosure,

722
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,910
which is really hard to do.

723
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,430
And they did say in one of their many, many messages

724
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,260
that the ubuntu security people were doing a marvelous job trying to help, like,

725
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,329
bridge all the gaps and keep everything under control, which it's very hard

726
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,459
to be in that position. Like I've been there. Many times it sucks.

727
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:19,670
Everyone hates you because no matter what you do,

728
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,160
someone is disappointed.

729
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,729
Well, and that's why con honestly,

730
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,079
if somebody came to me and said I have a massive security flaw,

731
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:25,910
I really don't want to deal with it.

732
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,260
I'd be like, do you want me to just post it anonymously on your behalf? So, it's done.

733
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:29,910
-- So.
-- Ok.

734
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,489
So let, let's close out with this. Let's say they did,

735
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,260
let's say they did post

736
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:37,280
not anonymously. Let's say they posted it as themselves.

737
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,800
How many people would be like, oh, good job.

738
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:40,819
And how many people would be?

739
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:41,280
Like,

740
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,270
you're a terrible person and you're destroying

741
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,479
the planet by posting this publicly.

742
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,540
-- I think
-- there would be a lot of people

743
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,239
complaining that it was posted publicly with no notice

744
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,439
and you can't win. Right. There's, there's no way to win this.

745
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:57,000
I, I think if I was a security researcher and I found, I found something bad,

746
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,760
I don't know what I would do. I would think about it.

747
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,310
-- I'd probably talk to a couple of people I know first, but I
-- have

748
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,910
straight up notice things and websites I use and just gone.

749
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,959
I mean, sometimes you do that.

750
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:12,119
-- I, I get
-- that I'm not going to try and interact with the bank.

751
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:14,719
-- Uh
-- I would not want to interact with the bank,

752
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,739
but that's also kind of different. Like

753
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,520
that's a singular customer essentially of,

754
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,420
of like the, the bug, right?

755
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,800
Versus let's say you find an R CE in open SSH.

756
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:27,890
What do you do?

757
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,400
You go to open SSH and be like, hey, I found this bug. Would you just post it in public?

758
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,719
Are we talking like, like a like basically like worst case scenario,

759
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:36,839
single packet remote,

760
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:37,300
the worst

761
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,760
case scenario, the absolute worst bug you could possibly imagine.

762
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,219
I mean, what would you do? Like

763
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,560
-- there's, I, I could make arguments in every direction
-- my thought would be, oh,

764
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,119
and this is a kind of a jerk move.

765
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,290
But I know enough people in the industry that I would just

766
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,760
anonymously send it to a bunch of them with AC C and it's

767
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:57,020
-- their problem. Now.
-- That's true. That would be one of the ways to do that.

768
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,560
But the secret is like,

769
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:00,969
I know these people, I know who they are.

770
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:02,339
I know their personal email addresses and

771
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:05,119
stuff like that's not the normal situation

772
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,839
-- like we're cheating basically.
-- I mean, and that's part of it too.

773
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:11,640
Like, for example, this reporter went to Sirte,

774
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,010
I would not go to Sirte in a billion years.

775
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,359
I've dealt with CT and they are a very heavy,

776
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,150
difficult organization to work with. I found

777
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,709
and that may have changed in the last like five or 10 years since I've talked to them.

778
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:27,369
But I've, I've never had a lot of positive experience with cert,

779
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,619
remember that uh point of sale system company in New Zealand found that

780
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:36,160
uh http or http S proxy bug that affected like multiple web servers

781
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,859
and reported it to Red Hat.

782
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:39,760
And then like I ended up having to report it

783
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,660
to Microsoft because we literally said to these guys,

784
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:41,939
like,

785
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,390
do you want us to help?

786
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,800
And they're like, yeah, they're like, we make point of sale software.

787
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,060
We don't want to deal with this global security thing.

788
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,140
Also time zones suck because we're in New Zealand

789
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,369
and like we handled it for them and it was,

790
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,849
it was tedious, I would say, not a nightmare, but it was tedious.

791
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:02,410
-- It is
-- easy to say, just don't, don't try to do coordinate disclosure. Right.

792
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,979
Very easy to say. Would I do that?

793
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:06,810
I know I wouldn't work with c my,

794
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,859
my suspicion is if I found something bad and it affected a Red hat,

795
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:12,089
I would go to them just because I know a lot of Red Hat people.

796
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:13,339
I know they're gonna help me out. I

797
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,849
think that's part of the story is there's also an aspect of

798
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:20,125
how much personal pain and suffering am I going to endure?

799
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:23,806
If I try to do this, we'll say the right way and we'll put the right way in. Quote,

800
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:27,885
what you just said, Red Hat will help me. Why have Red Hat helped you?

801
00:33:27,895 --> 00:33:29,926
Why not just have Red Hat do the work? It affects them.

802
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:32,426
-- Well, that's what I mean, they would do all of the work.
-- Oh, ok.

803
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:35,005
That wasn't clear, like it sounded like you were going to still be involved.

804
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:39,725
-- No, I would expect them to do, like, 99% of the work I
-- would just throw, I would,

805
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:43,005
I would basically tie a note to a brick and throw it through the window and run away.

806
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:44,891
I mean, maybe, and that's the thing. Like,

807
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:49,881
there are other companies that I know would be very difficult to work

808
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:53,602
with in an instance like this and those are the places I might not

809
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:56,041
have any desire to interact with.

810
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:56,991
Yeah, I might not even,

811
00:33:57,092 --> 00:33:59,531
I wouldn't even throw a brick through their window. Maybe not.

812
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:04,362
And I think that's part of it and I think that, that also kind of tells the story of the,

813
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:07,362
the things that are truly significant

814
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:11,041
that are going to affect a large percentage of the internet

815
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,389
are almost certainly going to be an open source software

816
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,429
-- or windows,
-- even, even windows.

817
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:21,100
I don't think there are that many windows bugs that would, I would care about.

818
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,000
-- Not
-- Peter.

819
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,149
Maybe. I mean, that was not, that was an attack though. It wasn't a bug. Right.

820
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,179
Well, no, it was a, it was a known security flaw that had been patched and leaked and

821
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,090
I can't even wrap my head around that because I don't, I don't even,

822
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,300
I don't even run windows like there's,

823
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,659
there's a 0% chance of me finding a windows vulnerability.

824
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,540
Like, it's just not going to happen.

825
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,458
Right.

826
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,060
And so I, I don't know. I mean,

827
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,899
I don't have a good answer for this. I feel like

828
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,280
I feel like if I can't tell Red Hat or Ubuntu,

829
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,699
maybe Debbie and, or su

830
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,149
I would feel bad for Debbie though because they're volunteers. But, like,

831
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,909
I don't know what I would do,

832
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:01,340
but I think I'm willing to say if it's something that they would,

833
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,429
those large Linux distributions were involved with,

834
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,669
I would almost certainly go to them right away

835
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,929
because I know

836
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,770
I would have a reasonable experience.

837
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,149
I don't think I would ever go to cert,

838
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:16,199
I think I would opt for a public disclosure over going to cert,

839
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:21,510
I might report something via a bug bounty. Maybe it would depend who it is.

840
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,820
Again, I think that's part of that whole, like

841
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:27,110
depending on the company, I'm going to think long and hard about this.

842
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,439
But yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, that's, that's the story here, Kurt, right?

843
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:32,209
Like that's the thing to tell is

844
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:35,729
there is no singular answer to problems like this.

845
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:38,090
It's easy to say you should always do responsible disclosure.

846
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,850
It's easy to say you should never do responsible disclosure.

847
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,580
But this is like everything.

848
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:45,489
It's this big muddy gray space in the middle

849
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,370
and that's

850
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,739
in this particular instance, like

851
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,929
it got reported and it got dealt with it did leak early.

852
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:55,330
So I wouldn't say it was a particularly co ordinated event.

853
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,090
Ok. I've got one last kind of point to,

854
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,409
to, to leave on.

855
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:00,620
So once

856
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:02,459
we figured out it was cuts,

857
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,620
I was thinking I could publish this

858
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,020
and say, hey, everyone, this

859
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:09,139
is Cups.

860
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:12,209
And the reason I'm telling you is because I'm not smart

861
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:16,239
and smarter people than me have certainly figured this out.

862
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:19,100
But then at the same time, it's like, if I do that,

863
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,389
if I do that,

864
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:22,260
I'm gonna be the bad guy to a whole bunch of

865
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,179
people and I just didn't want to deal with that crap.

866
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,050
Ditto. I like, literally look, it's like, like I'm like, should we post about this

867
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,844
-- and,
-- and yeah, yeah, it so I, I don't know.

868
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:34,965
I mean, this stuff is always so hard to do and I guess

869
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:39,635
-- there's, there's just never a good answer.
-- Is there any possible benefit?

870
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:42,905
Not just to us, but will this actually make the situation any better?

871
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:46,205
I think it might have actually because it would have made everyone go

872
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:49,895
public finally instead of pretending it was a secret because it wasn't true.

873
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:51,745
And if it is cups then everybody's like, ok,

874
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:53,975
I don't have that uh exposed to the internet.

875
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:54,544
So me,

876
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:55,199
I

877
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,080
mean, yeah, that's basically kind of how I felt about it.

878
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,800
Well, except a lot of people do like 100,000 people have cups on the internet. So,

879
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,389
yeah, but I mean, at the scale of humanity, like 100,000 people have a cup of cite

880
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,760
-- in their bathroom
-- and that's not a lot. Right. Right. Ok.

881
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,000
All right. So in summary, we have no idea.

882
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:16,040
Try not to make the world a worse place,

883
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,969
but it's not your job necessarily to go out

884
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:21,199
of your way at significant personal cost to try and

885
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:23,290
help make the world a better place. Like

886
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,639
be reasonable.

887
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,850
And I think that boils back down to a lot of this open source developer

888
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,719
burnout where they really are taking the weight of the worlds on their shoulders.

889
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,760
And it's like, like one of the no, like it,

890
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:35,479
no,

891
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,054
like companies that benefit from this and make money from this.

892
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:41,254
-- Maybe they can step up and do a bit more.
-- Agreed. All right, I'm calling it.
