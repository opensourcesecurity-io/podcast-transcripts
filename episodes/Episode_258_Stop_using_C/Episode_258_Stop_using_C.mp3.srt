Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,890
Kurt Siefried and my partner Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,989
I'm not your partner in Thought Crime anymore. Are we done with Thought Crime or?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,629
-- What's the deal?
-- We'll see thinking of something new,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,270
something better than Thought crime.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,629
It's getting a little too real.

6
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,850
This episode doesn't really lend itself to thought crime,

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,520
-- does it?
-- I don't know. What are we talking about?

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,299
Well, put it in the notes.

9
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:32,090
-- Project Zero news and updates from Project Zero team at Google.
-- Yeah.

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,130
But the audience doesn't know I put it in the notes. This is how it works.

11
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:37,889
It's the magic of a podcast cart.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,610
Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:43,150
So anyway, there's this report that Google put out and it got me a little,

14
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,049
a little wound up.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,799
We'll say

16
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:45,610
it's,

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:46,360
I

18
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,029
-- guess it's a report.
-- It's a blog post. Well, look, my,

19
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:53,560
my bar for what I call a report is very low. OK.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,840
I was going to say it's a blog post but actually is based on some real data.

21
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,790
-- It has
-- data in it. It has cve

22
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,639
I in it and I don't care about any of that stuff.

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,470
It basically the thing I want to focus on is the last couple

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,300
of paragraphs of the whole report because I will summarize what happens is

25
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:13,735
so Google Project Zero does phenomenal work.

26
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:15,815
I don't think anyone will deny that.

27
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:18,425
And one of the things they've done is they've uncovered

28
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:22,175
and researched a number of old days in the wild.

29
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:23,944
So this, this blog post,

30
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:26,334
they publish kind of focuses on the fact that

31
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:29,995
there were a handful of these that were discovered

32
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:33,415
and then fixed and then Attackers figured out again.

33
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:34,925
-- Right.
-- Right.

34
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:39,870
Well, they fixed the bug but there were like slight variants,

35
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,940
-- shell
-- shock. Right.

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,940
Yeah. Right.

37
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:42,599
Where

38
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,419
-- that's such a story
-- and it, and it's also not just slight variants,

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,800
but sometimes it's, the bug

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,480
was caused by some sort of underlying assumption about reality or

41
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:55,760
about how stuff works and that assumption was also made elsewhere.

42
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:57,750
Right. Right. So, yes, exactly.

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,059
So, anyway, they, they basically kind of lay out, they explain, you know,

44
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:02,400
here was the original bug,

45
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,430
here's what was found and they go into an amazing amount of detail.

46
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,449
I think

47
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,889
there were a couple of things that hit me on the data itself is number one,

48
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,389
it's almost all web browsers

49
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,580
-- in fairness. That's what matters nowadays.
-- I do agree with that.

50
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:16,899
That's what's remotely attack.

51
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,789
-- And that's what, how else do you use a computer?
-- Right.

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,850
And it's like the old, you know, why do you rob banks?

53
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,490
It's because it's where the money is, right?

54
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,289
I mean, obviously you could, you could write an O day for, I don't know,

55
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,369
-- something bash or whatever
-- solar winds.

56
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,070
That's a, that's a different story.

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,869
But

58
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,279
you know what I mean? This is a situation.

59
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:35,929
Duh,

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,009
obviously web browsers are going to be attacked

61
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,190
because web browsers are where the opportunity is.

62
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,470
Well, and especially the big two IE and Chrome

63
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,509
and Firefox is in there. Yeah.

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,559
-- And
-- so Safari kind of, but

65
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,889
it's look, it's all the web browsers, right?

66
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:51,929
That's just the reality of it is the bad guys are going

67
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,550
to put their money and their effort into web browser expo.

68
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,490
I get it makes sense. Right. Right.

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,479
Now, the thing that has me wound up is kind of at the end

70
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:03,960
they talk about when you build your patches,

71
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,899
you should make sure you're doing it right.

72
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,179
And you should pay attention to all this other stuff and you could

73
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,509
work with us to make it better and all this and all that.

74
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,600
And I just kept thinking this is literally some of the worst advice I've ever

75
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,809
seen from security people because the answer is quit using effing c full stop.

76
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:29,270
-- Well, but we can't sunk, fallacy costs.
-- No, no, no sunk cost. Fallacy is garbage.

77
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:32,880
How much do these things cost the universe versus how much

78
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,029
would it cost you to start rewriting some of this crap?

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,350
But here's the thing. How much does it cost the universe?

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,380
Versus how much does it cost the company? One of those is a number I don't have to pay

81
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,880
-- and there's your answer,
-- you're not wrong.

82
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,229
And this is part of what has me annoyed is, there's like I feel like

83
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,100
in my mind there are 600 levels of annoyance at everything going on here and

84
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,600
it's everything from the people saying just

85
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,720
security harder to the people saying whatever.

86
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:05,509
-- I don't have to pay for it. It's not my problem.
-- Well, and even if, even if you try

87
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,210
is security harder and smarter and do things like, oh you know, we found this bug,

88
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,449
let's do a proper root cause analysis and squish all the instances of it.

89
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,970
Yeah, I mean, if you're looking at this, it's all, it's C code where

90
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,089
managing

91
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,730
memory, managing pointers, managing,

92
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,739
managing all this stuff constantly,

93
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,980
people get it wrong and this isn't like throwaway code or simple code.

94
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:28,450
Somebody wrote on a weekend. This is,

95
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,089
you know,

96
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,369
this is stuff in chrome and IE and Safari and Firefox

97
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,970
-- that has been through how many code reviews
-- all of them.

98
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,420
And it's had a gazillion.

99
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:38,950
People look at it and it's been fuzzed and

100
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,450
put through static analyzers and all of the things and

101
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,130
the reality is we still can't make it secure

102
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,250
because it's C and that's just how C works.

103
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:52,649
Yeah. And then my question is, well, so what is that good enough? Well, clearly not.

104
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,130
Well, no, no, no. No, but what I mean is ok. So we have a big pile of cvs and

105
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,769
all the web browsers.

106
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,760
But does it really matter? I don't care that much.

107
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,970
I mean, I browse the web on a, yeah, it's a windows machine

108
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,179
using chrome

109
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:08,890
and I honestly update when it flashes that green thing or that

110
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,809
red thing when I let it go for a day or two.

111
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,470
And I really,

112
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,130
honestly, I don't care. I, I spend,

113
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,079
I probably spend more time thinking about cheese

114
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,350
than I do about my web browser security.

115
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:23,320
That, ok, so that is kind of a different problem.

116
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:29,869
And this is in my, in my mind house of madness here, this is also part of that.

117
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,989
Is there is the angle of you could say, well, I don't care.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,329
Well, no, no,

119
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,100
it's I'm actually saying I don't care because I have objective proof

120
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:39,829
that as terrible as it is over the last 20 years of we

121
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:40,125
b

122
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:41,424
the world keeps working.

123
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:44,434
Yeah, there's, there's a lot of external, it's like potholes. Yeah, I hate,

124
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:48,434
there's three potholes on my way to my kids' house that are really hard to avoid.

125
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:52,285
Fundamentally as terrible as C is and as terrible as these web browsers are,

126
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,704
you know, the world keeps working.

127
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,355
And I think here's the other thing is,

128
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:57,315
is part of it is it doesn't matter because there are

129
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:00,154
so many people that can't or won't upgrade their web browser

130
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:02,605
or operating system or whatever because they have something

131
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,714
that's certified to work only with XY and Z

132
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,670
and they're stuck with it because it's, you know,

133
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:10,679
it's a cell counting machine or AC NC Mill or a piece of medical equipment.

134
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,809
-- I mean,
-- ok, look,

135
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,190
-- that is a corner case and I'm going to no longer let you corner case
-- me.

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,149
-- It's a corner case with millions of instances.
-- It's not enough to matter.

137
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,920
We're talking about trillions and even if it's millions,

138
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,600
I don't care, I'm not talking about this. It's a corner case.

139
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:28,750
I don't care about the corner cases don't obsess over it. It's not a helpful,

140
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,470
it's not helpful to the conversation.

141
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,250
So

142
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,049
you are not incorrect in saying that the world continues to work.

143
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,910
I think you could sort of make that argument. But I think the problem is that

144
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:45,519
the failure scenario in many of these cases is catastrophic.

145
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,739
What do you mean by catastrophic?

146
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,320
So like solar winds will be what I pick on where

147
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,779
a lot of when you're talking about an O day,

148
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,250
you're also talking about a very targeted attack.

149
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,834
Someone is going after a very specific thing.

150
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:02,484
-- Not always,
-- the web browser, zero days are quite often used in, you know,

151
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:07,065
a drive bys or whatever or especially once they're not 00 days.

152
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,054
-- I mean,
-- maybe, maybe there's, there's going to be some of that.

153
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,695
But I think generally speaking, right,

154
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:17,174
we're talking about a target with value for some reason and some of these

155
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:20,815
we will never learn about for obvious reasons and some of them we will.

156
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:21,915
And so I think

157
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:25,209
there's an aspect of that is you and I

158
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:26,649
don't matter,

159
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,100
right? Or as some of these targets do. But more importantly, and the thing

160
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:36,209
that, that just consumes me from the inside is that unless a lot of people get killed,

161
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,690
no one's ever going to care.

162
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:41,500
And that's the other thing that just drives me bananas sometimes because

163
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,250
like a great example of this is we are recording this.

164
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,529
I think what, like a day or two after that whole incident in Florida,

165
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:52,325
the water treatment place where some hacker tried to like poison the town.

166
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:56,464
-- I tried
-- to increase the lie levels in the water from 100 parts per million to 11,000,

167
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,765
100 parts per million.

168
00:07:57,774 --> 00:08:00,304
It's very specific that, you know, that I like that.

169
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:03,934
-- I literally just read the article
-- because it didn't work.

170
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:07,665
-- I guarantee you nothing will happen.
-- Well, no, no, it worked.

171
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,464
They saw him do it and they flipped it back.

172
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:13,184
-- But
-- I mean, he didn't kill anyone unless like he literally killed the town.

173
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,269
Nothing is going to change is my prediction.

174
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,329
We're going, we're going to whine and complain and gnash our teeth and then

175
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,089
that's it.

176
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:23,929
Human beings have always had a million things that could

177
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,679
kill most or all of us at some point,

178
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,049
you know,

179
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:31,529
uh and food safety is a great example of the outgrowth of this, you know, chicken,

180
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,609
you know, listeria salmonella and all those horrific bacteria.

181
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:36,289
You know, we're currently going through a pandemic.

182
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,369
We had mutually sure destruction when we grew up as Children.

183
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,010
And so I think part of the problem is there's always

184
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,940
this huge laundry list of stuff that could kill us all.

185
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,340
You know,

186
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,619
the, the animals could escape from the zoo and eat us all or, you know,

187
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,099
self driving cars could rise up and kill us all.

188
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:55,080
And sort of where do we allocate those resources for things

189
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,510
that are kind of a problem because let's put it this way

190
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,169
in the entirety of human history.

191
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,219
How many times have we actually gotten together and

192
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:05,500
actually gotten rid of a significant risk to us?

193
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,869
And the only one I can really think of that's a super success is a smallpox, right?

194
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,270
Humanity got rid of smallpox, we can do it and once in a while we do,

195
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,200
-- but measles and polio are making a comeback because people, I
-- would even reframe it.

196
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,630
The way I like to think about this all the time is automobile safety.

197
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,919
If you look at automobile safety

198
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,359
before things like seatbelts and airbags and

199
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:27,820
all this other safety equipment was mandatory.

200
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:28,469
A

201
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,400
ridiculous number of people died because cars were unsafe.

202
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,590
Well, we keep going back to that, the Bel Air crash, the new and the old one, you know,

203
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,030
the Bel Air

204
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:38,539
-- is just horrifying.
-- Yes, exactly.

205
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,159
It is difficult for people to say I care about this

206
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:45,140
thing when it doesn't necessarily have a direct effect on you.

207
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,750
Like if I for example,

208
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,219
am in a burning house saying get out and put the fire out is of immediate need.

209
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:53,780
That's easy to understand.

210
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:57,969
There is a lion looking at me across the field that is an immediate need.

211
00:09:57,979 --> 00:10:00,119
I understand that saying that

212
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,919
the web browser I'm using has security vulnerabilities and

213
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:06,039
maybe someone could steal my bank account information.

214
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:06,440
Like

215
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:08,090
what? Well, and you know what?

216
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:09,500
I was just thinking, it's worse than that because it's,

217
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,809
it's a combination of a centralized and decentralized problem in that you have

218
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,200
this massive centralized organization that has to make the changes to the code,

219
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,020
test it and ship it and that's a ton of effort and money.

220
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,039
And so they kind of don't really want to do that,

221
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:22,599
but they have to,

222
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,500
if they do that, that's not enough.

223
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,150
That's

224
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,460
the start.

225
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:29,219
Now you have to convince 100 plus million

226
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,469
or billion people to actually install the update.

227
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,539
Well, that,

228
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,820
that's another problem and that's why like

229
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,020
automatic updates need to exist because people

230
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,969
are just never going to care and they're never going to do it.

231
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:40,349
It's not even that they're not going to do it, man.

232
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:43,809
I have automatic updates enabled on every single I device I have on most

233
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,659
of my computers where possible and the other day about a week ago.

234
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,309
So I'm on my Windows 10 computer and I

235
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,919
went to the Microsoft store to look for something.

236
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:50,549
I forget what it was.

237
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,580
And I noticed an update tab and I'm like, oh, that's interesting. I clicked on it

238
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,349
and I had about 20 apps that were not updated.

239
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,929
I have automatic updates enabled for that.

240
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,130
So I hit the update all button and it basically started downloading all the

241
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,931
data on the internet because there's a whole pile of stuff that needed updating.

242
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,820
But I was like, I, I wanted you to automatically update.

243
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:11,841
This computer is turned on pretty much all the time.

244
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,200
It's hooked up to Gigabit Ethernet to Gigabit

245
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:14,810
internet.

246
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,051
So it's not like I don't have enough bandwidth but just

247
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,791
something somewhere went wrong with the automated updates and it wasn't.

248
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,250
So I had a whole pile of un updated

249
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:25,531
apps, some of which I used to connect to the internet and do stuff.

250
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,851
-- Let's say that's a corner case.
-- No, no, no.

251
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:30,041
What what I'm saying is even when you want it to go, right?

252
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:32,642
And even when you want to automatic update and even when you like,

253
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,271
I desperately want to keep my computer as up to date as possible.

254
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:36,882
So that if there is a problem with an update,

255
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,591
I encounter it as quickly as possible and I know why it happened.

256
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,202
Oh, I updated X and something broke first is a

257
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:43,302
month from now.

258
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:45,952
I update everything and something breaks and it's kind of like, well,

259
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:48,492
what broke it because it was, I updated everything.

260
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:52,151
And so even in that case where I want everything updated and I try to make it update,

261
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:57,033
it fails. It doesn't always automatically update. To put it bluntly, this, this

262
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:57,663
problem,

263
00:11:57,672 --> 00:12:00,653
you have that centralized problem where you got to convince some big org to do it.

264
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:03,302
You have the decentralized issue where you have to convince everybody

265
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:05,703
to vote or to tie their shoes or to look both ways

266
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:08,072
when they cross the street and even when they have a

267
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,093
good computer that's up to date and on a good connection,

268
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:11,953
it still doesn't work.

269
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:13,143
Right. And how many people

270
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:15,853
have cell phones with no data plan and only have

271
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:18,533
access to good bandwidth when they're out of Starbucks.

272
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,283
I'm going to stop you.

273
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:22,593
Do you've fallen in the very typical trap of

274
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:26,593
security people of instead of talking about one problem.

275
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:30,403
Now, we're talking about 50 problems and we can't solve 50 problems.

276
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:31,693
But, and that's part of the problem.

277
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:35,473
It's an ecosystem of problems and we can't just solve them one at a time.

278
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,354
We have to, ideally,

279
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:39,684
I keep coming back to this markets and incentives if we can incentivize and

280
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:43,754
get people to want to update that solves a whole bunch of these problems all at once.

281
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,554
Maybe.

282
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,033
I mean,

283
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:51,094
that's part of the discussion I think is we fall into this trap of telling people to

284
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:56,174
security harder or throwing our hands up and saying it's too hard or just being like,

285
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:57,765
I don't care really whatever.

286
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,635
There's been examples of subtle or major incentive

287
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:03,455
changes that have essentially completely fixed problems.

288
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:10,044
-- Yes.
-- And that's something we don't understand how to do. Like, if I tell you, Kurt

289
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,234
here is infinite money.

290
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:15,484
Go fix the auto update problem. You probably can't.

291
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,205
-- I would buy everybody a new iphone.
-- Although

292
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,570
I will take infinite money if someone has it. Like I will try really hard.

293
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,109
The interest alone on the float would be worth it.

294
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,580
But like this is,

295
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,049
I think this is part of our problem

296
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,270
is our issues aren't necessarily resources or saying,

297
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,890
oh, we can't do that because we don't have the budget for it.

298
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,609
Like there are problems that revolve around budget don't get me wrong.

299
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:42,080
But I think in many instances we just like, we don't even know what to do sometimes.

300
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,070
Yeah. Well, I think the problem is these are interrelated.

301
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,840
It's like, it's like traffic safety, right. The city I live in Edmonton has this

302
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,700
zero vision,

303
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,960
traffic safety thing where essentially nobody dies in

304
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:54,809
traffic accidents at some point in the future.

305
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,750
And it's kind of like, yeah, maybe, hopefully,

306
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,070
but I'm pretty sure we're never going to get there,

307
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,809
which is a sort of a depressing statement.

308
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,349
But at the same time, I'm not saying we shouldn't work towards it,

309
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:04,840
but it's so many different things.

310
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:05,030
Right.

311
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,309
It's,

312
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,869
it's things like maybe having people actually

313
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,526
respect speed limits around school zones.

314
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:14,546
-- The
-- solution to, I bet 90% of those problems is self driving cars.

315
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:15,125
Oh, absolutely.

316
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:17,156
That will, that will solve 90% of it.

317
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:21,495
Humans are bad drivers. Like, you know what it is?

318
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:23,005
I just realized this, like,

319
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,945
complaining about humans writing C code is the same as letting humans drive.

320
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:28,806
Like it is the same problem.

321
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,606
You think you're good, but you're not

322
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:33,385
-- like that is
-- all

323
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:34,736
-- the
-- other and you can

324
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,622
solve specific problems.

325
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:39,502
You know, the city, for example, puts in traffic abatement, you know,

326
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,242
they put in speed bumps, they put in the little zigzag

327
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:45,271
things, you know, to, to reduce speed in certain roads

328
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:48,541
and that'll solve maybe, you know, it's basically a CV E patch, right?

329
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:53,942
We, oh you know, there's a lot of traffic taking 95th ave between 142nd and 149th.

330
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:57,302
So they put in a little tiny traffic circle that makes it kind of more awkward.

331
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,302
But the flip side was they had people doing donuts

332
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:00,841
around it for a while when they built it.

333
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,320
But uh well,

334
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:04,119
paved

335
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:04,820
circle,

336
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,570
that's just the equivalent of using like unnecessary C pointers.

337
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,270
You look cool but don't do it, you know.

338
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,869
So there's this constant sort of trying to patch if

339
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,989
we put in enough marked pedestrian crosswalks with flashing lights,

340
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,469
maybe city buses will stop running over old people,

341
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:24,549
if we maybe enforce speed limits, enough people will stop dying in, you know,

342
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,789
speed related crashes.

343
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,690
-- No,
-- that's ridiculous.

344
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,669
You can't say, how do you enforce,

345
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,309
saying enforced speed limits is just saying security harder.

346
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,820
Yeah, exactly.

347
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:33,106
And, and that's the thing, right?

348
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:36,125
Traffic is an ecosystem and the solution to the ecosystem is

349
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,806
a completely new thing which well is self driving cars and,

350
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:40,265
ok.

351
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:40,786
Ok.

352
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:41,426
For example,

353
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:44,335
everybody works from home and stops commuting that would cut down traffic a lot.

354
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:50,096
-- Although,
-- although not quite so in Wisconsin where I live in the United States,

355
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:53,486
obviously a lot more people started working from home

356
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:57,906
and the amount of traffic on the roads decreased substantially,

357
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,065
but the number of fatalities remain the same.

358
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:00,466
Yeah.

359
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:01,731
Here they found people uh

360
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,581
driving faster, right?

361
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,322
And that's exactly what they think it is, is people are more reckless.

362
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:09,211
So the like less, there are way less cars on the road,

363
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:12,572
but just as many people are dying because the people on the road are like, oh,

364
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:14,861
I can do whatever I want. But again,

365
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:19,471
humans like this is what humans do. Humans are humans and whatever,

366
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:20,062
but

367
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:22,262
so, ok. Ok.

368
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,622
I want, I want to bring us back to earth here because that's enough traffic talk

369
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:26,581
for a while.

370
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,182
I don't think you're wrong in saying

371
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:31,411
this is an ecosystem and saying this is a big problem.

372
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:34,710
But I think I don't know how to even talk about this.

373
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,289
Necessarily,

374
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:40,559
I don't feel like we have the language to even describe what our problems are.

375
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:42,880
And that bothers me greatly

376
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,869
and I was about to say, ignoring the vocabulary issue.

377
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,349
Do we have actually any strategic policy or even a simple statement

378
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,809
that actually defines what we want to do? I mean, food safety is a good one.

379
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Food safety, you can basically summarize us.

380
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,250
Well, let's have food that's safe and doesn't make people sick through, you know,

381
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,659
various bacterial and viral contaminants.

382
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:01,960
Boom.

383
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:04,479
Done that pretty much covers all your, your food heating,

384
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:05,750
cooking issues right there.

385
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,479
Done food storage, food safety, you know,

386
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,239
don't have the chicken dripping on the vegetables.

387
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,979
Cool.

388
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,750
Right. What do we do for

389
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:12,614
security?

390
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:13,895
Flavored juice?

391
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:14,354
Uh, I,

392
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:16,564
I agree with this.

393
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:21,295
I, I feel but so here's, here's the other thing that I'm wondering now is,

394
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:25,094
is this because computer security is

395
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,415
too hard or is it too big

396
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:32,214
-- or is it just not, are we not even thinking about it in the right way?
-- You want to say?

397
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:34,015
Too hard, too big? I mean, we had

398
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,020
nuclear deterrent, you know,

399
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,099
they built things that cost hundreds of billions of dollars.

400
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,469
You know, the dew line, the pine tree line, you know,

401
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:45,449
these radar stations that the missile silos, the bombers, the submarines, you,

402
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,790
the whole space race was basically a giant measuring contest to prove that, hey,

403
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,380
I can put this heavy thing in orbit and land it on the ground somewhere.

404
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,030
I want to

405
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,680
-- wink. Wink.
-- But let's even go.

406
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,530
Well, no one knows why.

407
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,890
Uh, let's even go further back though. I feel like sometimes

408
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,140
you, you, the solution is food safety. Right.

409
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,849
But I'm talking about,

410
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,170
oh, that chicken was infected by a demon and when you ate it, the demon killed you.

411
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,540
Like,

412
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,329
no, it's not a demon.

413
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,630
And I feel like in, in the security war,

414
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:21,765
we're talking about chicken bones and evil spirits and that has nothing.

415
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:24,416
You know, like those aren't problems, those aren't real things.

416
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:26,206
-- I
-- keep coming back to, you know,

417
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:29,086
we can't really just replace all the sea code bases because sunk cost.

418
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:32,036
But at the same time, we clearly can't secure them.

419
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,836
And from a manageability point of view, they're a disaster.

420
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:38,645
The sunk cost fallacy says, don't say that

421
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:42,602
-- since they do say that for
-- example, infrastructure, you know,

422
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:44,021
we had an old bridge here in Edmonton.

423
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:44,842
It was an old rail bridge,

424
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:48,222
it was converted to roads or to be a road bridge and

425
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:50,761
it was literally falling apart because it was over 100 years old.

426
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:52,842
So we built a new bridge and destroyed the old one.

427
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:56,281
And the new bridge is actually quite nice, much wider, much safer, you know,

428
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,631
better pedestrian access, blah, blah, blah.

429
00:18:58,641 --> 00:18:58,962
And

430
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,401
I part of the challenge is I think with computing,

431
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:05,010
we're not sure we, we haven't built good safe tools yet.

432
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,369
I mean, things like rust are starting to get there.

433
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:10,050
You know, it's, it's not like civil engineering where here's,

434
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,550
you want to build a bridge from A to B, here's how you do it safely.

435
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:12,729
You know,

436
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:16,689
software is still very much getting people to agree on which language to use,

437
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:19,050
bringing up things like bridge building is an

438
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,089
interesting comparison because to build a bridge,

439
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:25,160
you have to be what's called a, well, in the United States,

440
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,410
we call them professional engineers where you basically, like,

441
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,250
you have to sit for these tests and you have to basically get a license

442
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:31,531
and then you can

443
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:36,962
build a bridge because like, if I built a bridge, I'm, I'm not qualified to do that and

444
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:39,092
like, it would probably kill people.

445
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:41,472
And then they'd be like, why did you let this idiot build a bridge?

446
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:43,171
You know, like, obviously,

447
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:44,562
well, and not just, it's worse than that.

448
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:47,612
It's, it's not just building the bridge, it's designing the bridge, like locally,

449
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,462
our bridge was designed quite well

450
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,112
and then apparently the welds on it were not up to spec and so the city was like, well,

451
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:53,781
it's not our problem, you know,

452
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,822
let the subcontractors sue each other and sort it out.

453
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:58,391
But as long once it passes inspection, it passes inspection.

454
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:01,693
Here's the really interesting part though is I can't just, well,

455
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:06,313
I could basically build a bridge on my own if I owned property or something, right.

456
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:08,764
Which I'm sure some people might have done and like, if you've done that,

457
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,173
send me pictures, I'd love to see them.

458
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:10,703
But

459
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:14,534
software is completely different because anybody can write software.

460
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:18,534
Anybody, like, there's no limitation. There's no, oh, like to build a bridge.

461
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:22,293
You need millions of dollars. Like no, you need what, a credit card and five bucks.

462
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:25,963
-- And you've got an internet website, you know,
-- one thing I've never understood is why

463
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:26,573
there is

464
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:28,776
so much software. A perfect example is skater

465
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:29,745
software, right?

466
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:33,615
I checked once and there's about 1000 companies globally writing skater software.

467
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,115
You know, ranging from really big ones,

468
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:39,735
like say Schneider Electric down to five guys, not the burger chain, but actually,

469
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:42,276
you know, five people writing skater software.

470
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:45,015
Uh sorry, I need to qualify that for our American listeners

471
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:45,515
and I,

472
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:46,965
I get that there needs to be different

473
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,336
sk of software for different hardware platforms and

474
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,166
for different sort of industry verticals like mining is

475
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:54,735
different than say chicken processing to some degree.

476
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,439
But fundamentally do there actually need to be 1000 companies doing this

477
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:00,719
globally and replicating that effort and

478
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,689
replicating those mistakes and problems.

479
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:05,760
-- I mean,
-- maybe who's to say you're right or wrong?

480
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,079
Well,

481
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,550
I can't feel I can't help but feel like that's part of

482
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,239
the problem we have is that we have so much replicated effort.

483
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,030
But is it, I mean, are you saying that there should be six restaurants in the,

484
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,739
in the world and all these, all these little places.

485
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,189
-- They're just duplicating effort.
-- I'm not saying there should be

486
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,849
-- restaurants, but there's only six ways to build a bridge.
-- I mean, that's not true.

487
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,969
There's a bazillion ways to build you.

488
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:30,180
-- There's an infinite number of ways to make a bridge.
-- No, no, no, no.

489
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:35,170
There are six basic designs, cantilever arch. Um

490
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,270
Anyways, I can't find the list right now, but

491
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:42,250
there's basically, there are 60 trust, trust is the other one.

492
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:43,859
But anyway, the point is

493
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,349
there's six ways

494
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,459
six fundamentally structural ways to build a bridge.

495
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:50,180
And yeah, there's a million variations on it.

496
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,140
You can paint it pink, you can paint it brown, whatever.

497
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,290
But fundamentally, you know, it's like building a road.

498
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,750
There's, you know, we can use asphalt,

499
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,439
we can use concrete where we could maybe use cobblestones if we

500
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,979
want to look at an old timey thing or gravel and dirt.

501
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:05,219
-- I mean,
-- I don't, I don't know if this is a valid comparison to software.

502
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:09,609
-- For
-- example, why do we need Internet Explorer and Chrome and Firefox and Safari?

503
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,660
When ironically,

504
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,310
aren't they kind of basically all based off

505
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,390
the same underlying engine at this point.

506
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,150
-- Safari is still its own thing,
-- right?

507
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,910
Well, Safari and Chrome share a common ancestor in what used to be called K HTML,

508
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,209
which was a KDE HTML library, which was,

509
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,010
and then they kind of diverged in their own direction.

510
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,670
Firefox was its own thing.

511
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,300
Internet Explorer had its own engine as well,

512
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,310
which eventually turned into edge and then eventually Microsoft was like,

513
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,810
screw it Chromium one.

514
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,000
And now they're using the Chromium engine

515
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:42,810
but I don't, I don't even know if this is the right

516
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,609
conversation to be having because saying well,

517
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:47,229
-- but
-- this is an example of now we don't

518
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:51,329
have four completely separate built from scratch engines.

519
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:54,939
-- We have sort of a more common engine that's still
-- written in C

520
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:55,714
exactly

521
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:56,675
like,

522
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:59,755
well, but at least we've agreed on the internal combustion engine and we're,

523
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:03,354
we've stopped trying to put raccoons and gas tanks in a formula one race.

524
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:06,234
Maybe, maybe I, I don't, I don't know.

525
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:06,435
Well,

526
00:23:06,444 --> 00:23:08,354
would you agree with the statement that it would be

527
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:12,635
harder to secure multiple code bases than less code bases?

528
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,290
No. And the reason being is that

529
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,000
it is still a giant pile of sea code.

530
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,449
I would say if, if there is a line of,

531
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:27,400
let's say a couple of 1000 lines of sea code that once you surpass it,

532
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,380
it doesn't matter how many lines you have,

533
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:34,550
you just have a mess and having four browser engines or having one browser engine.

534
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:37,959
You think of it as if you lump all of the code into one place,

535
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:39,859
you cross the line almost instantly

536
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,640
and I think one or four is unmaintainable. It doesn't matter.

537
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,680
Well, I I'm talking more about it from a high level view.

538
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:49,000
For example, with one general code base,

539
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,780
you could at least get some decisions made on

540
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,839
it that affect most of the world rather than,

541
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,890
you know, chrome decides to go and make zero days harder.

542
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,359
I hope Internet Explorer and Microsoft did as well.

543
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:02,170
-- And I would like to think Apple and Safari are doing that.
-- Everyone's trying.

544
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,089
But the only right answer is quit using freakin C four or one.

545
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:09,890
-- If they're all in c it doesn't matter because it all sucks.
-- I agree.

546
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:12,250
But I'm talking more about a perfect example.

547
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,400
It's the whole Cups thing that I tweeted about right where cup

548
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,140
is dead

549
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,420
and open printing is

550
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,670
supposedly taken over it except open printing is not mentioned

551
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,979
on the Cups website meaningfully or on the cups,

552
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:23,060
github at all.

553
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,900
I don't even know what, what is open printing. I don't even know what that is.

554
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,079
It's a fork of Cups.

555
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,069
OK. That's it.

556
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,800
It's a fork of Cups that's actually being maintained by the community.

557
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,699
I have no idea how well that's nice, good or bad it is. But whatever.

558
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:35,890
But the point is like, for example, Google Fuzz,

559
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,199
there's an issue where Google Fuzz filed an issue saying, hey,

560
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:41,949
we'd like to Fuzz Cups and like come play nice with us.

561
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,949
And of course, it's been ignored because Cups is dead.

562
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,849
I checked the open printing github

563
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,479
for that.

564
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,930
It couldn't find that issue.

565
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:49,260
Like,

566
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,569
I don't know if Google Fuzz doesn't know about open printing or if

567
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:54,290
they don't think it's important enough or whatever because it's a fork.

568
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,040
But the point is if Cups was still alive, for example,

569
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,569
it would be getting that Google open fuzzing

570
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,010
stuff.

571
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:03,849
Whereas now, because there's two code bases because one died and one is active.

572
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:06,189
Now, we kind of have to replicate that effort and it's more,

573
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:10,189
there's more friction and there's more stuff to do to kind of get the same result.

574
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,680
-- I,
-- I don't like this example because like cups is just dead full stop.

575
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:17,510
Like everyone should be focusing all their effort onto the other thing.

576
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:21,530
What I'm trying to get at though is we've never had as far as I can tell.

577
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,140
The only industry that's like software with

578
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,050
all this ridiculous replication is cooking,

579
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,310
right?

580
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,630
Every restaurant has a chef that makes this slightly different version of recipes.

581
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:32,329
But the difference being it's just a slightly different taste in curry,

582
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:35,250
not something that like you said is going to be possessed by demons and make you die.

583
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,630
Let me, let me, I can do one better. And I think this is a great comparison.

584
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,770
I think it's a great way to bring the show out on is cooking is a marvelous example.

585
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,130
And if you have a restaurant,

586
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,650
the health department is going to come and inspect you.

587
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,550
And if you're serving rotten chicken,

588
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,469
they're going to shut down your restaurant and tell you

589
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,390
you can't be open anymore until you fix this problem.

590
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,959
And now I'm not suggesting we should

591
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,910
have software inspectors because that sounds horrifying.

592
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,020
But we have software inspectors.

593
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,630
Source code fuzzing and it's awesome and it works perfectly.

594
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,270
No, it doesn't.

595
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,150
Anyway.

596
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:07,540
That was sarcasm.

597
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,989
Yeah, that was,

598
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,650
you're a little too serious. That one was too real. But, like, I mean, I think this is,

599
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,329
this is one of our challenges is

600
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,199
we have software. Anyone can build it.

601
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,510
But if I write terrible software,

602
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,589
no one gets sick and dies. So no one really cares you like.

603
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,140
The only reason health departments exist is

604
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,859
because if the restaurant makes bad food,

605
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:33,579
I might get sick and die and people freak out about that.

606
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,430
Well, but even when people do get sick and die, metaphorically speaking,

607
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:39,219
like this whole solar winds thing, it's not like they stop using it.

608
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,579
I mean, I just got a letter from service experts, Canada,

609
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:44,636
this giant organization that basically kind of runs the

610
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,626
back end for a bunch of HVAC companies,

611
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:47,687
you know, heating and ventilation.

612
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:50,276
So they had a data breach with ransomware and I got a

613
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:52,227
letter with a 1 to 800 number I can call to,

614
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,626
I guess, complain about and they're giving me this useless advice like, you know,

615
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:58,107
make sure your credit score is good and don't,

616
00:26:58,227 --> 00:26:58,546
you know,

617
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,927
don't basically fill out credit forms online that were

618
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:03,217
sent to you via S MS text or email,

619
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:03,366
right?

620
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:06,246
Just useless stuff. And it just makes me angry because

621
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:08,754
I did not have a direct relationship with service experts,

622
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:11,114
Canada and I cannot do anything about this.

623
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:15,093
I'm stuck with their crappy data security pretty much.

624
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:16,663
And in the software world it's the same,

625
00:27:16,673 --> 00:27:19,803
like I have bought this software because they have some sort of security flaw.

626
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:21,293
It's not like I'm going to throw it out and buy a different

627
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:23,734
one because it's not like the different one is going to be secure.

628
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:23,913
Right.

629
00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:26,943
And, and, but you said something really important just a minute ago.

630
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:29,154
And I want to kind of end on this point as you said, you know,

631
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:32,114
solar winds of metaphorically getting sick and dying,

632
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:34,933
metaphorically doesn't count like people have to litter.

633
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,100
I die before anyone cares and not just a couple people,

634
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,401
it has to be thousands to millions of people.

635
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:43,681
And I'm going to like this, this bothers me to say,

636
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,470
-- I'm
-- not even sure man because I'm looking

637
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,350
at the COVID situation and it's like that hasn't

638
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,380
actually gotten people to just wear a mask

639
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,791
-- and wash their hands
-- that has active disinformation,

640
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:54,781
working towards it.

641
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:54,951
So

642
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:57,461
-- the software industry
-- and I think it does.

643
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,520
And so this, this makes it because obviously, if I suggested that

644
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:09,280
we need government regulation of all software sold to the public, I can only imagine

645
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:14,099
the the the hate that would come raining down upon me and some of

646
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,760
it would be would be real and some of it would be manufactured.

647
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,469
But even then you think about the labor

648
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,640
movement where they were advocating for worker safety,

649
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:26,326
there was enormous disinformation coming from these

650
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:28,156
industries who didn't want to change.

651
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,436
I mean, when you can externalize costs like that,

652
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:31,595
right?

653
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:32,776
And look,

654
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:35,056
they have almost nothing to lose with

655
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:38,576
disinformation because that's going to add cost and

656
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:42,306
suffering on their part even though it will make like society in general better.

657
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:45,952
And so, but again, at the same time, like you said, at the very beginning,

658
00:28:45,962 --> 00:28:48,312
the world goes on like, is it that bad?

659
00:28:48,322 --> 00:28:52,271
Not really is having a web browser that sucks better than having no web browser?

660
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:54,901
Absolutely. So in summary,

661
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:58,112
after our discussion, I have no idea.

662
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,541
-- I
-- just, I'll leave us on two depressing notes.

663
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:03,312
In late 2018, Toyota recalled nearly 2.5 million

664
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:05,712
vehicles after finding a software glitch, blah, blah, blah.

665
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,520
In 2019, a jury ordered the company to pay a $15.8 million in damages. Ok.

666
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,020
Whatever $15.8 million is their coffee budget.

667
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,459
Here is the one thing I will end on and,

668
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:17,560
and this will tie it back to the Google part

669
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,849
is if your advice is ever just security harder,

670
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,540
you suck.

671
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,140
-- That's all.
-- Yeah, I,

672
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,439
I don't know what to say at this point because I've seen people

673
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:28,270
try security harder and I've seen people like Google Project Zero is,

674
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,619
is actually security and harder in

675
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,910
a

676
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,579
I'm not sure it's effective

677
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:32,829
to

678
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,680
put it bluntly. No, I'm really not sure that it's truly effective.

679
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:40,020
-- It makes for cool reports. So I'll let them go.
-- They're fixing Cve.

680
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,939
But again, does that, is that really?

681
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,479
We should talk about this someday because we're out of time?

682
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:48,680
But I have a suspicion, Google Project Zeros is more about

683
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:49,969
attention

684
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:50,849
than

685
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,770
actually fixing things. But that's another story. So anyway, I'm going to end this.

686
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,520
