Hello and welcome to the

1
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:10,750
security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,000
-- Back
-- to Crime. How exciting

3
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:16,870
to be clear. We had nothing to do with what we're about to discuss. Did we?

4
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:19,000
I personally,

5
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:23,379
I'll be blunt, I don't see a good path to monetization with this attack,

6
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,739
so I'm not interested.

7
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,329
Ok. So we're gonna PHP. Got back

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,659
door and

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,299
-- that's neat.
-- Well, the thing is if that had actually made it

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,619
-- into a release, yeah, that would be news.
-- I agree.

11
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:37,694
Well, sort of, I mean,

12
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:42,944
-- but
-- I'm pretty sure nobody's using PHP current or head or whatever it's called.

13
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:44,235
I would hope not.

14
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:44,665
I mean,

15
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:48,825
I would suspect most people running PHP are running comically old versions of it.

16
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:51,075
Well, I've installed PP by hand.

17
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,025
So the answer is everybody's running whatever they were given by default.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,790
No, I'm serious. Right. We've, we've, we've been, we've been there.

19
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,369
It's, I don't install anything manually anymore.

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,950
Like I, I consider even installing like a snap to be like that's a little bit,

21
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:04,949
maybe too much work.

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,370
But, ok, I'll do it this one time. So, yeah.

23
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:10,669
-- So PHP they put in the back door and, well, like you said, it was, it
-- was ok.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,190
Let's, let's explain this a little more in depth for anyone who doesn't know.

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,610
So PHP is a web

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,830
development language from,

27
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,260
it's a blast from the past.

28
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:24,186
I mean, I haven't written PHP code in well over a decade,

29
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:28,866
I think at this point and I don't think I've even seen any in over a decade

30
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:34,266
-- says the guy who runs a wordpress site, I
-- do not run wordpress. I pay automatic to run.

31
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,336
Word is wordpress written in PHP. I don't even know.

32
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:38,957
-- Is it
-- cool? It's a PHP. It's a class. It's

33
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:44,656
wordpress is the ubiquitous lamp stack, right? Linux Apache, mysql PHP.

34
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,726
Oh, that's right. Lamp. I forgot about lamp.

35
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,906
-- Yeah, that's funny. You know what?
-- We're going so old.

36
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,694
-- We're starting to forget stuff then and
-- the world moves on. Right.

37
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:56,763
-- I mean, no Js is the PP of today.
-- Well, also Holy PHP is up to version eight.

38
00:01:56,774 --> 00:02:00,124
I just looked at the website and I'm like, is it? That's what the website says.

39
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:01,043
-- It
-- doesn't matter. Right.

40
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,893
Remember it used to be Pearl and then it was PP and then I don't know it was

41
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:08,723
in the middle and now it's no Js and it'll be something else in a decade and whatever.

42
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,393
Well, the nice thing about PHP is, you know,

43
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:13,684
you could actually just jam some code into a page and poof instant.

44
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:17,570
-- It just worked.
-- It definitely had a uniqueness to it. I will agree with that.

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,291
So, anyway, anyway, anyway, PHP had

46
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:24,031
two commits that have been pointed out where it was

47
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:29,591
clearly a malicious actor inserting bad code into PHP.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,180
And here's the really wild part about all of this.

49
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,401
They believe the credentials were stolen from the user and from, I,

50
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,080
I don't have confirmation of this,

51
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:42,380
but supposedly two factor authentication was enabled.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,341
So

53
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,759
something that, that adds a whole, like what's going on here aspect of this.

54
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,440
-- Well,
-- if they proxi it, right?

55
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:53,460
Just because the thing is, it depends on how you're doing two factor if you're doing,

56
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,080
you know, a six digit

57
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,779
code S MS to your phone,

58
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,369
you can either intercept that by intercepting S MS

59
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,610
or somebody's at,

60
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,139
you know, a bad web page and they enter in their six

61
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,139
digit

62
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,119
code. Now it's, it's when you start talking things like, well UB keys,

63
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,149
then you're actually like, even if you go to the attacker website,

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,800
plug your key and your key is gonna be like, no, bro, don't do that.

65
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,559
Yep. Yep.

66
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,610
OK. So anyway, we find out about all of this, everything's kind of reverted.

67
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:23,360
And I think the one thing the PHP developers did that it is very clever

68
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,699
is they were running their own source code management system and they were like,

69
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,029
we have to stop doing this immediately and they moved everything to

70
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,429
-- github like overnight.
-- It was easier than that because

71
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:32,559
I

72
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:37,149
moved to github but github was not the canonical source. It was a

73
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,369
copy. OK.

74
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,460
I'm less impressed now with how quickly they did it well,

75
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,210
-- but
-- more to the point they have the foresight to do that.

76
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,860
Lots of projects do that. I think like a lot of the Apache stuff does that.

77
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,669
-- Well, the Linux kernel even is the
-- Linux kernel.

78
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,559
Yeah, it's in github.

79
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,089
I know it's in github. But is that not the canonical copy?

80
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,080
-- I don't,
-- I don't know anymore.

81
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:56,679
I don't pay attention to any of this stuff anymore.

82
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,020
-- The other thing is it was actually two developers that got hacked. Was it
-- two of them?

83
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,279
Yeah,

84
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,100
it says yesterday 2 2021 3 28 2 malicious commits were

85
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,740
pushed to the PHP source repo from the names of Rasmus

86
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,460
Erdf and myself.

87
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,220
So

88
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,419
two accounts got hacked, which is even more impressive.

89
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:16,230
Well, maybe it, well, it's, here's what I don't get about.

90
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,820
This whole attack is the attacker is sophisticated enough to pop to developers who

91
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,140
are hopefully somewhat technologically sophisticated and, you know,

92
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:25,299
somewhat security savvy

93
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,690
and they have that level of sophistication,

94
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,970
but then they totally screw up on the back door.

95
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,220
-- The back door is so comically obvious.
-- I know that's

96
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,709
what I mean.

97
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:37,390
They didn't try to hide it at all.

98
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,440
It was clearly a backdoor which I and I think this is where

99
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:47,989
the whole story veers off into the weeds is no attacker who's

100
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,679
legitimately trying to attack something.

101
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,559
Does this,

102
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,690
this feels like there's some meta layer

103
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,929
that we don't understand of someone trying to

104
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,559
prove a point or someone trying to send a message to someone else or something?

105
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,959
It's, it's stupid.

106
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,709
Yeah.

107
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,059
Remember those massive D

108
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,679
OS attacks where everybody's like, oh, it's the Russians and Chinese.

109
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,600
Why would they burn zero days to blah, blah, blah.

110
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,220
And it turned out a couple of teenagers doing Minecraft D

111
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,570
os extortion. I mean,

112
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,920
right.

113
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:15,609
-- So
-- your story is more boring.

114
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,109
-- It's I will, it's like the Twitter hack. It was a 17 year old.
-- I remember that one too

115
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,890
like this. I'm sorry to say.

116
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:26,010
But when I say somebody who's technologically sophisticated and security savvy

117
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:28,369
like me, I can still get hacked by a 17 year old.

118
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:31,299
I just have to be tired one day and make a mistake once

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,779
or just live with a 17 year old. And,

120
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:38,980
-- well,
-- for example, at the CS A, we keep getting these, uh, you know, word documents,

121
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:42,000
mostly Excel files that have Macro viruses, that

122
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:46,179
one or two of the detection engines, mostly the Chinese ones on virus,

123
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,380
total.com detect and the rest don't.

124
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:52,630
And so, you know, Gmail happily passes these through and they're,

125
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,399
they're really obviously viruses or, you know,

126
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,079
macro viruses because it's like a short little Excel

127
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,859
file from somebody we've never heard of from some,

128
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,500
you know, random AOL account or whatever saying, you know, blah, blah,

129
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,420
please open this and it detects in a couple of antivirus engines.

130
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:08,179
This actually speaks to some stuff I've been

131
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,579
looking at where you're going to get hacked.

132
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,869
The question is how fast can you get rid of

133
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,299
the attacker and return to a normal good baseline?

134
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,179
And

135
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,859
git is lovely for that because to get rid of two git

136
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:21,459
commits is, well, it's really easy. It's one commands

137
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:25,779
and for example, to move to github, the

138
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,250
thing I love about github

139
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:27,910
is

140
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,269
I also have a copy of it.

141
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,019
So even if github were to get hacked and somebody were to monkey with my G

142
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,019
repo in github,

143
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,850
my workstation would be like, whoa what, you know what happened here, right?

144
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,809
Like all the commits are wonky. You know, I would throw up a huge air

145
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:44,799
and if you also do signed commits, which are a pain in the butt, but not impossible.

146
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:46,750
You know, now you also have to

147
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,600
compromise cryptographic material on the workstation.

148
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,390
The difference here is,

149
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,910
I don't think they actually broke into the developers workstations.

150
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,339
It sounds like they got fished.

151
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,410
And that's a big difference.

152
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,570
Like I absolutely guarantee you at some point in the future, I will get fished.

153
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,500
It's gonna,

154
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,459
-- you're a human, all humans are going to get fish.
-- That's why he's a password manager.

155
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,029
But anyway,

156
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,790
but the chances of somebody actually breaking into

157
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,470
and getting persistence on my workstation are much,

158
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,309
much, much lower.

159
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,429
I mean, that's true.

160
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,690
I do rail on signed commits a lot because they don't exactly do what

161
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,899
people think they do and the vast majority of people have unprotected keys.

162
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,690
Dude, it's such a pain in the, to have to type in your passwords every time.

163
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,390
-- So
-- it is, it's, it's a huge pain.

164
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,510
I literally have unprotected signing keys because, but it does raise the bar.

165
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,589
This is what got fedora in trouble is people had unprotected SSH

166
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,230
keys on shared systems that are also used to manage like infrastructure.

167
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,570
Well, but here's the challenge, right?

168
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,529
Even if I protect my SSH key or my P GP GP G, whatever key,

169
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:49,510
if the attacker gets local persistence

170
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,820
with my privilege level right now, it's just a waiting game.

171
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:55,190
-- Yeah, you've got huge problems. I mean,
-- even,

172
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,660
well, it's just a waiting game.

173
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,660
I will eventually unlock my key and they will, they will see that.

174
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,369
I mean, brutal simplicity.

175
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,640
They could just alias the command to something that logs it and runs the command.

176
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,549
Probably.

177
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,940
I mean, this is where you can make the argument like UB key can store your GP G key

178
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,920
on the, on the hardware token. And like I have that it's a huge pain in the butt to use.

179
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,670
But

180
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,670
even then if someone has persistence on my machine,

181
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,390
they can just wait for me to plug the key and unlock the key and then it's over.

182
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:25,859
But well,

183
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:28,059
but then there's a subtle difference is that they can

184
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,869
use your key but they can't copy your key.

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,470
That's true.

186
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,710
And so that means you can have an incident,

187
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,590
but you can also,

188
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,429
you can close the barn door. Most likely.

189
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,957
That's a good point. I mean, not that it matters.

190
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:43,888
I would still obviously recycle that key immediately if it was used incorrectly,

191
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,708
even once

192
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:48,109
that I know of because who knows how many times it got used, you know,

193
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,468
and that's part of the problem, right?

194
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:53,508
Is, is with like with availability and integrity, it's really obvious,

195
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:54,539
like kind of what happened.

196
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:56,218
Well, let me rephrase with availability.

197
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:58,158
It's pretty obvious what happened because it's either broken,

198
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:00,218
missing or gone with integrity.

199
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:04,148
If you have backups or something to ref to reference against, it's pretty easy,

200
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:05,109
but not always.

201
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:08,539
And then with confidentiality though, your stuff could be out there on the dark web.

202
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,190
-- Who knows?
-- That's true. Yeah, you can't, you don't know.

203
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,950
Yeah. And you can't prove a negative of saying like this is gone.

204
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,869
We wiped it off the internet anyway.

205
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,799
So here's the real thing I want to talk about with,

206
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,869
with all this whole PHP nonsense is the fact that

207
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,599
there's going to be naysayers that are like, oh open source. It's so insecure.

208
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:25,780
Look at all this, look at all this.

209
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:29,539
But I think the reality is this is kind of how it works where

210
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,219
something happens, lots of people notice

211
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,150
and then there are reactions to it immediately

212
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,479
and the exact opposite is ubiquity is in the

213
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:40,760
news right now for basically just trying to brush

214
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,590
everything under the rug for a terrible incident.

215
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:44,219
It works.

216
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:47,984
They did manage to brush it under the rug until you know,

217
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,784
there was an uh a reputable article about it.

218
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:54,825
And so long story short, it sounds like because when it initially came out,

219
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:55,625
I was like, OK,

220
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:56,525
saying

221
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:59,304
third party hosted data,

222
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:02,424
that's weasel words now because everything is third party hosted because

223
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,895
you're unless you have your own hardware in a colo location,

224
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,224
somebody else is hosting it,

225
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,719
right? Infrastructure as a service platform is a service, whatever.

226
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,390
And

227
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,659
there's obviously like pretty much everybody uses

228
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:16,219
Amazon S3 buckets at this point to

229
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,070
store data because it's just so cheap and it just works so well.

230
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,580
And so the classic thing is, you know,

231
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,340
people don't protect their S3 buckets properly and they get popped and

232
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,059
voila,

233
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:28,729
you know, data exfiltration from us, they use real fast and easy.

234
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,179
So I was, I was betting that that's what had happened originally.

235
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,450
And it turns out I was right.

236
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,609
Uh What I wasn't right about though was about how bad

237
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,309
it was like the type of data that was exposed.

238
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:41,799
And

239
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,909
here's the thing, if, if it was just this one thing, I could sort of forgive ubiquity.

240
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,919
But I've actually noticed in the last six months

241
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,869
because we actually bought a bunch of ubiquity gear.

242
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,150
And so, you know, because they're, they're good. Right. They're ok.

243
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:58,599
But because we've bought it, I've been paying a little more attention to them than

244
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,280
well I ever did before.

245
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:03,280
And there's some threads on hacker news that are,

246
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,590
especially in the last week or two that

247
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,070
are actually kind of concerning talking about,

248
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,349
you know,

249
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,929
the amount of engineering talent that has left the company and how

250
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,690
it's just sort of in a race to the bottom with cheap developers

251
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,849
and worse things like advertising in the interface in some cases.

252
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:17,260
Uh

253
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,609
That's terrible.

254
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:23,190
It just to be blunt, it sounds like the company peaked and is in decline.

255
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,030
And, and look, even if that's true, the fact is

256
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,390
they are

257
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,030
hiding behind a curtain

258
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,929
and they pulled the pay no attention to the man behind the

259
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,330
curtain and they got away with it for a little while.

260
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,130
But I think the lesson here is

261
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,169
anyone who complains about open source being insecure

262
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:42,469
is either they have an agenda or they're

263
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:45,390
comically ill informed because like these are two

264
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,659
opposite instances where the open source example,

265
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:51,549
things happen the way they should have happened to make everything better.

266
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,369
And in the ubiquity sense, it's like

267
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,469
this is a comedy of errors.

268
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,619
It's not a comedy of errors. It's, it's, it looks to be actively malice.

269
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,309
-- OK? Comedy is stupidity then maybe.
-- No, no, no.

270
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,210
It, it looks to be,

271
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:07,989
it looks like they actually made a conscious decision to hide this.

272
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,409
I I have no doubt they did. I have no doubt. Someone with a fancy title

273
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:12,960
made this happen.

274
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,250
Yeah. No, it's,

275
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:15,049
and

276
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,390
I will absolutely forgive PHP.

277
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,270
Like, in my opinion,

278
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,409
all major open source projects should be in github because if nothing else,

279
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,419
like

280
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,130
spending that time and effort running that infrastructure

281
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:28,890
is unless you're building tools that do that,

282
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,400
you know, like, get labs. If GIT labs is in github,

283
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,640
I would say that's a problem. But get labs, you know, they're on their own dogs

284
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:37,609
-- or for example,
-- well, there's like Ed Lass

285
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:38,119
and has

286
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,719
lab has its own

287
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,020
github.

288
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,559
There's, there's a handful of services that do this and you're right,

289
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,849
this is their service.

290
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,260
This is their bread and butter.

291
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,530
By definition, you will never be better at this than they are.

292
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,080
Nobody builds their own

293
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,599
data center anymore. We leave that up to the experts.

294
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:58,169
You know, you, you go and rent rack space because getting reliable power,

295
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:00,530
reliable internet, physical security, all that stuff.

296
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,130
It's a nightmare.

297
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,929
But having said that so

298
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,450
somebody like ubiquity doing this, it's, it's,

299
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,080
it kind of reminds me of the whole back door versus bug thing where

300
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,880
there's malice, there's intent. Yes.

301
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,099
And,

302
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:16,169
and I want to focus on that for a second because here's the thing

303
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:21,039
you need to understand is if an open source project has a security incident,

304
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,710
they have no choice but to

305
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,000
lay it all out.

306
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:28,440
-- There's no choice
-- one where they've tried to hide it, but

307
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,580
it doesn't work. What happens is, I mean, I've been a part of this more than once.

308
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,419
Is the conversation starts.

309
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,760
You talk about how do we make this seem less bad?

310
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,760
And you come to the inevitable conclusion,

311
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:42,070
we just have to tell the complete truth. There's nothing else we can do.

312
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,500
That is how this goes down.

313
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,739
There might be a hiccup in some projects where they're like, oh,

314
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,059
we'll try to make it sound this bad.

315
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,200
But at the end of the day,

316
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:50,349
you're gonna be telling the truth.

317
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,580
Now, when you are a private company,

318
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,869
you can have this conversation and you can come to the conclusion.

319
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,229
We're going to lie

320
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:04,780
and it is conceivable. No one will know and I promise you 100% every single company

321
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,750
that gets punk

322
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,789
has this conversation

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,500
and some of them decide to lie.

324
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,849
Part of it too is I would say it goes back to the intent.

325
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:17,229
My, my experience with open source is that when it comes to the intent of hiding,

326
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,809
it's more about personal ego or things like that.

327
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,270
There's, there's generally not a lot of money involved.

328
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:23,989
No,

329
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,789
no, it's just about looking stupid.

330
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,820
Like I don't want to look dumb and well, you look dumb because you got PED

331
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,669
-- like that's just how it is.
-- Yeah. And everybody gets ped at some point,

332
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,500
you know, I actually got pulled through a PHP vulnerability once

333
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,840
there used to be so many.

334
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:42,679
And, well, no, the funny thing is that it, it was on a f,

335
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,130
it was on a Friday and there was a, like I knew there was a Linux kernel issue.

336
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,099
I should remediate and I was like, I'll put it off till Monday

337
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,010
while the attacker didn't.

338
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,070
Whoops. Like it, it happens. It's just, it's

339
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,580
what's always funny to me is there's, if somebody breaks into a person's house,

340
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,960
you don't blame the person who owns the house, you don't call them stupid.

341
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,049
But yet with software and networks we do that all the time.

342
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,770
It's, it's interesting to me how there's that,

343
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,909
I mean, it's sort of a different dynamic. If somebody left their door hanging open,

344
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,570
you would call them stupid if someone ran in and installed their stuff,

345
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,349
like they opened the door and left,

346
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:16,109
right.

347
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,150
And in some instances

348
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:21,539
in it, that is kind of what happens.

349
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:25,320
So I think it's more complicated but I do agree that generally speaking,

350
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,400
we shouldn't be blaming the victim in most cases.

351
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:33,119
Yeah. But on the flip side, what some of these victims are doing is so egregious that

352
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,119
right.

353
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,679
You know, like with what ubiquity did,

354
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,979
number one to leave all that customer data exposed

355
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,659
or allow access to it. You know,

356
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,400
because the thing is, if you're in Amazon, you can lock that stuff down,

357
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,469
you can have multi factor authentication, hardware tokens,

358
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,570
like you can do a good job easily.

359
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,309
In theory,

360
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:54,609
ok. But the problem is ubiquity isn't just some random company.

361
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:56,250
UBIQUITY is a company

362
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:58,929
that is like solar winds and that if you hack into

363
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,450
ubiquity you can now hack into a lot of corporate networks.

364
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,729
That's fair.

365
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,489
So I would say that they have a special, you know, it's, it's the difference between,

366
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:09,270
uh,

367
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,650
somebody who makes consumer grade locks and somebody

368
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,299
like Schlag who makes commercial grade locks if Schlag

369
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,059
has,

370
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,580
you know, a flaw in their lock.

371
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:20,020
Yeah, that's, it's bad. But

372
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,150
now you, you know, you're talking about, like, breaking into banks and stuff.

373
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,369
I mean, I, I agree with that, I think because, well,

374
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,510
not only that the industrial equipment costs more and it comes with

375
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,559
the impression that it is better than the consumer grade equipment.

376
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:34,909
Right.

377
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,530
-- Oh, yeah.
-- No, I have a Schlag lock on the door here and it's, it was not a cheap lock.

378
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,700
I, I

379
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,530
do not. Um,

380
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,780
my locks are terrible but that's ok.

381
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,460
It's, the locks only exist in my house.

382
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:49,789
So when I get broken into I can tell the insurance company I had locks pretty

383
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,049
much,

384
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,919
you know, it's funny to me because, like,

385
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,349
my front door lock is biometric so that my kids can get

386
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,789
in without me having to worry about them losing their key.

387
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,020
I mean, that's fair. I, I'm, I'm ok with that.

388
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,059
Well, I also have a security system. So,

389
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,780
but is it hooked up to the internet?

390
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,510
Yes, of course it is. It's ring.

391
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,160
No, not the security system. I mean, is the door lock hooked up to the internet?

392
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,209
Sweet.

393
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,020
So, if the, if your wi Fi goes out, can you knock it in your house?

394
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,089
Uh, well, no, no, no, you can get in with a biometric or a key.

395
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,598
-- No,
-- even without internet.

396
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:19,118
Yeah.

397
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,130
Well, the bi

398
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,089
is local. Right. It's a thumbprint scanner or it's a fingerprint scanner.

399
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,709
-- Well,
-- right. But I don't know, does it send that off to the cloud or something

400
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,859
locally? Which means it's comically terrible.

401
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,130
No. No.

402
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,280
Like, seriously the, the experience of, you know, like on a, on an ipad,

403
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,119
you can just mash your finger down basically anywhere and it just works

404
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:39,859
this thing. You got to put your finger on just right. Or it's, it just kind of goes

405
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,189
beep, beep, beep.

406
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:41,359
I

407
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:45,709
mean, that's probably better than letting, like a hot dog open your door, you know?

408
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,729
Well, if you really want to open my door, bring an eight pound sledgehammer,

409
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:51,719
you can't be giving out information like that.

410
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,439
I'm pretty sure most doors can be opened with an eight pound sledgehammer.

411
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,599
I bet most doors could be opened with a kick.

412
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,219
-- Well, but you might hurt your ankle.
-- Probably. I would, I'm old.

413
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:02,780
I can't, I can't be doing that kind of stuff.

414
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,140
-- I know.
-- Seriously. It's my osteoporosis.

415
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:09,500
Which, well, that actually leads to another interesting topic.

416
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,560
So, we decided a long time ago.

417
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,540
That keys had to be secret, which meant, you know,

418
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,729
with the rise of high quality cameras,

419
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,699
people need to keep their keys in their pockets.

420
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,439
-- Yeah.
-- Right.

421
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:22,609
Well, you know, one of my favorite examples is remember when the whole, like,

422
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:25,089
you have to buy a TS, a approved lock for your life

423
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:26,734
became a thing.

424
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,494
Someone took a picture of the TS A keys.

425
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:33,464
This was like AAA press thing where the TS A like the media group took a

426
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:38,655
picture of the keys and then someone took the pictures and they 3D printed TS a keys

427
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:39,175
and

428
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:41,824
well, right. But like

429
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:43,814
that's hilarious, right?

430
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,660
Well, the same thing happened with uh when it was like a New York,

431
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,689
either a fire department or an elevator key.

432
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:51,160
It was like posted online and it's,

433
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,969
it's actually known as like the 8684 key or

434
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,540
something because that's the bidding on the key.

435
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,099
One of the magic keys

436
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,339
that opens up like half the doors in New York

437
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,650
anyways. Um So the deal is keys have cuts,

438
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,459
um

439
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,270
cheap keys basically just have depth of cut.

440
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,260
Uh for example, a more expensive lo like a slog.

441
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,260
They also have a direction of cut, right? They have like a slope to it.

442
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,069
Yeah. And, and you know what, we'll just put a link to the lock picking lawyer.

443
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:21,910
He talks about all this stuff and shows it off and he takes it up hard and it's amazing.

444
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,650
And uh and I love that anyways.

445
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:29,310
And so the majority of consumer grade cheap keys are just cut to a certain depth,

446
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,839
you know, uh it's uh between a one and a five depth of cut.

447
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:33,069
So there's

448
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,270
five positions.

449
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:36,469
And so the deal is

450
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,189
if you can take a picture of the key, obviously, you can copy the key.

451
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:42,209
But what if you can listen to the key being inserted into the lock?

452
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:46,500
-- I
-- mean, it's a side channel attack on, on keys. I love it. It's awesome.

453
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,729
And, but here's the thing, right?

454
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,689
So traditionally, I would have said, oh, that's gonna be tricky.

455
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:54,199
But here's one of my friends recently did an IOT project where he took a really tiny,

456
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:59,430
single form uh single uh system on a chip, small form factor board.

457
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,689
We're talking something the size of like basically two jelly beans glued together.

458
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:04,209
That's a computer running Linux,

459
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:05,209
right?

460
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:10,170
I've seen them. They're awesome. And he attached it to a lithium ion 16, 850 battery,

461
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,589
which means it'll run for like months.

462
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,130
Right?

463
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,180
Well, and that's, I think that's the thing that has changed is

464
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:24,439
I can now build a surveillance device with a camera and, or microphone

465
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,780
-- that is number one, very high quality. I
-- mean, I carry one in my pocket man.

466
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:29,040
Yeah.

467
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,719
Well, I'm talking small though, not big, like a phone. I'm talking small.

468
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:36,040
Like it looks like a piece. Like it just, it looks like a small piece of gravel,

469
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,800
right?

470
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,479
And that's part of the difference is,

471
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,680
you know,

472
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,770
you could easily hide something like this near the lock as a rock or a,

473
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,189
a piece of dog turd

474
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,310
and not, and collect time over da or data over time, right?

475
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,369
So you collect multiple key insertions because

476
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,439
that was one of the challenges they were

477
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:57,180
saying is like look a single key insertion that's gonna be really hard and yeah,

478
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,140
it probably will be.

479
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,890
But I'm guessing with some machine learning algorithms and you know, 10 or 20

480
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:03,880
instances of the data,

481
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,479
I'm guessing that problem becomes much easier.

482
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,310
Yeah,

483
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,430
probably there's so I'll put a link in the show notes but the lock picking

484
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,109
lawyer actually has a video I watched some

485
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,160
time ago where there's this like little camera

486
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,119
you,

487
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:19,880
yeah, you insert into

488
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,609
the the keyhole

489
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,439
and then

490
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,239
it, it you look at the picture and then they have like this little card and based upon

491
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:28,640
it's just a borescope,

492
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:31,390
I mean, right? But based upon what you see then

493
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:33,520
that you, you could decode the key,

494
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,319
get the code and then basically go to like a one of those

495
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:41,069
lock creating machines type the code in you decode it from the camera key

496
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,599
and it will print a functioning key like it's

497
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:44,170
and

498
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:48,000
here's the difference that technology used to be horrendously expensive,

499
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,670
but now it's,

500
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,439
you know, 3050 bucks.

501
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:55,010
-- Well, no,
-- I mean that that particular camera, I think was like $300 which is still not

502
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,979
-- ok. $300 is still pretty cheap.
-- It's still pretty cheap. I agree.

503
00:21:58,989 --> 00:21:59,770
Like, and you're right,

504
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,780
cause a technology like that even a decade ago would have been thousands of dollars.

505
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,209
I bought a bore scope. It's eight millimeters in diameter.

506
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:10,859
It has led lights on the end. It's basically just a, it's a fancy USB camera

507
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,640
on the end of a 10

508
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,250
m

509
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:13,650
stall.

510
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:16,569
-- It's amazing
-- to inspect my plumbing and it was,

511
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,209
it was under $30.

512
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,260
They're super cheap. I don't have one.

513
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:25,760
-- I keep meaning to get one
-- and it came with a USB battery that has a Wi Fi transmitter.

514
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:28,209
So it connect as a Wi Fi camera,

515
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,229
right? It's got like this really terrible app but

516
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,680
you basically just plug this battery and shove

517
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:35,530
the camera down a thing and then you can

518
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,619
pull the image up on your iphone or ipad or if you have like a laptop,

519
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,050
you just plug it straight into the USB

520
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,900
and it was like 25 or

521
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,540
-- it was under 30 bucks.
-- Yeah, they're dirt cheap. I, I looked into one at one point.

522
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:46,589
I,

523
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,180
I don't remember why I didn't get it but they are

524
00:22:49,189 --> 00:22:52,359
-- ridiculously inexpensive
-- and they used to be thousands of dollars.

525
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,290
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. I mean, I, yeah,

526
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,229
I remember that.

527
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,420
I remember when it was a huge deal. If you do someone with a Bar Scco camera

528
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,709
and, and I remember actually using them on C RT s

529
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,010
because that's the only way you could look at the picture.

530
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,599
Oh, yeah.

531
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,349
And they didn't work in the sun because it's AC RT.

532
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:15,560
So you had to, like, construct this weird little, like, shaded area to, to use it.

533
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:18,819
Oh, man, those are the days. Anyway. Anyway, we, we're in the weeds.

534
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,359
So, I, I think that, see, and this is part of my

535
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,859
sort of risk assessment of my house is, I'm not,

536
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,010
I know fundamentally that the whole point of a key

537
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,765
is that it relies on obscurity of the bidding and

538
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:33,285
quote unquote, air quotes, difficulty in copying the key, which it's not,

539
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:36,594
you can go buy blank keys and a key punch for 20 bucks on ebay.

540
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:40,515
-- Well,
-- you can use a bump key and get into any lock in like three seconds.

541
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:45,545
Just locks on houses suck and are from the perspective of keeping people out,

542
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:47,005
they fail 100%.

543
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:50,915
And so my security posture for my house doesn't rely on that.

544
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:52,449
Right. It's just

545
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,739
like most things, the, uh, physical security, uh, the,

546
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,630
the premise is I want to slow the attacker down enough that the police can show up.

547
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:01,989
I mean, that's fair.

548
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,420
Well, because no offense. But if somebody doesn't show up to enforce

549
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,010
and through, I mean, physical force to enforce the law,

550
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,619
why would the attacker stop?

551
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,719
I mean, they wouldn't. Right.

552
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:15,479
And this is one of the problems in like rural communities,

553
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:16,880
right where the cops take half an hour to an

554
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,150
hour to show up the Attackers know that they can

555
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,819
go through your barn and grab your A TV and stuff.

556
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,560
Yep. Yep. Yeah, there's infinite time for sure, for sure.

557
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,699
And, I mean, ok, so let's, let's bring it all back to the beginning and,

558
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:30,739
and tie this all together.

559
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,819
I think it really, I think we're going to see a shift from

560
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,800
traditional sort of barrier security

561
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:40,239
to more monitoring and active response security.

562
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,699
And I don't mean just physically, but,

563
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,380
you know, on your phone, on your computer,

564
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,979
the,

565
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:47,930
the reality is we know the Attackers are gonna get a zero

566
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:51,099
day or gonna get a well known issue that you forgot to patch

567
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:52,219
and they're going to get in.

568
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,650
And for example, I love that apparently on Apple iphones now,

569
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:55,939
a

570
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,089
99.9% certain way to get an attacker off your phone is to turn it off and on.

571
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,530
Right. Because they to get actual hardware-based persistence

572
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:07,719
-- is apparently really difficult on an iphone
-- now.

573
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:11,170
I mean, so look, I like what you said at the beginning, but I wanna,

574
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,130
I wanna relate something to that.

575
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,609
So I, I do think you are correct that prevention is generally a red herring

576
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,140
and I don't think it works very often,

577
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,810
but I will say in light of many of the supply

578
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:25,609
chain attacks that are now becoming like a hot topic.

579
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,459
I'm seeing more and more people becoming more

580
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:31,280
and more obsessed with prevention instead of detection

581
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,979
and the real, like, here's, here's one of my favorite examples.

582
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:37,250
You know, I work at elastic and our products contain a,

583
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,609
a large number of open source dependencies

584
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,890
because obviously every product does today.

585
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,569
Right. That's just, that's how it works.

586
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:47,369
And I track these things meticulously and there are,

587
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,719
for example, you will have, uh, I mean,

588
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,339
we've talked about this at length where there will be a

589
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,130
security issue in a bit of code we're not using.

590
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,050
And it's like, OK, I acknowledge this is there,

591
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,660
but this is obviously vastly less important than the security

592
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,290
issue in the bit of code we are using.

593
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:06,130
And I've, I've had more people than I'm comfortable with basically show up and say,

594
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,560
uh because of all the supply chain attacks,

595
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,969
you have to fix all of these issues immediately and we can't,

596
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:12,060
they can't be in the product.

597
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:15,160
And of course, in my perspective, I have the ability to talk to these people.

598
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,880
Like here's what is going on. This is why we're not doing it

599
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:21,140
because me fixing this thing, you're obsessing about means I'm not fixing,

600
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,219
fixing that thing over there that actually matters.

601
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:25,540
And you're like, oh, ok, well, you do that. I mean, not everyone.

602
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,699
So people are like, no, there's no other way.

603
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:27,810
-- And I'm like, well, whatever,
-- well,

604
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:31,550
some people I think fundamentally don't trust their vendors and

605
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,130
they want like a completely clean scan report because they,

606
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:35,849
yeah,

607
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,729
I mean,

608
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:40,869
I, I get that but I think this is also a place where like in the,

609
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,439
in the instance of elastic,

610
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:47,160
all of our source code is wide open on the internet. You don't have to believe me.

611
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,880
Go freaking look yourself. Now, granted, 99% of the people arguing with me.

612
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,319
I'm,

613
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:56,160
-- I'm quite certain can't do this
-- to have the expertise and go make your own decision.

614
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,630
If they did that, why are they using you as a vendor?

615
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,239
-- I mean,
-- you could,

616
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,300
you could definitely say that and I sort of agree to a certain amount,

617
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,880
but I think at the same time, like

618
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,329
this is a delicate balance of, I don't believe you fix it all of

619
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:10,729
no.

620
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,150
And here's the source code.

621
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,319
If you don't believe me, go hire someone to look at it and prove me wrong.

622
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,680
I think the problem more basically probably boils down to a

623
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:22,410
liability argument of the vendor said they fixed all the flaws

624
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:25,369
and they clearly didn't versus if the vendor says they fixed

625
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,489
some of the flaws and didn't fix all of the flaws.

626
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,949
I feel like, you know, you're gonna have a hard time proving something in court

627
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:32,660
to throw that company under the bus.

628
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,949
I mean, that's probably fair and I know there's, I know of more than one we'll say,

629
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:41,109
I know instances where tricking the scanner was the solution

630
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,280
versus actually fixing problems.

631
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,000
But here's the thing, if you get, if you get a clean scan back,

632
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,719
that's a busted scanner, right?

633
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:51,800
Somehow someone, either the scanner is broken or someone found a way to trick it.

634
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,300
And, and additionally, here's the other part of that, that really just,

635
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,079
the more I think of it,

636
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:58,680
the more it becomes obvious like this PHP thing is a great example,

637
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:02,579
blindly upgrading to the latest version of something automatically,

638
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:06,469
I think is probably dangerous unless you have a really good reason to do it.

639
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:09,839
Well, you would need such a mature C I CD testing pipeline.

640
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:10,560
Well, and,

641
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:12,780
and not just that and people don't like three

642
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,060
-- people have backdoors
-- generally don't get found immediately.

643
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:17,439
There's a little bit of a lag.

644
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,530
And so I think if you're, if you're upgrading too fast,

645
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,280
I think that also carries a certain risk to it

646
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,099
versus

647
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,599
making sure.

648
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:30,430
Ok, let's give this new thing a little time to cook and then we will upgrade to it.

649
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:33,900
You know what I mean? I it's, it's all everything matters in this equation.

650
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,599
And I think

651
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:38,400
we've swung the pendulum in a direction where there's just this like

652
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,130
there's this group of people running around screaming upgrade, upgrade, upgrade

653
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,890
and

654
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,150
they're missing all of this other stuff that comes with that, right?

655
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,880
It's like if you do this, there are going to be other consequences to your actions.

656
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,349
In theory, I would say, ok, because there's, here's the problem though,

657
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,410
there's a difference between upgrade, upgrade,

658
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,050
upgrade and I can actually upgrade everything and

659
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,800
know if it works or not because I have

660
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:01,949
a

661
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:04,135
C I CD pipeline. I, I agree.

662
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:07,064
And that's the first big part of the problem is everybody kind of

663
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,714
seems to blindly assume that everybody will be able

664
00:29:09,724 --> 00:29:12,704
to upgrade and things just won't go horrifically sideways.

665
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:17,655
Like I saw my devs talking yesterday about, uh some rails module from, you know,

666
00:29:17,665 --> 00:29:20,114
they, they would like to use version 3.0 0.0.

667
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,064
They're on version two point something right now,

668
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:25,175
obviously two point something to 3.0 0.0.

669
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:30,104
-- You and I both have an immediate reaction of uh like whoa
-- something's broke.

670
00:29:30,114 --> 00:29:31,655
I mean, that that's the whole point, right?

671
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:36,829
That was the point of versioning as saying 2 to 3 is going to have breaking changes.

672
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,829
That makes sense. I like that.

673
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,369
And so, but on the flip side,

674
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,979
I know my Devs are mature enough to basically to do this and,

675
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:47,089
and see if it kind of breaks or not and if it breaks,

676
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:49,729
then I trust them to either fix it or roll back

677
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,165
and if it doesn't break cool full steam ahead.

678
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:53,974
And that's the difference though, is,

679
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:57,385
is having that ability to test and be able to roll back and do all that.

680
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,375
But most places don't have that,

681
00:29:59,525 --> 00:29:59,935
you know,

682
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:02,635
to put it bluntly if you're shipping your software

683
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:06,545
or your service or whatever, you're updating it less than once or twice a week.

684
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,505
You're not there yet.

685
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:08,920
Like,

686
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,959
when you get to the point where you're doing, you know, once or twice a week updates,

687
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:17,640
now you can talk about kind of safely running current because you've, I would hope,

688
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:22,020
you know, matured the process and automated enough such that it's, it's a non event.

689
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,339
Yeah. I mean, I think this is how we should end it. I,

690
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,380
yeah, I think like everything, the issue is complicated

691
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,520
and I think it is just human nature to try to trivialize what we're doing

692
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,785
in a way that is probably silly and dangerous because we're humans.

693
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:37,584
Well, and we want these simple solutions like, oh,

694
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:39,494
you fixed all the potholes in the road,

695
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,864
we fixed the big ones, the little ones are still there.

696
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,665
-- So
-- we'll get to those eventually and they might turn

697
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,704
into big potholes and then we'll fix them right away.

698
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:49,385
You know, that's just, that's life, that's how it is. All right.

699
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:52,015
Anyway, thank you, everyone for listening.
