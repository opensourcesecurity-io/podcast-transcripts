Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,510
Siefried and my partner and not trying to boil the ocean. Josh Bresser,

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,819
I lack the ability to boil the ocean, but I would totally do it if I could

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,379
not. If you keep driving a car,

4
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:18,930
I

5
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:20,629
just realized using that expression.

6
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm like, because every year now is the hottest year on record

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,000
so far for like the last five years.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,090
But no, in this case,

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,040
we're actually talking about uh like sort of

10
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:33,430
the metaphorical boiling of the information security ocean

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,419
and how there are just,

12
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:39,240
there are certain classes of problems where

13
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,180
you just kind of have to get everybody on board.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:42,990
I mean,

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,119
it's all going to do it for sure. And it's huge.

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:46,560
Yeah.

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,110
And

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:47,779
so,

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,840
but the good news now is that there are

20
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:53,229
a couple of entities

21
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,029
that both have the capability of boiling the ocean

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,889
and apparently sort of the willingness to do so.

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,750
So we're going to go off on a tiny quick tangent first. So

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,449
I was just poking around my Google security settings

25
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,430
for Google workspace because I'm trying to audit,

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,569
I'm trying to get a list of all our privileged users

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,639
to like audit and make sure random people don't have privileges.

28
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,190
They shouldn't.

29
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,819
It seems like a good idea.

30
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,339
Yeah,

31
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,019
it's very difficult to find. But

32
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:17,290
yeah,

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,260
but I ran across a setting that basically says they're going to be blocking access to

34
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,175
insecure apps uh in July of 2024.

35
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,595
So in a few months from the recording of this podcast.

36
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:27,824
So for those of you who don't know,

37
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,404
you can use your Google account to authenticate to other

38
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:32,375
stuff using like single sign on O I DC,

39
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:33,275
all that crap stuff.

40
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:34,324
But there are,

41
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:36,084
they used to, well, they still do,

42
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:37,955
they would allow apps

43
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,315
though where the app needs access to your Google account.

44
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:43,474
And they would literally let you give that app, your user name and password

45
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:46,355
so that, that app could like log into your account and like

46
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,199
do stuff

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,480
and, and back in the day,

48
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:50,879
this would have been something like your email client running on your phone.

49
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:51,959
Sure, fine.

50
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:52,720
But

51
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,279
nowadays, it's also like a web based third party

52
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,639
plug in that like,

53
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,760
I don't know, spell checks your file names, whatever in Google Drive.

54
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:03,650
And so they're getting rid of that because obviously there's been some, you know,

55
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,019
it can lead to security problems when you let people hand

56
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:08,649
out their user name and password and allow it to be used

57
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,440
and don't enforce like two fa or M fa or whatever.

58
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:12,085
And so

59
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:15,774
I love that because it's actually going to break applications for people,

60
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:20,544
especially a lot of old stuff because by definition, the old stuff is what did this

61
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,684
and it's that old stuff that, you know,

62
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:25,845
finding a replacement for it or whatever is going to be a chore because, you know,

63
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,324
people have been using it for five or 10 years and, well,

64
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,125
if they wanted to find a replacement for it, they would have no.

65
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:31,684
Right. Like,

66
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,625
like I have Google advanced account protection enabled

67
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,565
on my account because I'm a super admin

68
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,529
and like

69
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,229
the Zoom calendar plug in doesn't work with it last I checked. Oh, interesting.

70
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,789
I didn't know there,

71
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,360
there's a lot of stuff,

72
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,240
there's a lot of stuff you would expect not to work because it's just not very secure,

73
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:47,740
well written.

74
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,020
And that's actually one of my new tests for when I,

75
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,570
when I check out a cloud vendors will

76
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,470
their stuff work with advanced account protection enabled.

77
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,279
And like Zoom, I can log into Zoom, I can use Zoom,

78
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,059
but I can't use the calendar plug in,

79
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:04,380
you know, because it, it just does whatever old version of authentication, but

80
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,720
-- it
-- does something it shouldn't do.

81
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:11,419
Well, it's, it's secure, but when you enable advanced account protection,

82
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:14,580
it's like everything has to be the most secure protocol in setting,

83
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:16,419
you know, whatever

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,539
it is, what it is.

85
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,660
-- So
-- that's it, it's interesting to me that for example,

86
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,699
like Google closing this loophole is gonna,

87
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,429
it's gonna stop a, a pretty reasonable number of security incidents,

88
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,899
full stop. But what's really fascinating. So, Github,

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,210
-- uh just announced a new thing. So why don't you explain to us what it is?
-- Yeah.

90
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,119
So github has something. They're calling artifact at a stations. It's in

91
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:37,279
public

92
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:43,020
-- data which whatever that means, it
-- means you can turn it on and use it if you want to,

93
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,320
but you're not like kind of forced into it

94
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,630
or, and it's like you have to kind of go searching for it.

95
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,740
It's not like my understanding is like, remember with the security advisory stuff,

96
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,429
it was in beta and you could turn it on and now it's like, it's kind of in your face in

97
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,320
the interface if you

98
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,039
like, it's kind of like you should turn this on, you don't have to,

99
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,160
but you should turn this on.

100
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,460
OK? Anyway, anyway, that's

101
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,240
not the topic

102
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,000
because

103
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,520
if you don't make people use the stuff, they won't use it.

104
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,130
And that's a good point and we'll definitely touch

105
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:12,059
on that eventually in this conversation because you're right,

106
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,139
most people won't use it.

107
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:13,669
It's what is, it?

108
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,369
Didn't like Google do a study and like 4%

109
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,459
of users change defaults or something like that.

110
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,769
-- I would be shocked if it was 4%.
-- It might not be. I mean, it's like

111
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:22,309
a,

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,970
it's like a conversation the other day about Factorio where

113
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,239
you were saying you can turn off the bugs.

114
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,339
I'm like, I've literally never looked at the settings

115
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,500
and I haven't, and I still haven't, I just haven't played Factorio in like a year,

116
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,450
-- but
-- I would literally be shocked if more than one percent of people

117
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:42,450
actually significantly change a default setting on pretty much anything they use,

118
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,869
be it security or

119
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:44,679
like

120
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,250
-- dark mode or whatever,
-- for sure,

121
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:48,119
for sure. Ok. Anyway, so github

122
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,720
has these artifact at of stations And what they're basically doing

123
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,959
is you can add

124
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,779
a workflow. I think it's called a workflow in this context. No.

125
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:59,720
Yeah, workflow.

126
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,959
So basically what happens is after you build your artifact in the github

127
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,720
Magic

128
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:04,980
C

129
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,630
-- I system.
-- What is an artifact

130
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,200
-- in the context of
-- this completely undefined?

131
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:10,709
-- Anything? It's
-- anything,

132
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:12,489
it could be a tar ball, it could be

133
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,570
anything,

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,320
it could be S

135
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,489
bombs, you can, you can sign whatever.

136
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,820
And this is important because it's

137
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,720
so it's, it's literally, it could be text files, could be compiled files, it could be

138
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:25,010
collated files like a zip file.

139
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,000
And, and the idea is when you generate your releases in the github

140
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,369
Magic C I,

141
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:32,489
you can also sign it.

142
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,769
Now,

143
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,299
you can create an at a station that uses sig

144
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:37,690
store in a bunch of sig store magic that then

145
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:42,977
you can verify the signed thing you have acquired. Downloaded.

146
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:45,778
Basically is the thing that was built

147
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:49,847
and these conversations always amuse me because you've got a bunch of people

148
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,287
that think it does something it doesn't do or it creates like,

149
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,778
oh, we can stop XZ with this.

150
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,208
It's like, no, this isn't. No, we can't. Like, not at all.

151
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:58,417
XZ would have totally been signed by this.

152
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:01,328
And in fact, they, they're even good about that at the very end of the article,

153
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:02,738
they basically say that right?

154
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:03,247
Like

155
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:03,507
it,

156
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,977
it is, you know,

157
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,058
but it, it says here

158
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:07,085
they bolded it.

159
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:10,096
I just noticed and it says it's important to note that provenance

160
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:13,425
by itself doesn't make your artifact or your build process secure.

161
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:13,906
That's right.

162
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,305
If you have a backdoor build process, you are now signing your backdoor build.

163
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:22,006
-- That is what is happening.
-- Well, this is like a perfect example. This is solar winds.

164
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:22,746
They

165
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:23,795
had had a

166
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:28,476
backdoor build process and what I love is they had improperly signed binaries and

167
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:32,265
they told everybody to just like mash that override button and get her installed.

168
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:34,305
And so that's, that's another thing is there is a failure

169
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:38,664
here that is shockingly common, which is I really want to install this software.

170
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,873
I don't care if it's signed improperly or whatever.

171
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,153
That's right. Well, and we've all done it.

172
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,993
This is a good example of where some people do change the default setting,

173
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:47,074
which is on Mac Os.

174
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,414
You can no longer by default run unsigned

175
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:51,264
binaries or binaries signed by a third party.

176
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:52,954
It has to be part of the Apple ecosystem

177
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:55,593
and that is one of the few settings myself and other people I know,

178
00:06:55,604 --> 00:07:00,433
turn off because I want to install software that I need, I need to do stuff

179
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:02,794
-- to do stuff like my job.
-- Exactly.

180
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:04,242
Ok. So, anyway,

181
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:04,631
github

182
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:06,332
now has this worker

183
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:07,041
that

184
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:12,411
you build your artifact, you add, it's a couple lines to a file basically

185
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:15,282
that says once my artifact is built,

186
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:17,201
I want you to sign it

187
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:17,902
with

188
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:18,701
cigar

189
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:19,962
and then,

190
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:22,161
-- so it's s store on the back end.
-- Correct.

191
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,661
Yeah. Yeah. They're, they're relying on

192
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:26,242
SAR and they've got, that's weird how they're doing it, but we'll,

193
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:27,122
we'll get to that in a second.

194
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:31,161
But basically, then what happens is you can verify the signature

195
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,049
of the thing

196
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:32,869
and

197
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,570
I, I cannot figure out how to do it without the github

198
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,440
command line tool, the GH tool. It looks like all the instructions.

199
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,709
Everything I found you need that tool

200
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,089
to phone home to

201
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,170
github to get

202
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,609
the at a station content, which is an in total predicate.

203
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,450
It doesn't matter what that is.

204
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,410
But basically the idea is github has added this

205
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,410
ability where you can use sig store to sign things

206
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,510
and then store those signatures for use later, which

207
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,309
on the surface

208
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:02,549
is not,

209
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:07,119
I think hugely useful because the reality is if you build something in

210
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,440
github C I and then you host it for release out of github,

211
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,640
the odds of that being back doored in some way

212
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,410
are

213
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:17,459
miniscule small it's zero.

214
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,079
Basically,

215
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:23,450
from what I can tell they've effectively recreated the idea of having archive

216
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,566
name dot whatever extension dot A SC with the external uh you know,

217
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:29,786
ASY

218
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:33,616
signature of it, like the P GP signature of that thing.

219
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:38,585
And the only real difference between this and what we were doing 30 years ago

220
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,135
is that now that, that,

221
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:42,856
that signature is hosted in SIG store and there's some

222
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:45,856
tooling wrapped around it to make it easier to validate.

223
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,325
That's really all this does.

224
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:51,546
I think the fact that they're using SIG store, the way they are is very cool

225
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,255
because historically, if you're going to

226
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:57,502
software, you would have to build it probably on your own machine.

227
00:08:57,512 --> 00:08:58,421
Where else would you build it?

228
00:08:58,911 --> 00:08:59,661
Obviously?

229
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:00,372
I mean,

230
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:05,312
well, but here's the thing like today, if you're going to sign software,

231
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:08,702
let's pretend I have AC I system that works and I'm not using my laptop, right?

232
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:10,581
I send my software up to the C I system.

233
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,302
There is now a step where I have to go from C I,

234
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:21,461
the output of C I to somehow getting key material into my process signing the thing

235
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,960
and then publishing the signature as well as the artifact.

236
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:30,440
And I think in a lot of instances you have people download the artifact from the C I,

237
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,380
they sign it and then they upload it somewhere else, right? And, and

238
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,679
what is protecting that key? Like who knows what's going on?

239
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,489
-- I
-- mean, in my mind,

240
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,799
you might as well just be publishing the shaw 256 sums of that artifact

241
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:47,599
on a somewhat trustworthy platform and you would essentially get the same thing,

242
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:48,179
right.

243
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:49,109
Largely

244
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:52,283
fascinating to me is like, ok, so, ok, let's be real.

245
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:57,513
I, I've decided on a new thing which is, this is not in and of itself helpful.

246
00:09:57,523 --> 00:10:02,554
However, it's plumbing and if you want a nice toilet, you need plumbing first,

247
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:04,653
-- then you can install the toilet
-- and,

248
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:06,914
and here I think that's the important part of this

249
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:09,033
whole conversation and that's why because it was funny,

250
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:09,614
I told Kurt I'm like,

251
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:13,664
we need to talk about this and Kurt says at a station is boring and I was like, no, not

252
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:18,857
in the, at a station is boring, but what this means means in big picture is not

253
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:23,177
-- exactly
-- that you now have a half inch supply line in your bathroom.

254
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,848
Right. And, and I think that's, that's the thing.

255
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:26,257
Like I,

256
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:29,658
I cannot stress enough how hard it is to sign

257
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:32,857
things in a way that isn't just like theater.

258
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,747
It is so hard to do,

259
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:35,857
ignoring theater,

260
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:38,627
to sign things in a way that doesn't add a ridiculous

261
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,247
amount of overhead and work and is prone to failure.

262
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:42,468
Sure. Right.

263
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:46,361
-- I, I consider all of that part of the theater because most of it doesn't work
-- well,

264
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:46,961
even at Red Hat,

265
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:51,122
where they had a dedicated decades old signing infrastructure with you know,

266
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:51,642
a hardware,

267
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,771
so uh hardware key man module and like software and

268
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,182
they've been using it for a decade or two.

269
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:00,591
We still had failures, we still had problems.

270
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:03,242
We still, like, there was every once in a while, like,

271
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:05,182
they'd have to bug fix the thing because somebody found,

272
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:07,942
like we did something new or different and it like broke.

273
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:08,541
And so

274
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:12,341
that was a major company putting major effort into signing software

275
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:15,495
-- and it was an unending nightmare. It was,
-- it was very difficult.

276
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:18,486
I was one of the maintainers of that system and, and it was hard to use.

277
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:20,346
I know I still blame you for that. That's

278
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:20,645
fine.

279
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:21,125
That's fine.

280
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:24,325
But anyway, well, my point is if Red Hat can't do it sanely,

281
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:28,656
what possible chance does an open source project with one developer have none.

282
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,096
Absolutely. Yeah, for sure.

283
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:34,635
And, and this is, but here's part of the story is so Sig Store is

284
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:37,286
we'll just call it magic signing because for the, the,

285
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,895
-- the purposes of conversation, it's magic
-- and

286
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,400
management. That's the biggest thing. They also do the key management.

287
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:47,669
And I dare anybody here write down something on a piece of paper and make sure

288
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,619
you keep that piece of paper and that thing's safe for five or 10 years.

289
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:55,309
-- It's such a chore.
-- Yes. But here's the important thing even to think about Sig Store.

290
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,900
Sig Store supposedly solved a bunch of problems.

291
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:02,479
How many start ups were created with the intent of doing something with sig store

292
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:06,380
and aren't doing anything with SIG store anymore and the number is not zero.

293
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,289
I have no idea.

294
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:11,263
The reality is like sig store solved a bunch of problems,

295
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,023
but it didn't solve enough problems that it was a tool that could be used,

296
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,004
we'll say by the general public.

297
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:20,484
Well, that's the thing though is we have to, like, we have to get this.

298
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:21,244
Basically,

299
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:22,883
your choices are you either build something

300
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:24,484
that does something useful for somebody,

301
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,044
but it's like standing by itself and it's

302
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:28,843
very fragile and brittle or you start building

303
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:35,364
boring infrastructure, pipes, highways, trains, and that is utterly

304
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:38,570
not usable at all to people until

305
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,299
you build a local road system and tie it together and put in toll roads and

306
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,090
get people to invent good cars. And that's the thing, right

307
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,409
is like right now this stuff is really boring infrastructure,

308
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,830
but nobody should directly use.

309
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:52,919
And even what github

310
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:56,330
is doing today is still part of boring infrastructure 100%.

311
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,619
And I applaud them for investing in this sort of thing because here's the thing.

312
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,000
This is beta. People are going to use it, not

313
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:05,835
a lot of people, but they're going to start learning

314
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:10,075
about how something like this needs to work. What are the bugs we find?

315
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,315
What are the difficulties sig Stor introduces into this system?

316
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:17,054
What is the difficulty of people doing verification of some of this stuff? Yeah.

317
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:20,715
-- What's the failure mode?
-- Right. We don't know, we literally don't know.

318
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:23,565
-- Remember
-- online certificate. I'm spacing out Os

319
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:27,354
O CS po online certificate, revocation protocol.

320
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:29,614
-- Whatever it was the point of
-- CS P

321
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,234
O CS P

322
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,669
Yeah. The, the certificate vendors couldn't run it reliably enough

323
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,640
so that people could use it because it was down so much. If you actually relied on it,

324
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:41,650
-- you wouldn't be able to surf the web like 10 or 20% of the time
-- I

325
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,659
remember turning it on and it was hilarious.

326
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:46,739
And so again, that's a perfect example.

327
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,760
Like people forget the, like the US interstate is a perfect example.

328
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,590
The US interstate was built by the military who realized trains are

329
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,549
great until somebody drops a 500 pound bomb on a train line

330
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,619
and like it takes a week to fix.

331
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,960
Whereas a road, you can drive the truck around the hole in the road,

332
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,359
you have to slow down a bit, but

333
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,530
you can keep going.

334
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,500
And so the interstate nice.

335
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,090
But if you've ever driven on the interstate, like, I'm a Canadian.

336
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,619
So we don't have that in Canada,

337
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,510
we have highway one which goes across the country east to west.

338
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,429
And then in Alberta we have highway two which

339
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,000
goes north south from like Edmonton to Calgary.

340
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:20,809
And that's it. Like those are. And then the 401 in Ontario which we apo

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,210
drive for a lot. It's the busiest highway in the world. Straight up.

342
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:24,900
But,

343
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,380
so I've driven on the interstate.

344
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,659
And what's fascinating to me is number one, the interstate is a,

345
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,340
it's a mesh, it's a net. It's huge. Right.

346
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:34,140
It's no, but you've got like, five major east west routes

347
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:38,020
and then you've got multiple north south routes on both coasts and in the middle.

348
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:41,340
And then you've got amazing gas stations

349
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,640
with, like, all the foods, hot foods. No,

350
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:46,099
no. Like, like here, if you're driving

351
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,479
you have to plan ahead because there's no gas station for 100 miles or 200 miles.

352
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,760
Yeah, that's definitely not a thing in America.

353
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,729
Like, there's a sign,

354
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:56,330
there's that famous sign in Ontario basically saying next gas station,

355
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,590
like 300 kilometers,

356
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,390
like, you better have gassed up back there or else

357
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,919
it could be bad.

358
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:03,799
And that's the thing I thought driving on the interstate

359
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,520
to me is magical because there's not just the interstate,

360
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,049
but there's all the fast food stations, all the gas stations, all the driver,

361
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,260
coffee bars. There's like

362
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,400
the whole ecosystem of stuff that makes it usable and actually kind of pleasant.

363
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,570
-- Well, I, I hate driving but I,
-- I know, but compared to driving on it's, it's

364
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:22,989
not bad.

365
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,229
That's fair. Like, I've seen worse.

366
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,679
I've lived in Europe, I've been to South America. Trust me.

367
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,119
If you got to drive 500 miles from A to B,

368
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,440
the interstate is one of the better options.

369
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:33,760
Right.

370
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,090
And that's the thing is stuff like SIG store.

371
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,320
And this is like, well, yeah,

372
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,260
how do we uh a perfect example is we're now rapidly realizing key management means

373
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,549
it should be outsourced to somebody and the developers should never see the

374
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:49,000
key or basically touch the key other than at the beginning to say like

375
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,119
make a key,

376
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:51,280
right?

377
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:52,159
Well, and that's

378
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:53,469
part of

379
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:55,539
what makes sig store magic

380
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:59,219
is most of the keys that end up getting used.

381
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:03,799
You generate a key, you sign a thing with the key and then you throw the key away,

382
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:06,340
you never use it to sign another thing ever again,

383
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:07,260
which is

384
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,119
amazing.

385
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,619
And this is a perfect example of what we've learned

386
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,909
now because remember it used to all be about,

387
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,820
you have to have your key and you have to keep it safe and you have

388
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,840
to feed it and you have to pet it and you have to groom it.

389
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:20,070
And now it's just like, yeah, no, just make a jillion keys, use them, throw them away

390
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,299
and have a third party that's somewhat trustworthy,

391
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:26,200
do it and no technical magic just have a trusted third party do it.

392
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,229
One of the things that has me really wondering about this and I don't think

393
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,880
github is going to get us there with this particular offering.

394
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,015
If you sign every artifact you build,

395
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:40,375
there are a lot of projects that build hundreds

396
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:43,695
or thousands of artifacts a day or week,

397
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:44,294
right?

398
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:45,534
Signing is cheap. Now

399
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,534
signing isn't the problem.

400
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:53,525
One of the things Sig Store does is they have a public ledger called Recor

401
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:58,335
and today Recor has 87 million, 88 million give or take.

402
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:01,284
It was when I looked a couple of hours ago, I think it was 87 million,

403
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,160
like 888,000 something. Was it something?

404
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:05,598
I bet you github

405
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,729
builds

406
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:10,229
hundreds of millions of things a week.

407
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,260
Oh, it, it, you know, it always reminds me of this Blockchain where people are like,

408
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
oh,

409
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,020
Blockchain does X number of transactions per whatever and

410
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,709
it's like Visa does 300,000 transactions per second during Christmas

411
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,420
like

412
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,189
bro.

413
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,910
And that's kind of where github

414
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,270
is.

415
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:30,364
It's like add about six or eight zeros to that number and now that's our hourly load,

416
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:30,685
right?

417
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:32,765
That's going to be one of the very interesting

418
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:35,165
problems I suspect is if this was deployed,

419
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:35,765
let's say github

420
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:38,395
said every single thing that gets built in github

421
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:42,204
is now automatically getting a six star signature. They'd probably crash

422
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:42,875
record.

423
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:45,025
Like that's just the reality of it.

424
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:49,765
Well, or you there's ways to shard it and to do bloom filters and to blah, blah,

425
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:53,265
blah like there's, there's technology solutions to this ultimately.

426
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:54,734
Will there be a giant

427
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:55,805
back end

428
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,969
data store thing of a jigger? Well, yeah, but the good news is

429
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,729
like we're good at that.

430
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:03,589
-- Yes,
-- we can solve it for sure.

431
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,270
We just,

432
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,550
we we're gonna have to scale up the SIG Store project.

433
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,750
That is why Google's getting rid of all the old analytics data.

434
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,910
-- They got to free up disk space for SIG store.
-- Right. There you go. Yeah.

435
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:15,069
Called it.

436
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:18,969
Need those tens of gigabytes of, of text.

437
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,729
-- No,
-- it's, it's a lot more than tens of gigabytes.

438
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:22,234
Yeah. It's

439
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,224
like I've done the math on the napkin and it's shocking how much.

440
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:25,685
Yeah,

441
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,494
it's horrifying.

442
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:29,395
Well, you got to remember because Google Analytics

443
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:31,785
used to keep everything by default and then they

444
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,425
dialed it down to a default two months.

445
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:34,854
You can extend it to 14 months

446
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:38,305
and then all of that stuff basically goes away in July and like,

447
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:38,834
well,

448
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:42,665
it's gonna also track like mouse movement and all kinds of crazy things.

449
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:45,454
Every record is several

450
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:48,689
well uncompressed and everything and duplicated and all that.

451
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,329
-- But every record is like several kilobytes of data.
-- I believe that.

452
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:55,770
Yeah. Anyway. Ok. Anyway, get up talking about, get up.

453
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,050
But so the thing is it's doable. Like I hate to kind of wave it away but like, yeah,

454
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,560
storing and serving a couple petabytes of data. Sure, whatever. Just

455
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,770
it's a money problem.

456
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,760
It's not even an engineering problem anymore.

457
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,479
Do it?

458
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,709
You have the strength of will to pay for it?

459
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,030
-- And I suspect Microsoft and Google do
-- I?

460
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,030
I think so and, and look, the reality is what they're signing right now.

461
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:20,469
I don't think it's a particularly high risk artifact.

462
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,790
Right. It's, you're going from the worker to the release.

463
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:26,060
There's not a lot of

464
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:28,380
we'll say distance there

465
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,699
that that could be abused.

466
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,859
Well, again, it boils down to just you do this inside of the github

467
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,819
trusted ecosystem and hope that github

468
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:36,479
is secure

469
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,160
because

470
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,300
let's be real. Github

471
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,660
has more people on their security team than most open source projects have

472
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,920
users,

473
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,439
-- let alone developers.
-- That would not surprise me if that's true.

474
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,469
-- They have,
-- if it's more than 50 it's probably more than 50.

475
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:49,880
That's true.

476
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,339
Most projects are one person.

477
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,430
Those projects probably don't have tons of users anyway. Anyway. OK.

478
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:55,630
Well,

479
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,969
but this is part of that changing ecosystem and also that people are even willing

480
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:03,369
to entertain this because imagine if you said this to security people 20 years ago.

481
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,449
Oh, hey, you know, there's this thing called github.

482
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,099
It's hosted G

483
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:08,060
or what's G? Oh, it's like CV S OK?

484
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,219
Cool. That sounds nice.

485
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:11,589
Like that sounds, you know, we had hosted CV S sort of kind of,

486
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,500
but they're going to do like all your key management

487
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,969
and signing and everything and people would be like,

488
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:18,449
heck, no, because like I remember, I used to not trust, I laugh.

489
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,329
Now, I used to not trust Amazon

490
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,219
to host my SSL certificates.

491
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:27,939
I would like, register them myself, upload them onto an Amazon Ec2 server. Anyways.

492
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:30,630
Now I just outsource all that to cloud flare, you know, and,

493
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,000
and that's that shifting mentality 20 years ago, I was like, oh,

494
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,819
you have to keep your own keys and have to keep them secure.

495
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:35,430
Now, it's like,

496
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,199
I'm smart enough to realize no, Amazon and Github

497
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,280
will do a far better job than I ever can.

498
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:44,400
And this speaks to the whole evolution of tools and process

499
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,270
where

500
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,530
cars, for example,

501
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,310
how many people maintain and manage their own cars

502
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,199
and change the oil on their own cars.

503
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:51,560
Now.

504
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,630
1 to 10% maybe it's very low.

505
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,180
The majority of us just go to Jiffy Lube or whatever,

506
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,420
every 3 to 6 months when the little light goes on.

507
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:04,339
For sure. You know, I actually own like uh the little connector, diagnostic.

508
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,630
I'm spacing out. What is that D

509
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:05,910
bus?

510
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,849
No, what's

511
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:07,859
Linux?

512
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:08,599
You know, the,

513
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:12,060
the little connector that plugs into your car and scans the

514
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,849
can bus and it'll tell you what the error codes are,

515
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,479
what they're called

516
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,800
O DB M.

517
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,540
OK.

518
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,989
Uh Anyways, like I own one of those and like,

519
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:20,660
I'm not going to actually fix my car.

520
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,829
I just kind of want to know what's wrong with it and it costs like 30 bucks.

521
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,550
And that's the thing with the software engineering. Do you want a software engineer

522
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:30,869
building and maintaining infrastructure or do you want them building

523
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,390
-- software? Like, do we want
-- to look? OK.

524
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,229
No, that's an invalid question and an invalid point.

525
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,209
And I don't like the t

526
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,859
anyway, so here's the thing.

527
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,439
No, one is doing it and they're never going to, no one is going to run their own site

528
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,719
infrastructure.

529
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:49,819
-- Not just because it's too hard, but because it gives them no value.
-- Right.

530
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:53,089
-- Well, some do and still do like open BS D and
-- like, ok,

531
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,869
-- whatever the functionally the number
-- is zero, but that's the point is,

532
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,030
they're like fringe lunatics.

533
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,319
-- Now, the number
-- is zero. K,

534
00:21:59,579 --> 00:21:59,709
like,

535
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,900
statistically speaking, it is zero.

536
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:04,869
Now, here's the thing when someone like github

537
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,349
creates this sort of infrastructure

538
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,349
and they give us the ability to start doing things like sending.

539
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,969
I mean, this is TLS certificates are a great example.

540
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:16,849
Remember when people were like, we don't really need HTTP S on our site

541
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,829
and there were a variety of reasons for that.

542
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,949
And then eventually Google was like, if you're not HTTP S we're not, you know,

543
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,319
we're not tracking your site and everyone's like, oh, very important.

544
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,170
Now all of a sudden,

545
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:26,839
and the thing is

546
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,609
we know someday some standard or, or compliance or whatever is going to say

547
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,630
you need the ability to basically track.

548
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,390
Where did these artifacts come from back to some source?

549
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,560
Well,

550
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,400
it's already being written into the memos from the

551
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,050
White House on everything coming out of them,

552
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,390
whatever.

553
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,750
Every, no, but that's all BS everyone says that, but it can't be done

554
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,349
-- well.
-- No, no,

555
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,709
but that's the start of it. It

556
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:55,310
-- is the start of it. That
-- Yeah. Well, how much funding is behind that.

557
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:59,383
-- Right. No dollars.
-- It starts as a memo and then 10 years later it's a ni standard.

558
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:02,142
No, the memo is pointless memos need, they need funding.

559
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,272
But regardless, even if, even if N

560
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:05,983
said

561
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,753
everyone has to

562
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:08,782
sign

563
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:13,932
and verify signatures on all software they use, we'd be like, ha ha. Sure. Ok.

564
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:17,483
We're going to raise the price of your software by 300% NIST.

565
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:21,083
-- And they'd be like,
-- ironically the mobile space would be fine.

566
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:21,753
Sure.

567
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,392
Well, not like, seriously,

568
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:26,875
-- like Apple enforces this because they want their 30%.
-- That's true.

569
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:28,436
They, they have, well, they have an incentive

570
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:29,926
and that's the thing.

571
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:33,215
No one has incentives, but the reality is it's not just incentives.

572
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:35,676
We can't even do it today. We can't

573
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:39,755
do, like, correct at a station like the, the plumbing and the,

574
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,416
the just tooling doesn't,

575
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:45,255
it's not reliable enough. Like, right now

576
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:49,436
I have a house, I have water coming into the house from Epcor.

577
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:51,436
I don't have a backup water system

578
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,400
and you

579
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,469
have electricity. Exactly. Because Epcor is so damn reliable.

580
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,640
You don't even, it's not that you don't have a backup.

581
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,119
You don't even really think about it

582
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,300
and attestation and all of this signing stuff is still

583
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,520
at the point of here's a pile of rusty,

584
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,910
random sharp tools.

585
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,989
Build me a house. Sure. Sure.

586
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,310
And like, you're going to get Tetanus and die trying to do it

587
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,465
and we're slowly starting starting to

588
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:18,576
get slightly less horrifyingly dangerous tools

589
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:22,806
like this thing here where I can now actually sign an artifact.

590
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:24,276
I don't have to do key management.

591
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,086
I don't have to build any software.

592
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,526
I literally just have to like, like you said,

593
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:31,656
like tweak a couple of lines in one config file and, and run an extra step.

594
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:35,916
That's actually something that can be done. Now, will people do it? No

595
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:39,261
0.1 of a percent of people will consider it.

596
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,942
And like eight people, half of whom we probably know

597
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,722
will actually use this thing.

598
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:47,921
And that's OK. That's ok because this is how we start

599
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:52,251
like model T fords, you had to crank them and if you didn't crank it right,

600
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:53,161
it could break your arm

601
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:56,822
-- and now we have push button, start on cars
-- and I think it is,

602
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,621
it will not surprise anyone

603
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:02,420
that the logical conclusion of this is github

604
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:08,020
is just going to sign everything that gets built in their C I system like that is the,

605
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,459
the obvious output of this particular learning experience.

606
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,430
Well, I think the thing is you can only, you can really only

607
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,719
kind of like TLS,

608
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:23,489
you can really only kind of rely on it if it is done as close to 100% as possible.

609
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,579
Yes, I, I agree with that. And, and I think

610
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:29,614
-- this is similar.
-- So if you go to Pi Pie

611
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,354
and you go to publish a package,

612
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,385
they now have trusted publishers

613
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:35,244
which are github,

614
00:25:35,555 --> 00:25:39,344
Git lab and a couple others. I forget it's all the usual suspects.

615
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,685
But the point is with pie pie, for example,

616
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:44,074
it basically ties itself directly into your github

617
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:44,714
repo.

618
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:47,525
And so I don't have that step of like I do the stuff in github,

619
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,775
export it and import it to pi pie.

620
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:55,069
It just pi pie talks to github for example and just gks the software down, right?

621
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,829
And

622
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,430
this is the kind of thing where now, oh, wait,

623
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:01,930
this attestation thing combined with that right now.

624
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:04,119
It's starting now we're starting to talk about

625
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,650
something that's uh for the sake of argument,

626
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,569
there'll be a green check mark on my pie pie package because it's signed and attested

627
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,439
or whatever. And, but today it's a green check mark and tomorrow it's

628
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,390
remember when software browsers used to say, hey, it's a secure site. Yeah.

629
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,290
And now this site is unsecure and now they give you hideously large

630
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:25,354
screens and make you click three or four things to get at the,

631
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:29,525
you know, like whenever I want to go to my local Bittorrent server web interface, I,

632
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:29,584
oh,

633
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:31,515
it's such a chore because I gotta like click through

634
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:33,525
all these things to get at the http thing.

635
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:33,895
You know,

636
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,234
you could just post your own certificate. It's

637
00:26:36,484 --> 00:26:37,535
anyway, yes,

638
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:39,295
that makes it even angrier.

639
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:40,614
Anyway.

640
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:43,214
Well, no, you whatever. I'm not. No. OK.

641
00:26:43,224 --> 00:26:44,204
So anyway, yes,

642
00:26:44,214 --> 00:26:47,395
everything you have said I think is the logical conclusion

643
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,094
of all of this where we have all of these pieces

644
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:51,619
that can start working together.

645
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:57,270
I mean, a good example is github and N PM are both under the Microsoft umbrella.

646
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,949
That is an easy win right there to say

647
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:00,790
that

648
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,510
if you're going to publish N PM things, they need to carry a signature.

649
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,800
And obviously, in the case of github,

650
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:11,750
it's like you can use our stuff and we give you an easy button now to do that.

651
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,739
And, and it's also from the perspective of a tool like github,

652
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,910
this is, I mean,

653
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,900
I don't want to call it vendor lock in,

654
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,739
but it's kind of going to be vendor lock in just

655
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,569
because I don't know how easy this will be anywhere else.

656
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,449
It's also one of those things where

657
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:26,689
it

658
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,869
is effectively vendor locking and I'm saying,

659
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,300
effectively vendor locking because the reality is again the time and effort,

660
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,810
even if there's an open source project that provides this and it works well,

661
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:41,069
the effort to set it up and configure it is

662
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:43,640
nontrivial and the effort to keep it running and working

663
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,910
non-trivial

664
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,430
because you and I have done this,

665
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,569
this kind of work and it is

666
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:51,069
super difficult because the problem is

667
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:54,619
if you start signing stuff, it's like if you use TLS,

668
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,609
you can't stop one day.

669
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,160
No, I'm serious, like, and especially with hsts and, and pre loads and stuff.

670
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,250
Like if you basically say people look we're going to sign the software.

671
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,459
You are now doing something that you basically have to do

672
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,630
until the end of time because if you stop doing it,

673
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,199
is it an attack or is it just like, what is it?

674
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,430
And so that's the thing is once you start doing these kind of security behaviors,

675
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,930
you have to do them.

676
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,650
Yeah. I mean, this is true of like, you can't,

677
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,189
uh, the toothpaste can't go back in the tube, right?

678
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:27,930
There's so many apt examples of that and for sure,

679
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,689
I think this sort of behavior is one of them.

680
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:30,369
Absolutely.

681
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,930
Now, there's also the, there's, I think it's going to be very interesting.

682
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:38,489
You can imagine a, a build system for like something like open source or N PM or,

683
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,040
or whatever where

684
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:45,300
every dependency you download is going to have the at of station checked.

685
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,939
You're going to have these chains to say like I can verify the thing

686
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:55,219
I'm working with came from that repository over there and it came through,

687
00:28:55,229 --> 00:29:00,099
you know, three layers of, of packages and three layers of builds from other people.

688
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:03,359
And it's kind of a wild idea when you really think about it.

689
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,780
Right. It's, it's not something we've really done before.

690
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,920
I know we've talked about it.

691
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,310
There are tons of supply chain people that have been going on and on about,

692
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,680
you know, being able to trace provenance and all this.

693
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:18,229
But we've, we've never had anything close to the technology to do it

694
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:18,800
also.

695
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,069
What, what's funny to me is we're,

696
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,560
we're solving a problem that existed 2530

697
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:23,800
years ago but doesn't really exist anymore.

698
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,369
Which is,

699
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:26,109
it used to be, you would build

700
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:29,489
software somewhere and then it would, like, end up on sun site and on Slack Word

701
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,119
F

702
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:30,609
TV,

703
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,560
distributed by third parties all over the place.

704
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:37,319
Because, well, a if you try to run it on a server and like it,

705
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:40,510
it would just crash because like if more than seven people tried to download it,

706
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,719
it would die. That world again, kind of doesn't exist anymore. Like you get software

707
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,119
largely, I'm gonna say from the source. Like you,

708
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,949
you don't,

709
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,619
I know there's third party, there's Debian packages and all that stuff.

710
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,910
But by and large that problem of I have to get my software

711
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,859
from mirrors because where else am I going to get it from?

712
00:29:57,869 --> 00:29:58,160
Like,

713
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,839
I always downloaded my software from Sunset U Alberta because it was local to me.

714
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:04,760
It was so damn fast compared to all the other mirrors, you know,

715
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,180
-- I mean,
-- that was the point, right?

716
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:09,209
Like we didn't have cloud flare, we had local mirrors,

717
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,810
you know, even now, like I,

718
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,060
I have a machine with a two terabyte

719
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:19,380
nvme drive that does 1.1 million, right? Iops per second to 1.2 million read.

720
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,229
Like that's unimaginable to me.

721
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:22,469
So, but back to this,

722
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:27,349
what is interesting is once you have this full signing and this full chain of depth,

723
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,569
for example, my Debian packages, they're signed by Debian.

724
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,339
That's nice.

725
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,020
But they consumed signed stuff

726
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:35,699
which consumes signed stuff.

727
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,069
And it starts to basically,

728
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,069
it doesn't really solve any problems that

729
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,109
we currently have anymore because people aren't,

730
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:42,670
you know,

731
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,150
attacking third party mirror sites and injecting stuff. They're like,

732
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,670
they're going to the source and getting involved in the pack project and, you know,

733
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,415
doing it right before this would ever be detected.

734
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:55,864
But the point is now we're at a point where in theory, if this all happens,

735
00:30:55,974 --> 00:30:57,805
the moment that that thing got built in github

736
00:30:57,964 --> 00:30:58,685
and then distributed,

737
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:00,655
we know from then on it's secure and so

738
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:03,444
now we can focus on the developer security part.

739
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,665
Yes, that, yes, that is exactly the point.

740
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:09,035
And that was where I was wanted to bring this to like finish this one up

741
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:09,765
is

742
00:31:10,265 --> 00:31:13,045
we don't know how to fix a XZ problem today.

743
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:14,800
Oh, no, it's easy.

744
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,859
-- You just don't allow any new contributors,
-- obviously, obviously that

745
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,369
and we just have to make sure the original contributor doesn't

746
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,680
turn evil or get his account hacked or whatever anyway.

747
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:25,060
But

748
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,260
that's the thing, right?

749
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:27,979
You do background checks on all these people.

750
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:32,020
It's fine. It's very easy to do. Yes, it should be. No problem. Like

751
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,569
it probably legal in at least six countries, at

752
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,930
least in America. It is

753
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,540
our total lack of information

754
00:31:39,645 --> 00:31:41,224
and security law anyway.

755
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:42,305
But here's the thing,

756
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:46,285
once we start putting this plumbing into place, this is kind of like what you,

757
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:50,935
I'm gonna bring this back to your interstate example, even though I test driving is

758
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:55,185
you couldn't have like those gas stations, those restaurants,

759
00:31:55,194 --> 00:31:57,994
all of those things that exist next to interstates,

760
00:31:58,094 --> 00:31:59,165
by definition,

761
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:03,744
the interstate had to be built first right before that infrastructure could exist.

762
00:32:04,114 --> 00:32:05,425
That is how it works

763
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:06,979
by creating

764
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,810
an environment where we have the ability to quickly and easily sign artifacts

765
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,349
by itself.

766
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,089
This probably won't increase security in a noticeable way for anyone because

767
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:22,060
I can't name a single attack in the last probably 10 plus years

768
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,030
that this sort of thing would have stopped.

769
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,819
-- But
-- there was one where somebody replaced a package on a mirror site.

770
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,189
They, they that used to happen

771
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,189
all the time

772
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,810
like 20 years ago. But I can't think, I, I can't think of it happening recently.

773
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:38,709
I'm sure it has and I just haven't noticed, but you get the idea right? Where

774
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,219
once we have this infrastructure built now,

775
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:44,680
we can start thinking about what clever things

776
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:46,579
can we do with an environment like this?

777
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,250
Like if I have a github runner that I can

778
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:51,880
arbitrarily sign anything

779
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:52,640
with,

780
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,280
what else can I do? Like they have an example in here actually of signing an S

781
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:56,790
bomb

782
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:59,079
as one of the artifacts

783
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,869
that, that you distribute or whatever, right?

784
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,540
These are the sort of things that make me excited,

785
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,030
like not specifically signing packages because I don't think that's

786
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,069
particularly interesting or is going to necessarily solve any problems.

787
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,819
But I am excited but having the ability to sign

788
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:18,300
anything I want in a reliable and trustworthy way,

789
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,680
which has never existed before

790
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,290
in a reasonable manner.

791
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:26,420
Well, let me give you a concrete example until we had widespread TLS.

792
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,260
We couldn't have H TT uh,

793
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,420
-- DNS over http S
-- that's probably a bad example because lots of people hate that.

794
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:32,800
But

795
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,800
-- also a lot of people hated TLS.
-- Uh, probably,

796
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:37,579
oh,

797
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,859
no, I wrote articles about it and people, like, some people were like,

798
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:42,300
this is a terrible idea.

799
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,660
Why would you want to encrypt? You should only encrypt.

800
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,069
What absolutely has to be encrypt.

801
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,630
Like, look at the standard itself like you can downgrade and upgrade encryption,

802
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,020
-- including to none
-- in the old days.

803
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,140
You can't do any of that anymore. They fixed it all.

804
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,780
No, but the point is the people that even built this were like, yeah,

805
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,329
you might have a TLS encrypt or not even TLS SSL encryption.

806
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,579
But you might want to downgrade to nothing to like,

807
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:04,957
-- save on computer time or something like
-- that could be.

808
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,796
Actually, I remember back in the day you could,

809
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:09,476
you could make ssh not encrypt and I would use that

810
00:34:09,487 --> 00:34:12,797
for transferring files between machines on a local network because the,

811
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:13,996
the encryption

812
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,866
overhead was so huge

813
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:21,076
on these old machines. And, and now it's all magic CPU stuff.

814
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:21,726
-- But,
-- well, I mean,

815
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:23,876
I wrote security documentation where one of the first things

816
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:26,927
you do with Apache is turn off the non encryption,

817
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:27,677
right?

818
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:28,726
Like disabled des,

819
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:30,456
you know,

820
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,987
maybe even disabled three des, if you're feeling frisky

821
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:33,342
got a

822
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:33,803
lot of

823
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:34,364
power

824
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:38,743
-- the days anyway. Ok. I, we need to land this plane, but
-- that's the thing like

825
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:40,253
10 years ago,

826
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:45,934
if you had said TLS everywhere, basically hsts and preload is kind of the,

827
00:34:45,944 --> 00:34:48,934
the default in the sense of how things are expected to work.

828
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:51,592
I would have been like, yeah, no, that, that, that can't work.

829
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:54,293
-- We don't have the infrastructure for it and now we
-- do

830
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:57,283
and we needed, let's encrypt to exist right before we can do that.

831
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:58,803
We needed that infrastructure.

832
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:01,384
And so that's, that's the thing, right?

833
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:04,510
People forget it's not just one thing like you don't just build the interstate,

834
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,611
you also need new, better road surfaces, you need better road paint,

835
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:11,670
you need better cars, you need better tires, you need better gas stations,

836
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,091
you need better payment systems,

837
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:17,990
you need fast food so people can eat in five or 10 minutes, like go watch the founder.

838
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,270
You know about the mcdonald's story,

839
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:21,990
like seriously stuff like that enabled the interstate.

840
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:22,990
You know,

841
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,690
like one of the biggest problems I have with electric vehicles is

842
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:27,020
if I want to go on a road trip,

843
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:29,831
I don't want to spend two hours waiting for my car to recharge.

844
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,510
Assuming that there's a supercharger even available.

845
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:36,100
Right. Whereas with a gasoline powered car as terrible as they are,

846
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,379
I can reliably go from like

847
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,290
an empty tank to a full tank in like 3 to 4 minutes.

848
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,649
-- But so many places, but
-- again,

849
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:47,689
electric cars are solving these problems. It is getting better,

850
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,790
-- it's getting
-- there, it's not instantaneous. And that, that is how we should end it.

851
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,120
Is the electric car example, right, like a decade ago,

852
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:56,919
electric cars suck beyond reason.

853
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,610
And now there's still very early adopter stage, I'd say,

854
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,699
and they're not ready for like mass consumption, but they are improving.

855
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,600
And

856
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,229
in the next 5 to 10 years,

857
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,929
they're probably going to end up in a place where anyone can

858
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:10,810
have one and use it and not have to worry about.

859
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,120
-- Is there a charger where I'm going to pull off
-- unless you park on the street,

860
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:15,850
in which case?

861
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,500
-- Good luck.
-- Well, today, today that is a problem.

862
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,330
-- Absolutely because, well, in a cold place,
-- well, I,

863
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,459
I would say it's even better than that.

864
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:25,590
There are now use cases for which electric cars are clearly better,

865
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,090
cheaper and more effective.

866
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,290
Like, so there are actual

867
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,050
realistic use cases where it is a better option

868
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:34,830
and it's slowly that s curve of adoption, it's, it's getting better

869
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:38,870
so that there will be, you know, more complicated use cases where it's like, oh no,

870
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,229
it, it can do that

871
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:43,070
and then five years from now it'll be like, no, it actually does it better than the,

872
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,350
than the regular car.

873
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,439
That, that is it. That is the point. It can do that. Like

874
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:49,229
we can

875
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,550
sign things.

876
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,310
It's just feats of heroic.

877
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,590
We need it

878
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,159
very simple and very default.

879
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:58,479
Well, I think it needs to be like LS and Crypt where it's just,

880
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,679
-- it's just enabled by default when you download Apache, pretty much
-- for sure.

881
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:05,479
