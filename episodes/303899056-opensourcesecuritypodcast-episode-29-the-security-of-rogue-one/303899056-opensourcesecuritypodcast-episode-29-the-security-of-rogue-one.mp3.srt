Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 29 with myself,

1
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,420
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,270
Kurt, if I said to you a long time ago in a galaxy, far, far away,

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,040
-- what would you think
-- of probably leaving the room?

4
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:22,110
Whatever man,

5
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:28,930
today, we're going to discuss the security of rogue one,

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,889
which is the latest Star Wars movie.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,529
Well, it takes place in the Star Wars Universe.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,209
-- We'll say it's the
-- most recently released Star Wars movie.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,150
And so if you haven't seen this movie,

10
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:44,569
you should probably stop the podcast now because I'm fairly certain

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,689
we will ruin it for you in every possible way.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,919
So you've been warned everybody

13
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,889
and just for clarity, this movie

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,240
essentially takes place.

15
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:58,490
What is it minutes or hours before

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,659
the

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,220
uh fourth film, which

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,730
was the first film to ever be released of the Star Wars series,

19
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:06,220
right?

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,720
I would assume the ending is similar between

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,260
hours to days before episode four starts.

22
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,459
Yeah, because they,

23
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:16,089
well, let's start spoiling.

24
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:18,819
They, because they redid the entire hallway scene,

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,739
the

26
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,430
beginning,

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,699
the hallway scene, they,

28
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,069
they

29
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:22,239
didn't

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,220
do it, but they essentially copied it Right. And they, they, they,

31
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:30,150
the way the first film starts is the way the last this film ends except on a, I,

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,970
I assume a different spaceship because they have to get

33
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,059
away or ready to

34
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:33,559
escape

35
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:35,279
on the giant ship.

36
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,690
And then they get in the little corvette ship and speed away with the, the plans,

37
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:41,559
the,

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,760
the X filled data. But we'll get to that, we'll get to that. Why don't we start

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,919
at the beginning? Because

40
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:50,319
there is a lot to talk about here.

41
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,839
Well, so let's,

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,029
well, you know, and starting at the beginning,

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,059
why don't we start with sort of one of the biggest

44
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:59,540
points of the film, like literally the whole point of the film, which is

45
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,540
the death star is engineered by this guy who hates the imperium.

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,019
So I'm not sure why he works for them because

47
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,729
-- so this guy is living as a farmer with his wife and kids.
-- No, no,

48
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,880
no. Let's,

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,419
-- it
-- makes no damn sense.

50
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:17,750
None of it does because it's a Star Wars movie and let's not obsess on plot

51
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:18,705
because

52
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:22,554
if you want to talk about plot holes, we're going to be here for a week.

53
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:23,815
We're going to talk about

54
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,294
cinema sins will do this better than we can.

55
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:27,695
We'll

56
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:29,955
put a link to that

57
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,434
in the show notes where

58
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:31,554
a

59
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:34,835
professional can eviscerate the movie.

60
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:37,054
We're just going to focus on security.

61
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:41,755
Yeah. So the Death Star has a reactor to power it Right. That, that makes sense.

62
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:43,464
Right. You got to have batteries or something

63
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,419
and there's a flaw in the reactor that if you basically blow up the reactor,

64
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:48,190
the whole thing blows up.

65
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:48,570
But, I mean,

66
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,410
that's

67
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,910
every power station.

68
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,630
This is

69
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:51,779
a,

70
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,710
-- this is a plot hole and,
-- well, it's a secure,

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,149
-- they should have put some armor on the
-- damn

72
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,339
thing.

73
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:00,320
A sheet of plywood over the hall. But that's not the point. right is that let's focus

74
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,589
-- nuclear
-- vessels, nuclear reactors,

75
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,380
four inch thick vessels.

76
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,759
And those things, even when they go bang on, you know,

77
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,600
three Mile Island in Fukushima and Chernobyl as bad as they were.

78
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,080
Well, Chernobyl had no containment vessel but even as bad as they are, you know,

79
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:18,520
-- they don't like go completely kaboom
-- because a rogue engineer didn't design them.

80
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,660
Right. They were designed by competent engineers. We will assume.

81
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,529
Well, yeah. Anyways. Yeah.

82
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,789
So, so I would say that's sort of the, one of the biggest,

83
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:29,320
uh to me security flaws is like you have this enormous power supply,

84
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,380
you should probably like put some shielding around it.

85
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:36,000
Ok? We'll get to that. All right, we'll get to that. Let's start at the beginning.

86
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,130
But I think

87
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,330
the first thing I noticed in

88
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,639
this movie is they,

89
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:44,720
they rooted their, their android, right?

90
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,210
It was an Imperial droid, right? That big black robot

91
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,740
-- sidekick. Right.
-- Right. Big black Robo

92
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,669
sidekick. I, that's, that's a fantastic name.

93
00:03:58,429 --> 00:03:59,889
So, yeah, so they they,

94
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:03,020
I wasn't clear on that because my understanding is these robots are

95
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,509
self-aware like C three po and R two D two and stuff.

96
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,339
Right. They are basically self aware and they can have conversations and stuff.

97
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,839
-- I would say they are legitimate artificial intelligences.
-- Exactly.

98
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,949
In a robotic mobile body with some sort of magic power source that runs the thing.

99
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,730
We'll ignore that.

100
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,369
And, um,

101
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,559
but, yeah, so, you know, at first I wasn't clear on like, did this, you know, robot,

102
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,059
you know, kind of gain a conscience and join the rebels or?

103
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,730
Yeah, did they root

104
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,359
they,

105
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:26,559
they,

106
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,950
they reprogrammed him

107
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,119
in the movie. So my assumption is they somehow captured the robot and

108
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,019
basically rooted it, as I would say, all the third party

109
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:38,065
or,

110
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:40,105
I mean, it could be a physical, like, you know,

111
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,964
like adding a chip or bridging something, right?

112
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,725
-- Which
-- kind of whatever, whatever it doesn't matter.

113
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:48,144
But the point is the robot didn't defect seems to be what was suggested,

114
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:53,065
which would be very interesting if you had uh robots in the Star Wars universe or any.

115
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,524
Well, I mean, other universes have, have done this but

116
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:57,714
where they have a concept of, of morality,

117
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:59,494
which doesn't seem to be the case because the

118
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:01,744
robots seem to generally just do what they're told

119
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,540
even if they don't want to because like three po complains at length and,

120
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:09,540
-- and even this guy K two, like they complain about everything but they
-- still do

121
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,600
go off script a couple of times.

122
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,920
I don't know. That's, I, I can't,

123
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,140
he shows initiative.

124
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,440
He, he shows initiative but I don't think he's ever, he, I

125
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:21,739
think he

126
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:22,859
put him

127
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,549
back in the trash.

128
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,799
That's his job is to be annoying.

129
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,470
At least this robot wasn't as annoying as three po because he was the

130
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:32,450
-- least annoying character in the movie, but it
-- does get shot

131
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,480
and killed. So I'll, I'll, I'll take

132
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,630
II I will accept his annoying

133
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,089
because

134
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,230
that's the only character when it died. I felt bad.

135
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,489
-- Like everyone else, I didn't care.
-- I just felt

136
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,809
relieved. The robot.

137
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,890
I'm like, oh, that poor robot, everyone else is dead.

138
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,570
-- I'm like in
-- fairness to the storm troopers.

139
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:47,790
I mean,

140
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,660
that's actually one thing I would like to see is somebody

141
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,809
tally up how many storm troopers die in this thing.

142
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,510
I bet you that is somebody did that. I guarantee somebody did that.

143
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,500
And I'm not gonna look right now because

144
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,535
I don't care.

145
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:04,255
But, well, how many storm troopers must have been on the death star? Right?

146
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,195
When it, when it blows up in episode four.

147
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:10,095
I mean, the, the, the genocide committed there is gonna be incredible

148
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,524
and weren't they? Ok.

149
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:15,605
So here's something I'm not clear on in the or like so the trilogy of trilogies,

150
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:18,934
the middle trilogy being released first and then the first trilogy being released

151
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:21,934
in the first trilogy, they're all clones of the what's his face?

152
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:22,815
The bounty hunter dude.

153
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,040
Uh, Django Fent, his name,

154
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,480
they're all clones of him.

155
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,299
And his

156
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,709
quote

157
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,839
unquote son is a clone of him

158
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,019
but didn't have that sort of, um, mental programming put in.

159
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,179
He was more independent,

160
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,739
right?

161
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,420
He's like a legitimate clone as opposed to some sort of reprogrammed robot clone.

162
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,600
So, at what point did the imperial Republic or whatever

163
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,359
stop using clones and start using normal people?

164
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,880
So I'm sure there's something written about

165
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,799
this in the official Star Wars universe.

166
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,750
But from if, if you only watch the movies, which is kind of what I consider

167
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,869
the canon and I hate all this extra crap people like to write.

168
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,910
But after the sixth movie,

169
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:05,309
before the seventh movie, which there's like 2030 year time span, it,

170
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,220
it would appear, they started using people.

171
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,859
And in fact, in, in episode seven, they,

172
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,750
one of the characters even

173
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,399
makes a reference to if you're like regular storm troopers can't handle this,

174
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,630
maybe I'll get clones to do it suggesting that clones are inferior

175
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,950
to the people.

176
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,309
But the people obviously have some level of willpower that can make them.

177
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,690
Yeah, whereas the clones will march across minefield happily.

178
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:30,679
Yeah, we'll get to that one

179
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:32,170
so

180
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:33,109
much wrong with this

181
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:33,399
here.

182
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:37,755
What drives me nuts too is we see these, these are like combat robots

183
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,204
essentially or not.

184
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,394
See that's the other thing I'm not clear on these,

185
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:43,035
these robots are they meant for combat or not?

186
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,434
-- Because you mean
-- the K two robots,

187
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:46,834
that's the big black one.

188
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:49,345
But there's a bunch of them in the film and as far as I can tell,

189
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,994
like, they're always just sort of stomping around not doing anything.

190
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,644
Like you don't see them with guns. Right.

191
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,505
At least I don't remember seeing them with guns.

192
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:57,515
I don't

193
00:07:57,915 --> 00:08:00,755
recall. They, they gave K two a gun at the end. Yeah.

194
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:01,515
Yeah.

195
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,459
But other than that, it,

196
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,660
-- I, I don't see because
-- I'm kind of wondering maybe after the clone wars, you know,

197
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,140
with that robot army from the trade federation that they

198
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:12,779
kind of realized giving robot guns was pointless because they,

199
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,059
they, they suck at this.

200
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:14,380
Uh

201
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,779
Maybe so according to

202
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,459
Wikipedia,

203
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,179
this is a KX series security Droid.

204
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,230
-- So I would assume they're capable of some level of violence.
-- Stupid question.

205
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,690
Why don't they have eyes in the back of their head?

206
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,380
They only have eyes in the front.

207
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,789
Why they don't need eyes? They should have some sort of liar.

208
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,900
So they know what's going on all around them at all times. But

209
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,320
that is

210
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,830
a plot hole

211
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:40,840
in my opinion

212
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,090
-- that we can, it's a
-- technology hall, right?

213
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,530
Like, I mean, if it was me, if I was building security robots,

214
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,299
they would be like essentially of a 360 field of view with a variety of sensors,

215
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:50,599
you know,

216
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,619
thermal, infrared, night vision, you know,

217
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,030
-- radar.
-- Here's the thing. If you had robots

218
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,630
that were perfectly aware of their surroundings at all times.

219
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,150
These movies would be far less interesting.

220
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,380
-- Right.
-- Let's face it.

221
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,669
I'd be ok with that. They'd be shorter.

222
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,320
Right.

223
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:14,539
So, anyways, ok. So moving along,

224
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,989
so they're transporting,

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,250
was that a bunch of those crystals they were transporting?

226
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,049
They were called

227
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,320
kyber crystals apparently,

228
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,159
which are supposed to be the energy source for a lightsaber.

229
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:26,260
So for those of you don't know,

230
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,169
they're apparently strip mining this old temple of like all these kyber crystals

231
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,820
and loading them up on a big star destroyer,

232
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,270
which which now actually I've heard people complaining because the star destroyer

233
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,679
is hovering above the city and it is not a known fact,

234
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,880
but star destroyers kind of from the beginning

235
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:43,869
have been

236
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,820
uh uh able to fly an atmosphere that isn't like something they went off

237
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,780
reservation for in this movie,

238
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:54,270
this is something they can do. They can fly in an atmosphere

239
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,530
shield technology, right? That can block stuff.

240
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,820
So I assume they could just put a shield around it and fly it into.

241
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,650
The problem is obviously gravity because you have a huge massive object and the

242
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:08,114
amount of energy that must be required to keep it from falling to the earth

243
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:08,945
is

244
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:13,765
outrageous to say the least. However, as someone else pointed out

245
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,684
is when you think about episode five, when they're invading

246
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:19,114
hath with the uh at

247
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,164
Walkers,

248
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:24,354
like why didn't they just fly down the freaking star destroyers and shoot the bay

249
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:25,044
right.

250
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:28,684
Drop a rock on it. Right. Or even land on top of it for that matter.

251
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,385
So, it's a legitimate complaint.

252
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,169
Yeah. So, anyways, um,

253
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:33,849
so they're transporting this cargo,

254
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,780
it's like on a little sort of hover car type deal

255
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,729
and it's surrounded by a bunch of guys and they're,

256
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,010
you know, so they're clearly expecting trouble

257
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,409
and then

258
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,030
they get ambushed and they basically just all stand around and die.

259
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,450
They have no air cover,

260
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,760
they have no,

261
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:50,929
they have air cover. There's a giant ship over the whole city.

262
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:51,789
You

263
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:51,950
know,

264
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,700
why didn't they just helicopter those stupid crystals out of there

265
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,570
or like an elevator, right? Like the

266
00:10:58,809 --> 00:10:59,260
tethered

267
00:10:59,489 --> 00:10:59,669
space,

268
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,320
right? Yeah.

269
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:05,750
Again though, this is a, a plot vehicle,

270
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,919
in my opinion and we can all acknowledge that this is a

271
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:12,169
ridiculous thing no reasonable organization would

272
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,640
do from a security perspective,

273
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:14,080
right?

274
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:18,119
So the other thing from a security perspective, you know, ok, here's a question,

275
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,599
what does storm trooper armor actually

276
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:27,440
-- block or protect them?
-- I suspect it doesn't protect them, but it is a thing they wear

277
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,400
that mercy kills them if they take any damage

278
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,280
because

279
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,559
in episode, well, think of it, episode six, dude, like ewoks,

280
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,840
throw rocks at them and they die like this is clearly not protective armor.

281
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,400
You know, they, they get stabbed through their armor,

282
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,299
they get just blunt force damage through their armor.

283
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:46,619
They,

284
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,349
and the other thing that drives me nuts. Is,

285
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,820
their armor is never scuffed up. So they have some sort of technology

286
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,099
because

287
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:53,849
once they die,

288
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,460
they don't have technology if they get, they get hit once and they die.

289
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:59,739
-- So they're constantly producing new armor.
-- Right. Ok.

290
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,849
That makes sense because I was, like,

291
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:02,739
thinking about this and I was looking at my snowboard helmet.

292
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,809
It's like my snowboard helmet is just scuff to heck from just, you know,

293
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,440
being dropped on the floor or whatever.

294
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,400
You know, it reminds me of the scene from the island where, um, you know,

295
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:11,619
the main character, what's his face?

296
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,200
Ewan mcgregory is like, why, why white, why,

297
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,750
why can't it be like gray or black but white?

298
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,419
-- You know, do you have any idea how hard it is to keep these things clean?
-- Right. Right.

299
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:21,559
Of course. And

300
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,799
I, I agree, I think that the storm troopers are completely ridiculous. And

301
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:30,409
I don't know, honestly, again, I suspect it's a plot device.

302
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,909
You need to look cool.

303
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,419
You know, the only thing that's cooler than having a bunch of, like,

304
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:37,309
scary looking soldiers and white is, is having the heroes, like,

305
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,359
mow them down with no regard.

306
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,489
And that's the other thing like the storm troopers. Ok.

307
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,210
I know they have blasters and they shoot stuff that's cool.

308
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:47,619
They also have hand grenades which they,

309
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,590
like never use except when they throw them at

310
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,760
a robot which catches them and throws them back

311
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:52,640
again.

312
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:53,919
Well,

313
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,130
don't,

314
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,739
you know,

315
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,650
-- make hand grenades with a contact
-- fuse. Not them,

316
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,349
they, they also make armor that provides your protection code, I think. Yeah.

317
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,750
Yeah.

318
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh God.

319
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,640
So, anyways, here's my favorite. It's, and it's a movie trope, but

320
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,369
to break them out of that, like prison, they shoot the door lock and the prison door,

321
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,270
like, whips open faster than you can say.

322
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:17,219
I love that. Ok.

323
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:22,090
So here's the deal in the real world, you always want doors to fail open, right?

324
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,119
Because if something bad happens,

325
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,929
-- you for health
-- and human safety.

326
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:31,169
However, in a prison, I bet prisons don't fail open or at least, I hope they don't.

327
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,729
It sort of depends. Um,

328
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,489
but basically if you cut the power to them, uh, I'm assuming they don't all just open,

329
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,570
but they can be manually opened,

330
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:44,960
which is the important part is you need essentially like

331
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,609
the thing to remember about prisons is prisons are built so they don't burn,

332
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,349
they're all concrete and steel, right?

333
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,570
Because you have people in there who will

334
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,375
very happily, you know, create a fire to cause a

335
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:55,784
problem.

336
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,294
There's also perhaps this wasn't a prison, this guy was in,

337
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,315
maybe it was like a repurposed room closet.

338
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:06,484
-- And so shooting the door will open,
-- it had like an armored door with bars repurposed,

339
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:09,445
right? They, they put a nicer door on II, I

340
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,145
don't know, like

341
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:15,510
it. I, I totally agree with this that if you have a prison

342
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,070
and you can just shoot the door.

343
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,150
That's ridiculous.

344
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,320
Well, the door lock, right, you shoot the door lock and in my experience, like,

345
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,869
when you,

346
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,890
well, I'm, I'm assuming if, for example, I'm not going to shoot it,

347
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,530
but if I took a hammer to a proximity card, swiper thing and smashed it,

348
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,630
you know, I,

349
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,809
somebody's gonna have to call maintenance to replace it and open the door.

350
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:38,400
Right. I suspect the terrorist organization doesn't have maintenance.

351
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,349
Yeah. Well, because remember in, I remember, I forget which desk are

352
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,880
but they do clearly have it because, remember they try and seal the door and then the,

353
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,609
the storm troopers do manage to open it.

354
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:51,145
Yes. That's right. It's, again though, I guess this sort of comes back, I guess

355
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:51,344
the

356
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:52,284
imperium is more

357
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:57,275
and later in the movie they, they break the door to keep it shut.

358
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:00,614
Right. They seal them in the data vault by,

359
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:03,614
he smashes the control panel. And that's the other thing. I don't understand.

360
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,085
Why do you have this massive control panel to like a door?

361
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:07,655
Like,

362
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:09,075
-- I'm
-- sure it

363
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:10,034
has

364
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:10,294
a button

365
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,034
-- up and down. Like,
-- yeah, but it does other things. Right.

366
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:16,924
It's not just to open the door, I'm sure a button to open the door

367
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,760
and then buttons for everything else.

368
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,400
Right.

369
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,150
And then that's acceptable. I buy that. All right. So the door is,

370
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,859
I'm ok with smashing door locks to make them

371
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,099
stay shut.

372
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,619
I'm not ok with them, like you smash the door lock and the door whips open.

373
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,979
Maybe, maybe the blasters have a special setting

374
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:36,650
for

375
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:36,969
open. So,

376
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:38,090
yeah.

377
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,960
Right, exactly.

378
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,179
Set

379
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,489
number 712

380
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:44,030
turn it on, shoot the lock, the door opens. Right. It's like a ha.

381
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,570
Yeah.

382
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,020
So anyways moving along the movie, so at one point they have, um, the,

383
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,070
the research scientists on that little

384
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,419
base on the planet or whatever. Right. And they sneak up on them

385
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:58,210
and this is what gets me,

386
00:15:58,219 --> 00:16:00,950
these are obviously high value scientists because they have a ton of guards.

387
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,039
They have anti air defenses.

388
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,349
They have those, um, what do you call the, the,

389
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,669
the fighters with the hexagonal wingy things?

390
00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:06,820
They weren't to

391
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,219
fighters. They were some other one.

392
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:08,919
These

393
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,169
were,

394
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:10,469
they have,

395
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,549
not only do they have air defense, they have like an air wing there to guard them

396
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,510
so clearly a high value group of people

397
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,109
and they don't use landmines.

398
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,869
Well, they did shoot them all at the end so they can't be that important.

399
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,489
Right.

400
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,510
But, I mean, you know, my understanding of the imperium is like if you mess up,

401
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,869
you get force choked or shot.

402
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:31,099
Uh, yeah, that, that, that seems fair. But did they mess up?

403
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:33,229
I mean, that one guy messed up, the rest of them

404
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,309
just were doing their jobs.

405
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:38,419
I also wonder if it was actually them,

406
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:38,960
uh,

407
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:41,219
was a security thing because these people knew how the

408
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:43,510
death star was built and what its weaknesses might be.

409
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,479
And so kind of like, you know, the Egyptian pharaohs or the, uh,

410
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:49,359
the Ming dynasty tombs, you know, shooting all the workers so that,

411
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,239
-- you know, their secrets go to their grave,
-- maybe.

412
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,820
But you'd think at the same time you wouldn't store the complete plans unencrypted

413
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:59,239
on a massive storage device

414
00:16:59,369 --> 00:16:59,390
on

415
00:16:59,609 --> 00:16:59,729
some

416
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:02,729
in fairness. That thing had reasonably decent security that

417
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,630
-- we'll get to that in a,
-- compared to like a lot of the other stuff in the movie.

418
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,040
Right?

419
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:12,348
Any who? So, yeah. So they, they mow down these scientists and just these poor guys.

420
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:12,628
But

421
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:16,029
yeah, the, the fact that she could, like, sneak up on this base and that there's,

422
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:16,417
you know,

423
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:18,688
there's no sensors, there's no land mines,

424
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:21,667
like seriously perimeter defense is a thing for a reason.

425
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,358
I would agree with you

426
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:28,118
-- completely. I suspect you can have
-- a home security alarm.

427
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,060
I'm not answering that question.

428
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,010
Well, then you're probably, I'm guessing you do and you're,

429
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,160
it's probably more effective than what the Imperial.

430
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,449
Ok. I'll agree with that.

431
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:38,040
A typical home security system is without question,

432
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,140
better than what these guys had.

433
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,430
Now at the same time,

434
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,704
they were clearly on a remote planet

435
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,614
and they were obviously in a very out of the way location.

436
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:47,604
And so

437
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:52,415
there is something to be said by an attempted security through obscurity here.

438
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:55,375
But I think fundamentally when you put it all together. Yeah.

439
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:59,885
It's completely ridiculous. And their physical security of that installation was

440
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:00,885
deplorable.

441
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:01,765
Yeah.

442
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,729
Well, it always is. Right. I mean, it's

443
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,790
the reaction times and everything are always quite terrible

444
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,770
and, and I, if I was one of the people protecting that I'd be like,

445
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,869
I don't want any storm troopers, like, just give me, like, some little kids,

446
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,550
anything but those guys.

447
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,619
Yeah, that's one interesting thing actually. Speaking of, uh, like air defense.

448
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,520
So you see in, um, on the rebel side they always have that little dude sitting in a tr

449
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,459
-- can on a pole.
-- That's

450
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:24,670
right

451
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:25,890
on

452
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,329
the, the moon. I forget the name of it.

453
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,390
-- No,
-- but in the other movies he's in a couple of movies too.

454
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,310
I remember that because I was always like, what is he doing out there?

455
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,819
Like, he sometimes has binoculars, sometimes he doesn't have binoculars. Like,

456
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:43,319
is he just, is he, you know, the backup in case the radar fails?

457
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,319
-- Maybe he is the radar, you know, like, yeah,
-- so I've always wondered about that.

458
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:49,150
So, like the imperium seems to,

459
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,619
you know, obviously of stuff like radar but they, they don't seem to have any,

460
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,349
you know, basically the,

461
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,589
the rebels fly a bunch of ships and then start shooting the place up and they're like,

462
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,900
all shocked and surprised.

463
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:05,430
Uh That's basically what happens in episode five though as well where they're on

464
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,079
h

465
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:06,979
and

466
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,939
the Empire shows up

467
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,829
-- with their,
-- detect them in orbit.

468
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,199
Was

469
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:11,420
it,

470
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:12,229
did

471
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:12,640
they

472
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,890
remember we've detected them in orbit?

473
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,229
So obviously they have some sort of radar or optical or something.

474
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:20,050
-- Go, they're, they're at least looking.
-- Ok.

475
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,989
So life technology exists, at least in this universe we can't,

476
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,239
we can't pretend it doesn't.

477
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,900
And so yes,

478
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:30,770
the empire has zero excuse for not enabling this functionality onto their remote

479
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,369
engineering base.

480
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:33,290
So,

481
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:39,170
uh anyway, so, and, ok, moving along, so they steal a plane.

482
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,329
Now, this part is actually somewhat believable.

483
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,420
I, I agree

484
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,319
it's spaceship, not, not a plane

485
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,709
in a spaceship. My bad. Yeah.

486
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,810
So, I mean, in general, planes, um, so apparently some small planes do have locks,

487
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:52,839
they're just not very good.

488
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,410
Um Or you can buy like a metal cover that goes over, say the throttle or the, the,

489
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,500
-- you
-- know, the club for your airplane

490
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,650
essentially. Yeah.

491
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,520
Um

492
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,979
because the reality is right,

493
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:06,949
like airplanes are kind of hideously expensive things, you know, like

494
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,089
100 million and up for like, you know, a decent sized commercial jet.

495
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,449
And so, and, and when you think about it too,

496
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:18,489
the thing to remember about a plane is it's not like it has a driver or a pilot, it has,

497
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,569
whichever flight crew gets assigned to it that day.

498
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:21,680
Right.

499
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,959
And so, you know, it's who has the keys to the damn thing.

500
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,500
You don't want to lose the keys, right?

501
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,040
And you would just end up with people making like 17 million calls the keys.

502
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,010
So, you know,

503
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,040
most planes essentially that's the thing to remember too.

504
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,609
They only live in secured environments or they're flying in the air,

505
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:38,760
right?

506
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,489
Like, like my local airport, if you want to get on to the airport, tarmac,

507
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,349
you better have a good reason and a pass,

508
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:46,880
right?

509
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,510
Because the whole thing is surrounded by chain link with

510
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,709
barbed wire and there's armed security and RC MP.

511
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,310
-- So
-- did you know that there are actually like repo men for airplanes?

512
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,020
Which is a crazy story to read about.

513
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,859
-- Yeah,
-- they've had to sneak on to the, the tarmac and take off with these things.

514
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:05,449
So I'll buy that because realistically, you know, it's like, uh,

515
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,430
you know what

516
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,550
I think because there are

517
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,209
repo men for airplanes and they're obviously fairly successful at what they do.

518
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:16,260
I don't think it's a matter of airplane security is,

519
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,339
is the security or the secured location.

520
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:19,300
I think it's a fact that

521
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,089
there's a very limited number of people who are

522
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:24,260
actually capable of taking off with these things,

523
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,010
but most importantly is once you get it, like, what do you do with it?

524
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,930
You can't hide it.

525
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,689
-- It's very difficult.
-- There's been planes that have been stolen and gone missing

526
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:32,699
and

527
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,819
there's very few of those. So that is certainly not a typical thing that happens.

528
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,040
And generally speaking, gone missing, they're pretty sure they all crashed.

529
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,420
Right.

530
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:41,719
Well, that's the thing. Right.

531
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:45,829
You'd never be able to fly to like a legitimate air airport without like, you know,

532
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,739
changing the tail number and getting a whole bunch of documentation and

533
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:49,359
which,

534
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:51,689
which the stolen spaceship now,

535
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,910
they don't change the tail number.

536
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,609
They apparently changed nothing about it and,

537
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:01,609
and the rebels have it and the empire clearly either nobody reported it missing,

538
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,589
which seems unlikely because I'm fairly certain they didn't kill everybody

539
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,560
at the location.

540
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,750
In fact, we know they didn't because the, the main character,

541
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,489
the guy who wears the white white cape,

542
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,849
he, he escapes.

543
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:15,890
And so you think he'd be like, uh, somebody should go and make sure that, you know,

544
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,530
like, nobody stole anything that we care about over here because, uh,

545
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,770
everyone sort of died.

546
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,069
Yeah. And, and sort of the main, one of the main crux points of the movie is

547
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,569
apparently the authentication credentials to get

548
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,290
through the shield and into the stuff

549
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,199
is tied to the spaceship.

550
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,660
It's

551
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:31,939
not

552
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:33,369
-- guys, you know.
-- Yeah.

553
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,010
It's not like somebody has, like, the password written down in their wallet.

554
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,839
It's actually like,

555
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,520
or maybe there is a sticky note,

556
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,729
right? Maybe there's a sticky note pasted into the radio.

557
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,829
And so they're like,

558
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,089
we're gonna read this code here and hope it works

559
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:49,420
every time they do that, transmitting the codes, it takes several seconds.

560
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,729
Like, think about that for a second, right?

561
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:53,520
Like, it's really slow every time they do this,

562
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,119
-- transmitting the code
-- because it's suspenseful.

563
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,130
If it was immediate, it would be far less interesting as the viewer.

564
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,199
-- I need to be emotionally engaged in the scene.
-- Ok.

565
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:07,540
It, it, again, I'll call that a plot device that I'm willing to overlook.

566
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:07,829
Well,

567
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,689
what really gets me too is so then they get to this place

568
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:12,449
where they need to use the access code and the guy's like,

569
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,089
you're not on the manifest and they're like,

570
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:16,920
they give some excuse about the delay somewhere or something, which

571
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:20,319
-- actually is kind of believable, but then it's just like, ok, come
-- on in.

572
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,349
Well, not only that, not only that, I love that

573
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:29,030
they land them right next to the giant data store warehouse thing that,

574
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,079
that huge spire instead of being like

575
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:33,170
there's a ship showing up we don't know about.

576
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,069
They have a reasonable excuse, you know, let,

577
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,939
let's have them park over by the farm on the other side of the planet.

578
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:43,880
You know, not by the sensitive industrial complex that we're worried about.

579
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,430
And the whole reason we have a shield around this planet.

580
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,140
Yeah,

581
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,209
that's what always gets me about all these movies is they

582
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:54,099
have this like big grandiose security measure that's essentially ineffective,

583
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:55,069
kind of like, you know,

584
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,959
um, airport security, right?

585
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:57,520
You have, uh, the,

586
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,359
the line of metal detectors with people

587
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,540
pawing through your luggage and everything and,

588
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,380
you know, when it really, what we,

589
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,780
what we really needed was like reinforced cockpit doors,

590
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:06,819
you know,

591
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:09,530
they, they had a door and it was closed.

592
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,310
Yeah. Well, sort of, but not really because apparently anybody can open it.

593
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,180
Uh, which, wait, which store are you talking about?

594
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,530
I was talking about the shield, all of them.

595
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,290
Well, the shield door was closed and they,

596
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,469
the only way they open that was by crashing two star destroyers into it,

597
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,489
which I would say is

598
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:26,329
reasonable. Door security.

599
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,119
Yeah.

600
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:28,680
I mean, I, I would,

601
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,170
I would imagine that their threat model didn't

602
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,369
include star destroyers running into the gate.

603
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,839
Well, but again, the, you know, the rebels have some reasonably big ships.

604
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,150
-- Uh, that's true. They do. There's no reason they couldn't just kind of crash it
-- into

605
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,239
an old freighter.

606
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,530
You don't even need to take a warship, like,

607
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,329
because they have freighters in this thing, right?

608
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:51,699
They have like, or like literal or freighters hauling around rocks in later films,

609
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:52,040
right?

610
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,140
I don't remember.

611
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:58,319
-- Probably we'll assume there's some way to move raw material
-- and, and somebody like,

612
00:24:58,329 --> 00:24:59,229
uh, what's his face?

613
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:01,589
-- Um,
-- you're gonna need more description than that.

614
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,209
-- The Millennium
-- Falcon

615
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,170
Han Solo.

616
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:04,939
-- Yeah,
-- I mean,

617
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:05,579
forget Han

618
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:06,250
Solo.

619
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,449
I hate these films.

620
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,719
I really hate these films.

621
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,609
Um,

622
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,790
so like if a private individual and a Wookie

623
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,459
-- or sorry, what is Chewbacca? He's a Wookie. He's a
-- Wookie Ewok.

624
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,010
-- Ok. And Wookies and Ewoks are related but not the same.
-- I don't think they are.

625
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,469
I think the idea was, but from my understanding of reading things and,

626
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,949
and I could be mistaken here but

627
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,589
uh George Lucas wanted

628
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,939
and, or the, the,

629
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,510
or the, the Ewok moon right in episode six to be wookies,

630
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:39,500
but they were too expensive. So they made ewoks instead because obviously

631
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,500
an ewok is half the price to build a Woogie suit.

632
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:47,670
So anyways, I mean, obviously if a private in,

633
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:51,300
if two private individuals can own something as big as the Millennium Falcon,

634
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,699
-- technically
-- he stole it. He won a card game and he cheated from Lando

635
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,349
Krizan.

636
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:01,420
-- They were playing a card game and he used the stack deck so
-- Lando can own this thing.

637
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,859
You know,

638
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,089
-- Lando
-- owns a freaking city man, like he's clearly a good businessman.

639
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,500
Well, exactly, Lando owns a city. Right.

640
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,969
Well, when there's people who basically own cities, I mean.

641
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:15,329
Right. True. But my point being is that, you know,

642
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,199
it's not then unreasonable.

643
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:21,369
I mean, think about it, they're protecting an entire planet, obviously something,

644
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,650
you know, valuable on it

645
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:24,089
to me.

646
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:24,319
You know,

647
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,180
that says that you should actually take into account somebody

648
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:30,020
like ram raiding you with like an or freighter.

649
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,640
I, which is basically what they did,

650
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,209
we'll say, ok. And I, I don't think that is

651
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,339
because you can steal these things or, you know, not even that, not even stealing it.

652
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,959
If you have a entire planet

653
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,959
that is protected essentially by one door that people can go through,

654
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,599
that means obviously,

655
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:50,560
you're gonna have a lot of ships in

656
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,719
orbit because they're gonna be bringing materials and,

657
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:56,800
and of course, if it's a data storage warehouse, there's no doubt,

658
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,319
regular deliveries of massive quantities of data.

659
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:01,209
Right.

660
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,180
And so

661
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:05,819
I think logically you have to expect at some point a spaceship

662
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:09,119
is going to break down in orbit and crash into your shield.

663
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,560
And so it's safe to say

664
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:13,780
that they screwed that one up. All right.

665
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:15,880
Ok. Well, I'll let that one go.

666
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,680
I think that's acceptable that, that even if a star destroyer hit the shield,

667
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,180
it should not have broken generator

668
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:22,500
or

669
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,050
no, the,

670
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,989
the generator, I assume is down on the planet.

671
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,319
Well, the ring thing had a generator because that was the,

672
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:29,890
it was closing like the little

673
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,089
ring thing.

674
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,510
It was,

675
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:32,369
I

676
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:38,380
don't, I don't know how that door works and I'm sure some Star Star Wars nerd

677
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,300
has, has put together some ridiculous explanation. But,

678
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,540
ok, and that's fair.

679
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:47,930
If the, if the door is generating its own shield, it is conceivable.

680
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:49,369
A ship crashing into it

681
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,369
would

682
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,400
disable that portion of it.

683
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,699
-- But I think
-- what doesn't make sense to me is if it is,

684
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:57,780
even if it's generating the door shield, once you destroy that

685
00:27:58,089 --> 00:27:58,780
part,

686
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:01,329
shouldn't the thing generating the shield, like

687
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,050
on the

688
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:02,479
planet

689
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:02,760
just

690
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:04,339
fill in that little hole.

691
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:04,780
So it's

692
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:05,939
closed, which,

693
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,420
which would be the correct way to plan this.

694
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,469
But I'm not a movie writer and this is all made up crap.

695
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:14,569
So, we'll just go with it for now. Right.

696
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,349
Well, and interestingly, I find it also bizarre that

697
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:21,739
you can't transmit out of the shield

698
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:26,119
unless you're apparently using the imperial radio frequencies.

699
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,979
Well, I'm assuming the shield has to block

700
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,489
-- it,
-- but

701
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:33,630
here's the thing, if it's blocking radio signals, why is it

702
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,739
visible light because you can see the planet? So,

703
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,209
yeah, you could at least optically signal out of there.

704
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,939
Although that would not be enough bandwidth.

705
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,979
We don't know that. I mean, it's,

706
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,410
well, and the thing is too,

707
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,689
they were listening to the radio when they were in hyperspace.

708
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:47,219
Correct.

709
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,959
I

710
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:50,479
remember he had the headset.

711
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,829
I think they looked like a pair of um beats that were spray painted silver.

712
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,280
In fact, this is one of those things that I always,

713
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,520
always annoy me is if you are traveling faster than the speed of light,

714
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,439
it should be impossible to send or receive any sort of communication.

715
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:06,959
And in fact,

716
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,469
-- if you read the book,
-- but you can see the stars outside, remember the light streaks.

717
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:13,680
-- So that obviously you can, you could
-- receive,

718
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:15,219
you would not see light streaks either.

719
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:16,180
But we'll ignore that.

720
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:21,869
Actually, this is a plot point in the Enders game trilogy or four books,

721
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,500
whatever it is

722
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,670
where they, they, they have, they don't travel faster than the speed of light.

723
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,339
They travel at very close to the speed of light.

724
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:34,589
And so they have various you know, time dilation, other issues come into play. A

725
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:37,300
communication is a huge issue when these ships

726
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,819
are traveling near the speed of light.

727
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:41,630
And that's actually a, a huge plot point in

728
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:45,160
the third book. I forget which one now it's been, it's been a while.

729
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,109
But anyway, anyway,

730
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:51,689
uh again, we can ignore that as a plot device in this instance. Ok.

731
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:52,430
So,

732
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:56,329
so we got the good guys, they make it down next to

733
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,530
the giant data warehouse,

734
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,719
which again is insane.

735
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:05,290
And then the, the empire sends inspectors on board.

736
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:09,599
And like so, and, and this like, don't be,

737
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:12,670
and some of them were wearing stormtrooper armor and I think

738
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,050
there was one guy just in a regular fabric uniform,

739
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,670
correct?

740
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,489
Like their lieutenant or captain or whatever.

741
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,449
And what gets me is like, none of them have time to be like

742
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,229
when they get shot or choked out or, or whatever or there's no buyers,

743
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,530
biosensors in their thing to say like, hey, you know,

744
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,280
the guy in the suit of armor is dead

745
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,010
might want to check him out. Yo, because

746
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:34,025
I know the US military has like been working

747
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:35,814
on smart fabrics and stuff for a long time.

748
00:30:35,824 --> 00:30:37,685
So they can see like where did the bullet hole go?

749
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:38,194
You know?

750
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:41,255
Well, I, I think it's safe to say that stormtrooper armor.

751
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:44,895
I mean, if these guys bump their head on, on the cabinet, they're gonna die.

752
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:45,494
So

753
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:49,255
you, you, you the amount of data you'd be generated would be phenomenal.

754
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:53,785
So we can kind of ignore that. And, and they also do this in episode four where the,

755
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:57,545
they land the ship, the storm troopers come on, they knock them out

756
00:30:57,844 --> 00:30:58,535
and then

757
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,560
they pretend radio

758
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,170
malfunction by tapping his,

759
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,239
-- well, at least
-- they do that in episode four.

760
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,890
This rogue one doesn't even have that where they just walk out and they're like,

761
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,660
oh look, it's me.

762
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:10,369
And then everyone in that part I get because you

763
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,729
can social engineer your way through a situation like that,

764
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:12,989
especially

765
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,660
if

766
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:14,930
you're wearing the uniform.

767
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:15,280
Right.

768
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,010
Well, not only that if you're,

769
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,170
how many people are on that base and they certainly don't know each other.

770
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,369
It's comparable to,

771
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,250
if you work for a moderately sized company and you go to an office, you don't know,

772
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,010
95% of the people you see.

773
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:28,609
Right.

774
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,089
And you just assume if they're in the building, they probably belong here

775
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:33,739
as

776
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,250
long as they don't look homeless.

777
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,589
It depends who you work for. Kurt.

778
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:44,910
So we'll let that, we'll let that go even. And so they, they march themselves

779
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,310
into the giant data storage warehouse

780
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,369
and they basically just get in.

781
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:52,510
Right. It's

782
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,619
minimal security in that

783
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,650
which you think you need like at least a badge system where you're coming in.

784
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,140
You say there's minimal security and yet we see

785
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:07,020
like storm troopers and robots and stuff constantly stomping around

786
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,790
useful security. They clearly have plenty of security theater.

787
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,459
Yeah, because, like, later on when they,

788
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,880
they, they decide that they're being attacked and they, you know,

789
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,300
there's storm troopers running everywhere.

790
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,030
So they have, like, quick reaction forces that are

791
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:19,130
the

792
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,449
walkers show up. Right. They have

793
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:24,130
come out, it's like, where the heck were those things?

794
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,670
I mean, they have like, a garage full of them behind the tree or like?

795
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:28,989
Right.

796
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:31,010
Yeah, because those elevators from the, the,

797
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,099
the surface elevator things were not that they were only like, what, 1020 ft high.

798
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,280
Yeah. Right.

799
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,329
Well, and I guess that also suggests that given the,

800
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:43,709
their ability to respond in force is they, they expected

801
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,550
some level of attack on this facility because if you assumed it was secured

802
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,949
you wouldn't have all of these armaments just kind of waiting.

803
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,160
You know, it's kind of like always in, what is it episode one when they're like,

804
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,280
we're peaceful people and at the end they, like, pull guns out of the chair.

805
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,589
It's like, no peaceful people don't keep guns in their chair. Like, you know,

806
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,359
-- that's not how it works.
-- I remember that. Yeah. Yeah, in the throne room. But

807
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,900
yeah, they have like a little mini armory there and the doors, you know,

808
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,089
those doors emergency seal, like,

809
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,010
you know, and it's like a 20 ft

810
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:16,050
tall door and it seals in less than a second.

811
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:19,680
There's

812
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:19,969
some,

813
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,459
we'll say there's some inconsistencies in, in these movies and maybe it's,

814
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,319
-- you
-- know, back to Theodore Roosevelt, you know, uh,

815
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:30,760
-- walk softly but carry like a really big stick,
-- carry a giant blaster.

816
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:31,739
Yeah.

817
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,670
And, and so, ok, let's not get stuck here because

818
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,400
they go

819
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:37,199
into the vault,

820
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:41,520
they just go into the vault control room and, like, shoot it up.

821
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,520
Well, they don't shoot it. The robot

822
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,479
hacks the system

823
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:49,219
-- and then they
-- hit the guy in the head and then

824
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,689
it's later on where some stormtroopers come in and they get shot. Right.

825
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:53,270
You're right.

826
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:54,849
And, well,

827
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:58,270
the robot does knock some people out again just by hitting them in the head.

828
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,770
-- So
-- that's gotta be like at a minimum of concussion.

829
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,689
You know,

830
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,949
I assume they're dead

831
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,310
because they got hit in the head.

832
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,629
I mean, that's, it's safe to say the ST tropper gets hit in the head. They, they die.

833
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:15,309
And I, again, that's the one thing they're consistent through.

834
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,608
Well, all the Star, all the Star Wars movies,

835
00:34:17,618 --> 00:34:21,467
like the one consistent point is stormtroopers get hit by something and they die,

836
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:21,868
right?

837
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:24,878
All the things they have. Inconsistency.

838
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:26,029
That's not one of them.

839
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:29,049
So, ok, so the robot hacks a computer they get.

840
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:29,197
Now,

841
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,908
now this is the thing that rogue one came

842
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,447
out around Christmas time and I saw it very recently

843
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:37,908
and I, I waited along, I'm not a huge movie person,

844
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,388
so I'm not one of those people who has to run out and see it, but I remember

845
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:43,878
there were all these comments on Twitter when it came out talking about,

846
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,300
you know, essentially like data exfiltration and proper authentication and,

847
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,280
and some of this stuff.

848
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,679
And I would say

849
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,478
that

850
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,199
ignoring the crap security to enter the facility,

851
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:56,840
like

852
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:58,889
the security they seem to have there,

853
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:02,959
I would say is acceptable where you have all of these tapes in their instance,

854
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:06,679
which whatever will we, we will ignore that as, as a poor storage medium.

855
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,310
But they have all these tapes and they have clearly

856
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,649
some sort of control room that's designed to work the table

857
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,600
well, and, and you had to manually control the tape retrieval.

858
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,260
Like you literally had to like drive the little robot over to the tape you wanted,

859
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:20,659
which

860
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,459
is done. And

861
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,540
well, and what's weird is they had like, no, they had like an index of code names,

862
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,189
which is good because, you know, like what's, what's purple monkey?

863
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:33,340
I don't know, maybe it's a destroyer, maybe it's tomorrow's lunch menu.

864
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,179
-- Like, I don't know,
-- that's

865
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,419
just good planning because when you're working on a project,

866
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,060
you should never call it what it's supposed to be because it could be renamed

867
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,600
or a, another one that'll happen is,

868
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:46,169
you know,

869
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:48,169
I if you have your code name for something and you

870
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,590
end up with like three or four revisions of it,

871
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,790
it can make it very difficult to, to decide like this is something, version two,

872
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,260
this is something,

873
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,709
version three where you just had different code names for them all.

874
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,179
And it simplifies things substantially. So I get that, that makes sense.

875
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:05,080
Well, and I know the military too when they generate code names,

876
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,340
they also make sure it doesn't have something to do with it because in World War

877
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,870
two there was a couple of incidents where they generated code names and it was like,

878
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:12,070
whoops, that actually describes what this does,

879
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:17,699
right? Like giant sphere of death would be a bad code name for the death star. Right.

880
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:20,530
Yeah. And they let the guy pick the code name, you know, Stardust.

881
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,810
So the, the daughter's like,

882
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,139
oh, I know that's, that's me.

883
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,969
And it's like if they just picked a random code word,

884
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,399
they would have never found the damn tape.

885
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:30,580
Uh Yes, that, that part is correct.

886
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,340
However, the movie would be much less interesting

887
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:39,679
if they had no idea how to find the tape. And that was a unique way. I think to kind of tie

888
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,959
the beginning of the movie with her interaction with her father into the end.

889
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,899
So I think from its storytelling perspective, that is quite fine

890
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,540
and I think from a security perspective it's uh whatever, right.

891
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:53,889
Then they go, they end up having to go into the data vault,

892
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:54,620
right.

893
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,209
Which is silly.

894
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:00,070
You, you'd think they, what they, they shoot the glass right to, to break it.

895
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,790
And you'd think like if, if, if the weapon of choice in your universe is a blaster.

896
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,620
You would assume there's something like blaster proof glass,

897
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,459
-- right?
-- Or at least blaster resistance.

898
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,590
-- Right.
-- Yeah. Like more than one shot we'll say it should take

899
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,000
or like, you know?

900
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,020
Yeah,

901
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:17,620
because blasters shoot stuff like walls and it's

902
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:19,179
not like they punch big holes in them.

903
00:37:19,189 --> 00:37:23,530
-- They rarely do. Actually, they usually hit a wall and leave a black mark.
-- Right.

904
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,800
So that's a good point is why is it breaking the glass?

905
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,939
Well, again, storytelling, story, plot, whatever.

906
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:31,340
But regardless if,

907
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,459
if you're building a facility that's meant to hold secure data

908
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,699
and it has a window that you can see the data.

909
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:39,409
-- Uh make sure you, like buy the nice glass. Right?
-- Don't

910
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:39,449
you

911
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:40,040
on

912
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:40,340
it

913
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,280
and see

914
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:41,830
bars

915
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:46,350
up. This is leading up, I think to, I think I've figured out the problem. So, but

916
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:46,739
anyway,

917
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,469
go into the data fault and there's a lot of wind and air noise and stuff going on.

918
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:51,780
Right.

919
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:54,280
And at the top there's these like,

920
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:58,030
I'm assuming air vents that are opening and closing like every one or two seconds.

921
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,360
Right.

922
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,939
And I'm not at

923
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,909
all like everything. I, I know, I, I'll admit, I don't know a lot about HVAC

924
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,939
heating, ventilation, air conditioning.

925
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,090
But yeah, no, that would just mess up the airflow immensely. Right.

926
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,300
-- You just would not do that.
-- But you know what this reminds me of.

927
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,750
Have you ever seen the movie Galaxy Quest

928
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,120
and the aliens?

929
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,139
Build the ship,

930
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:22,659
like the speck of the movie and there's obviously like

931
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:26,000
the ridiculous Hammer Room that it serves no reasonable purpose,

932
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,810
but the aliens built it because it's in the movie.

933
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,709
And like, that's totally what I think of when I see stuff like that.

934
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:35,179
This has happened, you know, World War Two, the, um, America Land, what was it?

935
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,600
A B 24 or a Liberator? Anyways.

936
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,600
And the Russians essentially impounded it and

937
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,120
copied it exactly as much as they could

938
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:45,850
even to the point where there was like an extra r hole that was never used.

939
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,709
It was like a manufacturing mistake,

940
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:51,939
but they were like, you know, so terrified of Stalin and all that, that they like,

941
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:54,739
exactly, you know, we'll put it in the show notes but like literally the,

942
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,820
the Russian, whatever this,

943
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,429
you know, bomber had like an extra, like tiny little hole in the wing because,

944
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,919
well, that's what the spec says. So you better do it.

945
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:04,979
That's brilliant.

946
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:10,080
So, anyways, I think I'm beginning to think part of the problem with the imperium

947
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,159
is

948
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:12,810
they,

949
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:13,389
you know,

950
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,899
people die so often, right?

951
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:19,060
Like, I can only imagine what happens when a storm trooper falls downstairs.

952
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,020
They die, right?

953
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:21,610
They don't even fall

954
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:22,340
down the stairs.

955
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:22,899
I mean,

956
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,340
if they, if they scratch their head too hard, I'm pretty sure they're gonna die

957
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,139
and,

958
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,360
and these facilities quite often seem to catch fire

959
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,500
and blow up and you never see sprinkler systems.

960
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,909
I can't say I've ever seen a sprinkler system in a star war.

961
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,020
And so maybe

962
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,229
they have a really aggressive fire code.

963
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,270
How though everything lights on fire all the time.

964
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,590
Well, a really aggressive fire code in the sense of evacuation routes.

965
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,419
But if the stormtroopers

966
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:53,969
falls,

967
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,739
they're gonna die and then you'll have like this massive pile

968
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:58,689
of dead storm

969
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,530
and then you can't get out

970
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,100
-- like
-- all those nightclub fires and casino fires.

971
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:07,229
So maybe that's why none of these windows and doors, you know, they all fail open.

972
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,739
They don't have bars. You can shoot them out easily with your blaster.

973
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,590
It is poor security.

974
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,669
Let's say that, let's say that their physical security is unacceptably bad.

975
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:20,280
And al although maybe they have a bunch of rogue engineers

976
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,600
who hate the empire and so they purposely designed everything terribly

977
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,260
-- and you think at some point they notice this,
-- maybe they have and maybe they're like,

978
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,780
what do we do?

979
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,959
We don't know what to do because the engineers all hate us because we're,

980
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,060
we're terrible people

981
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:32,530
and

982
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:32,679
at

983
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,120
-- the end of their
-- contract, well, as they should,

984
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:37,780
if you design something that's purposely broken.

985
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,209
Right.

986
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:42,020
I mean, when you're working for an evil empire and like, you screw it up on purpose.

987
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,889
The shooting you is pretty much the expected outcome there. Right,

988
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,989
I suppose. Yeah.

989
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,800
Right. Like, I mean, seriously, if I was working for a guy like Darth Vader

990
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,659
and, and I purposely, like, ruined his giant death sphere.

991
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,199
I would expect to die. I, I don't see how there's like, any other option there.

992
00:40:59,219 --> 00:40:59,320
Yeah.

993
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,939
-- I mean,
-- no, I must say too.

994
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:02,639
That's one other thing,

995
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:06,719
one other nit pick just because I can is that Darth Vader lived on a lava planet.

996
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:08,850
I would expect Darth Vader to, like,

997
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,870
fall into some sort of ptsd like syndrome as soon as he sees lava.

998
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:14,479
I mean, like, like, seriously,

999
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:18,520
right. Darth Vader and lava, I suspect are not friends.

1000
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,020
Why would you live on a lava plants?

1001
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,360
Like Captain Hook and the, uh, the crocodile,

1002
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,600
-- it
-- would be like him living with the crocodile.

1003
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,439
Right? Like, it would be some sort of sitcom. And so anyway, anyway, that's my, like,

1004
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:31,889
I, I know again, I've ignored many plot holes, but that's one that I'm like,

1005
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,360
this is ridiculous.

1006
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:37,679
You, you know, anyway, anyway, so back to the facility sucks.

1007
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:40,750
They get the tape, they bring it to the top, which again,

1008
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,719
there's apparently some sort of wireless transmitter at the top.

1009
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:43,969
There's

1010
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:46,844
a, at the top of it and I'm ok with that.

1011
00:41:46,854 --> 00:41:51,004
That makes sort of sense and you might want to put it high up because, you know,

1012
00:41:51,014 --> 00:41:53,564
so you can get it as high over the horizon as possible.

1013
00:41:53,574 --> 00:41:54,804
Get a little bit more view.

1014
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,885
What I don't understand is the controls

1015
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:00,725
to manipulate it and change the orientation are

1016
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,229
-- on like a walkway that sticks out like 100 ft into the air,
-- right?

1017
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:07,300
And this can only be explained by the, like,

1018
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,489
idiot aliens watching movies and designing the, the interactions.

1019
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,090
Yeah,

1020
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:15,060
because why would you need to see this thing to orient it?

1021
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,300
It's not like you're manually pointing this thing at a,

1022
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,370
this is something where you basically have a, you, you tell a computer,

1023
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:22,435
I want you to point it at this thing over here.

1024
00:42:22,445 --> 00:42:23,665
There's a bunch of orbital

1025
00:42:24,185 --> 00:42:24,844
information.

1026
00:42:25,225 --> 00:42:25,645
Let's face

1027
00:42:25,824 --> 00:42:25,995
it again.

1028
00:42:26,274 --> 00:42:28,945
If you have ships

1029
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:32,885
in orbit directly above you, like, you don't need to point it at the ship.

1030
00:42:32,895 --> 00:42:38,655
It, that ship is gonna pick up a massive dish, like blasting a signal out into space,

1031
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:38,905
right?

1032
00:42:38,915 --> 00:42:42,375
You could point that thing at the ground and that ship is probably gonna pick it up.

1033
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,310
Well, and,

1034
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,739
and here's one of the few areas where Star Wars

1035
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,790
is consistent in that they don't have targeting computers.

1036
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:50,129
I think you're right.

1037
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:54,600
E every single scene where you see shooting like on the Millennium Falcon

1038
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:58,830
or the tie fighters or the X wing fighters, they're always,

1039
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,580
you know, they, they have their little

1040
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,340
BB, you know, thing kind of moving around, you know,

1041
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,020
and like target lock and then they shoot, but,

1042
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,459
you know, realistically if you have like targeting technology,

1043
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:10,459
you're gonna strap, put it in a missile and like be like missile,

1044
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:11,699
go kill that thing over there.

1045
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:13,459
I don't care where it goes, just kill it.

1046
00:43:14,169 --> 00:43:16,860
But it's weird that they can have robots that are, like, self aware,

1047
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,060
they can see their environment and interact with their environment and, like,

1048
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,580
not like you never see a robot walking into a wall or into somebody.

1049
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:24,969
-- They
-- clearly don't have radar.

1050
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,899
That's the only explanation for them.

1051
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,709
But I'm kind of wondering if they have like, this weird,

1052
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:35,659
you know, they have this weird missing gap of technology of like, target, like,

1053
00:43:35,669 --> 00:43:36,679
target computers,

1054
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:40,270
right? Like, here's a, I'm here something over there.

1055
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,639
I wanna kill that thing over there.

1056
00:43:41,649 --> 00:43:44,330
Like, what do I, you know, how do I point my gun over there?

1057
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,959
You know, this is something that the navy solved back in the, uh, like,

1058
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:52,560
you know, this was, um, solved with mechanical computers back in World War One.

1059
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,310
Which funny enough is where the,

1060
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,719
the name computer came from because it was a device that computed

1061
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,590
and it was

1062
00:43:58,729 --> 00:43:59,300
physical.

1063
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:02,870
-- We should
-- probably put a link because there's just amazing us

1064
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:05,310
Navy films online from like World War Two where they,

1065
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,870
they actually show how these devices work and like, it's just an insane

1066
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,629
mechanical contraption. I

1067
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,070
-- think
-- I have some pictures actually where I was at a museum

1068
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,540
and it was, it was showing up the computer from World War Two and I'm like,

1069
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,709
that's awesome.

1070
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,050
The fire director and all that stuff. So,

1071
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:21,989
you know, I mean, the,

1072
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,879
the reality is people have been building mechanical computers so that

1073
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:27,729
you can shoot from a moving ship to another moving ship.

1074
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:31,719
Your ship is not only moving, but it's like rolling around in the, we, you know,

1075
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:32,939
in the, in the water

1076
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:33,969
and,

1077
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,179
you know, they're reliably hitting these things, you know,

1078
00:44:36,189 --> 00:44:38,729
a couple of miles away with, you know, guns,

1079
00:44:39,419 --> 00:44:41,560
the shoot in an arc. And, um,

1080
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,959
yeah, so I, I just wonder like if that's, maybe there's

1081
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,320
that, it's just like gravity. It's just one of the rules of that universe.

1082
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,949
They

1083
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,800
-- along with their aggressive, you know, evacuation fire code.
-- They have a I though.

1084
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:54,560
And

1085
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,689
so this is one thing actually that I, I love Star Trek.

1086
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,879
I'm a huge Star Trek nerd.

1087
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:09,600
And I find that in Star Trek they try really hard to get the science like this right

1088
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,750
where they try not to have too many inconsistencies

1089
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,879
and it's clear in Star Wars they don't care

1090
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,239
because none of it makes sense

1091
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,909
and, and rightly so rightly. So it's not my,

1092
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:26,860
it's not my universe. I've made zero movies. So we'll, we'll let it go for now.

1093
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:27,659
But so anyway, all right.

1094
00:45:27,669 --> 00:45:32,379
So, so back on task, they, they get the data, they get it into the transmitter,

1095
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,590
they transmit it up into space.

1096
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,679
-- It's picked up,
-- they have to

1097
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,870
-- knock the shield down first,
-- they knocked the shield down by, by

1098
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:42,350
ruining two giant spaceships that crash into the.

1099
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:46,239
Here's the thing, I don't get, one of the spaceships was disabled by some sort of

1100
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:52,080
cannons can take up. Basically, they disable something for a period of time.

1101
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,189
According to the X wing video game, I was

1102
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:54,580
talking

1103
00:45:55,879 --> 00:46:00,080
the um so the star destroyer, big ship dead in the water, so to speak,

1104
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,860
floating around and the guys floating next to them aren't like, oh,

1105
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,830
that could be a problem.

1106
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,379
Maybe we should give them a bit of room

1107
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:10,419
or maybe we should like, push them out of the way or, I don't know, but like something,

1108
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:11,300
you know, and then the, the,

1109
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:14,929
the rebels use a little corvette to push it into the other ship and it's

1110
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,310
reasonable. And

1111
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,330
-- that's what I totally
-- believe it's a big

1112
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:19,629
flying hunk of mass.

1113
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,469
But the point is that the other ship didn't do something about this, like,

1114
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,580
maybe push back.

1115
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:26,790
-- I don't know. I'm gonna let that one. They have tractor
-- beams,

1116
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:28,639
they have tractor beams,

1117
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,379
they do have tractor beams

1118
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:35,179
because they use them in episode four. But do they use them anywhere else?

1119
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,459
Well, if episode four is only a few hours afterwards,

1120
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:42,120
-- but the tractor beam is on the death star also. I
-- don't. True.

1121
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:44,979
-- Maybe it requires a ton of power and only works on small things.
-- Right.

1122
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,050
-- Right.
-- Ok. You know what?

1123
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:47,860
Let's ignore

1124
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:48,110
that.

1125
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:48,939
Let's ignore this.

1126
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,540
They, they get the data, they put it in the transmitter,

1127
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,790
it's transmitted up to a ship in orbit.

1128
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,219
Right.

1129
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,010
Then they put it on some sort of data storage,

1130
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:00,020
uh,

1131
00:47:00,209 --> 00:47:00,820
card

1132
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,689
it it looked like a card and that's fine.

1133
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:05,419
Whatever, it doesn't matter what it is, it's kind of kind of a moot point,

1134
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:07,419
-- robust
-- military grade storage.

1135
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,379
Now, this is a thing though that they,

1136
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:12,659
they put it on that and then they try to get that the plans,

1137
00:47:12,669 --> 00:47:16,219
they try to get them carried away as quickly as possible, like physically removed.

1138
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:20,219
And this is where you would think you'd want to transmit them

1139
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,020
like

1140
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,100
everywhere.

1141
00:47:22,649 --> 00:47:25,820
Maybe they don't want the, the imperial

1142
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,219
people to know that they have the plans they

1143
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:28,989
have

1144
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:32,010
at that point because they've attacked the planet, they've blown the place up.

1145
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,409
They've

1146
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,290
obviously somebody's been monkeying with your

1147
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,939
data store and there's a physical tape

1148
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:38,350
missing and you know which one it is plans for the death star.

1149
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,260
So it stands to reason that, you know,

1150
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:42,199
they should be able to figure out something happening

1151
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:42,739
in

1152
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,209
the very beginning of episode four.

1153
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:50,379
Darth Vader is looking for the plans like they know what has happened here, right?

1154
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,689
And I must say at the end when Darth Vader

1155
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:55,320
is like beating people up trying to get those plans,

1156
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:55,879
that's,

1157
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,840
that's a pretty solid scene for what it's worth it.

1158
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,399
-- It was, it was entertaining
-- to watch the

1159
00:48:00,189 --> 00:48:00,449
movie.

1160
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:00,600
Yeah.

1161
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,199
Yeah. Yeah,

1162
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,659
which is very similar to the beginning of episode four.

1163
00:48:03,669 --> 00:48:05,800
Then where Darth Vader kind of comes through the door and

1164
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:08,070
just everybody dies.

1165
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,399
You know what it is?

1166
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:13,810
No character with a cape ever dies from blasters.

1167
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,100
The dude with the white cape, doesn't he fall to his death?

1168
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:18,879
Does he

1169
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:23,669
fall? He does fall. And I guess if that didn't kill him, the, the giant

1170
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,790
death ray certainly did.

1171
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,100
Yeah.

1172
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:27,959
So

1173
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,229
that's why,

1174
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,610
because there are those high level storm troopers

1175
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,790
that have capes and they seem to do,

1176
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,979
ok, if I remember correctly,

1177
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,270
the red ones or whatever.

1178
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,610
Well, there's the emperor's guards which I think

1179
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:39,810
are

1180
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:40,340
storm

1181
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:41,229
troopers.

1182
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:43,020
Maybe they have blaster proof capes

1183
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:44,050
have capes.

1184
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:48,110
But much like, say the Incredibles, they've realized that capes, you know, that,

1185
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,530
that's an expert level thing.

1186
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,639
Like, you know, that thing gets sucked into a, uh,

1187
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:55,620
-- a turbo engine or something and you're done for
-- capes are dangerous.

1188
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:56,459
Yeah.

1189
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:59,649
Well, it's just doors, man. God, how annoying would that be? Right?

1190
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:03,080
You know, you're trying to make a grand entrance and like, blink, you know,

1191
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,570
your cape stuck in the door.

1192
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,550
I've never worn a cape in my daily life. So I, I can't say

1193
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,550
-- I've
-- done ballroom, uh, dancing and, you know,

1194
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,389
with partners who had to wear ballroom gowns and like,

1195
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:18,949
there's a reason you have a little girl carrying the train of the dress

1196
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:20,699
and there's a reason you, like,

1197
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:23,389
push the chair for the ladies because the dress is so massive.

1198
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:25,600
They have to like, spend all their time controlling it.

1199
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,479
They, they can't open a door for themselves physically.

1200
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:31,129
It's, it's like impossible. It would get stuck in the door.

1201
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:33,239
So maybe that's why nobody escapes in the, uh,

1202
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,540
but all their doors are like convenience store doors, you know,

1203
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,729
like they slide open and then they slide closed.

1204
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:38,129
So,

1205
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:38,320
uh,

1206
00:49:38,469 --> 00:49:39,530
this makes no sense.

1207
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:40,139
Well, and,

1208
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:42,550
and this is actually something someone has pointed out at

1209
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,219
some point is that in the Star Wars movies,

1210
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,979
there's never been a door that just opens. They're all crazy doors.

1211
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,590
Yeah, that's true.

1212
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,399
Yep. All right. So

1213
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:56,189
what, and the, the, the data also, here's the thing

1214
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,030
as, as I understand it, everybody

1215
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:04,449
encrypts their data when they write it to tape because tapes go missing all the time.

1216
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,979
You know, encrypt the data on the tape.

1217
00:50:08,229 --> 00:50:11,250
Obviously not because they beamed it up to orbit and were able to

1218
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:11,560
consume

1219
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:16,689
the transmission device had the ability to decrypt the tape.

1220
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:20,649
But I also feel like their plan was to steal the tape and then leave

1221
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:26,050
whereas the transmission was plan B. So I think it's probably safe to say

1222
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,409
they, but again,

1223
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:33,959
why would you necessarily need to encrypt data that's meant to be on a secured planet

1224
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:35,530
in a secure data

1225
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:36,239
vault?

1226
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,860
Yeah.

1227
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:38,340
Ok.

1228
00:50:38,629 --> 00:50:40,649
-- It
-- also
-- makes swiping media easier, right?

1229
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:42,459
Because you just have to crypto shred the keys.

1230
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:43,340
You don't actually have to, like,

1231
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,179
wipe the whole tape because I've had that happen where,

1232
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:50,489
like I've had a hard drive in my file server die enough that I, you know,

1233
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,580
can't reasonably wipe it.

1234
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:56,090
But at the same time I can't, you know, use it

1235
00:50:57,229 --> 00:50:58,629
so I can't wipe the drive.

1236
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,229
So it's like, ok, good thing that, you know,

1237
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,409
it's all encrypted anyways because it's,

1238
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,449
-- you know. Right.
-- And you just need to wipe the first

1239
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,969
one K or something.

1240
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:07,879
Yeah.

1241
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,399
You know, the, the, on the route partition.

1242
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:12,050
So, yeah, I mean, and again,

1243
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,080
maybe that's just something missing from this universe.

1244
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:16,520
Maybe they just don't have encryption

1245
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,120
because they're intercepting each other's transmissions all the time.

1246
00:51:20,129 --> 00:51:23,669
You know, sir, we've intercepted a transmission. How often does that phrase occur

1247
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:24,830
in all of these movies?

1248
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:30,080
Because in, in episode five, they talk about a coded signal,

1249
00:51:30,449 --> 00:51:32,800
coded but maybe not encrypted.

1250
00:51:32,939 --> 00:51:35,120
Like, maybe they're using like a word substitution thing, you know,

1251
00:51:35,129 --> 00:51:38,320
like I would like a box of cannolis.

1252
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,879
Did the word encrypted exist

1253
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,760
back then?

1254
00:51:42,439 --> 00:51:45,629
Did the word encrypted exist when they made episode five?

1255
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,110
Oh,

1256
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:46,530
yeah.

1257
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,820
Well, not in the popular vernacular.

1258
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:52,699
That's true. So it wouldn't have made sense and you would say coded.

1259
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,959
So that was kind of my assumption

1260
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:58,239
is the coded message from the spy droid

1261
00:51:58,629 --> 00:52:02,229
was just an encrypted message and they couldn't do anything with it.

1262
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,969
Well, the other advantage too is, right?

1263
00:52:03,979 --> 00:52:07,659
It's like GP G, if you're the only people using GP G, you stick out like a sore thumb,

1264
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:08,449
right?

1265
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,090
You know, and that's, I remember reading uh there was a,

1266
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,879
um a set of slides and apparently the NSA was

1267
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:15,860
like we love GP G because the only people using it

1268
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,929
are either so crazy that we ignore them or legitimately

1269
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:20,620
like we need to go keep an eye on them.

1270
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:23,810
And the beauty is there's all that metadata of who's talking to who,

1271
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,909
which is kind of mostly what we want anyway,

1272
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:28,110
this is where signals gotta be a nightmare for these

1273
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,610
guys because like tons of people are using it now.

1274
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:35,250
-- And so you can't say anyone using signal is probably up to no good
-- true. But

1275
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,969
uh does signal give away metadata like who's talking to who or is it?

1276
00:52:38,979 --> 00:52:41,449
We're all just talking to the signal mothership and then God

1277
00:52:41,584 --> 00:52:42,524
knows what's happening.

1278
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:43,364
No, no.

1279
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:47,445
If you're spying on the data as it's over the wire,

1280
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,415
you could certainly tell who's talking to who,

1281
00:52:49,425 --> 00:52:51,604
but they don't store anything like that on the server.

1282
00:52:51,614 --> 00:52:51,985
OK.

1283
00:52:51,995 --> 00:52:55,185
Well, no, what I mean is, is the, is, for example, if we talk on signal,

1284
00:52:55,195 --> 00:52:56,965
am I talking directly to you or am I talking

1285
00:52:56,975 --> 00:52:58,604
to the signal server that is talking to you?

1286
00:52:58,614 --> 00:53:02,145
My understanding is you're talking to the signal server but they don't log it,

1287
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:03,360
right?

1288
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:04,120
So then in that case,

1289
00:53:04,129 --> 00:53:07,189
it would be you'd have a harder time matching up those connection pairs,

1290
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,100
right? Because you have a whole bunch of people talking at the same time,

1291
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:11,889
you know,

1292
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:13,219
but I mean,

1293
00:53:13,229 --> 00:53:16,239
there's statistical analysis you can do with that and they've done in the past to um,

1294
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,840
identify command and control servers and, you know, other

1295
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:19,129
Tor

1296
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,810
users where they, like, shut down parts of the Tor network.

1297
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:24,739
Oh, he's still talking, ok, he's not on that part, you know,

1298
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,639
to narrow down kind of who's talking to who.

1299
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,379
So,

1300
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:30,409
yeah, so maybe, ok, I'll buy it, you know,

1301
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,929
this is a universe with A I and self aware robots

1302
00:53:32,939 --> 00:53:36,070
that don't bump into doors but they don't have targeting computers

1303
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:39,090
and they don't have like good data encryption.

1304
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:41,209
Sure, why not?

1305
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,429
That seems plausible at best.

1306
00:53:43,439 --> 00:53:46,560
-- And, and I will say that
-- because they also have spinny computer interfaces.

1307
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,540
Like you physically, this is what it never made sense.

1308
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:49,810
You plug a thing in

1309
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:51,050
and then spin it back and forth.

1310
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,270
Well, it makes perfect sense because when you're telling the story, you know,

1311
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,969
if the thing is spinning around something's happening.

1312
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:57,689
Whereas

1313
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,810
imagine if like Archie D two rolled up, he took out his USB plug,

1314
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,169
plugged in and just sat there for five minutes and be like,

1315
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,530
what's going on like this sucks, you know.

1316
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,580
Yeah.

1317
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,550
So it's, it's, they have this weird mix of sort of electro

1318
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,979
mechanical computing going on, right?

1319
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:14,639
Like they have tapes instead of you would assume

1320
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:16,770
they have some sort of solid state memory,

1321
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,370
you know, diamond crystal storage type deal going on with no, because let's face it.

1322
00:54:21,379 --> 00:54:23,639
-- Right. Computers with moving parts
-- suck

1323
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,060
computers with moving parts on a saltwater planet, right?

1324
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,389
-- With
-- humidity.

1325
00:54:30,389 --> 00:54:31,530
Yeah, with humidity.

1326
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:33,550
Yeah. It's got to be ridiculous

1327
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:34,229
without

1328
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:34,350
a,

1329
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:36,500
I can't imagine the failure rate

1330
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,879
and, like, and all of their stuff is outside,

1331
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:40,780
like the master switch for the communications thing.

1332
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,409
It's like that outdoor terminal. So

1333
00:54:42,919 --> 00:54:45,770
it must rain there because there's like trees and, you know,

1334
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,280
lots of lush vegetation,

1335
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:50,070
-- but
-- they're surrounded by water. Maybe it doesn't rain.

1336
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,489
Were there any clouds in the sky? I don't, I don't remember

1337
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:53,129
there were,

1338
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,169
were there? Ok.

1339
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,169
Uh,

1340
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,040
yeah. Anyway,

1341
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,899
-- so,
-- I mean, all this stuff has got to be regularized and

1342
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:04,540
clearly we come back to the point that the Star

1343
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:10,320
Wars Universe has so many scientific inconsistencies that it's comical,

1344
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:10,600
I guess.

1345
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:10,850
But I,

1346
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,919
I guess at the same point at the same time if you're going to make up the universe,

1347
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:18,080
you have to either be Star Trek where you're

1348
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,760
consistent to the point of ridiculous

1349
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,540
or Star Wars where you're like, eh, whatever.

1350
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:27,399
Yeah, we need, we need to switch and, and some guys need to flip it and, uh,

1351
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:29,340
they're getting shot while they're doing it right.

1352
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:31,659
Like, ok, sure. Put it over there,

1353
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:35,379
you know, it, I kind of get it, you know, and it's like we need, uh,

1354
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:37,419
data and we wanted to steal it and, uh,

1355
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:40,129
let's climb something and maybe they go through a hole

1356
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:42,580
that's opening or closing or something to be dangerous.

1357
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,860
And then, uh,

1358
00:55:44,419 --> 00:55:48,169
-- you know, the bad guy shoots them. This
-- fundamentally is the reason I hate,

1359
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:53,709
one of the reasons I should say I hate Star Wars is there is so much forced, like,

1360
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:54,370
du

1361
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,709
du du, you know, there's so much forced

1362
00:55:56,939 --> 00:56:00,169
fake risk and danger where, like, clearly

1363
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:04,820
-- that character is not going to die because he's Harrison Ford.
-- Now, remember

1364
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:10,899
you can tell Kurt how wrong he is using the Pound Os S podcast hashtag on Twitter.

1365
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,500
Hey, if it's any consolation, I also hate Star Trek.

1366
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:15,820
Uh, that's fine.

1367
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:20,780
I, I don't, I have no ill will towards people who like, or dislike Star Trek.

1368
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,199
Well, they have replicators and then from there it just goes downhill for me and

1369
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:24,780
transporters.

1370
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:27,340
Replicators are the best and transporters and

1371
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,040
replicators are basically the same thing.

1372
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,820
Right. It's, it's just how it is

1373
00:56:31,229 --> 00:56:31,699
and

1374
00:56:31,919 --> 00:56:35,560
I'm, it's ok. You cannot like Star Trek. I have no problem with that.

1375
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,260
However, if you want to talk about crap security,

1376
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,169
we should talk about Star Trek security someday.

1377
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:40,689
It is.

1378
00:56:41,229 --> 00:56:41,310
It's just

1379
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:41,729
keep

1380
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:42,439
going

1381
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:43,100
missing,

1382
00:56:43,489 --> 00:56:46,840
like POF he's missing and the computer knows it's like computer. Where's captain

1383
00:56:46,979 --> 00:56:48,459
Pard? He is not on the ship,

1384
00:56:48,669 --> 00:56:50,300
don't you think that's a problem?

1385
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:51,340
Exactly.

1386
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,699
You think the computer would have like some sort of, you know,

1387
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:56,659
maybe alerting mechanism that if the captain disappears,

1388
00:56:56,669 --> 00:56:59,100
then it should say something.

1389
00:56:59,379 --> 00:56:59,860
Right.

1390
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,500
Well, especially since it's a consistent problem.

1391
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,100
I know,

1392
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,350
-- like, how many times do these people get killed?
-- We're not talking

1393
00:57:07,459 --> 00:57:10,739
about this. This is No, not right now. We're nearly done.

1394
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,739
We've been complaining about Star Trek for, for nearly an hour now.

1395
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:14,600
Star

1396
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,810
Wars. Sorry,

1397
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,879
I know, man, I do this all the time. I'm getting confused, but that's ok. That's ok.

1398
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:22,955
So, so I guess here's what it comes down to is people complaining about

1399
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:27,014
the operational security problems of rogue one

1400
00:57:27,135 --> 00:57:30,455
and talking about the data X fill and they should have had authentication and blah,

1401
00:57:30,465 --> 00:57:31,254
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1402
00:57:31,455 --> 00:57:34,094
And I would say that inside of the facility,

1403
00:57:34,304 --> 00:57:36,175
the security was acceptable.

1404
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,810
The problem is

1405
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,659
they let a ship land next to the facility and they clearly had poor security to

1406
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,620
get in because even if they had some sort of key card that the bad guys,

1407
00:57:47,629 --> 00:57:50,830
well, they get good guys whoever you, which, whichever side you're on here.

1408
00:57:50,939 --> 00:57:53,280
If you, if, if, even if they had key cards,

1409
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:56,419
the rebels stole and they used to get into the facility,

1410
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:59,459
you should still not be able to get into the

1411
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:04,760
data warehouse without some sort of multiple layers of security

1412
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:06,659
that get you in there. So in reality,

1413
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,629
rogue one isn't an information security problem.

1414
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,590
-- It is a physical security problem.
-- Yeah. Well, an operational security.

1415
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,629
Well, these guys are a bunch of idiots. I mean, let's just face it. Right.

1416
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:19,350
Like they don't know how to do this.

1417
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:25,090
Maybe this is an institutional and cultural hangover from when they all the,

1418
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,610
all the stormtroopers were clones.

1419
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,149
And thus trustworthy

1420
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,510
because let's face it. Right. If you're all.

1421
00:58:30,689 --> 00:58:33,159
No, no, absolutely not. And

1422
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,729
why would you allow a random ship to even land? Then why not?

1423
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:40,159
Just like, seal the whole freaking planet in the shield and be like, nobody comes in,

1424
00:58:40,169 --> 00:58:41,040
nobody gets out.

1425
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:42,560
-- What's the point of
-- it

1426
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:42,840
then?

1427
00:58:42,929 --> 00:58:46,679
Because you have a bunch of disposable people running the place?

1428
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:49,399
No. But what was the point of the base on the planet then

1429
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,139
I assume their data, that's their backup facility, right?

1430
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:55,360
Like you've got all this data you need backed up, let's put it somewhere safe.

1431
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:56,560
Ok?

1432
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:59,419
Because I wasn't really clear on that. Like it wasn't an engineering base.

1433
00:58:59,429 --> 00:59:03,760
-- It wasn't, I was
-- just my assumption is it, it's a data warehouse, right?

1434
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:07,399
You, you have, it's, it's like Amazon Glacier, right?

1435
00:59:07,689 --> 00:59:10,040
-- So
-- it's their off site data backup facility.

1436
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:11,780
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

1437
00:59:11,899 --> 00:59:13,280
And that way when you need data,

1438
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,429
you can get it and again having it even offline and needing humans.

1439
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:18,629
So let's say you need the death star plans, Darth Vader.

1440
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:22,899
Like, hey, I, I need the plans for the giant, you know, sphere of death I built.

1441
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,899
Uh Could you send them to me, please?

1442
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:26,149
And you would need,

1443
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:31,449
like a person would have to acquire the tape and then transmit them

1444
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,639
to their evil overlord. Like that is a great idea.

1445
00:59:35,649 --> 00:59:37,909
-- That's wonderful security from that perspective.
-- It's

1446
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:38,500
an

1447
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:38,919
air gap.

1448
00:59:39,649 --> 00:59:40,030
Exactly.

1449
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:44,300
That's perfect. That's exactly what you want.

1450
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,800
Yep. I agree, man,

1451
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:53,100
-- they just should have put some bars in the doors and maybe put a lock or two on.
-- Right.

1452
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,850
Right. That would have made a huge difference. And

1453
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,040
maybe,

1454
00:59:57,159 --> 01:00:01,840
maybe if you have a giant transmitter, you don't put a tape reader,

1455
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:07,080
like at the base of it make them, you know, bring it to the transmitter room

1456
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:08,330
at the bottom

1457
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,949
-- or, or something.
-- Right. Because one thing

1458
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:14,590
we talk about two fa but if, if they're all clones,

1459
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:15,419
you can't have

1460
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:15,570
you.

1461
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:20,370
No, not biometrics, but you could have a token and a password. Right.

1462
01:00:20,379 --> 01:00:21,570
-- You certainly can't
-- use

1463
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,290
-- all the time.
-- Of course, they lose that stuff. And that's why you have

1464
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,489
the, the two factor. So you still have a unique password in your brain.

1465
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:33,709
And additionally, if it gets lost you,

1466
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,409
-- I would assume they're trained to tell people
-- brain control

1467
01:00:36,419 --> 01:00:38,439
slugs because you'd mentioned that early in the film.

1468
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:42,070
Like, that's such a weird scene. It's not control.

1469
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:46,520
Apparently the big giant slug monster thing was supposed to extract

1470
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:49,030
the information from the pilot to determine if he's a lot,

1471
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,239
uh, telling the truth or not.

1472
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:50,550
Yeah.

1473
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,090
And so maybe that's why they don't rely

1474
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,320
on passwords because if you have like brain sucking

1475
01:00:56,149 --> 01:01:01,080
-- devices or animals then
-- maybe, and that's fair.

1476
01:01:01,439 --> 01:01:02,330
That's fair.

1477
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:03,580
Well, well, is true.

1478
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,169
Right. What's the difference?

1479
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:06,590
Yes, that's correct.

1480
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:10,399
Oh, my goodness. All right. This is

1481
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:15,399
all right. So Empire security, terrible rebel security. Just as bad.

1482
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,600
And I guess fundamentally at the end of the day,

1483
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:21,760
if you have a secret in the Star Wars Universe, uh don't write it down or tell anyone.

1484
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,520
That's, that's the lesson, right? That's the lesson.

1485
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,500
All right, sweet problem solved.

1486
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,189
Ok. Gang, thanks for listening.

1487
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:33,080
I, I appreciate putting up with our insane ramblings for the last uh nearly hour.

1488
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:35,399
And if you want to get a hold of us,

1489
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:38,790
there's the open source security podcast.com website which will

1490
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,439
have the show notes and things such as that.

1491
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:43,350
There is the Pound Os S podcast.

1492
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,389
Hashtag you can use on Twitter to get a hold

1493
01:01:45,399 --> 01:01:47,889
of Kurt or myself with any sort of complaints.

1494
01:01:47,969 --> 01:01:53,399
Remember we, uh, if you like Star Wars and, and Kurt clearly does not let him know.

1495
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,330
I'm sure he'd love to hear all about it.

1496
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:58,229
Uh, direct your hate in his direction, please. Uh, ignore me.

1497
01:01:58,239 --> 01:01:59,229
I think Star Wars is fine

1498
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:02,419
and I have nothing else. Thank you everyone for listening.

1499
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:05,510
You have a fantastic day, Kurt and until next time

1500
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:07,229
everybody stay safe.
