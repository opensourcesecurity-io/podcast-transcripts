Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,869
Kurtz Siefried and my partner and just discussing all sorts of things.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,050
-- Josh Presser. That's literally what
-- we do.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,750
-- Well, we just came up with two shows before the show. We
-- did.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,379
-- I know and we got into a marvelous argument. I would say
-- an argument.

5
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:24,829
-- It's a classical argument.
-- I consider every one of our discussions an argument

6
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,069
a

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:25,569
classical,

8
00:00:25,674 --> 00:00:29,295
which is great because like both of us end up changing our mind or more often than not.

9
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:33,615
-- Oh, this is actually worse than we thought. Yeah,
-- that's the sad truth sometimes.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,854
But that complexity is the thing, right?

11
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:39,375
Like a lot of people don't want to embrace or understand

12
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:41,615
complexity. They're just like, why can't this be simple?

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,235
Well, because it's not, it's like,

14
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,694
it's like every time I see an economics discussion and I'm like,

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,819
economics is hard. Like people are complicated,

16
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,569
money supply M two M one, I don't know,

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,459
we can't just simplify this.

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,340
It's complicated because there's so many people involved.

19
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:56,759
And which is a perfect example.

20
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,290
Today we're gonna talk about passwords and passwords

21
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:02,540
are horrifically complicated to get even remotely,

22
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,939
right.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,099
-- In
-- a very specific context

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,720
and even that is complicated.

25
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:13,339
The 23 and me story has been bananas to say the least. But I think the most interesting

26
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:16,400
point of discussion from it all

27
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:20,480
is the 23 and me leadership are saying

28
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:24,639
all the people who got hacked had terrible passwords, it's not our fault.

29
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:28,260
And then you read stories that were written about this and

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,430
there are security people saying 23 and me are a bunch of idiots. Absolutely not.

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,569
And there's other people that are like,

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,639
-- yeah, how do you defend against crap
-- passwords? So the answer is 23 three and me

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,660
is completely correct

34
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:41,650
and

35
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:46,940
-- 23 and me is also completely wrong.
-- Well, thanks for coming everyone.

36
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:47,720
You're welcome.

37
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,099
So here's the beauty. It again, this is complicated. So,

38
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,330
well, let's start with a bit of disclaimer. So I am a 23 and me customer from ages ago.

39
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:58,940
So I'm your information has been stolen. No, it has not because

40
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,730
this is a perfect example.

41
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:05,029
I'm a security privacy minded jerk who doesn't like sharing,

42
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:08,000
right? So I don't, for example, share my genetic profile.

43
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,860
You didn't click the button. I see.

44
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,710
Are you insane?

45
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,740
But that's the thing.

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,350
People do click that button because they do want to share and they do want to like, oh,

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,110
you have that gene for the asparagus thing or for the diabetes thing.

48
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:22,020
And you're my second cousin removed. And oh, you also did perfect example,

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,910
there's a genetic health problem in my family that like

50
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,520
I had to go get a camera up my butt.

51
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,339
-- Me,
-- everyone our age has to do that. That's

52
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,089
not at the age of 4050

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,639
-- you know,
-- it's

54
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:34,710
45 for colonoscopies here now.

55
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:35,699
Well, it's,

56
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,130
you know, it was anyways.

57
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,580
But the point is like this can actually be really useful

58
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:42,020
information to know that can save your life because for example,

59
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,100
my mom is still alive because she got prompt treatment.

60
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,850
You know, it is nice. I would miss her.

61
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,960
So this is the complexity of. So here's the problem. Fundamentally,

62
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:55,289
passwords can be very weak. You can choose a weak password like 1234,

63
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,050
right?

64
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:59,110
You can also reuse a password which is then exposed and not only

65
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,460
do I know your password potentially through the breach at another site,

66
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,089
but I know that email associated with it.

67
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,539
So now I'm gonna try, you know Joshua

68
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:05,850
press

69
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:06,205
net

70
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:08,494
and the password of whatever your dog's name is

71
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:11,604
plus your kid's birthday because you posted that on social media.

72
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:15,945
-- For example,
-- my dog's name is Atlas. So there you go. Now everyone can do

73
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:19,835
-- me on all the sudden.
-- The problem is passwords can be very weak

74
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,985
and here is where things get complicated.

75
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:22,955
You can

76
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:24,574
make them very strong

77
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:29,410
from both the user's perspective and the provider's perspective that right.

78
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,750
So the user, for example,

79
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,979
can use a password manager and generate a very strong random password for each site.

80
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,690
So even if it gets breached, no big deal, it's just that one

81
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,669
password, right? It should be used anywhere else.

82
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,070
So that is on the user to then be secure that

83
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,350
there's degrees of this.

84
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,529
So for example, when you cross the road,

85
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,246
you need to look both ways and if you don't look both ways that's on you.

86
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,356
But using a password manager and unique passwords,

87
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:53,455
that's a little bit more sophisticated and complicated and it,

88
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,255
it's very sophisticated for normal people.

89
00:03:56,266 --> 00:04:00,055
I, I feel like that is outside of the

90
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:04,615
realm of possibility for at least 80% of the population.

91
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:05,615
And in fairness,

92
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:09,205
companies like Apple are trying to make it easier like in on an Apple mobile device.

93
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:09,895
Now it will suggest

94
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,182
do you want to use a strong password and then it will generate one in store it.

95
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:15,481
And really like, what more can we do?

96
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:18,002
We can't really force people to use password managers.

97
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:21,462
Well, we, we can't use passwords like obviously,

98
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,481
-- but
-- I was about to say again, it's complicated in that.

99
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:26,052
Yeah, actually we can force people to use password managers

100
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,842
because for example, the provider,

101
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:32,441
the site could assign you such a horrifically long, complicated password,

102
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,309
but you can't remember it and that you're forced to write it down,

103
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,179
-- but they
-- won't do that because that's going to create a cost

104
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,540
for the provider because people aren't going to write it down or

105
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,850
run into one or two that do that. And I was pretty impressed.

106
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,519
So, again, this talks to the complexity of it. So, let's assume. Ok.

107
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,019
So basically what the user can do is strong password hygiene,

108
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,109
use a password manager.

109
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,929
And like we agree that that's,

110
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:56,179
that's like people who use their turn signals, it's not going to be everybody.

111
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,299
No, I'm serious. Right.

112
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,230
We can't even get people to use their damn turn signals. I know for sure.

113
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:03,545
Please turn your headlights on at night and by night, I mean,

114
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,105
anything past 430 here where I live in winter.

115
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:07,635
No, I'm serious. Like I

116
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:08,165
know

117
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:11,695
-- it was brutal last night it was snowing and it was dark and it
-- was no,

118
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,345
no headlights are a great example.

119
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:17,464
Right? Because how many times have you started driving?

120
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:19,744
And someone flashed their lights at you and you're like, oh crap,

121
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:21,144
I forgot to turn my headlights on.

122
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:25,075
Literally never because part of my checklist for getting in my car is making sure the

123
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,535
knob is turned all the way to automatic and making sure the lights are on.

124
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,420
It happens. It's happened more than once. Not a lot, but it's happened.

125
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:32,920
Everyone does this, right.

126
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:37,890
This is a really good comparison I think because my suspicion is the vast majority of

127
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:40,329
people without headlights on at night did not

128
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,540
intend to not turn their headlights on.

129
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:45,029
They just forgot because the kid yelled at them or whatever. Right.

130
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,570
There's a million things that can happen.

131
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:49,290
And I think it's the same story with passwords

132
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,649
is no one wants to use a crappy password.

133
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,364
They just don't know better or they forgot or they accidentally did something or,

134
00:05:56,475 --> 00:06:00,165
-- or they're not able to, they have a bad memory. Sure.
-- Sure. There's

135
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:00,904
reasons.

136
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:03,295
-- Right. I,
-- I have a son with autism. He

137
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,114
can't really remember passwords. I thank God for biometrics.

138
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:07,855
-- Right.
-- Right.

139
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:08,174
And, you

140
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:08,304
know,

141
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:08,825
there

142
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:14,644
is man, I feel like blaming users in this context is ridiculous.

143
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,295
I would agree because

144
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:19,834
there is not only I would say the obligation for the provider,

145
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:22,815
especially a provider handling your genetic data,

146
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,739
which is kind of, I think we'll all agree a little bit sensitive,

147
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,540
especially if you ever want to get insurance because I would agree.

148
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,670
For example, in the US,

149
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,190
there's a specific law saying an insurance

150
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,529
carrier cannot deny you coverage based on genetic

151
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,390
testing.

152
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,130
I don't have that law in Canada.

153
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,670
I'm shocked usually Canada is way ahead of us, but

154
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,799
-- I don't have to worry about health insurance.
-- That's

155
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,029
so that's a good

156
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,299
point.

157
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,329
If anything,

158
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,410
your genetic data being in the hands of the the medical system is a benefit,

159
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,739
-- not a negative,
-- right.

160
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,890
I would say not only does 23 me sort of have

161
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:57,589
a moral and ethical obligation to keep customers data safe.

162
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:00,829
Are simple technical controls to do so.

163
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,739
And I'm gonna read them because this is in my mind if you are going to support

164
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,730
user names and passwords, number one, what is the data for?

165
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:11,399
Like if it's like, let's say it's the circle platform at the CS A,

166
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,609
it's our social media platform for intersect discussion.

167
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,730
Yeah, that's not super sensitive. It's all public anyways, right?

168
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,619
Like, so if somebody breaks in your account like, yeah,

169
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,850
it's gonna be kind of annoying but like they're not gonna get you genetic data,

170
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:22,269
right?

171
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,929
So the first thing is kind of what are the, what is the risk level like if it is it,

172
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,440
is it a crypto brokerage or your genetic data or is it like, you know,

173
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:28,799
for?

174
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,660
So number one, I think we can all agree that 23 me is handling sensitive data.

175
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,510
-- It's pretty high on the, I don't want this out
-- list. Exactly.

176
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,040
That's the first thing is what is the risk level and it's high,

177
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,980
very high like damn near 10 out of 10.

178
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:45,690
So this means that I think they have an obligation to do everything possible.

179
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,149
And the thing is there are some very reasonable

180
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,690
and simple things you can do as a provider.

181
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,570
So number one

182
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:53,920
is they should support single sign on and pass

183
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:54,470
keys

184
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,369
and

185
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,779
I

186
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,529
passwords and email are an option but should be discouraged.

187
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,209
And, and I also want to point out that

188
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:05,540
23 and me isn't like some five

189
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,529
person start up,

190
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:09,329
right? This is a real big company.

191
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,209
-- This is a high
-- tech company that does fast genetic sequencing. Like

192
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,000
-- come
-- on.

193
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,250
Even even that honestly, like it's so easy to use single sign on now.

194
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,970
Even if you're a five person start up, you can make it happen.

195
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,260
It's not like it's not like five or 10 years ago where you needed like a

196
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:28,529
-- team of 10 people to get sso to work
-- and going back to what's complicated.

197
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,040
I would also say on the flip side, if you are a major provider that provides some

198
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:31,549
sign in,

199
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,799
you should also be obligated to provide email and password login because

200
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,150
some people do not want to or cannot use single sign on.

201
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:37,880
So

202
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,729
moving along

203
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,169
number two, if you're providing passwords,

204
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,570
you should also support two fa and I mean strong

205
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,130
two fa not S MS but like hardware tokens,

206
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,859
Fido

207
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,460
all that stuff.

208
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:52,750
Number three, if you are still then providing user passwords and user names,

209
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,109
and we're going to assume the user is not sophisticated.

210
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,349
So they're not doing single sign on, they're not doing pas keys,

211
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,380
they're not doing a hardware token, they're not doing two factors

212
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,159
authentication.

213
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:03,929
Then any time a user sets a password,

214
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,729
you need to check it against the have I've been PS list and if it's in there,

215
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:07,609
you don't get to use it.

216
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:08,869
I, I would agree with that.

217
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:12,590
Let me ask, did you, did you make this list up or did you get this from somewhere?

218
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,510
I made this list up

219
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:17,510
this is a topic I've actually been thinking about off and on for a very long time

220
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,840
because I wrote that pas

221
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,440
keys paper and I've spent a lot of time

222
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,989
thinking also about the social implications of authentication.

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,460
Because

224
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,530
to put it bluntly, if you make authentication truly secure, you're going to lock out

225
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,169
a lot of vulnerable people are not gonna be able to use your service for sure.

226
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:31,789
Full stop.

227
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,489
So again, it's these degrees. So

228
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:36,369
if you're gonna offer just a pure user name and password,

229
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:37,450
you need to

230
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,869
check how I've been ped

231
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,409
-- and not let them set that password
-- probably.

232
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:44,159
-- Yeah, I'm ok with that
-- if it's a high security application.

233
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:48,409
So a perfect example, Shake pay just got also breached. I use Shake pay. Lucky me.

234
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,770
I'm just hitting everybody today

235
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:50,330
is Shake.

236
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,250
Shake is a crypto exchange in Canada.

237
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,780
I'm pretty sure it's you guys in Toronto in an apartment building or condo

238
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,539
maybe three. They seem legit

239
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:58,919
ish.

240
00:09:59,690 --> 00:09:59,700
Uh

241
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,500
Anyway, this is not obviously this is not like an endorsement of their product,

242
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:03,869
the

243
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,140
opposite. So they got breached

244
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,679
oopsy doodle.

245
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,900
But here's the thing when I log into shake pay,

246
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,820
I enter my user name and password.

247
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,929
And then I get a thing saying, oh, you know, I don't recognize this IP address,

248
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,820
go check your email

249
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,549
and I have to go check my email for a four digit code

250
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,000
and then plug that in.

251
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,780
So,

252
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,340
yeah,

253
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,049
so,

254
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,479
um, if you are using just pure password and email. Then

255
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,479
in a high security application,

256
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:31,429
I think you have an obligation to send an email saying

257
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,070
like you're trying to log in from a new IP.

258
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,159
Is this you? Yes, cool. If it's not, you

259
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,489
either ignore this or maybe click this button so that we can like,

260
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,200
panic a little bit on your behalf.

261
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,890
Uh Yeah. You know what's funny about that? So I like once a week

262
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:44,809
I get

263
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,690
uh a Facebook reset

264
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,825
uh email and they do have a button that says this wasn't me on the bottom,

265
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:55,335
-- which I appreciate because because
-- now we know that IP address is a bad actor

266
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:57,705
and that, I mean, that's not foolproof because for example,

267
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:01,125
I was actually trying to browse the web on a web blog on

268
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:04,226
my phone and it said basically you're using a VP on your block.

269
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:06,416
And I'm like, well, yeah, I'm on my mobile phone.

270
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,435
So obviously I'm coming from one IP address

271
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,786
that represents like essentially everybody in Alberta,

272
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:14,335
you know, using tell us which is like

273
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,442
a lot of us. So crap. I got to go on my desktop.

274
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:20,081
But I would say these are the minimum things you need to do.

275
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,861
And now having said that if you check the, have I been pulling password,

276
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:25,171
people will basically be forced

277
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,802
to pick a

278
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,361
stronger password that by definition has not really

279
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,521
been seen in a public breach yet,

280
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,401
which is I mean, there's billions of passwords in there.

281
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:33,601
So it's going to be pretty good.

282
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:37,361
And I would say a further thing that I didn't write down on the list is that

283
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,530
you should

284
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:43,450
offer people an instructional page on

285
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:44,849
how to use

286
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,349
the password managers that are built into their devices and software.

287
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,289
So for example,

288
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:49,539
a

289
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,169
link to here's Apple,

290
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,609
here's the link to the Apple page talking about how to use Apple password storage.

291
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,000
Here's a link to the chrome one,

292
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,599
here's a link to the whatever like because I'll be blunt,

293
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,190
how hard is it to do user agent detection and be like, oh,

294
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,130
you're coming from a mobile Apple device.

295
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,409
If you want to learn more about saving your

296
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,650
passwords securely go to the Apple website here.

297
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,049
And so I'm saying that the,

298
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,950
the the the provider of that service does not tell the customer what to do.

299
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,750
They simply say to the customer look, you appear to be using an Apple device,

300
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,700
go to Apple and learn about this if you want to.

301
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,580
I I think there is somewhat of an obligation to start trying to educate people and to,

302
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,669
I don't know about that one. I don't know about that one.

303
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,200
I, I think you run into two problems there that companies aren't going to want.

304
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,750
First of all,

305
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,140
you have the issue of endorsement where if you send people to Apple there,

306
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,479
it's gonna be claimed you're endorsing Apple as like

307
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,950
-- coming
-- from an Apple device. I mean,

308
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,989
you're not wrong.

309
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,719
I'm just saying like this is a legal

310
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,429
concern.

311
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:40,739
No.

312
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:47,219
And then I think the other piece of this is by encouraging password manager

313
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:50,500
use in people who may have never heard of a password manager before.

314
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,580
You're going to, without question,

315
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,940
increase the number of support requests you

316
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,750
get for password resets because people aren't

317
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,280
going to understand what they're doing and

318
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,739
they're going to accidentally lose that password.

319
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:00,909
Yeah.

320
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:01,900
And, and

321
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,289
that,

322
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,809
but, but from

323
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,299
that

324
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,559
-- to some degree,
-- well,

325
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,289
it'll probably be higher and companies don't want to spend money on this.

326
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,039
So the business people are going to be like, don't do this.

327
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,890
It's going to cost us more money.

328
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:16,719
And so what's interesting to me is looking at all this,

329
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,179
I would also pause it. There's a, there's 1/4 thing.

330
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,010
Now, I, again having said this, I say this very carefully.

331
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,210
I think we have an obligation

332
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:25,469
to,

333
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,789
I don't want to say force.

334
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,119
I, I don't want to use the word force but to strongly,

335
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,599
strongly encourage people to use pass keys

336
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,559
with the proviso

337
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,669
that we still need to support emails and

338
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,159
passwords because not everybody can use past keys.

339
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,619
I don't want to walk people

340
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,500
-- out just because, you know, they don't have an up to date phone or whatever.
-- Right.

341
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,059
Right.

342
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,299
I, I won't disagree with that.

343
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:50,619
I mean, I think past keys are really cool and they solve a lot of problems.

344
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,099
But unfortunately, I bet if we did a poll of, like,

345
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:58,859
randomly selected humans on the planet and ask them how many have heard of pass Keys.

346
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:00,739
It's probably less than 5%.

347
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:02,825
I would go with 0.05%.

348
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:05,304
No, I'm serious. Like, it would be less than 100,000.

349
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:07,075
And here's the other thing,

350
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:09,924
this all ignores the reality and the reality is

351
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:12,465
the people most likely to have chosen a bad password

352
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:15,744
and be in a breach and so on have bad passwords.

353
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,885
They're use, they're reusing that password everywhere.

354
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,864
And these are the kind of people that are going to be

355
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,635
least amenable to change because if they were amenable to change,

356
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:23,924
they

357
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,854
would have. And so this

358
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:28,775
now comes incumbent on 23

359
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,469
for example, to detect credential stuff.

360
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,880
So these are called credential stuffing attacks where I get a breach.

361
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,109
I got a list of emails, I got a list of passwords they used elsewhere.

362
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,380
I'm literally just gonna try stuffing them into 23 and me and see what happens.

363
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,349
And here's where I would say 23 and me is really gonna struggle

364
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:47,429
is that they could have detected that and could have dealt with it

365
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,469
and they did not.

366
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:51,909
And you want an example of a site that actually dealt with this really well,

367
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Bricklin.

368
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:56,849
So Bricklin is a Lego, it's like it's like an online

369
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,914
exchange for selling and buying LEGO,

370
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:02,125
buy the piece or buy the pound or whatever specific pieces, you know,

371
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,414
you can search by country or shipping and cost

372
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,815
Lego actually bought

373
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:07,424
Bricklin, uh, about a year

374
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:07,604
and

375
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,645
I was terrified because I'm like, God, I love Bricklin

376
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:13,145
and like, when I need those pieces, you know, for the thing

377
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,034
and they haven't screwed it up, they've actually made it better

378
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:16,955
yet.

379
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:19,304
Well, it's been a year and a half, like,

380
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:20,044
you know,

381
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:22,354
but the point is Brick link sent me an email one

382
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:24,854
day saying we apologize but we've locked all the accounts.

383
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,369
Ok. That's it basically.

384
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,640
And then three days later they sent an email saying,

385
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,309
ok,

386
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:34,429
here's what happened. Credential stuffing basically. So we locked everything

387
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,619
and we did a bunch of forensics and everything and you're not affected.

388
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,659
Hold on when you mean everything. You mean like every customer they have, they

389
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:43,039
understand they

390
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,059
walk my account, my account password is

391
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,619
strong because like they locked, yeah, they just locked everything.

392
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:49,849
I mean, that's

393
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:50,710
I applaud the

394
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:51,280
will

395
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,020
to do that.

396
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:52,590
Yeah,

397
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:57,169
-- so that's the thing, I'm sorry. But if a lego exchange can do this properly, I
-- mean,

398
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:59,260
for sure. And look,

399
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,659
the reality is if you're a proper company handling sensitive

400
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,000
data and even if you're not handling sensitive data,

401
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,419
like you should be doing these things,

402
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:12,590
there are a ton of technologies that exist today you can use

403
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:17,599
to watch for credential stuffing and data scraping and all of this sort

404
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,010
of activity they should have lit up a dashboard like a Christmas tree.

405
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,380
And let's, and, and

406
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:25,083
you're gonna be really impressed with it. This is from the Bricklin email.

407
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:28,953
There is no evidence to suggest that your Bricklin account has been compromised.

408
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:32,002
However, as a precaution, we're asking you to update your password.

409
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,463
Please go to the Bricklin site and start the process

410
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:37,703
of resetting your password by following the prompts during login.

411
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:41,382
Awesome. Make sure you use a unique password which you don't use on other sites.

412
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:44,353
We're sorry for the inconvenience and disruption caused by the site being down.

413
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:45,862
We're taking this incident very seriously

414
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:47,786
and want to assure you that we're committed to doing

415
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:49,726
all that we can to ensure this doesn't happen again.

416
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:52,296
Like to put it bluntly. Oh and yeah, it gets better.

417
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:53,575
We've taken steps to further strengthen our

418
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:55,135
security and we'll continue to investigate and take

419
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:58,866
a step to tighten how we monitor and respond to unusual activity like I'm sorry,

420
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,666
but Bricklin handled this perfectly 100%

421
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:07,214
like straight up. Perfect. Like this is Olympic gold medal levels of infosec. Yep.

422
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:07,464
Yep.

423
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:09,056
So come on 23. Me,

424
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:10,430
I mean, you could

425
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,209
sort lots of companies like,

426
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:16,569
yeah, but like for 23 and me not just to handle this poorly but to then go with, hey,

427
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,050
you know what?

428
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,310
Let's try blame the user

429
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,739
because they don't want a class action lawsuit and even better

430
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,910
when I haven't logged in yet intentionally because now when you log in,

431
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,130
you're being asked to agree to the new terms of service,

432
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,630
which it's got a weird little arbitration clause

433
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,750
at 23 and me.

434
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,020
-- Yeah, they changed
-- their

435
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:33,839
course

436
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,550
and most companies are trying to move

437
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,229
away from arbitration because it's expensive.

438
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:42,229
But arbitration is probably less expensive when you do have

439
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:46,349
-- the very real potential of a class action lawsuit.
-- Arbitration is funny

440
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,790
because didn't, was it

441
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:50,735
Uber or someone where the drivers abused arbitration to

442
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:53,765
actually cost them like an insane amount of money?

443
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:55,725
It's expensive because Uber has to pay for it.

444
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:58,845
So a lot of them are trying to move away from it and be like, you have to file in like the,

445
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,916
you know, the, the Sioux County lower Court of blah, blah,

446
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:03,676
blah and some middle of the nowhere place

447
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:07,125
that's like closed except for Tuesdays between two and three in the morning

448
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:09,645
and they, they bought off the judge. So

449
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:11,485
there's nothing to worry about.

450
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:15,036
-- Like,
-- I'm sorry, but here's the thing, like if this was some hypothetical or some,

451
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:16,865
like in a vacuum thing, like, ok, 20

452
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:21,052
need to handle this wall. But no, this is not some hypothetical. This is a well known,

453
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:21,582
like,

454
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:22,381
have I been

455
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:24,062
ped, has been around for what, 10 years now?

456
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:24,942
Five years?

457
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:26,442
It's older than that.

458
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,781
-- Well, I
-- mean, with the service where you can actually check passwords and stuff.

459
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:32,592
Yeah. Oh, the check password service? That's a couple of years at moment. So

460
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:39,381
this is, this is not like, oh, like this is not an Apple zero day where like they spent,

461
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:41,661
you know, how much money researching a zero day chain.

462
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:45,822
This is like kid in the basement level attack.

463
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah,

464
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,069
that's exactly what this is.

465
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:49,849
And,

466
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,790
and then conversely

467
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,989
there are sites that

468
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,449
handle this really well, like Bricklin

469
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:56,459
look like.

470
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,550
So I'm sorry, but like there's, this isn't some,

471
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,430
like this isn't some hypothetical gold standard of

472
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,390
information security where it's like hard to achieve.

473
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,890
No, if Bricklin can do this

474
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,714
23 and me can do this, they can spend a bit of money.

475
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:12,135
I don't think that's the argument I would use in this context.

476
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:16,015
-- Well, it's one of the arguments, I
-- mean, sure. But look, I think

477
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,375
what this reminds me of when we kind of lay

478
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,834
it all out and obviously people blaming people and,

479
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,194
and whatever is

480
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,670
when you are a business,

481
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:28,989
you have to make a decision to spend money

482
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:29,810
on

483
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,949
reducing the level of risk you have. And this is across your entire business, right?

484
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:37,270
This isn't just like it and, and information

485
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:38,719
-- and
-- actually managing

486
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:39,869
risk. Sure. Right.

487
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,150
Like locks on the doors,

488
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,869
like where are we renting buildings if you rent your

489
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,810
office in the most crime ridden part of town,

490
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,260
like yes,

491
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,589
you're going to have a different set of problems and if you rent

492
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,864
an office in the very expensive part of town that does zero crime.

493
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:55,925
You know, there's like there's all these pieces to this.

494
00:19:55,935 --> 00:20:00,035
And so what I mean, what fundamentally happened here is 23 and me

495
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:03,405
pretty clearly has cheaped out on security is what I'd say.

496
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,665
And now they have to try to pick up the pieces

497
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:08,425
that, to be blunt is assuming that they have any security.

498
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:13,425
-- That's a good point
-- because no, we've, we don't know that they have a security team.

499
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:17,645
-- We know nothing about the internal security at 23 and me,
-- it could be a guy.

500
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,089
-- It might be, I don't know.
-- And that's the thing.

501
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,109
And this is the part of the problem with security is like, uh, I'm going to pick on me.

502
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,119
Cloud security lines basically is one kind of security.

503
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,229
It, operations person mostly, which is me

504
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:31,359
and, well, but that's kind of cheating because I'm a Donk. Right.

505
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:34,920
Like I have been doing this for a long time and I get free rein to, like,

506
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,310
everything goes by in Cloud Flare.

507
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,430
What is a Donk

508
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,229
from the, the movie Crocodile Dundee? This sounds like a dirty word.

509
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:46,050
So the, the, the Colombian drug dealers go to Australia to assassinate Crocodile

510
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,180
D,

511
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:46,765
right.

512
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:49,564
And they go up to that, you know, the little guy drinking beer on the beach

513
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:52,395
and the guy's like, I've got a gun and the little guy's like, yeah, cool.

514
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:53,645
I've got a Donk and the guy's like,

515
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:57,645
what's a Donk and a Donk is a 6 ft five guy who bashes you in the head and knocks you out.

516
00:20:57,954 --> 00:20:59,594
-- I don't remember
-- this.

517
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:00,364
Right.

518
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:03,604
-- The guy's name is Donk. Are you sure
-- this is Crocodile Dundee.

519
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:04,410
Yeah,

520
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,260
it's the second, uh, the first one, right?

521
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,280
Because they is, it, I don't remember anymore anyways. But,

522
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:11,890
but that's the thing, right? A lot of places have a Donk

523
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,550
and have shockingly good security based on one or two or a small team of people.

524
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:17,609
And then there's large companies where it's like,

525
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:22,119
how on earth have you? Not like a, how did you get your pants on this morning?

526
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,349
-- I'm not clear on that, but b how would you not burnt the building down
-- yet?

527
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,689
I mean, look, there's also many aspects of this.

528
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:29,810
Like I have,

529
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,109
I have seen instances where like internal security

530
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,069
was just blatantly lying to upper management.

531
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,349
Right. There's,

532
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,079
there's a lot of challenges in this space and

533
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,760
you have instances where you get a third party office

534
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,209
and if people know how to work the auditor, you can get by with terrible security.

535
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:53,050
Like there's, there's so many dials on this machine

536
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,569
and like, we don't know what 23 and me story,

537
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,949
they're never gonna tell us because they're gonna get sued no

538
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,729
-- matter what we
-- do know for sure that they have bad security

539
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,930
because they didn't

540
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:02,979
agree

541
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:03,569
with that.

542
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:03,920
That

543
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:04,469
is reasonable.

544
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,969
They did not detect and block the attack.

545
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,410
They did not use the, have I been P password

546
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,800
thing.

547
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:16,750
The only thing you need to know about this attack is they blamed the users,

548
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,790
which means the lawyers wrote that release not the security team

549
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,010
because every time lawyers write something,

550
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,530
the sole intent of that communication is reducing

551
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,890
our risk and pushing it somewhere else.

552
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,969
That is like the job of a lawyer

553
00:22:32,204 --> 00:22:33,494
in that context.

554
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:35,454
Like that's the famous Supreme Court decision

555
00:22:35,464 --> 00:22:37,385
here in Canada where saying I'm sorry,

556
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:39,285
does is not an admission of guilt.

557
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:41,765
That's right. That's right. Which I love.

558
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:42,464
Yeah,

559
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:43,925
very Canadian.

560
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:44,545
It is.

561
00:22:44,555 --> 00:22:46,255
Well, I mean, what I love is, for example,

562
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,234
I remember one time I bumped into a cop at a coffee shop,

563
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:50,864
like we were both sort of backing up and we both said sorry at the same moment.

564
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:51,685
Nice.

565
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:53,964
Well, anyway, so sorry, I just logged into 23 and me

566
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,380
and uh they now, for example, are saying,

567
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,310
like I just clicked on single sign on to see what happens.

568
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,319
I actually use user name, password.

569
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,969
But it says basically, do you want to sign in with Google or I'll keep my password?

570
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,119
I'm gonna keep my password.

571
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,939
So I'm gonna click and sign in with my

572
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,130
Oh, here we go.

573
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,459
As an added security measure,

574
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:10,170
we're requiring that all customers choose a new

575
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,390
password to unique 23 and me to proceed,

576
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,750
please reset your password.

577
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,910
So they are forcing a password reset, which to me says

578
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,630
I would do that no matter what, in this particular instance?

579
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,390
-- Well,
-- but they didn't get into 23 and me's database or anything they got into

580
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,839
user accounts. I

581
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:25,959
know.

582
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,439
But this is a good,

583
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,920
I think it is a good behavior for an organization like

584
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,050
23 and me to do because I think it helps signal.

585
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,640
We're taking this seriously.

586
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:40,050
We're making everyone change their passwords because we don't know for sure

587
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,579
who has a crap password.

588
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:44,030
Of course, it doesn't mean people are going to set good passwords.

589
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,729
-- But
-- actually, let's see if I can choose a bad password.

590
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:53,300
-- One second, I don't know, set of crap
-- password set like password. 123, four.

591
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,660
Ok.

592
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,140
It said

593
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,709
this password is too short. It must contain at least 12 characters.

594
00:23:56,719 --> 00:24:00,709
This password is too common. Ok, let's try password. Uh, hang on a sec.

595
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,709
Let me just cut and paste because I'm tired of typing.

596
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:05,979
I, I tried password 123 and it didn't let me do that nice.

597
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,969
So pass. Let's try capital P word,

598
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:16,699
123 and 123. So capital password. 123 with shift and then 123.

599
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:17,229
Oh,

600
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,520
it took that. It'll take bad passwords.

601
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:21,650
They are definitely not using,

602
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,930
make sure you change that back now.

603
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,890
Yeah, I'm gonna actually hang on a sec reset password.

604
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:31,000
But yeah, it'll let you pick a very poor password.

605
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,180
It's just, it has to be more than 12 characters long.

606
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:33,420
Uh,

607
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,810
hang on one second. Let me see if I can pick something truly terrible.

608
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:39,290
-- This email confirms that you've changed your Oh, yeah. Yeah. Ok.
-- That's,

609
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:44,930
-- that's nice. Here's
-- the new reset link. Ok. I'm gonna try

610
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:46,510
just password password.

611
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,130
Let me set a password of password, password with capital PS

612
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,900
in, in both PS.

613
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:52,920
Yeah,

614
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,680
that's like the worst password ever. Well done.

615
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,150
So, I'm sorry. 23 me fails.

616
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,530
No. Come on, this is

617
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:02,989
I'm very glad

618
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,030
they don't have any of my data.

619
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,750
I mean, look, none of this surprises me

620
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,790
because no, no, no, I just want to try my email as my password.

621
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,420
Oh, that's a good one.

622
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,040
Because if they let me set my email as my password, then we know that they, that's true

623
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,050
is what that is.

624
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,890
The password is too similar to the email address. Ok, let's try

625
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:21,729
fried one

626
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,290
with the number one.

627
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,849
No, it didn't let me do that. Ok.

628
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,290
So it will not let me set my email address as a password,

629
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:29,150
-- but it
-- will accept

630
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,449
password password.

631
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,079
I mean, look, it is clear that

632
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:38,689
23 and me has some security issues internally. So none of this surprises me.

633
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:41,489
-- Oh, wait,
-- I need 12 characters.

634
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,339
Ok. So

635
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,209
123, basically 1234567890123.

636
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,189
And that, that work. This password is entirely numeric is too common. Ok, let's try

637
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:54,229
pass.

638
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,150
We have,

639
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,439
we're not going to sit here while you try

640
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:00,430
every combination of passwords you can think of.

641
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:06,439
-- We know their password form, accepts crap password.
-- It took password 1234567

642
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,790
-- with
-- a lowercase.

643
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:09,069
Well done,

644
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:09,469
well done.

645
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:11,444
Hats off to you, sir. Ok.

646
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:14,114
Let me just actually set my password to something good now,

647
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,864
so you don't log into my account because,

648
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:18,954
or somebody else logs into my account because that's a pretty

649
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:19,944
good password.

650
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:21,025
I love it

651
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:21,564
also.

652
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:24,474
There's no apparently limitation on me resetting my

653
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:26,385
password multiple times in a few minutes.

654
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:26,405
Oh,

655
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:28,734
except now I'm not getting the reset link.

656
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:29,175
Oh,

657
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:30,464
no, I didn't. Ok.

658
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:33,719
I

659
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,310
see.

660
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,239
But in my opinion,

661
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,020
if somebody resets their password like four or five times in a minute

662
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,630
-- that should flag something.
-- I mean, I would think so. It's often not

663
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,489
clearly

664
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,829
affected behavior.

665
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:49,510
They're testing something or they're a bad guy maybe. But,

666
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,349
ok, anyway, anyway,

667
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,650
I want us to kind of bring this one home and we're going to stop listening to you,

668
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,750
-- change your
-- password.

669
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,349
Ok. There, I changed something secure.

670
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,800
I feel like

671
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:00,369
this is

672
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,010
just the universe we live in now

673
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,209
where organizations have to deal with this kind of crap because

674
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,150
even if you're a company that does genetic testing,

675
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,189
like you're in the information security business now, that's it.

676
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,810
There's, there's no other option.

677
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:19,849
-- Bosch
-- makes nice tools and dryers and washers and stuff, that drill thing,

678
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:24,926
the torque drills that are uh IOT devices essentially So, for example,

679
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,105
you can remotely set and calibrate and measure

680
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:31,666
all these screws were torqued correctly, which that's important for a lot of stuff.

681
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:32,365
Like if you over to

682
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:32,826
something,

683
00:27:33,556 --> 00:27:34,395
well, if you over to

684
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:35,336
something, you can break it.

685
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:36,046
If you under torque it,

686
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:41,222
-- the screw falls out
-- as we have seen with an airplane incident recently say

687
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:44,302
somebody found like, what was it? 27 vulnerabilities in these things.

688
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:45,862
So you could remotely compromise it.

689
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:46,501
And for example,

690
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:49,791
reset the torque value so that you're not torquing stuff tight or too tight.

691
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:50,582
So it breaks early.

692
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:53,741
And that's the other thing is there is a lot of

693
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:57,302
health and human safety and sensitive data that is online now.

694
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,982
And yeah, these companies need to do better

695
00:27:59,192 --> 00:28:00,212
and the fact is

696
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:01,482
it's not that

697
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,219
I'm sorry, but like

698
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,989
Apple is dealing with crazy zero days with people who have millions of dollars

699
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:11,829
23 and me is failing when people set their password to password 1234567.

700
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:14,189
And I think that's it.

701
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,479
That's all I have to say.

702
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,050
Well, look, here's ok. I think the Bosch example fits in nicely with this.

703
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,890
The reality is,

704
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:27,209
let's say five or 10, maybe 20 years ago, you could be a product company

705
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,510
and not need to know anything about information security or it in general, right?

706
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,250
That was fine. You could exist like that. That is not the world we live in today.

707
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,410
Everything's connected

708
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:39,939
you can make the argument

709
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:44,040
that it's not right that every company has to be a security

710
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,530
wise company

711
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:48,155
to exist in the universe. And I won't disagree with that.

712
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:51,604
I think it's too easy to screw this stuff up and that's a different conversation.

713
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:55,785
But the reality is where we exist today. If you are a company

714
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:56,435
with,

715
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,214
we just say a product and I'll use the

716
00:28:58,224 --> 00:29:01,675
term product loosely to denote like things or services.

717
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:07,635
You have to be security aware because if you're not, this is going to happen to you.

718
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,954
But now here's the other piece of this to think about.

719
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:16,359
-- So Bosch and 23 and me had security incidents
-- and Bosch seems to be handling a, well,

720
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,020
Bosch is committed to updates by the end of

721
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,979
the month which for a software company that's ok

722
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,060
regardless

723
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,569
at the end of the day,

724
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,699
if they, if, if, when you look at the math,

725
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:29,380
if doing nothing about security and just paying the fines or,

726
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,260
or whatever was cheaper than actually having good security,

727
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,760
they're gonna say that was a good business decision.

728
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,609
And so that's part of the problem is today,

729
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,099
that is a conversation a company can have

730
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:45,900
because there are often little to no negative

731
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,619
outcomes for them

732
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:51,380
when this stuff happens because maybe 23 and me will get sued.

733
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,459
Maybe they won't, maybe they'll get fined, maybe they won't,

734
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:54,900
I don't know how this is gonna happen,

735
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,619
but a good security team is expensive. Right? How expensive is crappy security.

736
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,540
We don't know yet.

737
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:06,069
-- And
-- actually I would say it's more subtle now, it's not just if you produce a product,

738
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,589
but if you use stuff to produce a product, for example,

739
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,219
you might be producing an entirely mechanical device like AAA wood plane.

740
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,489
And if you're using those Bosch

741
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,589
internet capable torture wrenches,

742
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,099
you could be over tightening screws and like damaging products.

743
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,900
So it all fails earlier or the screws fall out and people get hurt or whatever.

744
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:25,699
And then an extreme case would be like, yeah,

745
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:28,579
if you're using these things to install door plugs in airlines,

746
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:30,560
then getting the torque wrong on those screws

747
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,380
has very significant downside potentially.

748
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,479
And that's the other thing is it's,

749
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,380
it's not just enough. If you're producing a product,

750
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,130
it's if you're, now, if your supply chain

751
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:45,869
uses any of these things, if you're using them directly.

752
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:47,189
And this is,

753
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:47,650
I mean,

754
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,859
essentially this is everybody that's like everybody

755
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:52,599
has an IP capable H VAC system because

756
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:56,040
like, well, that's just how they are nowadays

757
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,709
and that's how Home Depot got broken into, for example, right.

758
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,719
They got into the H VAC system at Home Depot and

759
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:03,109
then into the Home Depot Network and the credit card stuff.

760
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,439
And so I think the reality is

761
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:09,594
basically everybody has to have an information security team now or

762
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:11,035
they really need to start like,

763
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,244
outsourcing this stuff to somebody who's trustworthy.

764
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:17,314
Like I don't do. Well, I'm not going to build a system to manage my cash.

765
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:19,915
I keep it in a bank. I pay a bit of money for it.

766
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:24,834
That's just like, and that's what most businesses do. Most businesses even casinos

767
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,780
avoid handling cash as much as they can because it's such a pain.

768
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,630
But now we're going,

769
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,630
now this opens a conversation about how do you find enough people?

770
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:39,180
You know who's like, how do you tell if the MS sp is competent or like a bunch of morons

771
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:43,160
-- and
-- you can't outsource your drills like you need to have on premises drills

772
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,800
and yeah. Does an MSP P manage them or something like? Right.

773
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,699
It's complicated.

774
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,839
That's a conversation for another day.

775
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:53,650
I suspect I want to call this one because I don't want to drag on too long,

776
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,319
but like 23 and me failed.

777
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,250
That's it. And they continue to fail.

778
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,810
That's what really upsets me

779
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,250
the fact that they let me set those poor passwords. That's it is sad.

780
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,569
Like if you're a lawyer

781
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,109
just email me and Josh,

782
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,890
we'll explain why this is so terrible in terms that the jury can understand.

783
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,689
I'm staying out of this.

784
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:17,069
Yeah, but like straight up, this is just like, I'm sorry, Bricklin gold star,

785
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:17,920
gold medal

786
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,380
23 and me,

787
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,430
you continue to disappoint him.

788
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:26,339
What is it? My, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.

789
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,430
Check how he's doing.

790
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,469
Steve was just eating 100 plus year old crackers and

791
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,140
they were edible because it was just flour and water.

792
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,060
There was no shortening.

793
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,729
I got a couple of tins of World War One biscuits

794
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:40,180
-- and they were edible.
-- I don't think I want to watch that.
