Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 24

1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,569
and the first of the new year in 2017 with myself,

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,180
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,750
Oh, man, 2017,

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,219
the train wreck that was 2016 is finally behind us and everything is ok again.

5
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:22,540
Right.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,370
-- You know,
-- my personal thoughts on that are,

7
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,209
if you look at history every single year is a train wreck.

8
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,809
-- You know, at least it wasn't a super volcano last year
-- yet.

9
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:32,529
I read an article actually in the newspaper today with yes,

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,490
I read like the dead tree newspaper every day,

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,509
but they said there's a volcano in Italy. I think that is getting ready to erupt and

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,110
it's in a, a densely populated region

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,909
which

14
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:45,740
that's pretty much Europe, by definition.

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,099
That's true.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,959
And it's not like we've ever had a problem

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,810
in the past of densely populated regions near volcanoes.

18
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:52,119
Right.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,509
So, yeah. So I think this year

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,459
we should, maybe we should lead off, I think with some predictions.

21
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:02,060
I love predictions.

22
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,550
-- Yeah, I think we should do some, a nice set of predictions for 2016
-- and

23
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:07,110
20

24
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:07,860
17.

25
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,269
No,

26
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,180
no sadly, I don't.

27
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:16,699
-- So I think we should do the predictions for 2016.
-- I, I love it.

28
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,319
This is a brilliant idea because we can laugh at everyone

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,199
else without having to actually do any real work ourselves.

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:23,919
Yeah.

31
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,169
And we can just pair at them, which is a

32
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,190
-- winning strategy.
-- I love it. I love it.

33
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,720
So I guess to, to start off then let's say this.

34
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,690
If, if you want to look at what we're looking at,

35
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,870
you can just head over to open source security,

36
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,199
podcast.com and all the links we refer to and all these predictions we have there.

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,120
And so if you wish you can play along at home, dear listener.

38
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:42,639
Yeah.

39
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,440
So I'd like to start with my favorite prediction of 2016,

40
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:47,730
which is also essentially my favorite prediction for

41
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,669
the last probably 10 or 20 years,

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,160
which is passwords are going away

43
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,699
right, right next to the paperless office. Right.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,800
Yeah.

45
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

46
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:01,819
I mean, and, and what gets me is, um, I have a lot more,

47
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,980
I was gonna say, apps,

48
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,099
but it's more websites that now support two

49
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,410
factor authentication primarily through my phone because,

50
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,258
you know, S MS or, or the Google Authenticator app or whatever,

51
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,339
which is awesome. But they all pretty much primarily go by password,

52
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,550
you know,

53
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,059
full stop.

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,320
And

55
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,789
what really drives me nuts is how few of them will allow me to log in, say,

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,369
using a Google or a Facebook or my linkedin account

57
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,100
so that I can just use one password for many sites.

58
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:25,539
But yeah,

59
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,139
I don't think passwords are going to go away for probably another 50 to 100 years.

60
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,899
They will never go away. Let's face reality.

61
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,940
There will always be passwords in some capacity. However, however,

62
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,649
I

63
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,050
think what's going to happen here and this has been

64
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:44,970
referred to kind of like water on Mars or Voyager leaving the solar system.

65
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:50,020
How many times have we found water on Mars in the last five or 10 years?

66
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:52,580
What, like 20 maybe, maybe more.

67
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,529
And, and I think passwords are kind of like the, this is, this is like boiling a frog

68
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,410
where

69
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,729
eventually it's going to happen,

70
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:02,100
but it's been take,

71
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,669
it's taken so long and there have been so many incremental

72
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,179
changes along the way that when it does finally happen,

73
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,449
nobody even notices.

74
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,360
And I, I suspect

75
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,020
it's gonna be the same thing like when we find, you know,

76
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:17,300
extraterrestrial life where we send out these probes

77
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:19,440
to these moons and planets and stuff.

78
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:19,940
And

79
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:24,149
we always find like on Mars, how many signs of life have we found?

80
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,889
You know, a whole bunch and one day they're gonna be like, oh, we finally found,

81
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:30,190
you know, life on Venus and like, didn't we do that like 10 years ago?

82
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,449
You know, I mean, that's just how this stuff is.

83
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,630
Yeah. Well, it leads me to one thought is, you know, we still have coal

84
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,449
and FORTRAN apps that are 4050 years old, grinding away on data,

85
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:41,300
you know, so much so that

86
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:46,089
Amazon and the Amazon cloud now actually has like a batch data processing service,

87
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:49,679
right? Like explicitly aimed at like banks and whatnot because they're like,

88
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,190
they're like, let's face it, right?

89
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,100
You wanna move this stuff to the cloud,

90
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,759
but you're basically just forklift a mainframe into the cloud, right?

91
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,839
So we have to support batch processing because

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,369
that's how that world works.

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,270
And I'm, I'm thinking like password based apps. I mean, they're,

94
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,289
they're the rule, not the, you know, I,

95
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,009
I can think of so few applications that don't require a password,

96
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,750
you know, it's, it's at least another 50 100 years for that paradigm to, to change.

97
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,869
Well, but, but so, well, let's use Cobalt as our example here is

98
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:22,600
there's not a lot of Cobalt or FORTRAN

99
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,790
in actual production anymore. I mean, the, the stuff that exists is quite large but

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,910
it's just been a slow death

101
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,790
and it's gonna be one of those, you know, kind of

102
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,510
what, what do you call it with? The,

103
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:35,924
not a Parabola, you know, but the other way where it's, it's going to,

104
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:40,345
right? It's gonna always be approaching zero but never actually getting there.

105
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,934
And it's the same thing with passwords, right?

106
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:46,135
We're going to continue to approach the universe where there are no passwords,

107
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:48,274
but we will never actually touch the line.

108
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:49,734
Well, but see, here's the dirty secret.

109
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:53,234
We'll always need some form of password because what happens when you wash up,

110
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:55,394
you know, with, without your wallet or phone or anything.

111
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:59,255
And you literally only have what you remember in your head and maybe biometrics,

112
00:04:59,304 --> 00:04:59,475
right?

113
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:02,295
And the problem with biometrics is you need sensors on everything, which

114
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,459
what happens

115
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,089
today,

116
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,600
I mean, OK,

117
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,799
-- so let's say you have your
-- secret question to like, you know, change to, to uh,

118
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,920
to recover your, you know, account, right?

119
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,730
What was your first high school teacher or?

120
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,369
What was your favorite pet or, you know, things like that? So

121
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,579
the reality is like the, the one benefit of passwords is, you know,

122
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,609
barring head injuries, you always have your passwords.

123
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:21,779
That's

124
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,140
true.

125
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,779
And in theory, you know, as

126
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:24,160
you

127
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:24,959
let's face it,

128
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,890
it has one.

129
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,609
Yeah. And so, you know,

130
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:32,019
that's the dirty secret, right? Even if we replace everything with really good,

131
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,679
you know, biometrics or really good, um,

132
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,470
like token based authentication or whatever,

133
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,109
you know, something you have. Well, you know, you can always lose that,

134
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:42,980
right?

135
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,429
Or you go in a steam room

136
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,869
and uh, and with something you are, you know, well, I mean,

137
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,839
people do get their limbs and eyes and stuff injured, you know, what happens then,

138
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,149
right?

139
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:53,059
Yeah,

140
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,029
that's, that's very true.

141
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,769
You know, there's, there's been, you know, there's those cases of, well, I mean,

142
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,250
there's double amputees out there.

143
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,790
So, what do they do? For fingerprint based authentication systems,

144
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:05,820
you know? I don't know. That's an interesting question,

145
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,109
you know. So,

146
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,459
anyway, so, yeah,

147
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,209
I think passwords are gonna be here to stay for a couple more decades at least.

148
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,910
And, um,

149
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,279
but my hope would be is that we

150
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,359
supplement them with two factor authentication so that,

151
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:19,279
you know, by shoulder surfing or sniffing the password, you don't just

152
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,179
-- basically hijack somebody's life right away.
-- All right.

153
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:29,890
So this, this one came from the uh CSO online top 15 security predictions for 2016.

154
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,279
So let's,

155
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,480
let's stick with these guys for a few minutes and see what else they had to say.

156
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,359
We've got, uh let's see, IOT for ransom.

157
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,160
So when they say for ransom, they mean, like, you know, give us a Bitcoin or we,

158
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,359
-- you won't get any
-- coffee,

159
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,160
they're discussing ransomware to a degree and then

160
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,880
they're trying to tie it into iot.

161
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,329
Well, I mean, I've, there's that comic,

162
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:54,140
you know where that guy is in his kitchen and every single device is showing

163
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:57,269
some variation of like give us money and we'll make you coffee or cook your,

164
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,940
you know, open the fridge or whatever.

165
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,890
And my, my problem with that is, is by definition,

166
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,500
the people that are like susceptible to be being

167
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,279
hit by ransomware are typically not that sophisticated.

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,679
So how do you make them pay you?

169
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,660
It, it is true and if you disable all of their devices, they,

170
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,779
by definition cannot pay you

171
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,420
and, and well, ok, so ignoring that, ignoring that conversation.

172
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:22,500
Have we seen any instances of IOT ransomware?

173
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,100
Not, I've heard of nothing public yet. And I kind of have kept an eye out for it.

174
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:31,649
I haven't TV. S maybe I think we'll see that

175
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,179
with the IOT attacks.

176
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,679
D

177
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:34,820
do

178
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,279
is easier to monetize.

179
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,839
Right. Because like, if I hijack, say a million TV.

180
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,049
S and I send out a million ransomware notices,

181
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:44,700
I then have to, like, basically train and educate

182
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,480
enough people to, like,

183
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,459
pay me in Bitcoin because realistically Bitcoin is

184
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,899
the only way to do this anonymously.

185
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,329
Right.

186
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,970
So, you know, I'm only gonna get a minor subset of those people and more the point,

187
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,239
you know, it's like those people that have like,

188
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,130
virus infested laptops and it's gonna cost like 200 bucks to, to wipe and clean it.

189
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,500
Well, you can buy a new laptop now for 300 bucks.

190
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,260
Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

191
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,239
And, and that's, that's always gonna be the challenge of ransomware. Right?

192
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,640
Is ensuring that the ransom is less expensive than the alternative.

193
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,859
-- Well, not just less expensive but less hassle.
-- That's true too.

194
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:16,640
That's a very good price

195
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,000
because you and me, we could,

196
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,489
we could go get a hold of, you know,

197
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,440
you and I could follow instructions on how to buy

198
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,660
a Bitcoin and ship it to somebody with relative ease.

199
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,470
But you're dealing with people who, like, can barely check their email

200
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,540
-- or don't know how to reset a password
-- trying to even explain what Bitcoin is to.

201
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,400
My parents

202
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,239
is a horrifying thought.

203
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,818
I, I would, I would just call it magic money.

204
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:39,217
Like, I can't even think of anything else I would say.

205
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:43,908
Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't think we're going to see IOT ransomware

206
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,458
because quite frankly it's just, it's,

207
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:47,328
that's

208
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,758
a foolish thing to say.

209
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:49,299
I

210
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:49,448
was,

211
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,708
I think on the higher end we might, but here's the reality.

212
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:55,809
If someone ransomware is my $3 light bulb. Oh,

213
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,768
ok.

214
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,140
I, I go and buy new light bulbs.

215
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,299
It's less hassle than paying the ransom and it's probably cheaper.

216
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,260
So, you know, you mentioned that and I know we,

217
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,500
we laughed about this a couple of episodes ago, but I was at a store yesterday,

218
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,330
I think it was,

219
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,570
and there was a $12 light bulb that was Bluetooth enabled and a speaker

220
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,380
and part of me wanted to buy it so bad

221
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,979
just to have it and say I have it.

222
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:22,869
Another part of me is like, no, there's no reason to have this thing.

223
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,510
Like no good will ever come of this purchase.

224
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,369
Yeah. Yeah,

225
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,380
I expect in a couple of days I'll go back and buy it.

226
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,479
Yeah. See, and that's the thing, right. I mean,

227
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,130
I,

228
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:35,320
I think at the higher end you'll be able to maybe hold a medical device ransom.

229
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,630
You know, like an MRI scanner that cost a million bucks

230
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:41,229
but yeah, at the low end I just can't see it

231
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,320
being MRI,

232
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,530
like, working and more to the point, I can't see

233
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,289
an attacker getting enough people to actually pay

234
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,020
-- to make it worthwhile
-- regardless of that.

235
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,429
We're just picking on 2016 predictions here. It didn't happen. Right.

236
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,869
-- No.
-- Well, there's not enough IOT deployed yet. Right.

237
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,460
Yeah. Sure.

238
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,469
And the thing to remember too is, I mean, as bad as IOT is the reality is

239
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,109
99 point whatever percent of home internet connections are behind

240
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,239
a net device because your ISP will only give you one IP,

241
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,919
because we haven't done I PV six yet.

242
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:12,700
You know,

243
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:15,030
and so how do you infect those devices?

244
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:17,979
Right. They have to be if they're directly connected to the internet. Yeah. Sure.

245
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:20,340
They all have default passwords and stuff. So, no problem. And,

246
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:23,059
and that's where things like those video camera systems come in. Right.

247
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,359
Because businesses put them online so they can check them remotely. But, you know,

248
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,900
as far as most of these light bulbs are like nest cameras, they,

249
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:33,239
they go through like the Google mothership or the manufacturer's mothership.

250
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,609
Right.

251
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:37,979
And, well, granted those things are probably not as secure as they should be.

252
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,049
I just, I don't think, I, I think it will happen at some point,

253
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:44,539
but probably not for a few years until we really get some more

254
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,940
widespread availability and

255
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,989
easier ways to get money from people anonymously online.

256
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,190
Yeah. Yeah. That's,

257
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,070
I'll, I'll agree with that.

258
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:59,520
All right. So let's move on to the next one is about

259
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,820
chip, credit cards

260
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,700
about

261
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,099
it says your card is safe or you aren't.

262
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:05,989
Yeah.

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,159
Well, it's funny because the, I just took a course on, uh,

264
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,409
cybersecurity economics and they actually used this exact example

265
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,880
from Britain back when Britain introduced chip and pin,

266
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,000
the card not present fraud rose dramatically, especially from foreign countries,

267
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,409
right?

268
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:22,950
Um, Because the reality was like in Britain,

269
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,789
you could no longer easily clone a card by copying the make stripe,

270
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,010
but you could still clone the card and then use it to make an online purchase.

271
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,330
So this isn't even a prediction. This is just

272
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,150
what happened in Europe.

273
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,010
Well, it's how it works, right? You,

274
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:35,630
you

275
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:40,364
make one type of fraud harder. So of course they move to a different type of fraud.

276
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:41,244
So, I mean, yeah,

277
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:43,335
that's not even a prediction that is like that is

278
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:46,784
a historical fact used in an online cybersecurity course.

279
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:50,945
I know. Right. Right. That's great. Well done guys. Well done.

280
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:54,825
Uh So, so moving on then now this one

281
00:11:55,094 --> 00:12:00,864
shows up in a number of places in all the 2016 predictions I reviewed is,

282
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,950
do you remember in 2015 where these groups like anonymous, for example, were, were

283
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:10,299
essentially breaking into people's online accounts and they, they

284
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:11,299
the same

285
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:11,690
stuff.

286
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,059
Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly. The doc

287
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:13,440
or the

288
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:14,309
stuff

289
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,700
where you,

290
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,309
you're stealing basically someone's private information and then you're,

291
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,770
you're either trying to ransom it back to them in

292
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,669
some cases or just using it to hideously embarrass them.

293
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,270
And

294
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:30,349
a lot of people said this was gonna get worse in 2016 and I don't think it did.

295
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,049
I think this actually decreased substantially.

296
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,580
Um, so my experience of it is, uh,

297
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,349
a couple of the major sites like icloud

298
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,280
and stuff definitely tightened up their security.

299
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,760
Um,

300
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,239
you know, talking passwords. It kind of goes back to that.

301
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,940
A lot of places have really good account security,

302
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,059
like passwords and two factor authentication and all that.

303
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,419
And then they have really terrible account recovery and like setups,

304
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,780
you know, like, um, like there was those famous cases with, I think it was um,

305
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:00,059
well, it was a large online retail. I'm, I'm not gonna name because I might be wrong

306
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,869
where basically it was the last four, it was the classic,

307
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,330
last four digits of your credit card could be used to recover the account.

308
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:08,809
So all you needed was somebody's email address and

309
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,229
the last four digits of their credit card,

310
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,890
which let's face, it are not hard to find.

311
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,210
Um, so things like that.

312
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:16,650
So I think a lot of them uh improve their account recovery procedures, which,

313
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:18,190
you know, again, that becomes a problem, right?

314
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,289
Because if somebody legitimately loses all their stuff,

315
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,520
how do they get back into their account?

316
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,809
Especially when, you know, they,

317
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,729
they're goofy and forgot their passwords or whatever

318
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,250
their secret question answers. Sorry. Uh, not a password. They secret question.

319
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:32,900
Um, so I think that side of the doc

320
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:36,830
and got, or that side of the, you know, the break into your data got a bit harder.

321
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,469
And I think the reality is, you know, people

322
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,849
like you, you can only use a blackmail once and then it's like, well, ok.

323
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,429
Yeah, you, you, you shared my

324
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,979
deep, terrible secret.

325
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,909
What are you going to do now? Right.

326
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,809
Yeah. You know, and I didn't die. Nothing too terrible happened.

327
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,090
You know, I didn't get fired or whatever.

328
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,650
So, you know, and I think that's part of it is the reality is,

329
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,460
I mean, the dirty secret is everybody has dirty secrets. You know,

330
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,380
we all,

331
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,570
we all have things that we are embarrassed and we won't say we

332
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,260
won't tell our mother or our coworkers or our boss or like,

333
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,650
put on our, you know,

334
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,820
web page

335
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,690
or our Facebook profile.

336
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:16,859
And I mean,

337
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,650
you know, but the vast majority of things are just not that terrible

338
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,229
and you're just,

339
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:23,849
nobody really gives a care.

340
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,309
You know,

341
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:30,320
I remember one time a person was so embarrassed to tell a

342
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,609
group of us that she had been divorced and we were like,

343
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:32,820
uh huh.

344
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,130
And then what happened? And she's like, no, that's it. I was divorced and we're like,

345
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,010
yeah. Ok. But like, what's the, what's your deep, terrible secret? I'm divorced.

346
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,909
I we're like, I don't get it. Like, how is that a terrible deep secret? Like this is,

347
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,830
what year are we in again? Like,

348
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,539
you know,

349
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,700
and, but in her mind it was the most terrible shameful thing, you know,

350
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,020
coming from her cultural background.

351
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:53,840
And that's,

352
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,770
I mean, that's just part of being a human is we assume

353
00:14:57,989 --> 00:15:02,190
people care far more about details like this than they really do. And,

354
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:06,580
and it's kind of like, always where, you know, I, I get this, my, my, my son is 10

355
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,710
and it's always like, oh, so and so doesn't like me and I'm like,

356
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,000
so and so probably doesn't care, you know,

357
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:14,770
that's the reality of it. Just don't worry. All right,

358
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:18,539
we're lucky that people actually know we exist

359
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,700
-- whether they like us or not.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

360
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,140
So, oh man, anyway, let's keep going.

361
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,820
The next one, I'm gonna skip over a couple here on this list because they're just,

362
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,700
they're boring.

363
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,000
But there is

364
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,890
the cloud wars talking about

365
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:38,030
that hackers are going to use public cloud as a major attack vector.

366
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:44,140
-- And I don't, I can't think of any good examples of this from 2016.
-- It

367
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,619
has not really happened yet.

368
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,150
And I know for a fact like some of them like Amazon web services is a great example.

369
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,109
You do a port scan from an EC2 instance

370
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,869
and you get a nasty email within like two minutes saying like you

371
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,989
better explain what's going on or we're probably gonna shut your account down.

372
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,169
So I shouldn't like scan the internet from EC

373
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,750
like I did. Uh, what was I doing?

374
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,859
Oh, yeah, I wanted to, I wanted to verify my firewall configured home.

375
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:09,460
So I just fired off, you know, n map

376
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,590
with like uh no options

377
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,280
pointing out my home IP address.

378
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,859
And like literally three minutes later I got this nasty email from

379
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:18,260
Amazon web services and I'm like I typed in a reply saying,

380
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,900
you know, well,

381
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:22,739
I scanned my own IP address and please for the love of God don't turn my account off,

382
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,659
you know.

383
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,090
Um but the reality is like uh a lot of

384
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:29,530
these major cloud writers are really good at egress,

385
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:32,479
detecting the attacks, blocking them, filtering them, you know,

386
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:35,919
just in general dealing with them because that is a significant

387
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:39,710
cost on their side if they have to deal with people complaining about these attacks,

388
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:39,890
right?

389
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,210
Because

390
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,770
people who are being attacked will be annoying and they will manage to find like

391
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,239
that phone number for one of your humans and like phone them and harass them.

392
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,890
Well, I guess not only that you,

393
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,359
these IP addresses in a public cloud are heavily shared

394
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,210
and if one of your IP S ends up on a blacklist,

395
00:16:56,219 --> 00:17:00,349
I mean IP D four addresses are they're worth their weight in gold these days.

396
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,348
So if your, if your address is on a blacklist, you're going to be in trouble.

397
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,219
Yeah,

398
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:08,520
I had to deal with this one Swiss company that they block

399
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,098
all incoming email from all of Amazon's IP ranges and I'm like,

400
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:14,180
well, I guess you're not getting our email.

401
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,118
That's crazy. Why would you do that?

402
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,699
It would stop a lot of spam, I guess. I mean, but,

403
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,560
you know,

404
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:22,900
I mean,

405
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,260
in theory I shouldn't be sending email directly from

406
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,579
an E two instance I should probably be using,

407
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,280
you know, Amazon's simple email service.

408
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,619
Ses. Ok, that's fair.

409
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,900
But, you know, it's uh why bother setting it up just have post pic,

410
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:34,670
you know, post,

411
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,670
spit out the occasional email or whatever, right?

412
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,310
But yeah, I mean, so, you know, and

413
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,189
so the reality is this guy is like, well, I can't receive email from you and I'm like,

414
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:45,750
well, yeah, no, you can't go get it, go get a gmail address

415
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:48,810
and like sign up using that, you know, like I,

416
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,670
I'm not going to rejigger my entire email infrastructure, you know, to,

417
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,810
to do one person.

418
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,640
Um So I,

419
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,709
I think we're gonna see some of that eventually but I think it's

420
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:02,640
gonna look a bit different in the form more of like account hijacking

421
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,800
and then trying to use those that account's resources,

422
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:08,369
you know, to do something nefarious. Um

423
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,420
But it's probably gonna look more boring, like, probably like Bitcoin mining,

424
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:15,390
you know, because again, it goes back to the question of how do you monetize it?

425
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,859
So, I've hijacked your account.

426
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,859
Honestly, the one big way I can think of to monetize it is to resell it. Right.

427
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,290
Like, you know, cheap web hosting,

428
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,680
just go to this virtual server, you know, for the bad guys, right.

429
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,219
For bulletproof hosting or whatever.

430
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:30,739
But again, that stuff gets detected and taken down relatively quickly.

431
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,160
Right. I, I just, I don't see that as having a future because,

432
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:38,670
I mean, if you're spinning up any number of systems,

433
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:41,030
people are gonna notice when,

434
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,910
when the number of systems they have running went from, you know,

435
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:47,900
-- 1000 to 25,000 or so, or,
-- you know, they use the serverless stuff like LAMBDA.

436
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,709
And the thing is, um, a lot of people don't set, like, uh,

437
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:54,089
you can set on most of these cloud providers, you can set warnings, let's say, like,

438
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:54,930
look when I

439
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,650
hit a certain amount of billing, warn me, right?

440
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,010
Like, say, I normally spend 2000 bucks a month,

441
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,050
you know, warn me when I hit, say

442
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:05,170
2500 in case something goes haywire. Right?

443
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,699
I don't think a lot of people set those limits.

444
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:07,849
Um,

445
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:11,160
what's interesting is like a lot of these cloud providers do limit

446
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,579
how much resources you can use and spin up by default.

447
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,869
You know, I think with Amazon it's like 10 instances and you gotta ask nicely for more

448
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,989
or whatever, you know.

449
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,660
Uh, well, and I had like, first, uh,

450
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,709
simple email services I needed to send like 100 emails a day.

451
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,810
So I sent a nice, you know, I sent, filled in the form, like,

452
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:28,910
can I please have 100 emails a day?

453
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,910
And they're like, you can have 50,000 a day.

454
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,310
So I'm guessing that's like their, their sort of floor entry level. But yeah, I mean,

455
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,270
I, again, it comes back to how do you monetize this stuff?

456
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,390
And I can't think of a lot of good ways to monetize this, especially,

457
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:42,280
you know,

458
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,030
with these providers wanting to filter and prevent outgoing attacks so

459
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,079
that people don't block their IP S and like you said,

460
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:48,520
then,

461
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,359
you know, then they become much.

462
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:53,760
-- Well, they, they will lose business.
-- Well, and let's face it too.

463
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,280
And in all the predictions

464
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,800
I looked at last year,

465
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:58,640
I mean,

466
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,660
none of them really mentioned ransomware in any significant way and

467
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,640
let's face it 2016 was like the year of ransomware.

468
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,079
I mean, this is where cybercrime learned how to monetize what they do.

469
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:10,859
Yeah,

470
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:11,900
definitely.

471
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:15,780
And that's just the reality of it. I mean, in, in, in all seriousness,

472
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,859
I don't see it getting any better

473
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,900
next year

474
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,229
because I, I mean, I remember

475
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:24,369
almost certain,

476
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:26,790
I, I remember 2015

477
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,849
and ransomware just started coming out and it was kind of a

478
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,650
joke and it didn't work very well and we laughed at it.

479
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,989
I remember laughing at it being like this is stupid, you know, whatever.

480
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,459
And you look at it now and

481
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,390
it still has problems.

482
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,430
It's not great because I've read a number of

483
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,469
reports talking about the fact that in most instances,

484
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:47,339
the ransomware fails due to either backups or it

485
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,989
just doesn't encrypt the data correctly or whatever,

486
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,829
there's a reason.

487
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,719
But give them another year.

488
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:56,479
I mean, these guys are, they're innovating at an alarming rate

489
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,479
and

490
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,800
I, if, if it, if 2017 isn't the year of ransomware, 2018 probably will be

491
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:07,359
where it's like a huge problem unless we do something drastic to stop it.

492
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,859
And I don't know of anything

493
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,089
out there

494
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,319
that's ready to stop it.

495
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:13,920
Well, I'm kind of wondering.

496
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,810
So, for example, uh I keep a lot of my files in icloud right from my, you know, I devices

497
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:23,349
and I don't know exactly how icloud works on the back end with keeping snapshots.

498
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,819
But for example, if icloud transparently keeps like,

499
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:29,160
say snapshots going back forever or, you know, to whatever my,

500
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,479
my one terabyte limit is,

501
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,430
I can just roll back before the ransomware

502
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:35,109
without too much hassle

503
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,910
and, you know, and I won't bother paying them.

504
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,770
So I suspect we're gonna see a lot of innovation in ransomware.

505
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,380
You know, obviously they're gonna get better at actually encrypting the files.

506
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:46,109
Um, I suspect they're also gonna maybe get a bit quieter,

507
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,520
you know.

508
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,219
So for example,

509
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:50,550
they encrypt the files and decrypt them on the fly for say

510
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,030
a week or two to make sure that they're everywhere and then,

511
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,349
you know, flip the switch and say pay up or else,

512
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,890
you know, conversely then, you know,

513
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,260
maybe hopefully people can recover the decryption keys and stuff. But, um,

514
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:02,949
yeah, I suspect they will get better because, yeah,

515
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,640
it's been proven to work and generate money.

516
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,869
It's huge.

517
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,579
And what gets me is like, and I still haven't heard.

518
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:12,099
Um, so there was what the San Francisco, what was it called again? Not the

519
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,180
system?

520
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,760
-- Was
-- it Bart? I think it was

521
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:14,900
the,

522
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,510
it

523
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,369
is the Bay area rapid transit. That's the trains,

524
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,300
the municipal bus service or

525
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,390
service.

526
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:23,459
That's the one.

527
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,640
And so they got infected and they, they at the time had to pony up.

528
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,170
I think it was Bitcoin, whatever it was worth it was like 73 grand or something.

529
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:31,500
I mean, it,

530
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,130
it's got to have cost so much more to recover it manually.

531
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,300
-- So
-- rumor has it that they were, well, they, they stopped taking fares because they

532
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,560
still

533
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:41,869
need

534
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:42,119
to

535
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:42,920
confirm

536
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:45,800
and rumor has it. It was like half a million a day

537
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,849
they were dropping.

538
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,670
-- So
-- how did they ultimately resolve this?

539
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,709
Did they pay the ransom or did they get somebody in

540
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:53,589
to fix it or because that's what I haven't heard,

541
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:55,280
-- you know,
-- I don't know.

542
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,550
So maybe make a note we should check on that. But um

543
00:22:59,339 --> 00:22:59,550
yeah,

544
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,290
because I'm kind of wondering like honestly part of me if I was running that place,

545
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,869
I'd be like, part of me would be like,

546
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,619
let's just pay the ransom, get back up on our feet and fix it.

547
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,420
You know, the old part of me was like, no, you know, you do not pay the kidnappers.

548
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,170
We don't negotiate with terrorists kind of deal.

549
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,880
But the reality is like, as a business,

550
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:15,069
you know.

551
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,709
Yeah, it would be great if everybody didn't pay because these people would stop.

552
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,609
right. If nobody paid, they would stop doing it.

553
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:23,790
Um,

554
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:29,119
but on the flip side, you know, the tragedy of the commons, if you know, well, I don't,

555
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,099
if I pay then I'm, I'm out of here and I'm, I'm done for the day.

556
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,680
You know, I don't have to spend like a month fixing everything.

557
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:35,750
So, according

558
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,599
to this, this website, I just found

559
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,719
the Muni folks restored from backup. They refused to pay the ransomware.

560
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:46,140
Glad

561
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:46,770
to hear that

562
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,290
man. So, I,

563
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,869
I'm really torn over this because

564
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,400
they lost probably millions on this attack and for 70

565
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,910
grand they probably could have made it go away.

566
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,270
Well, stupid question though.

567
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,010
But isn't the whole point of having backups that A,

568
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,680
you have backups and b you can restore them quickly and painless.

569
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:08,410
So, you know what, when I was a youngster,

570
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,869
backups were one of the things I got stuck with

571
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,719
because you always give the new guy the crap job.

572
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:17,829
And I learned a ton about doing backups and it is in

573
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:23,199
it. It reminds me of key management in a way where it's really easy to do wrong

574
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,800
and almost impossible to do. Right.

575
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:26,430
I

576
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,109
think it's worse than that because even when you're doing it wrong,

577
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,020
it looks like you're doing it right until you actually have to do a

578
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:36,160
proper recovery. Like, not a test recovery but like a legit, like

579
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:38,079
-- something went wrong.
-- And

580
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:39,719
I mean, so, so you say that and like,

581
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,739
that's one of the things I did is I would do bare metal

582
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:44,270
restarts of,

583
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,349
you know, critical systems and things like that.

584
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,800
And of course everyone I worked with is like a stupid new guy.

585
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,550
And I'm like, no, no, like this is, and

586
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,709
it saved her behind

587
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,185
more than once or,

588
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:56,785
or the other one nobody realizes is when you do tape backups,

589
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:59,775
you need two drives because you do the backup on one

590
00:24:59,785 --> 00:25:02,104
drive and then you verify the backup on the second drive.

591
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,224
Because what happens is the way tapes work.

592
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:07,074
If the, if the reader right head becomes misaligned

593
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:12,324
now, no other tape drive on the planet can read or write that data correctly

594
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:13,555
because of the way it is

595
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:13,895
your,

596
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:17,584
well, that's just it, right? If you lose the tape drive

597
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:23,140
and in another tape drive can't read your tapes. You now have a box full of plastic.

598
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:24,109
Yeah.

599
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,130
No, when I worked for the government,

600
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,380
they had uh 50 or 100 years of historical data on these, uh, tapes,

601
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,750
they were like 100 megabyte tapes.

602
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,239
And I believe there was one tape drive in the

603
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,550
province that the government owned that would read these,

604
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,329
man, you've got to get that stuff

605
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:37,780
off

606
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,479
if you're lucky. Right. Assuming the drive still runs, I think

607
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,030
you didn't like NASA,

608
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,930
someone have that problem where they had all this data and they're like,

609
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:48,880
we got to get it off because, you know,

610
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,079
in 10 years this stuff just this gear isn't going to exist.

611
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,489
Yeah.

612
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:55,380
Well, it's like five and a quarter inch floppy drives.

613
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:56,079
I mean,

614
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,430
can you imagine having to find a working five and a quarter inch floppy drive?

615
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:03,000
And then the big question is, what do you plug it into?

616
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm pretty sure I can't buy a computer with, um, an isa interface

617
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,310
-- or with a five and a quarter floppy drive interface
-- anymore.

618
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:14,849
I would go to a local grade school

619
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,069
to see their equipment.

620
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:20,550
Yeah. Go basically computer mining in the, uh,

621
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,670
please let me into your basement.

622
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,229
I need one of your old computers.

623
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:26,589
Yeah.

624
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,339
-- So, no, seriously,
-- seriously.

625
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:31,079
But that's because the reality for me is like, you know, if,

626
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,619
if you get hit by ransomware, it should literally be like, ok,

627
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,989
we just have to figure out when this ransomware hit and then

628
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,680
ideally it was recent, you know,

629
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:41,520
so we're not losing a week of work or two days of work or whatever,

630
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,250
but we can just roll back to pre ransomware.

631
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,750
And then also more importantly, you know, prevent it from getting in again,

632
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,849
which I guess mostly in these cases, you know, means

633
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,089
preventing Janice from accounting, running dancing.

634
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,790
-- Hamster dot exc, which some nice Russian guy emailed
-- her

635
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,390
whatever dude. I want to see that hamster dance,

636
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,670
which I guess this kind of leads us. So let's, let's keep going.

637
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,479
We don't, we don't need to burn all our time on this. But

638
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,339
so let's move on to the Gartner stuff because Gartner their, their predictions are,

639
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:09,910
are interesting because they, they're multiyear predictions.

640
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,339
And

641
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:13,609
the number, the top one here is that through 2020

642
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,660
which is

643
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,229
closer than we think. Now

644
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,949
it says 99% of vulnerabilities exploited will continue to be ones

645
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:24,670
known by security and it professionals for at least one year.

646
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:28,089
-- And I think ransomware ties into this.
-- I have to agree

647
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:28,329
with that.

648
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,810
That's totally true. And I think it's always going to be true.

649
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:35,770
Well, the economics are simple, right? A zero day is going to cost you 50 to 100 grand,

650
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,410
right?

651
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:39,270
And then it will for sure, let you get into like almost everybody.

652
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,619
Although, you know, some subset won't click on it or won't download it or,

653
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:45,489
or will have some, you know, extra security that prevents it.

654
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,439
And you get basically the exact same infection rate using the known vulnerability.

655
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,219
It's

656
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,760
just spam it out, you know,

657
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:55,439
just take 10 million people instead of 1 million people.

658
00:27:55,449 --> 00:27:58,380
And this is obviously, I mean, I mean, this is totally,

659
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,140
this comes back to all the economics of

660
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,160
the bad guys have to run their business as well.

661
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,439
So they're going to pick the cheaper option. Right.

662
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,160
Well, and also the easier option, right?

663
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,959
Like the level of skill needed to use an existing flaw is uh well, basically zero,

664
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,750
right? There's kits or there's, you know,

665
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:17,459
there's meta

666
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,020
um,

667
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,199
versus the, the expertise needed to find a zero day.

668
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:23,199
Like, you know,

669
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:26,599
you have to be at least this tall to get on the ride or at least this tall to, you know,

670
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:27,949
have 100 grand to go buy one.

671
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:31,560
Oh, seriously. Well, yeah. But even if you had it, what do you do with it then, I mean,

672
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,079
it's nontrivial to actually use this

673
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,560
stuff correctly and more importantly is protected

674
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,599
because as soon as your exploit gets out, it's worth $0.

675
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,640
Well, yeah, I mean, especially, uh, the big guys like Microsoft and Apple, you know,

676
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,709
they are like, very actively monitoring, you know,

677
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:50,920
all those telemetry systems that send back data, crash data and stuff.

678
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,640
I think the reality is, is that these zero days

679
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:58,290
exploits are gonna mostly be used by state actors.

680
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:58,890
Right?

681
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,729
Because they're the people who are like 100 grand to go, you know,

682
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:05,290
mess with some journalists. Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

683
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:09,800
They have infinite money. Exactly. They, they, they don't care how much it costs,

684
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,819
you know, and especially in some of these parts of the world where, yeah,

685
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:16,010
they have quite a bit of money that they've historically been willing to spend on.

686
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:19,430
-- Not very nice.
-- We'll get to the, the state level. One is,

687
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,689
I don't,

688
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,839
one of these predictions talked about the election

689
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,660
and which was, yeah, which election?

690
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:30,819
So it was dark reading

691
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,369
in their predictions said a cyber attack

692
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,619
will impact the 2016 presidential election.

693
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:38,900
And I think

694
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:41,469
in 2015,

695
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:45,270
I would have accused them of being a bit tinfoil hat to say that.

696
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:51,790
And in 2017, I'm like, I won't say that's a hard, yes. But it's probably a holy crap.

697
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,869
I think that might be. Right.

698
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,199
Well,

699
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,000
so I've done a lot of reading on election machines.

700
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,040
-- No, no,
-- not, not the machines, not the machines,

701
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:02,609
the machines are untouchable because they're so crappy

702
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,040
and they're so different

703
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,000
that it would be like you would need to literally hack

704
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,920
millions of completely different computers that are all terrible and,

705
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,430
and you probably can't even get any exploits to

706
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,239
work on them because they're just going to crash.

707
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:15,719
Right.

708
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,520
So my,

709
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,229
my fear has always been that they're not gonna

710
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:20,099
go directly after the machines even though they could.

711
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:20,479
But that,

712
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,430
you know, there's, there's subtle things you can do like there.

713
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,979
-- I mean,
-- either the, one of the parties

714
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,510
-- or,
-- you know, voter registration list. Right.

715
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,079
Because for example, even a 0.1 or 0.2% shift in the number of,

716
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:35,560
say Democrats or Republicans registered in an area.

717
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,000
-- Some of those races were tight.
-- They're all tight, man. It's basically,

718
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,839
well, I mean, some of them were decided by less than 1000 votes.

719
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,640
And

720
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,000
so even a minor shift there of like, just somehow getting those people not to vote

721
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:52,380
-- could be the deciding factor. It would,
-- it would be very significant.

722
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,199
But I think regardless of that,

723
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:57,760
there were events around this election involving

724
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,119
cyberattacks.

725
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,260
-- Well, the,
-- the, the DN

726
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:05,209
the Democratic National Convention Party, uh, you know, what is it?

727
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,660
John Podesta got hacked

728
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:09,219
with a targeted phishing email link where, yeah,

729
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:12,609
it was basically go click on this link to reset your password and he,

730
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,079
he sent it to the it guys and the it guys

731
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:17,900
meant to say, do not click that it's

732
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,489
a illegitimate link

733
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,329
and accidentally put

734
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,430
like it's a legitimate link. And so he clicked on it and entered his stuff and whoops.

735
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,010
Well, there you go. His email got hacked.

736
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,770
So, you know, it, it comes back to a lot of that.

737
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,540
Like, I'm worried more about these subtle influences where you don't,

738
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,040
you don't need to hack all the voting machines and like, be like, oh, you know, uh,

739
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:37,280
you know, co

740
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,500
boast the alien won by a landslide.

741
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,829
You know what

742
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:41,949
I voted for

743
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,500
king.

744
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,500
Yeah, exactly. I voted for the lesser of two evils.

745
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,010
But yeah, these, these more subtle hacks, like voter registration lists, uh,

746
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,430
things like, well, you know, like the republicans and the democratic conventions.

747
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:53,739
I mean,

748
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,920
there are some major choices being made there, like, which, you know,

749
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,400
candidate they're going to run,

750
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,719
which obviously are going to have a huge impact on the election, you know, like,

751
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,229
yeah, that's right.

752
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,349
And I think that's what, so, so, you know what,

753
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:10,290
this always reminds me of is metadata matters.

754
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,670
We, we obsess over,

755
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:16,589
I guess what we'll call the target where there's the one big thing we worry about,

756
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,630
but in reality,

757
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,459
that's not that important. If you can start doing things all around your target,

758
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:27,170
you can affect that, be it metadata or in this case,

759
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:31,829
releasing information, uh, about one party when let's face it, like they're both

760
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,300
terribly

761
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:32,560
releasing.

762
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,719
-- Right.
-- Exactly.

763
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:35,974
Releasing information so that people only get one part of the.

764
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:39,665
-- Right. Right. You know, exactly.
-- Like they're, they're all terrible. None of

765
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:42,545
them. One of them isn't way better than the other.

766
00:32:42,555 --> 00:32:42,944
-- Oh,
-- I mean,

767
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:45,395
the reality is you go through anybody's email spool and you can find at least

768
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:48,175
one or two emails taken out of context that are going to get them fired.

769
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,125
I

770
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:52,104
have no doubt you could do that.

771
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,609
Absolutely.

772
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:57,560
It's, yeah, these, and, and the reality is though, I mean, the,

773
00:32:57,739 --> 00:33:00,209
like I live in Canada and so we have, you know, it's nice.

774
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:02,569
We have a federally mandated election system that consists of,

775
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:05,369
here's a piece of paper with names on it and circles next to the names,

776
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,800
you make a cross in one of the circles, not two of the circles, not a check mark,

777
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,939
not a smiley face, not a poop emoji, but just an X.

778
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,750
Then you fold a piece of paper and

779
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:16,770
put it in the ballot box and you're done,

780
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:17,750
right? And that's

781
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,880
-- hard to hack, especially of scale,
-- remarkably efficient.

782
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,150
It is super efficient. It, voting is very quick typically.

783
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,260
But where things do fall down, for example,

784
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,489
is quite often students have trouble voting

785
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:34,859
because, you know, do they have ID that's local to the area, right?

786
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:38,369
They might be from out of province or, you know, and do they have like,

787
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,030
so then they're like, oh,

788
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,689
you can bring like a utility bill but like if you live in student housing,

789
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:43,630
you don't have a utility bill.

790
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:46,410
Voter ID, we could fill

791
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,599
hundreds of shows, especially in the United States around that topic.

792
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,949
Yeah.

793
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:54,780
So basically what it boils down to is pretty much every election

794
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,160
system is going to have this problem where there's all these like

795
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,800
extra systems that happen sort of before the voting

796
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:03,400
that, like I said, I think one or 2%

797
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,339
changes in them could seriously throw,

798
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:06,920
you know,

799
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,438
especially local elections that are hotly contested like that one we

800
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,620
had in Calgary where it was a one vote difference,

801
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:14,139
like the literal definition of democracy.

802
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:15,899
Oh, yeah, they had so many recounts.

803
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,379
Oh, my

804
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,449
-- goodness.
-- Because, like, yeah, they were like, we just, we can't believe this.

805
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,040
And, um,

806
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,070
you know, personally part of me likes, uh, what was it?

807
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,938
I think it was they do in some Middle Eastern countries

808
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,780
where basically you vote and you dip your thumb in ink.

809
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,699
Yes.

810
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:29,659
Right. Indelibly.

811
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:32,389
And it's like we don't care who you are, where you're from.

812
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,110
Just, you know, one person, one vote

813
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:34,520
on

814
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:35,340
time.

815
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,580
That type of voter fraud basically doesn't exist.

816
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:40,820
Well, but

817
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,020
in the sense of you could then get rid of all those extra ancillary systems.

818
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
-- They're now not needed. Like
-- we don't

819
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:46,860
need

820
00:34:46,978 --> 00:34:47,050
to do

821
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,208
voter

822
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:47,879
registration.

823
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:51,339
No registration. Now, the, the downfall you

824
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:53,168
that is for

825
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,498
people to lose their minds. Right.

826
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:59,618
-- Right over someone carting people in from somewhere else to vote,
-- which again,

827
00:34:59,628 --> 00:35:00,858
barely ever happens.

828
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:04,999
It would be more democratic to let anyone vote and dip their finger in ink.

829
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:09,448
But I think due to politics that would never catch on and let's face it.

830
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,499
It's all about politics. Right.

831
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:15,898
It's all about the politics which now this brings us to the next point

832
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,959
on the dark reading list

833
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,659
is they talk about balkanization of the internet, which

834
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:24,949
I don't think that even came up last year.

835
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,929
But I'm,

836
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:33,459
I'm wondering if the, the RNS um or if the DNC hack by, by Russia is going to

837
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,939
bring this conversation to the top,

838
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,080
I think. Yes and no. So there was a couple incidents of

839
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:44,189
countries taking themselves offline, uh, for whatever reason,

840
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:47,649
like they were rioting coup elections, that kind of thing going on.

841
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:51,949
But the majority of them came back online because I, the, the reality is you can't

842
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,929
not be on the internet anymore if you want to be part of the world,

843
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:58,020
if people want to take and give shipping orders, right.

844
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,149
Forcing them to go back to phone

845
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,449
lines.

846
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:02,290
This isn't exactly the same thing.

847
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,159
It's one thing when you have a essentially dictator,

848
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:09,050
government cut off the internet to prevent dissent.

849
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:10,919
But this is more

850
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,679
where governments try to pretend there's borders in the internet and you want like,

851
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:18,520
like the United States wants to keep out Russia.

852
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:21,100
Well, so for example, things like, um oh

853
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,239
jeez, I keep forgetting, I keep referencing it, Google's project.

854
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,639
Um The one with no,

855
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,040
essentially they,

856
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,699
they accept that their network is even their

857
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:31,000
internal networks are like essentially public networks.

858
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:31,600
And so they,

859
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,959
they stop pretending like they have a network perimeter

860
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:36,340
and they put the perimeter down like the application level

861
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,070
beyond

862
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,110
-- Corp,
-- beyond Corp. Yes.

863
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,969
Um You know,

864
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:42,100
things like the cloud security lines does uh

865
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,409
has a project too called software defined perimeters.

866
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:45,229
And the idea is

867
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,879
uh let's say you have a, a large application running in the cloud, right?

868
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:53,510
It's gonna have for the sake of it's gonna have a database, a middleware layer,

869
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,909
a presentation layer, a

870
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,209
logging piece you know, all, all that standard stuff that makes up an enterprise,

871
00:36:59,219 --> 00:36:59,620
the app,

872
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:04,100
well, you don't control the network anymore. You know, it's in the cloud

873
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,020
so you can't really just stick a firewall in front of it.

874
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,610
So the idea is that you bring the firewall down to the

875
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,399
application level and essentially sort of create like an application level,

876
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:16,360
virtual private network so that the various pieces can talk to each other

877
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,040
and only to each other and anybody else trying to talk to them

878
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,219
doesn't have the right certificate or prime number key or whatever essentially.

879
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,750
And you know, just can't attack it until they

880
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:29,520
get through that first layer of encryption and authentication.

881
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:32,179
You know, and of course, if you deploy this properly,

882
00:37:32,189 --> 00:37:33,459
it solves a whole bunch of problems.

883
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:35,590
That's not the balkanization of the internet.

884
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,750
That's like you, you're just segregating every single system.

885
00:37:39,149 --> 00:37:41,600
Yeah. And I think that's what's going to happen is, you know,

886
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:44,699
-- smart companies like Google have already accepted this.
-- Yes. But, but

887
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,080
you're talking about a smart company and I'm

888
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,159
talking about what happens when some politician from

889
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:54,879
the middle of nowhere who thinks the internet is a series of tubes decides to say that

890
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:58,000
we shouldn't allow immigrant packets into the country

891
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,620
and that's just not gonna work.

892
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,989
We know that.

893
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:03,669
But the thing is, it's just, here's the thing, even if,

894
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,879
let's say for the sake of argument, we build the great firewall of America

895
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,479
of you know, the USA

896
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:11,560
and we block for the sake of argument. We block Russia.

897
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,340
Well, there, how do you deal with all the VPN providers?

898
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:15,159
Yes,

899
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:21,409
-- it is. Definitely. Right.
-- II, I pay, I think it's 10 bucks a month for who is it?

900
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:22,540
I think it's tour guard over,

901
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:23,600
like,

902
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,510
every plant, like, they're in every country on the planet.

903
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,979
You know, I think they have something like 1000 end points.

904
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:30,659
I don't even know or care to be honest.

905
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,790
And so

906
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,909
that's the thing. Right? Like, um, are we going to start, like,

907
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,860
you have to label packets

908
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:40,110
or, you know, by their geographic region

909
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,540
for the evil bit?

910
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:42,149
Yeah.

911
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,060
You know, well, we already have geographical IP databases but again, you know,

912
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,459
VPN providers, like,

913
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,169
and are you gonna block, you know, what's Amazon gonna do?

914
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,290
Right. Like

915
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,790
Amazon gonna

916
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:56,330
look, let's face the reality.

917
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,699
It can't be done.

918
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,489
And luckily it hasn't been talked about yet and let's hope

919
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,050
it doesn't get talked about because anyone with any freaking sense knows

920
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:06,649
it's completely ridiculous.

921
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:07,739
Right.

922
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,620
Well, it's not just ridiculous. It's,

923
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,379
and this is what I find really offensive. It's not cost effective.

924
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:15,139
There are better ways to deal with this. Yeah, definitely.

925
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:15,739
You know,

926
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,520
if it could work then I'd be like, well, maybe we should talk about it.

927
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,060
But the reality is even if you spent the money trying to make it work,

928
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,199
it wouldn't work.

929
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,100
Now, now

930
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:26,870
that actually leads to the, the one dark reading point I wanted to

931
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,860
get to in this discussion is,

932
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,419
it says a shake out of security industry, snake oil sales people.

933
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:37,699
It's not gonna happen, it'll never happen. Every industry is one of these guys.

934
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,780
It's just, it's how it is,

935
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,870
it's going, you know, again, that,

936
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,320
that security course I took on economics has been really

937
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,260
interesting because they actually cover this point a lot.

938
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:52,340
And basically what it boils down to is there is a huge level of information asymmetry

939
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,479
in the security product market,

940
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:57,459
you know, like uh antivirus is a great example.

941
00:39:57,939 --> 00:40:01,290
How many viruses do you detect? That used to be a meaningful question?

942
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,000
Now, that question doesn't even mean anything because these guys are, you know,

943
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,310
auto

944
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:06,360
generating new viruses on the fly,

945
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:11,290
you know, or um and then, you know, Tavis Ormandy starts looking at the anti

946
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:11,500
virus

947
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,199
scanners and he's like, oh my God, you know,

948
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:16,250
these things have like unpack running in the kernel,

949
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,479
you know, because speed

950
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,419
or one of them used, what was it? Um

951
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,020
They changed some string operation to be the insecure one because it's faster.

952
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,280
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah, it was uh they used string copy instead of STRN or no string.

953
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:32,590
Was it string copy? But yeah, it was the STR versus the STRN variant

954
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,889
because it was like 1% faster.

955
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:35,540
Yeah,

956
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:39,399
and that is something that does get benchmarked on antivirus scans

957
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:41,149
is speed of scanning, you know,

958
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,080
so the reality is, and,

959
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,959
and the second problem too is you don't find out that the product is garbage until,

960
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,080
well after purchase.

961
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:48,959
Yes.

962
00:40:49,419 --> 00:40:52,810
And, and let's face it too. I know. I, I read, I just read a thing the other day.

963
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,800
I don't remember where this was, but they were saying that

964
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,050
this, this group was recounting

965
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:00,570
the process of investigating purchasing a security product.

966
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,969
And they said at the end of the day, they just pick the sales guy, they like the best

967
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:06,899
of backup software, right?

968
00:41:06,909 --> 00:41:11,389
Like until you actually do like a full disaster recovery level backup and restore,

969
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:12,689
you don't know if it works or not.

970
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:13,889
Right. Right.

971
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,250
Absolutely.

972
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,169
So,

973
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:20,209
no, the reality is, and, and even if you know, people get shaken out,

974
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:22,389
there's always newcomers with new products and

975
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,909
new technologies that are just garbage.

976
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:24,169
Like,

977
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,560
-- all
-- right. So no, let, let's, I'm gonna use this as a transition point.

978
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,250
Speaking of shakeouts and new technology is trend micro.

979
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,199
One of their predictions was ad blocking will

980
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:36,370
shake up the advertising business model and kill

981
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,729
mad advertisements.

982
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,689
Yeah, that's a big old

983
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,020
-- weird
-- to me. Is that

984
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:43,040
what I find the weirdest is that there's still

985
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,070
people who don't browse with an ad blocker,

986
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,260
but,

987
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,770
but it's not just that is the solution to

988
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,199
ad blocking wasn't to clean up the ad business.

989
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:54,219
It was to create ad blocker blockers, right? Like that's just,

990
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:55,179
and now,

991
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,245
now we all run ad blocker blocker blockers. Right.

992
00:41:58,254 --> 00:41:59,564
And it's just gonna, like, it,

993
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:02,824
it's like insane section where we're just gonna

994
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:05,524
keep going another level deep where we're just,

995
00:42:05,554 --> 00:42:09,185
they're going to get another level of ad blocking detection and

996
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:12,274
we're going to get another level of blocking their detection.

997
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:14,875
I, what's interesting to me is, I mean,

998
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:17,655
this whole advertising model basically exists because we

999
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:20,145
don't have micro payments or micro transactions to,

1000
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:23,229
you know, so that the newspaper can make money when you read it. Right.

1001
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,449
-- So
-- they computer with ransomware and I'll pay you. Yeah,

1002
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:25,989
exactly.

1003
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:26,620
It's fine.

1004
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:27,919
You know.

1005
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:32,149
And so I hate, I mean, part of me wants, for example, a good strong free press to,

1006
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:32,280
you know,

1007
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,679
dig out the nasty things politicians do and embarrass

1008
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:35,840
them so they don't do it so much.

1009
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,959
-- But this is
-- why I get the newspaper delivered to my house every day.

1010
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:42,199
-- Yeah.
-- But I can't help but think that that might be a dead business model

1011
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:42,659
and

1012
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,320
it's totally dead business model. I would,

1013
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:47,669
I, I don't know any young people.

1014
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,300
I'm the only person I know under the age of like 50 that gets the,

1015
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,790
the like dead tree newspaper brought to their home every day.

1016
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:57,629
So, I don't know, maybe the future is more things like wikileaks or something I,

1017
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,370
I can't say.

1018
00:42:58,379 --> 00:42:59,060
But, um,

1019
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:03,419
yeah, I, you know, it's, I, I think like many people, they mean, well,

1020
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:05,830
just their execution has been less than perfect.

1021
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,310
It's,

1022
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:09,189
it's very hard to do some of that stuff correctly.

1023
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:11,429
And so I'm at least sensitive to that.

1024
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:11,989
Right.

1025
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,620
But, uh,

1026
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,030
no, I think, um,

1027
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,550
yeah, like the ad blocking thing, I mean,

1028
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:21,760
like even mobile devices now support ad blockers like that was recently added

1029
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,860
in Apple's IO si think last year the support for ad blockers and,

1030
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:26,040
um,

1031
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:29,739
I don't think Android is quite as friendly there for some reason.

1032
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,050
Weird. Why would Google? not? Huh.

1033
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:33,770
Weird.

1034
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,530
But, yeah, I mean, because, and part of it for me now is I don't want ads on my devices,

1035
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,419
not so much because of the ads, but just

1036
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:44,459
the, the, I have a very finite amount of attention span.

1037
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:46,330
Well, not only that they're so intrusive,

1038
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,449
they take up so much space and they always

1039
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,010
slow things down when they load that stupid ad.

1040
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,600
Well, and the best is like right now on my ipad, because I have an old ipad.

1041
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,389
I cannot put ad blocking on,

1042
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,129
I get two youtube ads

1043
00:43:58,659 --> 00:43:59,439
and only two,

1044
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:01,100
one is fake.

1045
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:02,290
You know,

1046
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:06,020
one of them is the government of Alberta ad on sustainable energy

1047
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,719
and how great the carbon tax is and all that stuff,

1048
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:08,760
which I actually agree with.

1049
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,840
So, like, you can stop showing me the ad. I'm in favor of this

1050
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,139
and the second ad is for some sort of

1051
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,780
online financial service that, and I quote,

1052
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,439
it's like having a bank in your own house and I'm like,

1053
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,399
how else do you do banking anymore?

1054
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:22,949
Like, of course,

1055
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:26,250
it's like having a bank in your house because you have a laptop or a tablet or a phone.

1056
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,639
And, like,

1057
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,360
that's how people bank now.

1058
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,629
Like, I paid the rent yesterday with, like, I was, like, on my phone.

1059
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:32,830
I'm like, oh, I should go pay the rent.

1060
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,669
Maybe the system has decided you're like, in your eighties

1061
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:36,959
to

1062
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:37,530
online

1063
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:40,679
-- banking.
-- Yeah. Maybe, I don't know, maybe looking at,

1064
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,189
yeah.

1065
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,739
But, and, but the thing that kills me is I only see those two ads. That's it.

1066
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,590
I don't see any other ads for last month.

1067
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,399
It's funny you bring that up is so,

1068
00:44:48,409 --> 00:44:53,530
my wife and I were watching funny youtube videos one night on the couch and on our,

1069
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,580
our smart TV, connected to the internet

1070
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,709
and

1071
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:59,360
they kept showing ads for, like,

1072
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,439
really old people and it was clear that

1073
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:05,189
the targeted demographic here was probably 60 plus

1074
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,500
in the various products that

1075
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:10,179
it was like 11 o'clock at night. I mean, it was pretty

1076
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:10,409
late

1077
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:15,080
and I just looked at her. I'm like, I have no idea what's going on right now. Like, why

1078
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:18,679
Google knows who we are, right. Like, they know,

1079
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,610
and

1080
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:23,239
I will never purchase any of this crap that they're showing here.

1081
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:24,760
It was, it was crazy.

1082
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:25,429
Yeah.

1083
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:28,389
No, I mean, it's, I've been reading about this because there's a lot more, you know,

1084
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:32,080
people are looking at, like, brand influence instead of like, outright, you know,

1085
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,439
getting you to click on it and buy something. Right.

1086
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:36,320
So, putting that like ID in your head and,

1087
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:37,610
and, but, you know,

1088
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,530
the dirty secret is we have no idea how well this works if it works at all.

1089
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,070
-- Right.
-- Well, you know, it does work. All right.

1090
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,330
So I actually I told this to someone the other day is, I am doing

1091
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:47,449
research

1092
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,590
into a security topic and part of it has involved

1093
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,570
me watching episodes of Star Trek the next generation.

1094
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:54,090
Ok.

1095
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,459
And I know this sounds hilarious.

1096
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,949
Terrible security on that show.

1097
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,610
Yeah, I know. Anyway. So it's part of it. Right. When I was a kid

1098
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:05,370
I would watch Star Trek obviously on broadcast television

1099
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,449
and they do the intro

1100
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:09,169
and then they'd play, you know,

1101
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:12,209
the little music and all that stuff and then it would go to a tide commercial

1102
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,989
every single time.

1103
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:15,250
-- And I
-- still,

1104
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:16,659
when you say a tide commercial,

1105
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,149
like

1106
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:19,800
the laundry detergent,

1107
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,250
a tide commercial.

1108
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,899
And even now it's been like,

1109
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:30,290
probably 25 years since I watched Star Trek on broadcast television.

1110
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,510
I still wait for the tide commercial to play

1111
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:36,689
when the intro. I'm, I'm totally serious. Like,

1112
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:39,449
I, I understand the power of this stuff. Right.

1113
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:39,939
Because, like,

1114
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:42,409
I am now brainwashed that when I watch Star Trek

1115
00:46:42,419 --> 00:46:44,770
there's going to be a tide commercial after the intro.

1116
00:46:44,939 --> 00:46:46,050
Like, seriously.

1117
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,189
Yeah, it works.

1118
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,110
Yeah.

1119
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,209
So I, I just,

1120
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:52,040
I think the whole advertising model is gonna have to

1121
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,629
evolve a bit and become a bit nicer because it,

1122
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:56,949
it reminds me of, you know, every time I travel to America,

1123
00:46:56,959 --> 00:47:00,649
one thing you guys have that we don't is those giant roadside billboards

1124
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:01,479
are

1125
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,790
terrible. And we have big roadside billboards in Canada.

1126
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,070
But they're not like on this, like,

1127
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,229
like one or 200 ft tall poles.

1128
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:09,510
You know what I mean?

1129
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,379
-- Like those really tall ones, like,
-- like everything America does it best. Right.

1130
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:14,070
Yeah.

1131
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:17,750
-- And I just find that so bizarre and ugly. Oh, they're
-- terrible, man.

1132
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,199
They're so annoying. I hate them all. So.

1133
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,669
And, um, yeah, I mean,

1134
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,189
what really gets me going and curious about the future is with augmented reality.

1135
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:27,750
But we have ad blockers

1136
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,870
because that would be lovely. Didn't,

1137
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,000
it's already been done in the lab, essentially.

1138
00:47:33,129 --> 00:47:34,959
Some guy in Toronto was doing it. I think

1139
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:40,379
there, well, there have been a handful of, of movies and, and TV,

1140
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:43,110
shows that kind of deal with this where they

1141
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,919
show augmented reality ads based upon who you are.

1142
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,090
I didn't, didn't

1143
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:49,090
we already see that?

1144
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,409
There's, uh, the L CD billboards that, like,

1145
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:53,500
look at kind of how old you are and stuff like that?

1146
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,889
Sure. Yeah. And that's just real reality. Even

1147
00:47:57,379 --> 00:47:58,909
-- crazy, man. So
-- that's happening.

1148
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:01,620
I mean, but, you know, I like the idea of having, like,

1149
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,379
augmented reality and never seeing a mcdonald's again in my life.

1150
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:05,600
I, that's

1151
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,620
that would be interesting. You could,

1152
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:12,060
yeah, you could block out a lot of things. Couldn't, don't show me fast food.

1153
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,050
I don't want to see poor people anymore.

1154
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,899
Or homeless people or that, that could be crazy.

1155
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,110
Yeah, it'll happen. I mean,

1156
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,530
oh, man.

1157
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,570
Yeah, it'll be,

1158
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,360
oh,

1159
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,330
I, I could see a lot of bad coming of that because you could,

1160
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,179
you could legitimately just hide the things you don't want to see.

1161
00:48:28,189 --> 00:48:31,010
Like, like you don't want to see hungry little kids begging for money.

1162
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,040
Yeah, they look like park benches now. No big deal.

1163
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:33,909
That's

1164
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:34,659
right.

1165
00:48:35,189 --> 00:48:37,169
That's right. They're dogs jumping around. Uh,

1166
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,530
they, man.

1167
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:40,290
Yeah. No, thats

1168
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,149
when I started thinking about some of this stuff, it's just like, II,

1169
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:45,520
I have to stop and just

1170
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:47,149
take a break from life.

1171
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,290
They, they kind of covered this in. You ever watch Black Mirror?

1172
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:51,030
I

1173
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:51,429
do

1174
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,469
the new, the latest season that just came out on Netflix.

1175
00:48:54,479 --> 00:48:56,149
They've got the, the war episode.

1176
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:58,530
That kind of covers that where they use augmented

1177
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,580
reality to make the enemy look like monsters.

1178
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:04,909
I, I actually skipped that episode because I found it rather disturbing.

1179
00:49:04,919 --> 00:49:07,689
-- I still need to watch it. It's pretty
-- messed up. I'm not gonna lie to you.

1180
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:08,409
I

1181
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,310
saw where they were going.

1182
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,120
Yeah,

1183
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:13,419
that's one thing I like about Black Mirror.

1184
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:16,320
It's the only show that legitimately makes

1185
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,229
me feel uncomfortable watching it where,

1186
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:19,800
especially some of the episodes where I'm like, yeah,

1187
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,750
that's actually we could do that today.

1188
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,969
That, that social media one. It was the first episode of the new season.

1189
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:26,639
I'm like, that's like real, that's,

1190
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,550
that's today.

1191
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:28,459
Right. They just,

1192
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:31,510
they basically just took what's happening now and they

1193
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,899
-- added a little bit of a twist
-- to it.

1194
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:35,489
Well, it, it's going on in China, right? With the, uh the, the,

1195
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:36,770
the, the citizen,

1196
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:41,320
right? So it's essentially that score of like, how good of a citizen are you? Are you

1197
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:42,219
online?

1198
00:49:43,169 --> 00:49:43,689
You know?

1199
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:49,739
So it's uh yeah, I mean, well, I mean, look at, you know, the US Customs, what is it?

1200
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,540
Immigration, customs enforcement agency wants, you know,

1201
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,729
access to people's social media profiles.

1202
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:54,790
Y

1203
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,340
yeah,

1204
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,590
that's right. And currently it's just noncitizen but I mean, give it time. Right.

1205
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,729
Boil the frog man.

1206
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,459
Yeah. So,

1207
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,439
yeah, like I know returning to Canada,

1208
00:50:04,449 --> 00:50:08,020
the Canada Border Services agency has every single

1209
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,449
right to go through all my electronic devices and

1210
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:13,340
ask for my passwords and if I don't give it to them then that's a problem.

1211
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,010
Uh What,

1212
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:17,889
what they can do is they can just be like, ok, you don't get your devices back,

1213
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:19,899
you know, because we want to know what's on them,

1214
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:24,320
-- you know. And so like, yeah, I tend to wipe stuff or
-- I don't, I don't

1215
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:25,439
very sanitized.

1216
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,070
I purposely,

1217
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:27,850
I,

1218
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,530
I've got clean gear anytime I go through an airport

1219
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,770
because I know that this is certainly a risk.

1220
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,929
Oh, yeah. My traveling laptop is so boring.

1221
00:50:35,189 --> 00:50:35,330
Yeah.

1222
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,290
Right. Right. Yep. Exactly.

1223
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:40,000
But again, with the way cloud works now it's,

1224
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:42,000
it's not like it used to be.

1225
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,689
I mean, I guess funny enough the,

1226
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:46,889
now that the authorities care about this kind of stuff, it's kind of irrelevant.

1227
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,570
Well, yeah, I mean, the, the reality is like, I mean, oh, a great example is my, like,

1228
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,840
my photos, I don't keep my photos on my devices anymore.

1229
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,080
It's, they're not big enough,

1230
00:50:55,209 --> 00:50:55,899
-- you know,
-- I have

1231
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,659
is I have my photos backed up in several locations because

1232
00:51:00,669 --> 00:51:03,469
one of my fears is I've heard stories of like Google

1233
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:06,159
deciding you're a bad person and they just kill your account

1234
00:51:06,169 --> 00:51:08,469
and like it's gone and you don't get it back.

1235
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,219
And so that's one of the things I obsess over is

1236
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:13,419
making sure I have good backups of that kind of stuff.

1237
00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:13,659
And

1238
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,479
that's where II I don't know what the Apple policy is,

1239
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,979
but I imagine it's similar where you could just lose it all.

1240
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,600
I assume there are things you could do to get Apple angry at you. So

1241
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:27,090
quite honestly, part of it is I try to, I make sure I don't do anything naughty or,

1242
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,169
you know, that could be perceived as like evil and quite honestly with Apple,

1243
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:34,500
that's pretty easy because they don't like sell compute services or anything.

1244
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:36,199
So,

1245
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:37,969
yeah,

1246
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,709
so, but yeah, no, I mean, that, that is a good point.

1247
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:45,300
Like if Apple decided I was a non entity that would be very, very inconvenient for me.

1248
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:46,060
Yeah.

1249
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,100
Yeah, totally, man.

1250
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,139
So, all right,

1251
00:51:48,379 --> 00:51:51,590
I guess here's the point is let, let's kind of bring this one home.

1252
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,540
Now is I looked through this list and I'll put the, the,

1253
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,879
the links to these lists in the show notes.

1254
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,810
Um, open source security podcast.com again,

1255
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,520
but

1256
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:03,899
a remarkable number of these just didn't come true.

1257
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,699
And so I think

1258
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:10,020
the thing, the takeaway here and this is something to think about for 2017

1259
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,110
is the fact that we suck at predicting the

1260
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,540
future because the future is so incredibly unpredictable.

1261
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,219
And so I think the things we expect to happen in 2017 are almost certainly

1262
00:52:20,229 --> 00:52:24,419
things that will not happen in 2017 and that's almost terrifying to think about.

1263
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,760
Well, I think a large part of it too is we,

1264
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,780
we look at making predictions from like a technical

1265
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,010
perspective and we just ignore the economics of it,

1266
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:31,500
you know,

1267
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,790
like fundamentally all behavior boils down to is there's got

1268
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,409
to be some driving motivation to do this behavior,

1269
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:37,629
right?

1270
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:40,929
Ransomware, get money. OK. Clear, simple, clean, effective,

1271
00:52:41,379 --> 00:52:41,850
you know,

1272
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,820
um cloud flare, you know, prognosticating the DDOS

1273
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,550
attacks in 2017 will like hit a terabyte.

1274
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:53,209
Well, that's just a linear extrapolation fit of a graph, right? That's

1275
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,100
not,

1276
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,310
that's literally taking a ruler on a piece of

1277
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,610
paper and drawing the line and going like,

1278
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,729
oh, we hit one terabyte,

1279
00:52:59,050 --> 00:52:59,370
you know.

1280
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:01,689
That's, yeah, it's a prediction, technically speaking,

1281
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:03,750
but it's like saying the sun will come up,

1282
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:06,290
you know, it's pretty safe. It's probably gonna happen,

1283
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,300
you know.

1284
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:11,120
And what I'm really curious about is like, sort of what of, you know,

1285
00:53:11,129 --> 00:53:12,800
of these criminal business models,

1286
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,449
what new criminal business models and things are gonna come up

1287
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:16,689
in the next, you know,

1288
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,709
year or two years or three years because

1289
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,000
that is what's gonna fundamentally shift things.

1290
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:21,219
And

1291
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:24,639
I'm really curious about things like with the IOT, you know,

1292
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,949
obviously

1293
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,560
ddos that's gonna work. That's boring. You know, that's a

1294
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:28,989
known

1295
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:29,739
problem

1296
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:31,399
right there. There's no bit of

1297
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:31,659
money

1298
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:32,550
to do it.

1299
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,139
Not a lot of money. Right.

1300
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:35,689
And so, you know, they're gonna,

1301
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:40,929
but somebody is going to find a killer app for it and go with it

1302
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,989
-- and that's what
-- I'm really curious to know.

1303
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,379
You know, if I want, if I want to have a prediction here is I will say

1304
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,830
we are not going to see

1305
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:50,449
ddos monetized.

1306
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,800
We're going to see someone figure out what they can

1307
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:55,699
do with all these zombie devices because let's face it.

1308
00:53:55,709 --> 00:54:00,129
The, someone wrote a clever botnet that can just use these devices to D

1309
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:00,550
OS,

1310
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,510
but I suspect people are going to find something

1311
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,830
they can do with these that will generate revenue

1312
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:09,449
and they're going to do it and it's gonna be crazy when they do.

1313
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:10,830
Yeah. No, I agree.

1314
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,050
I mean, uh, some things would like, maybe drive up power consumption.

1315
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:16,409
I, you know, buy shares and energy companies.

1316
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:20,260
It won't be that subtle. I think it'll be more direct. It'll be very ransomware.

1317
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,159
Ask where you get immediate returns because let's face it too.

1318
00:54:23,169 --> 00:54:25,399
When you're dealing with criminal activity,

1319
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:29,510
you need fast returns. That's not the long game. I mean, you need to get in,

1320
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,540
get your money and get out. Right.

1321
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,379
And, and because you're, you're going to either get arrested or shut down,

1322
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,060
that's the reality of it.

1323
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:39,479
It's not a long term growth.

1324
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,780
What I wonder though too is I always wonder,

1325
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,830
are there these criminals taking a long soft

1326
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,760
approach that we just will never know about?

1327
00:54:46,459 --> 00:54:48,560
Yeah, they're called Wall Street executives.

1328
00:54:51,449 --> 00:54:51,729
But

1329
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:53,750
two

1330
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:56,750
1008 housing crisis was a giant redistribution of weal

1331
00:54:56,969 --> 00:55:00,120
given the nature of, of criminal activity.

1332
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:04,719
I, I just don't see anyone having the foresight or patience

1333
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,459
to have any sort of long term criminal business model.

1334
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,100
Right.

1335
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,929
It's, I could see it being very rare if at all.

1336
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,590
II, I don't like speaking in absolutes, but I think in this case, I,

1337
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,270
I don't think they exist.

1338
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,120
I just don't.

1339
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,929
And of course, now we have someone listening, laughing because they've been,

1340
00:55:22,939 --> 00:55:23,310
you know,

1341
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:26,949
running their criminal enterprise for 27 years under the radar.

1342
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:30,590
But it's like I said, it's just, it's like start up culture, right?

1343
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,959
Get in, make your money, get out. That's the only way to look at

1344
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:34,370
it.

1345
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:35,830
All right, man.

1346
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,510
2017. Here we come. Right.

1347
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:41,439
And I think it's safe to say that,

1348
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:44,449
that it was very easy picking on all the 2016 predictions.

1349
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:48,300
