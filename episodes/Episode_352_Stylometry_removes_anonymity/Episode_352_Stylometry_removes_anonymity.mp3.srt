Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,399
Kurt Siefried and my partner in wearing glasses, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,590
That's true in the pre

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,659
roll, which I probably won't include because it was very boring.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,909
Kurt is wearing glasses.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,120
He usually doesn't because his eyesight isn't completely terrible.

6
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:23,590
And he was complaining about how annoying wearing headphones is with glasses. And

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,000
it's like,

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,750
please tell me more. Kurt about wearing glasses for anyone who's never seen me.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,590
I wear glasses and I've worn glasses for a long time because my eyesight is very bad.

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,610
Well, see,

11
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:35,810
and I wore glasses from the age of like five until I

12
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:38,990
had LASIK eye surgery in my early twenties because I was 2400.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,020
Like I could not see,

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,689
I could barely see my monitor if I put my face up against it.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,680
And so now my eyes are degrading because it's been over 20 years.

16
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,080
And I got to wear glasses again

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,319
and I got a low grade headache because my,

18
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:52,720
when I take them off, my right eye is worse than my left eye or sorry,

19
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,759
my left eye is worse than my right eye, but my left eye is dominant.

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,479
So I take it off my brain. Literally, I can feel like a little shake inside.

21
00:00:58,189 --> 00:00:58,959
You know, it's just

22
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:00,400
getting old man.

23
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:03,619
-- It's hard to get used to a new view of the world.
-- Literally.

24
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,970
It's funny you say that because every time I get new glasses, my,

25
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,410
obviously you get a different shape of lens, I usually try to,

26
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,559
I've had similar looking glasses for many years, but

27
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,010
even though my

28
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,750
prescription hasn't really changed in the last probably 5 to 10 years,

29
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,669
the shape of the glasses changes a little bit. And when you get new glasses,

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,650
the world looks warped until my brain adjusts.

31
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,830
And now what's really funny is I take my glasses off to like read at night and the world

32
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,970
has like a concave view to me when I

33
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,129
don't have glasses on because obviously my brain has adjusted

34
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:39,720
the probably

35
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,080
concave or convex, whatever the heck it is coming off my glasses.

36
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:44,569
And when I take them off,

37
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,279
then I see the whole world as like this messed up squishy space, which is funny to me,

38
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,040
there's been those experiments where they make people wear

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,199
prism glasses that flip all the images upside down

40
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:55,459
and apparently the brain will adapt to it.

41
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,680
Although I haven't found an actual proper scholarly reference.

42
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:02,120
I wish I had the time to do that. I would love to experience it,

43
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,160
but it takes like two days

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,720
and

45
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,529
I don't have two days of

46
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,930
I don't think you should be driving.

47
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,369
Well, that's the thing. Like, the whole world's upside down.

48
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,460
What can you legitimately do? Nothing,

49
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,500
right. Like, maybe use the toilet if you're lucky.

50
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,205
All right. Anyway, that, that got weird fast.

51
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:26,475
Well, it's kind of like this actually speaks to our topic today, which is like stom

52
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:31,615
Mery and like, analysis of how people write the phrases they use, you know, the,

53
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,994
the cadences, the expressions,

54
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,755
-- Let's
-- set this up. So

55
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:35,884
a

56
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:37,675
couple of days ago,

57
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:44,074
KT sends me a link to a tool that I'm going to look up now because I don't, it's,

58
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:46,375
it's called stallo.net.

59
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,750
And what it is is you type in the name

60
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,389
or a user name for,

61
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:56,559
for someone from hacker news and it basically looks at their writings

62
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,789
and compares, it looks for other similar writings and the obvious intent of this

63
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:05,389
is lots of people have sock puppet accounts and things like that.

64
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:06,190
And

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,080
you should be able to look at like

66
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,529
is how similar is the writing of this account to this other account.

67
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,960
And this is something I'm really interested in and I'm really excited

68
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,570
to talk about because a lot of people don't realize it.

69
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,479
But the way you write is like a fingerprint,

70
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,880
you leave all over everything you might think

71
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:26,179
you're trying to write like in another voice,

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,389
but you're totally not.

73
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,410
And this is something that's been used by

74
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,169
researchers and like the FBI and all kinds of organizations

75
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,610
to better understand, like, who are they looking at?

76
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,929
-- Well,
-- and to be clear, there's, there's sort of two elements of stom

77
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:40,410
ary.

78
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,020
There's the, like the statistical analysis where you compare A to B and say,

79
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:45,080
kind of how close are they?

80
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,880
And then there's,

81
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,690
and I don't think it's really how the word is meant to work,

82
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,380
but people conflate it with like,

83
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,839
oh, you know, this passage was written by an angry white male in his forties, blah,

84
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,360
blah, blah,

85
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,350
right? Which is kind of the, that's,

86
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,779
it's,

87
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:03,419
you can definitely tell things like education about a person from their writing,

88
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:04,729
even where they're from.

89
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:05,770
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

90
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,350
But one interesting thing is you can also tell

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,500
like if they're highly educated trying to write down

92
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,770
or yeah, where they're from, like what phrases they use.

93
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:13,160
Because like, for example, is my mom,

94
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,729
my mom's German and she'll say expressions and I'm like,

95
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:19,220
and then I translated it word for word back into German. And I'm like, oh, yeah. Yeah.

96
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,678
-- Yeah. Yeah. OK. That made sense.
-- Sure. Right. Right.

97
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,559
So my, my favorite example of this is

98
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,600
there was a character

99
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,679
named Ted Kaczynski who also goes by the Unabomber

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,579
to

101
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,399
many.

102
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,809
So anyone in the United States who's about my age is gonna

103
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,559
remember this was a like domestic terrorist who mailed bombs to people

104
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,589
and

105
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:44,739
had this manifesto that was kind of famous and it was like this just enormously long,

106
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,290
semi

107
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:45,910
unhinged

108
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,540
rant against society,

109
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:47,989
uh,

110
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:48,890
semi

111
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,130
unhinged.

112
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:49,839
But, yeah.

113
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:50,910
Well,

114
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,209
and, and so anyway,

115
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,079
they eventually caught him and they caught him because

116
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:56,279
of his writings and it was his style.

117
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,959
But when you read about what they did,

118
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,859
they actually caught him because I think it was someone who knew him,

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,839
it was his brother. OK.

120
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,760
Like, recognize some of the phrases used and we're like, wait a minute,

121
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,690
I think I know who that is but

122
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,269
just using the writing, like the FBI was able to ask or turn like general regions,

123
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,570
the person is from,

124
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:17,600
you know, how, where they were educated, things like that because like

125
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,369
where you live will dictate how you write because certain areas of a country,

126
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,959
for example,

127
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,899
will use certain phrases or they will use certain words more than other places.

128
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,899
I, I have an article I'll put in the show notes. I talked about this.

129
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,640
Well, a soda and pop, right?

130
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:36,250
There's the map of who, what do you call soda and pop?

131
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,089
Or if you want to be a jerk at soda pop,

132
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,049
you know,

133
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,250
or is it fizzy water? Right? Or whatever?

134
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,140
There's a bunch of linguistic maps out there

135
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,809
that are just fascinating because it's just,

136
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,160
it would have never occurred to me that people

137
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,970
would use that stupid word to call something.

138
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,970
My favorite

139
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,570
is I live in Wisconsin, right?

140
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:57,119
What would you think we call a water drinking fountain?

141
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:57,320
A

142
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,489
water fountain?

143
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:01,549
-- No, we call them bubblers here.
-- Bubblers

144
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:02,410
bubbler.

145
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,929
Do they bubble?

146
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,970
No, maybe, I don't know. Apparently

147
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,220
according to legend,

148
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:13,859
the creator of the drinking fountain is from Wisconsin and called it a bubbler.

149
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,420
But for some reason, the rest of the country

150
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:20,660
-- that sounds like one of those sour grape stories.
-- It's very possible.

151
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,369
And there's also like a very small part

152
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,160
of Massachusetts that also calls it bubblers,

153
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,940
which I don't know why but whatever it doesn't matter,

154
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:31,369
it's one of those hilarious things where people who aren't from here will be like,

155
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,769
oh, someone will say like, oh where's the bubbler?

156
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:34,959
And they're like, what

157
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:39,859
also it was, it was invented in uh looks like it was invented in the UK,

158
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,989
whatever that makes more sense,

159
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,750
-- it seems like a pretty
-- obvious

160
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:43,929
thing.

161
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,799
The inventors of it,

162
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:46,589
Taylor's father had died of typhoid fever

163
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,109
caused by contaminated public drinking water.

164
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,109
And so they literally wanted to

165
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,670
find a way to serve water in public safely.

166
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,630
Makes sense

167
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,790
anyway. Anyway.

168
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:57,660
All right.

169
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,179
But, but regardless, I want to tie all of this into the world of security,

170
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,410
which is the reason we're here.

171
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,140
Sorry. One thing that's just fascinating to me about salam

172
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,000
tree, is it?

173
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,500
So the Ted Kaczynski thing is a great example where they

174
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,420
basically got like a lead and I'll just read it.

175
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:15,190
Most importantly, David provided letters and documents written by his brother.

176
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,010
Our linguistic analysis determined that the

177
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,390
author of those papers in the Manifesto

178
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,420
were almost certainly the same when combined with facts gleaned from the bombings.

179
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:22,850
And Kaczynski's life that announce

180
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,714
has provided the basis for a search warrant.

181
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:29,385
So that was a very like classic, you know, super big FBI effort

182
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:31,024
focus, you know, investigation, blah, blah, blah.

183
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,095
But now the difference is, oh, yeah. Yeah.

184
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:35,334
No, I just downloaded all of hacker news and I can just cross

185
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,005
reference all the sock puppets like

186
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:39,834
this is,

187
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,795
this is what makes it so interesting, right?

188
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:42,434
Obviously,

189
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,795
I spent time at Elastic where I learned a

190
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:48,515
great deal about dealing with large Corporates of data.

191
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,690
And like this is something that these systems can do now

192
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,859
where you have the ability to take in literally like gigabytes of

193
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:58,839
text and do analysis on it in a couple of minutes or

194
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,540
seconds in many cases and you can gleam very interesting things.

195
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:02,799
And

196
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:07,640
like one of my favorites was when the Mueller report came out in the United States,

197
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:09,679
which was that Department of Justice, you know,

198
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,920
special investigation into like Ru Russia

199
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:13,940
ties with the administration and whatever

200
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,480
one of the employees basically took it,

201
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:18,640
dumped it into Elastic search and did all this

202
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,619
analysis on it where you can say things like these two words are often

203
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,230
connected or this word and this word are usually separated by three words.

204
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,100
And there were all these weird relationships you

205
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,790
could identify doing this kind of work.

206
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:33,989
And I'm like, wow, this is really fascinating without reading the report at all,

207
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,950
you could glean

208
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,070
the, like, intent

209
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,030
-- and message in the report
-- and that goes to what's called sentiment analysis, right?

210
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,869
Where people have done a sentiment analysis of sec filings and they're like, oh,

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,099
this company is on the ropes, you know, they're like,

212
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,739
it's like every time a company is like, everything is fine

213
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,869
is something wrong. No, everything is fine.

214
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,710
I, I wouldn't say it's fine if it wasn't.

215
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,669
-- Yeah,
-- like, like at Twitter, everything is fine.

216
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:03,340
We're, we're gonna make Twitter two point. Oh, it's gonna be awesome.

217
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:08,429
So anyway, Twitter is the reason I'm excited to talk about this right now

218
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,380
because

219
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,960
there is this, this whole concept, right? Of stom

220
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,729
Mery of looking at the writings of people to, to unravel who it is or what's going on.

221
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:20,380
And then we think about

222
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,210
in the Twitter universe right now like there was

223
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:27,500
just the spat of fake accounts like Eli Lilly saying

224
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,010
insulin is now free everyone and their stock price crashes

225
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,830
20%. Yeah.

226
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:35,900
The guy who did that actually put a video up on youtube about it and it's fascinating.

227
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,070
-- We'll link to it in the show
-- notes. Wait, what do you mean the guy who did it?

228
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,979
Like the they know who did that?

229
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,390
Did they arrest them?

230
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:43,080
-- And
-- that's,

231
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,590
and that's a big part of his video where he's kind

232
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,419
of like uh so I'm doing this video and I,

233
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:46,849
I

234
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:47,250
uh

235
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,489
did you just like,

236
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,109
what is it?

237
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,260
Oh,

238
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,849
man. Is it a, uh, what,

239
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:54,070
uh,

240
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:57,099
uh, I'm not prepared for this information right now. Like,

241
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,299
is this person in jail or are they going to jail? Is that illegal?

242
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:05,270
-- Like, no, no, no,
-- it's, it's a, it's a guy who, it's Sean Morrow and he writes for the,

243
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,270
um, he does, like, he, this is the kind of stuff he does but he's like,

244
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,570
I didn't plan to do.

245
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,250
It's, it's one of those classic, like I,

246
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,750
I do this for a living but I didn't plan to do this one incident of it.

247
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,590
So I did this stupid little thing that of course is now what I'm famous for,

248
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:19,450
you know, like you and I have done that where

249
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:19,659
we

250
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:20,919
in quotes.

251
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:22,200
But um

252
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,489
ok, put a link to that

253
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,989
in the notes and I will put them in the show notes because I, I need to,

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,690
I can't comment on that right now because it's hurting my brain too much.

255
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,770
Well, basically it's just like I kind of did this dumb throwaway thing and like,

256
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:37,460
you know, what's the most like inflammatory kind of thing?

257
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:38,289
I could say

258
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,429
insulin is

259
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,830
ok.

260
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,760
But look at the same time just because you were trying to do

261
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,479
a stupid joke and you accidentally burnt down the theater full of people.

262
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:51,369
They're not gonna be like, oh, it's fine. It was just a joke. You know what I mean?

263
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,489
Uh I, I'm on his side for this one. Like, it's uh Twitter,

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,419
I mean,

265
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,469
Twitter, I would say Twitter holds just as much blame for

266
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:02,070
legitimizing his message as

267
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,669
-- he, you know,
-- I agree with that. But we're also not going to talk about that today.

268
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,729
It's so hard not to talk about Twitter.

269
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,000
-- And because it, but at the same time it's like every two hours it's different.
-- Yeah.

270
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,200
Like that L tt link I sent you where, you know,

271
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,789
they're talking about Twitter for the last, like,

272
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,515
it's like just the last four days of Twitter and it's like, so on Friday and then like,

273
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,835
by the time they get to Monday it's just like what?

274
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:24,945
I know that's the thing. Like I, I,

275
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,765
but between the time we record a show, I edit it and release it

276
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:33,955
like it wouldn't, I guarantee whatever we talked about would be outdated and wrong.

277
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:35,465
And it's just like, I don't,

278
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:38,474
well, or just horribly surpassed by whatever fresh

279
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:39,775
hell,

280
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:41,544
you know, was visited people

281
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:42,705
up

282
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,000
anyway. Anyway. Anyway

283
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:45,690
where

284
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,679
-- like
-- that poor lady that took three days to

285
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,169
quit because she couldn't find anybody to quit from

286
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,309
like, because her entire chain of command was gone.

287
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,599
Like,

288
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:56,729
-- I know the
-- people in Europe who aren't getting paid on time or the one guy's like,

289
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,700
well, the money came into my account and then got clawed back from a different bank.

290
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,630
So clearly everything is not working as normal.

291
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,419
We're talking about

292
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:04,140
stry.

293
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,549
So, ok, but anyway to, to bring this back to the world of security.

294
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,489
And the reason I really found this interesting is there's a couple of instances that

295
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,969
I, I really enjoyed

296
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,169
this whole concept of

297
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:16,419
Silom

298
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,460
Mery. I'll say the first is Satoshi Nakamoto, right?

299
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:23,909
Which for anyone who doesn't know Satoshi Nakamoto is the

300
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,489
-- alias of the person who created Bitcoin
-- or persons plural.

301
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,539
-- Well,
-- that and yes, yes, we'll get to that

302
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,450
right where we don't know who made Bitcoin

303
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,539
and

304
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,340
the persona

305
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,659
who claims credit is Satoshi Nakamoto.

306
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,580
And

307
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,609
they have done analysis on the writings and they have almost certainly determined.

308
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:46,659
It's more than one person.

309
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,739
Well, more to the point

310
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,219
they, they claim to have his birth date fifth of April 1975.

311
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:57,150
Well, I, I'm sorry, it's kind of, again, it's an FBI level style of pain,

312
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,020
but you just go through all the birth records for that day in Japan.

313
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,830
It's gonna be a bit of

314
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,969
-- a work.
-- It's not guaranteed to be Japan, right?

315
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,289
Uh No, that claimed he was born in Japan.

316
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:09,690
Uh

317
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,400
-- oh, the, the analysis. OK.
-- No, no, not the announce.

318
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,309
But anyways, this is on the Wikipedia page.

319
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,830
Is it? I didn't read the Wikipedia page. I heard some other things

320
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,349
-- on
-- his P to P foundation.

321
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,440
-- Anyways,
-- we're not gonna, we're not gonna do it.

322
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:22,179
Yeah.

323
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,080
No, it's, it's,

324
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,710
that's, that's one thing that, yeah,

325
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:28,369
when you can tell if it's a single coherent voice or

326
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,729
25, 10, 100 whatever

327
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,739
number of people.

328
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:32,450
That's right.

329
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,380
And now the tie back to this, that really, I guess tickled my fancy back in the day

330
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:44,289
was when people were using this sort of technology to do analysis of hacking groups

331
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,190
and

332
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,010
like ransomware groups and,

333
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,169
and all of these nefarious groups and basically ask

334
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,729
them questions like who is actually behind this.

335
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,909
And this is where they could identify, like the author of this

336
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,270
English paragraph

337
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,210
is

338
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:02,530
Russian or they're Eastern European or they're probably from this country.

339
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,549
And that kind of stuff just fascinated me.

340
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,530
Person speaking. Russian is actually Romanian or Polish or whatever.

341
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:12,549
That's right. Exactly. Exactly. That stuff. And there's something I can't find

342
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,000
and, and I've been trying, I've been, I've spent like,

343
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,000
three days trying to figure this out.

344
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,270
But if I, I vaguely recall

345
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,950
an instance of

346
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:24,200
there was a hacking group back in the, it wasn't a hacker group but like a,

347
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,719
a security research group

348
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:28,590
-- that was doing.
-- Oh, was it eight little Green Men? Was it?

349
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,270
I don't know.

350
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,150
-- I don't remember, but it was basically,
-- remember they,

351
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,349
they took a hard run at HP and they just churned stuff out

352
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,750
and I remember talking about them and I was like this, if this is one,

353
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,500
like in hindsight, it always smelled like a group.

354
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,369
Right. Right. And that, that's, that's exactly it. I don't know if it was that group.

355
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,510
I can't remember anymore.

356
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,520
It was basically someone did the analysis and was like, this is not,

357
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,780
not a researcher, this is a group of people that are specifically targeting this.

358
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:55,099
And then there of course, were rumors about, oh, well, it's,

359
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:57,960
it's his country or it's his company doing the work or whatever.

360
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:58,340
And

361
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,140
it's just fascinating that

362
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:05,900
we as humans like to believe that we can hide behind aliases,

363
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:08,280
that we can write things with pseudonyms.

364
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,679
And the reality is if you have a presence on the internet in any meaningful way,

365
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,299
which many of us do now, thanks to blogs and social media

366
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,580
and whatever,

367
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,159
there's almost no way to hide who you are from.

368
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:27,000
-- A we'll say reasonably competent adversary,
-- you don't know,

369
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,900
like there's youtube videos on like os

370
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,580
courses basically that are half an hour long and it shows you how to

371
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,960
like dig up everybody's public profiles and then find their less public ones like,

372
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,719
you know, linkedin is a great example.

373
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:42,770
It's, it takes a little bit of digging, but you can find people on linkedin like the,

374
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,780
the, you know, obviously starting with their name and then there's like 10 billion,

375
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:46,260
you know,

376
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,260
John Smith.

377
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:47,979
OK?

378
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,340
Like if you got a city or a company or anything,

379
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,390
you can narrow it down real quick and get to their linkedin, get to their, you know,

380
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,739
previous, like I said, there's youtube videos that talk about how to do this,

381
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,969
you know, it's,

382
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,159
you don't even have to be that confident, you just need

383
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,840
a little bit of time and basic knowledge.

384
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,830
-- You
-- need some resources and because

385
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,320
not everyone has time to actually do all this.

386
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,130
And like, here's an example, let's say someone starts publishing something

387
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:15,580
as a pseudonym.

388
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,049
And you're like, I wonder who that really is. Right

389
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,890
now, you have to collect a huge corpus of information process,

390
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,250
that information process,

391
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,609
the writings of the anonymous individual and then try to figure out who it is like,

392
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:32,330
that needs some skill. It's different of saying

393
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,010
I'm going to track down Kurt

394
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,400
and figure out where he lives.

395
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,190
That's one thing because you're a specific target.

396
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,070
-- But if you're just trying to do like a, a casting a wide net, then you need
-- resources.

397
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,640
Well, I think this is the difference between I know who I'm looking for versus,

398
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,390
ok, like, uh a middle aged, a middle aged white male of average height and weight,

399
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,510
right? And if you know the name, you can

400
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,525
like easily, Kurt is very tall if you've ever met him, I'm not very tall,

401
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,155
I'm 6 ft one and a bunch.

402
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:03,804
You're taller than me. I'm, I'm average height, literally average height.

403
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,425
But that's, and that's the thing though, right?

404
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,983
Is, again, it's like all these police investigations where it's like, ok, well,

405
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:08,993
it was a red pickup truck.

406
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:09,395
Ok.

407
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,493
We're just gonna have to go visit every single one of them

408
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:13,473
in the city and work for damage to the front vendor.

409
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,829
And that's the thing with Stom

410
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,180
Mery is it changes it from, like I have to

411
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:21,319
cast, you know, I have to figure out it's, oh, you know, here's the top 10 matches.

412
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,420
0, 10. I can do 10. Right. But I can't do a million.

413
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:24,969
Yeah.

414
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:25,459
Yeah.

415
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:28,420
And I'll, I'll put another link in the show notes. I, I have one other point.

416
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,660
I want to bring up before we, we kind of miss it is

417
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,849
there, there's a video I found from Ted Ted Ed.

418
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,739
I think it is where they talk about William Shakespeare.

419
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,920
And obviously you can imagine

420
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,619
William Shakespeare has had

421
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,439
stom Mery applied to the writings at length.

422
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:44,920
You know, what's wild to me is they're applying stom

423
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,660
to the translated writings. And I'm like, uh

424
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,150
wouldn't you have to apply it to the originals?

425
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,239
And, and that is a very reasonable,

426
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,560
reasonable complaint. And, and, but, but so here's in the Ted Ed video.

427
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,579
They basically said that

428
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:04,380
when you create like the what I forget what they call it.

429
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,310
It's like the fancy graph they use when they're doing stom

430
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:08,359
Mery to, to decide like, what,

431
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:09,260
how,

432
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,819
how are we gonna categorize the writings like the words

433
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,979
used and how often they're used and things like that.

434
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,969
And basically Shakespeare is Shakespeare. And when they've tried to

435
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,829
compare some of the

436
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,170
proposed like pseudonyms where like real people

437
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,290
using William Shakespeare as their name,

438
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,770
like their writings didn't fit and it's like this is really cool actually because

439
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,910
there have been

440
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,630
countless examples of people making, you know, claims about.

441
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,369
Oh, so and so was really Shakespeare.

442
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,069
This person did a lot of the writing or whatever,

443
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,390
like it's not holding up to this sort of analysis,

444
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,920
-- which I find really cool
-- because my understanding

445
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,630
is Tom Clancy wrote his original books,

446
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,300
but then he got like a stable of writers to

447
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,430
Cranko's books and he would basically provide an outline and

448
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:48,949
the stable of writers.

449
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,589
Have you seen how many books he's written?

450
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,199
I mean, I know it's a lot,

451
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,949
I don't really pay that close of attention to what he's doing well.

452
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,439
Well, and in fairness though, like Isaac

453
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:58,170
Asimov cranked out like 500 books.

454
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,290
-- It's a big list, but he was a prolific writer. Give it
-- Asimov

455
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,790
-- wrote for 50 years. Like, yeah,
-- well, still 10 books a year. That's a lot of books.

456
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,229
Well, novels, short stories, whatever. There's a lot of writing them are short.

457
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,359
Yeah, still,

458
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,589
I just remember when I was a kid,

459
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,859
the section at the library of Isaac Asimov was like multiple linear feet.

460
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,609
I know it's awesome, you know.

461
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,349
But like, for example, Tom Clancy,

462
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,040
I would wonder like also kind of how abstract can it be?

463
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,180
Like, I know that they have code style

464
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,660
Lawry. But I wonder especially now with like the tools perfect example.

465
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,060
Like I'm writing a bunch of javascript and I tend to use Python style naming like,

466
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:32,459
like

467
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,989
square bracket, full quote name, full quote,

468
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,890
square back instead of like bla dot blah.

469
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,739
Right.

470
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:39,729
Yeah.

471
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,380
And,

472
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,510
and that's just because I'm a Python person and I

473
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,699
need to become more of a Java script person.

474
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,060
So, I mean, that would be an easy way to identify that.

475
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:51,109
-- This code, this terrible, terrible code was written by me.
-- Well, and that's just it.

476
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,410
Right.

477
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,699
So everything you do leaves a fingerprint,

478
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:55,699
it doesn't matter if it's Twitter messages.

479
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,859
If it's a code you write, if it's

480
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,520
blog posts, you write,

481
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,619
it's, it's what humans do, right?

482
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,619
And now we have these means to uncover who people are.

483
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,339
Well, and at scale like it's not just a 1 to 1,

484
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:08,474
but it's like

485
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,244
again back to, yeah, I just downloaded all of hacker news,

486
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:14,064
put it on an M two drive and fit it into my video card, right?

487
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:15,104
Why is this so hard?

488
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,055
Exactly.

489
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:17,655
And now you have to think

490
00:20:17,854 --> 00:20:21,505
there's also other data that can be brought into this.

491
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:23,265
And this is where when you start talking about

492
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:25,555
an organization like the NSA or the FBI,

493
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:28,265
where they have like infinite compute at their disposal.

494
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:28,905
Essentially,

495
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:33,189
when you can take something like the writings of Satoshi Nakamura,

496
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,800
and you combine that

497
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,300
with all the data we have from the IP space, we've been sniffing for decades.

498
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,280
And you combine that with,

499
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,920
you know, who's posting at what time and how,

500
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:47,260
and like I have no doubt they could untangle that web if they wanted to.

501
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,119
-- They, they, they might have and they just won't tell us
-- also narrow.

502
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:50,760
Like, it's always all

503
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,530
about,

504
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,099
uh, well, for law enforcement,

505
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:55,569
it's oftentimes about that parallel construction of like,

506
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,579
either we know the person who did it but we

507
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,560
can't through some way that we can't use in court.

508
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,650
So we have to parallel discovery or

509
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,770
like, yeah, we just like, who's the Unabomber? We have no damn clue. Ok.

510
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,599
What do we do now?

511
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:10,780
And then we narrow it down and get a search warrant and it turns out because, you know,

512
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,810
that's the thing, like, pretty,

513
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,339
uh,

514
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,810
criminals by and large are not these criminal masterminds.

515
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,369
No. Right.

516
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,810
Like real criminal masterminds do white collar crime.

517
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,130
Like they do what I'm making air quotes here. White collar crime.

518
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,640
They do things that aren't even illegal yet.

519
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,010
Like some, like the early crypto scams or Kickstarter scams where it's like,

520
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,569
-- but it's FT
-- X.

521
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,489
-- Yeah.
-- Like it's not a crime. It's just,

522
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:34,430
it's sharp business or it's, uh, didn't you read the fine print about no guarantees?

523
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,770
Right. No, absolutely.

524
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,880
And that's one of the, I,

525
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,780
I have that conversation with my kids every now and then be like, oh, you know,

526
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,219
this criminal or whatever, I'm like, look,

527
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:46,199
the best criminals are running enterprise sales

528
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:49,219
organizations because they're making a fortune,

529
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:51,939
like, overcharging people for crap. They don't need

530
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:52,439
it.

531
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:52,949
I just,

532
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,339
I just bought a 23 battery for my garage door opener. It's literally

533
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,349
a AAA battery cut in half and it costs $12 at the store.

534
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,760
Actually, they

535
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,939
are not AAA batteries cut in half. Take it apart.

536
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,479
It has like four batteries inside of it or something.

537
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,719
-- It's the
-- same coin cells as a AAA. Basically,

538
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,089
it's just half

539
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:13,729
of them.

540
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:15,109
Right.

541
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:18,770
You gotta love it. Whatever. It's 12 blocks to live with it.

542
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,160
It's the modern conveniences of life we have to deal with.

543
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:22,910
Ok.

544
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:23,709
So anyway, we're,

545
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,349
we're running ourselves out of time and we haven't got

546
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,930
to any of the things I wanted to talk about,

547
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:27,760
which is normal.

548
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:31,739
But I think here is the overall point of

549
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,099
this conversation and why I was excited about it

550
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,819
is

551
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:37,530
when we put on our security hats,

552
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:42,319
we love to think we have this like ability to hide

553
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:45,530
or kind of anonymize ourselves on the internet

554
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:47,000
and we don't.

555
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,089
And I think that's what makes this terrifying and exciting at the same time is

556
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:56,319
the fact that if I create a sock puppet account on Reddit or something,

557
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,819
if someone wanted to, they could figure out it was me.

558
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:01,479
Well, I mean, just,

559
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:04,000
you'd have to either use GP T three or

560
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,770
run it through Google translate twice or something to mangle

561
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:07,250
it

562
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,489
enough to make it

563
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,680
different than you.

564
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,589
I wonder if that works.

565
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,560
Uh I suspect it would,

566
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:14,650
to some degree

567
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,819
in that you would

568
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:19,099
essentially your traces would get overwritten by Google's traces.

569
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:21,300
Like a bird example is I write and I use grammarly.

570
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:25,790
And so obviously, like, I, I literally will open up a piece of work

571
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,569
and it is clear and grammarly and I'm like, oh,

572
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:32,000
the other party obviously is grammarly because it stands clear, right?

573
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,839
And then what's funny is

574
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,829
like, my,

575
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,349
one of my editors will go through and make

576
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,430
a bunch more changes and it's not totally clear,

577
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:40,180
clear and grammarly, but it is better.

578
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:43,630
So I'm like, OK, the human is still sometimes a bit better than grammarly. Sure.

579
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,469
But I suspect like by running it through,

580
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,949
translate or like grammar check kind of things you would,

581
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:51,000
it would mask the traces

582
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,800
but it, like there would, there'd be less traces, they'd be harder to find,

583
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,689
but I suspect they would still be there.

584
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,733
And if you haven't enough data and enough elastic search instances, you know,

585
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:02,253
and enough patients to collect it all.

586
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:03,562
And that's the thing people forget. Right?

587
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:06,812
Is these, these government agencies, they just storage is cheap.

588
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,292
Oh, it's very cheap. Yes,

589
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:09,883
it might not be useful now.

590
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:12,692
But 30 years from now we got to figure out who's writing this crazy Manifesto,

591
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:13,863
you know, and that's the thing, the

592
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:15,983
offset of this. It's not just enough to do the

593
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:18,572
offset of this going forward, but you have to have ideally done it before.

594
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,792
Like, apparently this is one of the reasons the NSA loves Mormons

595
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:25,036
because they have no social media profiles. Oh, I suppose.

596
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:25,645
Right.

597
00:24:25,806 --> 00:24:27,475
And, and that's what I was thinking about that the other day.

598
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:30,475
I'm like, how are you going to have like, spies

599
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:33,395
when I can, like, take their picture, run it against?

600
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,735
Uh oh, what was that American company, for example, that, you know,

601
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:38,875
mined Facebook for photos and was clear light or something.

602
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:39,375
Anyways,

603
00:24:39,526 --> 00:24:42,576
you know, how are you going to have a spy when I can take a picture of the spy,

604
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:46,755
run it through like all the Facebook photos and be like, oh, here he is at 16.

605
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:47,956
Right. Right.

606
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:48,739
Yeah.

607
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:49,369
Yeah, I mean,

608
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,459
these are really good points and I think this is really interesting from, I mean,

609
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:56,449
I'm not qualified to comment on the way that's being done because I'm,

610
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,359
I bet they've got some plans.

611
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,349
Right. Like

612
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:05,020
-- the intelligence agencies aren't morons.
-- No, no. But it, it, how do you

613
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,900
have, well, or another example is with biometrics,

614
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,939
how do you have people have multiple,

615
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:11,689
you know, fake identities?

616
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,420
Well,

617
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,479
you can issue fake identities using like the US government can

618
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:17,430
issue all the fake passports they want by fake passports.

619
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,689
I don't mean like fake passwords, I mean, real passports but like,

620
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:21,150
that's not their date of birth and name

621
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,489
-- really.
-- Right.

622
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:25,000
But I think you're too, I think you're too deep.

623
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,089
What I'm trying to say is like sock puppet accounts on Reddit

624
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:29,959
and that's what I'm saying though. Is like, you,

625
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,849
you definitely have writings online before you try to mask them.

626
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:35,689
And so

627
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,349
again, that's the other thing is it doesn't have to match 100%.

628
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,780
Like when you use this stom

629
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:43,250
Mery tool with hacker news, it's like, well, here's the person and here's like the,

630
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,770
the closest 20 matches,

631
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:45,569
then

632
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:47,464
you could look at them, look at time zones, look at,

633
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:50,574
you know, blah, blah, blah, like sentiment analysis or, you know,

634
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:53,295
are they pro or against emacs or V I, you know,

635
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:54,324
whatever

636
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,354
and get those other clues. But the thing is

637
00:25:56,614 --> 00:26:00,834
now you're looking at a list of 20 people instead of everyone on hacker news.

638
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:01,574
And again,

639
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:03,415
I can do 20 people. I can't do

640
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:05,885
an analysis of, you know, V I versus E A

641
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:07,535
sentiment for everybody.

642
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:10,214
Well, actually you could, it's really easy because they're all wrong.

643
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:11,944
They'll tell you.

644
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:14,655
-- Exactly. Yeah,
-- they're not gonna hide it there.

645
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,349
But, I mean, and that's the thing, right? It's all about this.

646
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,189
It's like industrial fishing, right? It's,

647
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,739
yeah, we just put a really big net out there and sure we killed, you know,

648
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,849
a couple dozen dolphins.

649
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,229
But, eh, what are you gonna do? Right.

650
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,060
I

651
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:29,140
-- guess that's one way to look at it,
-- you know, and again, I'm, I'm not, I'm,

652
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,439
I'm pro dolphin, but the point is like,

653
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:36,160
normally we didn't have this ability to do this industrial data mining on our own.

654
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,300
And now, like on a Mac M two.

655
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,459
You can like the, the CP US are crazy fast for this kind of work.

656
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:45,119
Right. Well, and so here's part of the interesting aspect of this

657
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:48,500
story, Stylo is not new, it's from the 18 hundreds,

658
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:52,199
right? It was when they say an Irishman, I forget who it it's in the TED video,

659
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:52,819
but

660
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,540
they talk about where this came from

661
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,239
and

662
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,550
back in those days they had to do this by hand,

663
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,469
right?

664
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,540
Like they didn't have computers and I think

665
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,260
computers have now created this environment that,

666
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,469
that unmasks anyone who you might want to unmask, which is terrifying and,

667
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:10,680
and maybe a little exciting.

668
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:11,449
I don't know. But

669
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:12,170
in anyway,

670
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,050
it, it reminds me of,

671
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,119
I love those examples people show on Twitter where someone

672
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,030
thought they were using their alt account and they were

673
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:24,609
and stuff like that and it's like, oh, that's so good. It's so good. And it's so funny.

674
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:26,270
-- Uh uh like
-- a perfect example of this is a

675
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,189
lot of jurisdictions now use biometrics on their identification,

676
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:33,170
not so much to identify who you are, but to essentially have one per customer.

677
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,239
Like we issued a driver's license to this fingerprint and now this

678
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,969
fingerprints trying to get a different driver's license and a different name.

679
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:39,530
Nope.

680
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,290
Nah, naughty.

681
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,489
And

682
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,160
you know

683
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:43,329
that

684
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,579
I would,

685
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,859
I, I wish Twitter had done that because you could have like, consoled.

686
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,459
Like how awesome would Twitter have been if they'd been like, oh,

687
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,260
this account is also related to these other 15 accounts

688
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,040
that also seem to use a VPN through Russia just saying, you know,

689
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,939
I kind of labeled that on the thing because

690
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,339
like, there's so much,

691
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,540
it's like spam, I get spammed to my inbox and I'm like, Google,

692
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,780
how did you not spam this?

693
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:07,180
There's like, come on,

694
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,030
you know,

695
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,699
something's going wrong and somehow the Attackers are getting this stuff through

696
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,530
and I wish Twitter had

697
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,310
made a bit more effort here because

698
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,010
like, Twitter could have been

699
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,489
amazing and it was amazing. But

700
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,420
like, yeah, the Russian troll

701
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:21,780
farms and stuff, like when you,

702
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,510
when you look at some of the people that post and the responses and just the, you know,

703
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,869
the vitriol and everything, it's just like, it's brutal

704
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:30,410
and

705
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:36,310
I, I can't help but think stom Mery on Mastodon might lead to some really interesting

706
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:37,560
uh

707
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,969
consequences.

708
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,810
Maybe. I don't know. I don't know.

709
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:41,459
I mean,

710
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,500
you could probably get

711
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,469
access to a lot more data on Mastodon if you wanted to.

712
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:52,060
Yeah, it's very, I mean, Twitter sort of was the Twitter api could would,

713
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:53,739
would be finicky at times.

714
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:55,359
Well, with Mastodon, you could,

715
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:58,709
you could run 100 instances and set up 100 sock puppets and

716
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:01,520
just follow huge piles of people and get all their stuff.

717
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,609
Yeah, you could, I mean, that, that's still a lot of work though. But I, I bet you can.

718
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,349
Well, that's fair. That's fair. And, and they probably know this stuff.

719
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,430
But, but anyway,

720
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,959
I guess it's time to go

721
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,020
and I don't really have a great takeaway for this show other

722
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,949
than I think Silom Mery is super exciting and interesting and I,

723
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,109
I love the, the work people have done.

724
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,459
I can't wait to see kind of what comes next.

725
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:29,589
So, a part of me is terrified because anonymity is already such a valuable thing.

726
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,030
And it's difficult

727
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,670
to even pretend

728
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,750
you can be anonymous if you want to be because someone can,

729
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,670
can tie this back to you in some way.

730
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,310
But

731
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,180
at the, at the same time it's,

732
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,770
it's very cool research and it's very interesting.

733
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,979
I think like a lot of things,

734
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:47,910
it'll lead to some totally unpredictable consequences that are probably

735
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,530
not as bad as we'd hoped in some ways,

736
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,729
maybe worse, like unmasking the true author of, you know,

737
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:56,689
whoever is leading a protest in some country with an authoritarian government.

738
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,660
I'm sure they do that, which is

739
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,619
bad.

740
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:01,699
Well,

741
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:04,939
we think it's bad because we don't live in the authoritarian government.

742
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,219
Well, the thing is we, we,

743
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:10,180
we went through this growth pain 100 and 5200 years ago in the western world.

744
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:11,770
-- I mean,
-- well, we're still going through it.

745
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,939
I mean, we don't have all this solved and I think this is one of those places.

746
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:17,329
I know, I, I say this a lot but like our

747
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:23,314
regular, our privacy regulations have not kept pace with reality even a little bit.

748
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:23,535
And,

749
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:25,334
and this is going to be one of the challenges

750
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:27,655
I think going into the future is we literally,

751
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:29,925
we have to solve some of these problems because

752
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,165
it's like a freaking free for all out there.

753
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:32,805
You know,

754
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,520
like there's a reason

755
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,760
that police can't just come in your house and search

756
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,260
your stuff whenever they want because they used to do that

757
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:42,579
and people were like, this is bad. Let's not do this anymore.

758
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,439
You know, and, and this is like,

759
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:48,449
this is the internet now is anyone can search your stuff anytime they want and,

760
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:50,839
and you can make the argument. Oh, just don't use the internet.

761
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,359
But that's obviously absurd.

762
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:52,959
So,

763
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,390
yeah, it's, I don't know, man, it, it's wild times for sure.

764
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Clearview, clearview, face recognition. That's the one. Sorry.

765
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,319
It was bugging.

766
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,640
Glad we sorted that out.

767
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,939
But it's, well, but it's a perfect example of like, well,

768
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:06,939
these people published all this data publicly.

769
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,300
Why can't clear view, just grab it and use it, you know,

770
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,780
and the answer is because there's some really,

771
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,079
really potentially bad consequences.

772
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,459
Right. Right. Yes.

773
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,140
You know.

774
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,989
Well, and it's like anything, right?

775
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,329
It can be used for good or it can be used for bad or both.

776
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:20,439
Usually both.

777
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,729
It reminds me of open source coding in that

778
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,949
something that was basically

779
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,339
rocket science impossible. Like in 1940 is now like,

780
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:30,500
yeah, just download this library and run it on your,

781
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,109
like GP U enabled computer with at least 64 gigs of ra M.

782
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:34,369
That's

783
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,079
true. Actually, that does make it,

784
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,199
-- it's exciting for me as a nerd.
-- It goes back to that security tool podcast episode.

785
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:41,670
We did,

786
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,219
like, it's just all of a sudden,

787
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,160
like when you think about the security tools

788
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,270
we have nowadays compared to 20 years ago.

789
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,910
Good, sweet Jiminy.

790
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,829
No, I, I know, I think about that all the time. Like I can do things on my laptop now

791
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,439
that I couldn't imagine a

792
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,010
-- decade ago even I
-- processed 100 and eight videos using FFM peg on

793
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,770
my laptop in 25 minutes while I was writing code on it.

794
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,469
Right. It's, it's

795
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,319
like

796
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,670
-- magic.
-- Welcome to the future.

797
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,439
Everything's terrible.

798
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:12,109
But the internet is fast.

799
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,880
That's true. I have Gigabit Internet, whatever.

800
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm

801
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,790

everybody.

808
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:31,589
I'm just trying to break up the

809
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,270
so you can analyze me

810
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,650
whatever, whatever. Alright. I'm hitting stop now for real.
