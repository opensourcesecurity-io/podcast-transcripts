Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,899
Siefried and my partner wearing socks. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,510
-- I do actually have socks on today. I don't always have socks when we record
-- though.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,090
See, I don't wear socks from May until the middle of September.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,350
I try to avoid socks whenever possible.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,090
Mhm.

6
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:21,989
Anyway, that's a weird topic.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,950
-- That's
-- not really a fair, like, I don't have that option in winter here.

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:28,209
It's not a pleasant experience necessarily. I have fuzz

9
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:29,242
slippers. I wear and

10
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:29,541
stuff,

11
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:31,972
but I don't know why I just don't like wearing socks.

12
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:34,091
It's always funny when I go to conferences

13
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:35,622
because socks are really popular right now.

14
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:38,771
People are like, oh, take a pair of socks and I'm like, no, I don't want your socks.

15
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:39,981
Like, I won't take those.

16
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:42,672
-- I'm like, what socks are popular?
-- What?

17
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:44,872
Yeah, like socks at conferences are

18
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:49,041
when, when, when I go to a conference, I'm serious. This is completely honest to God.

19
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:51,321
When I was at a conference

20
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:53,833
we were giving away socks

21
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:57,083
and people were, like, seeking us out to get the socks and I'm like, what's

22
00:00:57,273 --> 00:01:00,324
wrong with you people? I mean, no, they're just like crappy conference socks.

23
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,113
They're not even high quality or anything. It's

24
00:01:02,754 --> 00:01:04,763
-- because I'm, I'm pretty, it's
-- conference

25
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,744
swag ever since I did ballroom dancing,

26
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:07,694
I'm actually quite

27
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:10,234
particular about what I put on my feet anyway.

28
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:11,833
All right. This is weird.

29
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:14,374
No, it's, it's, well, it's, it's kind of the exact same

30
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,596
-- thing is today's topic.
-- I can't wait to see how you tie them together.

31
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:20,515
This person posts. Linux is a nightmare.

32
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:24,905
It's only 0.8% of our sales, but it's over 50% of the reported technical issues,

33
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,526
some game or something.

34
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:26,676
And, and,

35
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:31,655
and this is generally true across a lot of different platforms and Softwares.

36
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,856
Sure. Sure. And so then there's the,

37
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:37,466
the, the, the classic hacker news article, you know, of

38
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,050
the, the Linux bashing followed by the not Linux bashing, followed by the blah,

39
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:41,730
blah, blah, blah,

40
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,199
blah,

41
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:42,910
obviously.

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,279
But um,

43
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:46,849
one thing and so like, let's ignore,

44
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,620
see,

45
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,370
the one thing that always gets me is people

46
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,750
treat these bug reports and problem reports as something like

47
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,089
that they

48
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,650
have to deal with.

49
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:59,889
And if you've ever bought software from a large entity, like let's pick on oracle

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,040
-- and you have a major problem with it. Well, no, let's not
-- pick on or

51
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,040
they're a bad example. Let's pick on Red Hat because we were there.

52
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,029
We have experience and there's literally public bugs to point

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,699
to this Red Hat publishes all of their security vulnerability information

54
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,509
in a very easy to consume way. They have an API they have flat files.

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,500
It's very, very nice.

56
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,229
And there is a high percentage of security vulnerabilities.

57
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,869
They just mark as won't fix like we

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,490
are never fixing this vulnerability in our product.

59
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,729
-- Well, on purpose unless
-- we accidentally update

60
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,880
this.

61
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,949
So sometimes they accidentally fix it. But

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,990
you get the idea

63
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,470
and the intent behind this is,

64
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,100
and this was always funny having this conversation with people is

65
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,809
I can fix the important security bugs

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,149
or I could fix this crap and ignore the important bugs,

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,820
which would you rather have me do?

68
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,990
Well, actually it's worse than that because

69
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,779
-- why do people buy Red Hat? Well, for stability and boringness?
-- Right. Exactly.

70
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:53,110
Ok.

71
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,339
So you want me to start making a bunch

72
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,020
of code changes that aren't strictly speaking necessary?

73
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,059
-- Right. Right.
-- And

74
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,330
sometimes have pretty deep impacts.

75
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,899
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,449
You know,

77
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,380
and it always amused me because it seems like the patches for the low

78
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,509
severity vulnerabilities are vastly more complicated than

79
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,860
the patches for the critical vulnerabilities,

80
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,509
which

81
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:16,460
I love because the critical stuff is usually like an integer overflow

82
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:18,190
and the low severity stuff is like, oh,

83
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,529
we have to completely revamp the way our temp handling works,

84
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,830
which is a 7000 line commit.

85
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:28,660
But, um, I, what I was thinking was more interesting to me is,

86
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,110
is kind of less about the whole,

87
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:34,100
like Linux users find a lot of bugs that are actually cross platform, right?

88
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,389
This is one of the reasons Open BS D traditionally

89
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,679
wanted to support a lot of big and small Indian architectures

90
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,660
is because it would bubble up bugs that

91
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,779
-- otherwise wouldn't bubble up.
-- That's right.

92
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,800
-- You know.
-- That's right.

93
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:48,570
I mean, this was why I remember when, when I helped out the Fedora people

94
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:52,065
gen two because gen two users would find the

95
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:54,445
gnarliest bugs because they would create these like,

96
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:57,494
bizarre combinations of software that no one ever

97
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,815
thought of and it would uncover ludicrous problems.

98
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,095
-- And
-- so what I'm kind of wondering is like, I'm a Windows user,

99
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:05,585
a Mac user and a Linux user.

100
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:06,145
And

101
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:09,365
the way I react to a bug in these systems is very different.

102
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,225
Like on the apple side, it's like, well, I'm holding it wrong.

103
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,639
No, I, I'm serious

104
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,380
that,

105
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,238
yes, that's how I deal with bugs on my.

106
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,600
Like, I'll reboot the system and then I'm like, well,

107
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,359
I need to learn a new way to hold this.

108
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:22,579
It's,

109
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,029
it's my fault.

110
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,899
I,

111
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,570
I clearly didn't pay Apple enough money or I should have bought a

112
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:30,739
Macbook instead of a Mac Air because what else can I really do?

113
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:35,019
-- Yes, that is correct.
-- You know, like I could file a bug.

114
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:36,799
Can you, can you file?

115
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:38,869
I don't, I don't know, I don't know how to file.

116
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,950
I know when my Mac crashes, it has the, would you like to send us a report?

117
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,209
And that's the,

118
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,220
-- all I've seen
-- developer feedback using the feedback assistant.

119
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,950
Oh, this is for actually getting, like, feedback and bugs in your stuff, I think.

120
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:56,910
Anyway, we don't have

121
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,609
this right now

122
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,730
and then, like, with Windows kind of

123
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:02,890
the assumption is if it's a minor bug, whatever, that's just how it works.

124
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,929
And if it's a major bug, yeah,

125
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,739
probably some enterprise user will report this to Microsoft and they'll fix it.

126
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,549
Maybe eventually

127
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,850
I'll complain on, on

128
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:10,929
Mastodon.

129
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,410
If there's a windows bug I hit, which is, I don't,

130
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,269
I don't hit a lot because I don't like windows.

131
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,570
But,

132
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,549
and then with Linux,

133
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,820
I

134
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,589
-- might file a bug,
-- I file lots of bugs on Linux. Yeah.

135
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,079
Part of it is

136
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,510
I can actually file,

137
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,299
I don't wanna say just a good bug in the sense of like, hey,

138
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:31,910
this exact version with this exact command line, you know, blah, blah, blah.

139
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:35,545
But for example, I can file it very concisely against

140
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:36,625
the correct person.

141
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:38,295
Whereas if I file a bug in windows,

142
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,964
it's kind of like I just sort of fired off into Microsoft and I'm like,

143
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,024
goodbye, have fun at college.

144
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:44,575
But like, it's just,

145
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:47,904
you know, it's like going on a transatlantic voyage like I hope you get there.

146
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:52,059
-- I have no idea.
-- So, OK, so there's, there's two pieces to this.

147
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,980
I, I and I, I have a fun example to give, but

148
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,179
I think

149
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,869
there is also a myth in the world of open source that like, oh anyone can contribute,

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,059
anyone can file bugs.

151
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,690
But the reality is they can't.

152
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,420
And there's a lot of reasons for that

153
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,459
and I'll, I'll give a really good example.

154
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,369
So

155
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:10,299
I

156
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,200
was running X Windows for a long time because I was using the Audacity

157
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,799
audio editor literally for the podcast.

158
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,209
And audacity on Wayland

159
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,640
basically made Wayland like come to this crushing

160
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,130
halt where it was just whatever they were doing

161
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,839
was in, we'll say incompatible with what however Wayland worked, right?

162
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,279
But if I ran it in X Windows, it worked fine.

163
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,600
So I was running

164
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,079
modern Fedora

165
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,790
modern

166
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,519
Gnome

167
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,220
in X Windows.

168
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:39,899
Gnome.

169
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,170
Yeah, it's called Gnome.

170
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:41,660
That's its

171
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:41,929
name.

172
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,200
No,

173
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,959
it's funny because there's AAA board game shop in

174
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,589
town called Gnome Games and I always call it Gnome

175
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,869
games and everyone thinks I'm a freak.

176
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
But I'm like, this is just literally decades of abuse.

177
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,910
-- Yeah,
-- that's how, that's how you pronounce it can.

178
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,010
And so now, yeah, like the people who own the shop, they think I'm a weirdo which I am.

179
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:03,899
But I mean, anyway,

180
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,790
-- we
-- can spend money there. So it's OK.

181
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,869
I guess that's fair. They're nice. But so anyway, I am running Audacity. I'm using

182
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,230
Gnome

183
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,390
with X Windows

184
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,470
and obviously a lot of the developers for Gnome have been using

185
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,709
Wayland and so a lot of the features are in Wayland and

186
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,850
you can tell X Windows is kind of a second class citizen now. It's not quite as right.

187
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:28,179
And I found this weird bug where c I forget what they call it.

188
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,570
You know, how,

189
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,390
like you have the windows now where they put all the decoration crap in,

190
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,470
like the title bar.

191
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,809
Like, like if you run a

192
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:35,079
month

193
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:39,092
web browser instead of having like the old school title bar at the very top,

194
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:41,572
it has like the tabs and all that crap in it Now,

195
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:46,412
whatever you, you you, I I promise you your browser is doing this.

196
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:47,692
-- You just don't realize it.
-- Yeah.

197
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:49,013
-- Yeah, the tabs at the top,
-- right?

198
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:51,513
Instead of having the like empty window bar

199
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:56,363
-- because that's just dumb wasted space.
-- I disagree. But anyway,

200
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:59,376
I need somewhere to click to move things. Kurt, I move things a lot

201
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:00,575
anyway.

202
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:02,105
That's, that's

203
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:03,536
fair.

204
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:04,055
So anyway,

205
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:06,665
I use Windows power toys to solve that problem.

206
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,075
Like I literally

207
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:11,885
-- have a piece of software to explicitly solve that problem. So yes, you are
-- correct.

208
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,925
Use windows anyway.

209
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:13,795
OK.

210
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:14,566
So

211
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:17,316
I realize that there is a problem

212
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:18,075
in

213
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:18,799
Geno

214
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:22,170
on next windows where if I have a traditional window that is in the

215
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,929
background because I also use focus follows

216
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,209
mouse because I'll just move something,

217
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,670
my mouse and into a window type things,

218
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,739
move it back to the other window type things which which I

219
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,989
found like windows and apple do a terrible job at that,

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,909
which is one of the other reasons I detest them.

221
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,830
But anyway.

222
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,520
So I've got focus follows mouse and I find if I have something in the background

223
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,960
and I click on the, the menu bar, not menu bar, the title bar thing.

224
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,280
No, it doesn't, it doesn't come to the top.

225
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,799
I have to grab it and move it for it to come to the top.

226
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,830
-- Oh,
-- you actually have to like, you have to move it a pixel at least.

227
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:50,780
But then,

228
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:54,599
so I, I'm like, OK, this is annoying and this is bugging me.

229
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,359
And so I start doing some research

230
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,770
and I find a bug in the genome

231
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,780
bug tracker

232
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:04,109
and someone had reported this, but they, the, the developers asked some questions

233
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,090
and they had no idea what to do next. And I find that I'm like,

234
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:09,750
I know exactly what to do here.

235
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:12,700
So I spent like literally like two hours figuring out exactly

236
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,960
what was happening and it turned out it only affected the,

237
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,469
I don't know the lingo and I even said this at the beginning like,

238
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:18,669
I don't know your fancy words.

239
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,239
So please excuse my like horrible caveman speech.

240
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,590
-- But
-- the fact that you know that you don't know

241
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:26,960
is already putting you in the top percent of bug reporters

242
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,030
probably. But anyway, I found out this only affected

243
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,280
the like traditional windows, the new, like, like fancy decorations,

244
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,950
-- those worked
-- fine

245
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,809
legacy

246
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:38,190
code.

247
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,330
Yeah. Right. Exactly. Exactly what it was.

248
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,340
And I did like all this work, I thought I fill out all this information b

249
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,229
for the developers. Like, oh, I know exactly what's wrong with this.

250
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,190
And of course, I, I think,

251
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,830
I don't know if it's fixed now because actually I switch audio

252
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,880
editors to a tool called Reaper and Reaper works fine in Wayland.

253
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,940
So I'm like, whatever Fux windows I'm out.

254
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,429
So I, I actually don't know if it's fixed. I, I suppose I could go check.

255
00:09:58,609 --> 00:09:58,830
But,

256
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,150
yeah, like this is one of those examples where

257
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,979
the, the I, I think it is a, I don't know if I'd call it a myth or a lie.

258
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:07,880
But saying anyone can contribute to open source

259
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,590
is for, for a lot of people

260
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,119
submitting bug reports to open source is no different than submitting bug

261
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,739
reports to Microsoft because it's outside of the realm of possibility.

262
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:18,229
No.

263
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,900
You know what it's like saying, it's like saying if your car has a problem,

264
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:22,780
you tell the mechanic what it is and they'll fix it.

265
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:24,820
-- Oh, yeah, that's fair
-- too. Yeah,

266
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,419
like

267
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,179
if you could actually diagnose a modern car problem,

268
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,140
you're basically a mechanic.

269
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,700
And I think that's part of the challenge here is

270
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:37,679
this is stuff that is like, ok, if a, if a fence board has a crack in it,

271
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,750
the fence board has a crack in it.

272
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,000
That's very sort of simple, direct and relatable and

273
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:42,020
visible

274
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:46,380
cause and effect. But software is complex. Cars are complex

275
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,059
and so there isn't

276
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:51,340
like there are some car noises where I'm like, ok, I know what that means.

277
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:52,700
Like a timing belt or something.

278
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,099
But there's a lot of stuff where, like,

279
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:58,929
a friend of mine has a car that will randomly just choose not to start,

280
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,119
but all the lights and dash and everything come on.

281
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,479
And so they replaced their battery that didn't solve it.

282
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:05,679
It's still like, it'll just randomly

283
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,510
not start and then 10 minutes later it'll start fine and it'll work and then it'll

284
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,419
right. And it's like,

285
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,380
yeah, that sounds like it's gonna be expensive for a mechanic to track down.

286
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,260
Probably.

287
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,260
I mean, it's funny, I, I had that with my old pickup truck.

288
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,820
I drove the check engine light was on for about a decade

289
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,510
and the mechanic I go to said, look,

290
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,989
I could figure out why this check engine lights on,

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,710
but it's gonna probably cost you as much as this truck is worth.

292
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:34,219
So, as long as the truck runs and there's nothing terribly wrong with it.

293
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:36,030
Like, let's just pretend it's fine.

294
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,030
I'm ok with that.

295
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,520
Yeah.

296
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,340
So

297
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,380
that's the thing is just

298
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,590
number one fixing a software bug means you have to understand

299
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,270
the software notice. I didn't say the software bug.

300
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,320
-- I said you have to understand the software,
-- uh, to a degree.

301
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,500
I would, I would agree with that.

302
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,270
-- Yeah,
-- because otherwise you're gonna make co changes that

303
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:58,289
impact the software in ways that are negative.

304
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,739
Right. How many times? Oh, perfect. So how many times have we seen Linne Torvalds

305
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,820
go? This patch is followed by a very, like,

306
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,679
-- apparently he's getting therapy now and he's like, nicer creative
-- string of

307
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,390
words.

308
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,590
But in fairness if they did put that patch in, it would be

309
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,140
horrific

310
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,179
for some reason, like either performance or security or whatever.

311
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,710
Like, like,

312
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,729
I'm always reminded of uh what was the one where the

313
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,539
patches had a 30% performance impact for the CPU bug?

314
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,820
-- Was it heart bleed or whatever it was?
-- It was like shell shock or something, right?

315
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,919
-- No, not
-- shell shock. That was the bash stuff, but the, the CPU stuff. Uh

316
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:30,690
Ghost

317
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:30,869
and

318
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:32,859
anyways the CPU stuff.

319
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:34,969
Uh Yeah, Ghost or whatever.

320
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,659
I know what you mean

321
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,369
-- though. Yeah.
-- Yeah.

322
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,940
And it's like, yeah, we can fix this but there's a 30% performance impact.

323
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:40,900
I remember that.

324
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,760
Yeah, we

325
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,510
can't do that. Like those people running

326
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,570
servers that are running at like anywhere more than 65

327
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,030
ish percent capacity,

328
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:50,780
whatever.

329
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,080
Amazon

330
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,270
probably loved it. Like

331
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:56,390
I still maintain like this patch sponsored by Amazon.

332
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:57,460
So,

333
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:00,469
but that's 30% more aws. Now, everybody.

334
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,429
Like, if there's a board in my fence that's broken,

335
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,309
it's actually a nontrivial fix because I have to take

336
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,710
some of the fence apart to get the board,

337
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,789
the new board in.

338
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,390
But it's,

339
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,909
but it's doable.

340
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:10,669
But

341
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,159
like, you're bugging gnome,

342
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,039
like,

343
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,690
right? Like, I, I don't know, like, I don't know

344
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,859
gnome and it's, it's in the tens of millions of lines of code

345
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,729
size.

346
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,849
And now now look, no, no, no.

347
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,840
So the point is I'm saying is complexity

348
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:30,929
matters and just understanding the software, let alone understanding the bug,

349
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,890
let alone understanding how to fix the bug

350
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,869
properly. Now, sometimes it's easy. It's like, oh, we didn't escape HTML,

351
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:39,039
escape HTML. We good or an integer overflow.

352
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:43,450
But a lot of times these bugs are not simple or especially if it's old legacy code.

353
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,809
It's kind of like a logic error in which case.

354
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,409
What is the correct logic? Like every time there's AAA TCP/IP problem

355
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,960
and somebody determines like, oh, the specs unclear.

356
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,520
Well, now what?

357
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,590
No, like

358
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:56,219
because

359
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:59,640
the correct behavior is not specified.

360
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,820
Um OK. What do we do now?

361
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:03,219
I mean,

362
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,570
and over the years we've accrued.

363
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,020
Sure.

364
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:06,729
Sure.

365
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,330
I think that's a vaguely different problem.

366
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,179
And I, I want to tie this back to security bugs though.

367
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,849
I think security bugs are a great example of this

368
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,770
where I remember

369
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:19,770
there was a time I

370
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,559
did a bunch of fuzzing. This was back when fuzzing was brand new.

371
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,729
I wrote a Fuzz to Fuzz true type fonts.

372
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,140
I submitted patches to the, the true type. What is, what is free type?

373
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,690
I think it was called the free type project

374
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,750
because I'd fuzzed all these fonts. I had a bunch of reproducers.

375
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,000
I tracked down the integer overflows. I added the checks

376
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,500
and I sent them, it was like 15 different bugs

377
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:45,020
and I sent it to their mailing list and they were like, oh, this is all the same bug.

378
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,219
You actually are fixing the wrong integer overflow.

379
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:51,109
If you fix this one up here, it solves all these problems. I was like, holy crap.

380
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:52,099
That's freaking amazing.

381
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,169
But that's an example of these people understood the code.

382
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:58,130
Really, really well, I did not understand the code really, really well.

383
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,659
So I was working within the confines of my knowledge, but it was wrong.

384
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,309
And so one patch instead of 15 patches, that's a huge deal, you know,

385
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:06,909
well,

386
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,530
-- and
-- more to the point fixing it correctly versus like how

387
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,830
many times have we seen a place try to band aid?

388
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:16,059
The symptom like windows was famous for this. Remember, Windows would fix a bug

389
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,630
and then literally two hours later on Microsoft Tuesday, somebody would be like,

390
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,239
-- I got it.
-- I mean,

391
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,330
that's the story of shell shock.

392
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,190
Like I mean, shell shock is I'll,

393
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,109
I'll tell the story for anyone who hasn't heard it before.

394
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:27,390
But

395
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,020
Shellshock was a problem in bash where,

396
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,750
what was it? Certain environment variables I think could end up executing bash

397
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,380
arbitrary code.

398
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,260
And the correct solution was to just basically escape

399
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,419
all of the environment variables in a certain way.

400
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:46,260
But by doing that, you would break backwards compatibility.

401
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,239
So the bash people,

402
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,780
their first patch was to only

403
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:54,260
address the specific environment variable in question

404
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,700
and I remember

405
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,390
-- I was at Red Hat at the time and we were, we were, we were coordinating
-- this.

406
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,710
-- I remember thinking there might be more.
-- Yeah.

407
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,130
And I remember we even said this, we're like,

408
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,969
we're pretty sure this is gonna be there's

409
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,650
other variables that this can be done with.

410
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,849
They're like, no, no, we're not going to touch it. We're only doing this.

411
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:11,179
They released their patch and I think it was Tavis

412
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,570
Ormandy like literally two hours later found another one.

413
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:16,210
They fixed that one

414
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,390
then literally like two hours after the next release.

415
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,299
I think it was Tavis found another one

416
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:24,530
-- and then I think it was um
-- um Michael

417
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,849
-- Zaleski also found a bunch.
-- Yeah,

418
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:27,510
Zaleski. Yeah, he ended up running

419
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:27,940
a

420
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,669
fuzz against it, I think and found a lot.

421
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,070
-- And that's when Bash was like, OK, we're gonna actually have to do this, right?
-- And

422
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:38,260
there was also Florian and uh Florian Weimer

423
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:39,039
and then Toss

424
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:42,705
-- Sabine also found a couple in the parser code
-- that that could

425
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:44,625
be because Florian is doing a ton of work on this.

426
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:48,614
-- I know
-- he found 21 with Todd and another on his own.

427
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:50,494
Yeah, that guy's scary, smart

428
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,825
and that's a perfect example of like Florian is

429
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:53,875
the kind of human being where you're like,

430
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:55,135
just you can go fix the

431
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:57,794
pa the thing yourself. And he's like, yes, yes, I can.

432
00:16:58,015 --> 00:16:58,434
But

433
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:01,284
there's like six of him on the planet. If that.

434
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:03,044
Right. Like,

435
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:04,670
you know.

436
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,040
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But,

437
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,540
I mean, anyway,

438
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,770
-- so, but
-- I think at least with open source there's the chance of it. And also I think,

439
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,199
and I've said this before on the show, there's this accountability piece of, like,

440
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:18,380
there's a public bug filed.

441
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,780
It's been ignored for a year or two and,

442
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:21,848
you know, uh,

443
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,180
you at least get some validation that you're not

444
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:26,140
the only one that ran into this and cares.

445
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,380
That's kind of nice. Right.

446
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,979
I mean, it, it can be, but at the same time I also take issue with people who think

447
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,920
if you file a bug with an open source project, they should fix it.

448
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:39,660
Like there's nothing wrong with the project, won't fixing a bug.

449
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,030
-- I, I think that's a good attitude.
-- Mo Dash

450
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,839
just declared a bug bankruptcy.

451
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,790
And, yeah, so if you go is issue,

452
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:51,609
uh, so basically in their current issue, Tracker and github

453
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,829
-- they have two open and 4166 closed.
-- You know what? I don't, I don't blame them.

454
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,959
You know what that feels like

455
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:02,449
if you ever come back from vacation and you just have so much email, you're just like,

456
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,130
select all delete.

457
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,439
I, I can't deal with this. There's nothing I can do and sometimes that's ok.

458
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,530
Well, I mean, at some point

459
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,939
I think, uh, going back to accepting reality for what it is.

460
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,420
Oh, we have 4000 open bugs and three developers

461
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:20,569
for sure. And part of the challenge is it's just, it's distracting.

462
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:22,859
Like, what is the mo ok. Just triaging.

463
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:24,160
It's just rating,

464
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,599
just reading the titles of 4000 bugs is gonna take you

465
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:31,500
-- hours
-- just knowing you have 4000 bugs is mentally exhausting.

466
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,390
It's in the back of your mind all the time. I have 4000 bugs.

467
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:36,819
That sucks.

468
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,500
Yeah. And so I think, but one thing it proves is that no,

469
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:44,109
you can't just fix it if you find a bug because,

470
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,300
I mean,

471
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,560
there's 4000 bugs that have been closed.

472
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:50,229
Obviously, some of them are closed, you know, fixed or whatever it has.

473
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:54,189
But looking at this, like, some of them are not that complicated,

474
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:54,849
but

475
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,900
I mean, there's,

476
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:59,119
there's no chance of them fixing it. Like, oh, here's a perfect one.

477
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:02,180
I didn't find the Conca dot Js and file and master.

478
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,900
Change the name. Question mark.

479
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,989
-- That's the bug.
-- That's it.

480
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,150
And then followed up with, could you please tell me the answer from another person?

481
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:10,760
What

482
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,140
I don't? Well, I, I probably, I'm lacking knowledge.

483
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,040
I'm sure that might make sense to someone who uses it. But

484
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,849
so, but now, now

485
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:20,979
there's always going to be the people who say, oh,

486
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:24,199
just send a patch upstream for the bug you have.

487
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,020
-- And that's not always simple either.
-- Well, and that's almost worse in a way because

488
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,349
I mean, if you think A I produces bad code quality,

489
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,839
you should see the random patches people send into open source projects.

490
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:35,910
Well, it's, it's not, I mean,

491
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,550
so there's that aspect but even let's pretend I'm a good developer for a minute.

492
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,989
If I want to submit a patch to a project,

493
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:47,540
you go to the project and they often have like a developing

494
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,170
section where they talk about here is how we develop the software.

495
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,739
And it's often you need to obviously clone the repository,

496
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,089
you need to install these dependencies,

497
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,780
you need to run these test cases, you need to do all this and that and other. And like

498
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,604
I remember when I started at anchor,

499
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,074
one of the first things I did

500
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:09,175
is I took our open source project Sift and Gripe, I cloned the repositories.

501
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:12,354
And then I was like, I'm going to build these and I'm going to see what it takes.

502
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:13,935
And then as I went, I,

503
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:17,074
I fixed the developing documentation because I knew it was wrong.

504
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,400
And like

505
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,689
I obviously had

506
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,510
financial motivation to do this because I want,

507
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,550
I obviously I wanted to learn the projects, but I also wanted to make it more,

508
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,410
you know, like approachable by others.

509
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,550
But how many projects have outdated,

510
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,729
like developing documentation that is completely wrong for

511
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:34,010
one reason or another because I mean,

512
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,189
developers are legendary for never upgrading the docs, you know,

513
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,280
that's just how it is.

514
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,930
But I, I think that's one of the challenges open source has is just the fact that

515
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,189
you look at this documentation on how to submit a patch

516
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:51,030
and it's often extremely complicated and, and usually out of date.

517
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:52,750
And so if I'm a new developer,

518
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,469
do I have two days to get this project up and running on my local environment?

519
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:00,270
So I can create a patch so I can send a patch in.

520
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,510
No,

521
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,180
-- you probably
-- don't only to be told it

522
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:05,270
doesn't meet their cultural standards for coding.

523
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:05,949
Well, that too.

524
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:09,800
Yeah, I mean, that's ignoring the angle of dealing with the,

525
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,579
the developers on the other end of that.

526
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:11,959
I mean,

527
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,400
imagine like sending a patch to the Linux kernel

528
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:19,199
with no background or history or understanding what's going on.

529
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,229
Like, oh my goodness, you'd be run out of town,

530
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:21,959
you know.

531
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:26,099
Well, and in a way, I have to say kind of rightly so because

532
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,329
you can't just be taking random people's patches and shoving

533
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:31,920
them into the Linux kernel and hoping for the best,

534
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,199
like

535
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,750
-- for sure,
-- for sure. Actually.

536
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,040
Did you hear that at the, there's the open source summit was going on this week.

537
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,270
Uh Jonathan Corbett

538
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,930
gave a talk about the long term Linux kernel versions and they're reducing the,

539
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:48,219
the lifetime from six years to two because they're having maintenance issues,

540
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:49,609
finding developers to work on it.

541
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:50,109
Like

542
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:51,310
-- I get it.
-- So

543
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:54,459
that's so weird because like, like when we were at red hat,

544
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:58,209
it was so easy to find Linux kernel maintainer developers.

545
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,209
It was

546
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,150
super easy.

547
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,339
I know. I'm being sarcastic.

548
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,869
This is,

549
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,250
see, I'm really bad at that.

550
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,550
This is what, like, two or three episodes in a row that,

551
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,109
-- that your sarcasm has flown over my head,
-- dude.

552
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,630
Like Red Hat has money to pay people to do this

553
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,829
and even Red Hat is struggling and drowning

554
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,540
in the Linux kernel

555
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:21,010
who has

556
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,810
to work on old stuff

557
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:24,280
is

558
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,099
worse than that.

559
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,430
The level of expertise needed to work on that and do the

560
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,020
old stuff is the same level of expertise needed to work on.

561
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,030
Cool new things.

562
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,189
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

563
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:38,069
And if you have that level of expertise, unless I don't know what

564
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,890
you, you'd probably want to work on new stuff and not do maintenance, patching.

565
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,229
I mean,

566
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:42,939
yeah,

567
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,910
I don't want, I don't want to do old kernel patches

568
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,939
-- like that sounds terrible. So,
-- yeah.

569
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:48,800
No, it's, I,

570
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm actually always kind of surprised at how long some

571
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,219
of these LTs life cycles are for free software because

572
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:58,420
especially something with the complexity of the Linux kernel. Like, oh, yes.

573
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,829
Like I remember

574
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,770
building Slackware 1.0 with the Linux fal

575
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,790
0.99 or nine, I think we started about 91 or 92 and then

576
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,300
-- 99 patch level infinity
-- probably fit on a floppy back then

577
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,089
a couple of floppies.

578
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,709
But yeah, like, I mean,

579
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,689
and even back then, like, it was a much simpler thing. Like I knew the config file.

580
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,709
-- Like there was only a couple, like 200 options.
-- I remember, I

581
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,650
remember the Linux config file and that's like a blast from that.

582
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,189
-- I wonder what it looks like now. It's got to be insane.
-- It's machine generated.

583
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:30,969
It's, but

584
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:31,359
uh

585
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:34,390
like going back to this, like the skill,

586
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,119
like,

587
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:35,994
even,

588
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:36,594
I

589
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:38,375
don't want to say trivial software because there's not a

590
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:41,185
lot of trivial software anymore because even something that is trivial

591
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:44,224
is typically interacting with non-trivial things.

592
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:45,015
Like your gen two

593
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:47,895
example, where they're smushing this stuff together in weird ways.

594
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:49,584
And it's like, oh, I guess what I found,

595
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:50,185
you know?

596
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:50,974
Yeah,

597
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:53,185
-- I mean, yeah, that's fair.
-- And so

598
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,619
I just,

599
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,160
I keep coming back to the fact that just because somebody reports a bug or a problem,

600
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:58,569
like,

601
00:23:59,089 --> 00:23:59,859
maybe you should,

602
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:02,400
if that's your entire business model and you want to keep them happy,

603
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,680
but that's not a business model.

604
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:04,839
Most projects have.

605
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,569
Well, that's a business model for businesses, not for projects

606
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:10,780
that's fair. And that's true because

607
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,760
I know

608
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:15,109
obviously every product company I've ever worked with,

609
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:18,000
there were bugs customers would report. You know, here's the thing

610
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,089
customers would rather have you tell them we will not fix this

611
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:25,400
than have you pretend you might someday maybe,

612
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:29,479
right. That way they at least understand like we can work around this

613
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,410
or we can wait for the fix.

614
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:32,479
You know what I mean?

615
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,170
And, and I know that's always one of the challenges is like,

616
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,319
where do we draw that line?

617
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:36,910
What do we say?

618
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,250
Like, we're not fixing this bug, but we are fixing that bug and that's hard to do.

619
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,329
And some of it was also educating them, right?

620
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:44,900
Because I remember one bank reported across that scripting vulnerability in a

621
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,209
product and was freaking out and wanted daily updates and I'm like,

622
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:47,569
nope.

623
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,920
And they're like, what do you mean? No. And I'm like, no.

624
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:55,079
And they were flipping out and then I was like, well, here's the exact same

625
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,719
type of bug severity

626
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,900
mark does

627
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,790
won't like, maybe we'll fix it and it's,

628
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,109
and, and that actually calmed them down.

629
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,300
I think that got their internal people because my suspicion

630
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,780
is that they had some security person who was like,

631
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,819
really like I found this bug and I want the credit and I

632
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:12,040
want to make a big deal out of this and chicken little it

633
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,189
and to be blunt, probably the higher ups were like, yeah, we whatever, man, like

634
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,020
what is cross

635
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,069
site scripting again?

636
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,069
You know, for them to have this kind of answer of like, oh,

637
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,689
here's another one that's public and been public for months.

638
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:23,709
I,

639
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:28,250
I always felt bad when a security researcher would report like a

640
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,550
trivial security bug like that and it's like your bug is valid.

641
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,780
Thank you for the report.

642
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,030
-- We're never fixing this.
-- Well, I mean, we've had to go that far with like,

643
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,319
how many bug. How many website bug bounties now explicitly say,

644
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:43,239
like best practice hardening tips around like

645
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:43,689
Deam

646
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,839
and SPF and TLS and all that stuff. We just weren't. No.

647
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:50,319
Right. Because how many people are reporting that kind of simple stuff,

648
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,359
you know, for sure.

649
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,140
Or like, uh Daniel from Curl just posted one where somebody,

650
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,680
was it a no point or d reference, I want to say,

651
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:59,989
and after a lot of back and forth, the,

652
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,369
the person finally understood that this is not exploitable or a security block

653
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,859
and it took a while, but they finally got educated

654
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,000
and basically like kind of Daniel got through this person by

655
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,079
forcing them to explain how it was exploitable.

656
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:13,760
And initially they were just like, it's an all point or D reference.

657
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:15,405
E says it's a bad

658
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:19,045
type of flaw and traditionally there are blah, blah, blah and he's like,

659
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:19,805
that's cool.

660
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:23,785
But like, what about this bug? Explain how this bug is exploitable.

661
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,175
And eventually the person came back basically saying like, yeah, I tried to like,

662
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,665
kind of figure out how it was exploitable and it's not.

663
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:33,185
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. But how much time was spent,

664
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:35,535
you know what I mean? And that's tough.

665
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:36,785
That's really tough. You can't,

666
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,250
how do I say this nicely?

667
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,060
You can maybe think of asking this of someone who is a programmer for a full time job

668
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,560
but anybody else that is an unreasonable ridiculous thing

669
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,500
to even think about asking them to do.

670
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,449
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. That's fair. That's fair.

671
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,959
You know.

672
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,750
And, and in fairness that goes also to,

673
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,910
that's the thing that worries me though is like, there's often that, you know,

674
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,369
a very unsophisticated person who wants to report a bug and kind of can't.

675
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,959
And my, my concern is always, like,

676
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:07,170
are they the one person that decides to speak up

677
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,329
and there's thousands of people suffering from this bug?

678
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:09,989
I mean,

679
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,390
there's probably more than one and I think that's one of

680
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,599
the angles that I find very interesting in the open source universe

681
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:17,520
is,

682
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:17,880
uh,

683
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:22,329
it's a, it's a, it's all statistics, right? It's all giant numbers.

684
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:25,650
You have millions of users, maybe billions of users in some cases.

685
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,329
And if 10 people speak up it,

686
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:31,489
you probably need to multiply that by a pretty big number to get

687
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,650
an idea of how many people are actually affected by a particular issue,

688
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,369
you know,

689
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,119
and it's kind of like this is one of the

690
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,589
things that hacker news thread brings up for that whole,

691
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,719
like what 0.8% of our users are Linux,

692
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,569
but they're 80% of our bugs or whatever.

693
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:44,189
But

694
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:44,310
yeah,

695
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,790
one of the people in the hacker news thread is like, look,

696
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,369
Linux users are really good at filing bugs.

697
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,699
So of course, they're filing more bugs than Windows users are

698
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:54,609
Netflix. I don't know if that's technically true though.

699
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:55,930
I mean, I've run games on Linux

700
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,760
and they're super flaky and it's because my Linux

701
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,709
installation is like some like nightmarish Frankenstein monster.

702
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:03,380
And that's fine.

703
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,069
Go ask anybody at your company who's not a

704
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,150
developer to go file a bug against your products.

705
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,380
I mean, they do that all the time,

706
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,589
-- like, like a salesperson.
-- Uh So

707
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:11,719
our

708
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,250
sales people, we're really small. So sales people are shockingly competent. But,

709
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:17,109
ok,

710
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:20,390
but like when I, when I joined Red Hat, you know,

711
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,930
you go through your one day induction or your Yeah, one or was it two day induction?

712
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,479
Yeah, two day induction. You know, you fly down

713
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,829
two days and um

714
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,689
there was me another technical person and then like uh over a dozen sales people that

715
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:35,859
-- really did not understand what the GP L was. I mean,
-- that's fair.

716
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:36,199
Why

717
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:37,010
-- would they,
-- so

718
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,089
they're gonna file a bug hat?

719
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,780
-- Well, they
-- don't, they, this is why. So I mean, look

720
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:44,469
in the context of a company like Red Hat salespeople don't file bugs.

721
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,910
Salespeople talk to

722
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,099
support people and support people, file bugs.

723
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:50,229
But what I'm saying is this is an example of where these

724
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:53,109
people are like asking a regular user to file a bug.

725
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:53,969
That's fair.

726
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,660
Like if that regular user is a full time programmer, that's maybe a fair ask.

727
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:03,589
-- But if that regular user is my mother, like come on.
-- OK. So II I actually have a good

728
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,910
kind of example for this. So

729
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:11,010
there are new Arduinos out. They are four Right. They have an arm chip in them now.

730
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,829
They're very cool.

731
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,140
And I've been doing a bunch of like, electronics project work and I'm, I,

732
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,010
I only have one Arduino left that's not broken now.

733
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:22,550
And so I'm like, I should buy some more. I, I break things cart. It's what I do like

734
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,930
putting a lot of voltage into an Arduino is a bad idea.

735
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:26,660
Just saying

736
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:30,089
I would love to tell you, I won't do that, but I make no guarantees anyway.

737
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:33,209
So I buy two, right? And they come, one of them works fine.

738
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,130
The other one doesn't work at all.

739
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,729
And it looks like the USB port is missing some solder joints on it.

740
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,400
That is my suspicion.

741
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,699
I'm not going to try to fix it because like,

742
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:46,339
I'll probably just make it worse and I literally just bought this thing.

743
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:49,819
So I'm like, I'm going to contact Arduino support and see what happens. And

744
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,329
we've reached the point after giving them basically a very detailed explanation

745
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:58,339
of everything I've done of why this is definitely a broken Arduino.

746
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,709
And they send me this huge questionnaire with all this stuff.

747
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,060
They want me to do like do this and then take a screenshot,

748
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,329
do this and then take a screenshot.

749
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:05,839
And I'm like

750
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,770
part of me is offended

751
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
because the data I've already sent you

752
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,060
is vastly more valuable than this questionnaire.

753
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:14,180
It's like a resume

754
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:19,099
-- processing site, right? Like we need it in a standardized format for our.
-- Exactly.

755
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:21,810
And, and that's the thing, dealing with a normal person,

756
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:25,819
they probably already are going to be able to barely fill this thing out.

757
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:30,630
And I get that because it's, I'm basically filing a bug report with Arduino

758
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,410
and they're trying to validate my bug.

759
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,619
And so they're asking for this enormous list of information

760
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,209
to verify. I do, in fact have a broken Arduino

761
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,010
and I'm not holding it wrong, so to speak.

762
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:42,689
Right.

763
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:46,369
And in my particular instance, I have two arduinos, one of them works flawlessly.

764
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,500
One of them like does not work at all.

765
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:52,119
And it's funny because when I plug it into windows, I have no idea what's going on.

766
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,829
So I plug it into Linux and I can look at the output of logs and stuff.

767
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,449
I'm like, oh, I see what's happening. I understand completely.

768
00:30:57,969 --> 00:31:00,170
And it's funny because they're like, we want the windows output.

769
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,709
I'm like, whatever.

770
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:04,550
So you're gonna get it because I want my,

771
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,750
we're gonna see if we can get this thing replaced.

772
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,949
But

773
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,609
anyway, anyway, it's, I guess the thing I would sum this all up as is the whole,

774
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,670
like anyone can contribute to open source is probably a lie.

775
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,560
And

776
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,829
I think the, the amusement

777
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:19,790
of

778
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,920
going through normal people processes when you're,

779
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,880
we'll say moderately technical,

780
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,160
I find entertaining because it's like a peek behind the curtain of what must be

781
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:34,199
-- just madness for the most part.
-- Have you turned it off and on.

782
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,260
Yes. Yes, I did several times.

783
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:36,859
But

784
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:38,880
in fact, I even, I,

785
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:41,319
I found out this is one thing I was disappointed

786
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:43,760
in is the chip they're using in the new Arduino

787
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,989
is from some French company.

788
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,800
And there, it, it's very unfriendly to open source.

789
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:54,219
Their software only runs on windows for like, like the building and flashing the,

790
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:55,699
the boot rom inside of it.

791
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:56,869
And

792
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,959
I will say Windows now has like a rollback feature.

793
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,989
I, I set a rollback point and then I installed this awful software that did,

794
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,430
who knows what to my computer

795
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:10,959
and none of it worked obviously because it was just completely trashed.

796
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:13,209
The Arduino doesn't work and of course, this is not,

797
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:15,250
this is not in the Arduino's instructions.

798
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,010
This is me just like going off the rails trying to fix this thing

799
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,660
and then I, I restored my windows install and I'm like,

800
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,109
thank goodness for that because that thing installed,

801
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,060
you know, that whole like, oh, this program is trying to do something scary.

802
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,359
You have to click. Yes, that popped up like 20 times to

803
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:35,140
install. But it's what Kurt, it's like, it's an IOT type software suite of stuff.

804
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,079
Oh, no, I know.

805
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:36,660
But they,

806
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,010
they don't need to be written that poorly and

807
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,780
-- it's
-- installing drivers and who knows what else.

808
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,119
Like, I don't want to know what it did to the system,

809
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,119
but it occurs to me if I was like, an actual, like, like, you know,

810
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,609
embedded type developer.

811
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,089
I would basically have a plague system just

812
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:54,119
for running all this software because there's like,

813
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,479
no way I would trust my computer ever again.

814
00:32:56,489 --> 00:32:59,160
It's cute that you think these developers work for

815
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,910
a company that will pay for two systems.

816
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,239
I, I probably not, but I mean, it's just like, oh, I can't believe how

817
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:08,390
it's just horrible that world is anyway. Anyway,

818
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,150
-- I'll give you the last word, man. Then we'll call it.
-- I don't know.

819
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,400
I don't really have a last word here.

820
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,000
It's just, I wish, I guess, you know what my biggest thing is.

821
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,369
I wish people would actually look at how the world is and not how it should be.

822
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,739
Like those people on, mastered,

823
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,430
on arguing about software updates saying if people basically

824
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:26,310
observed semantic versioning then updates would be safe.

825
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,260
-- And I'm like,
-- yes,

826
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,180
sure.

827
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:28,780
Like, just,

828
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,699
they'll magically have the resources to do long term support for some old version.

829
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,300
That's, that's a topic we'll have to bring up again soon.

830
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:42,239
-- Yeah,
-- I just, and I understand we should strive for a better world. Absolutely.

831
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,780
-- But we should also probably tell the truth about reality. I,
-- well, it's ok.

832
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,760
-- I like
-- low dash declaring a bug bankruptcy. That's true.

833
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:55,089
-- Yeah,
-- that's it. It is. It's very true.

834
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,199
And this is, we'll have to make this a topic at some point in the near future.

835
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:00,189
But, yeah, I think it comes back to like that whole,

836
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:03,449
the open source we have versus the open source people pretend we have, right?

837
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:03,910
And like,

838
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,530
like, oh, all these projects have a lot of contributors and super healthy,

839
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,820
like, looking at low dash 287 contributors.

840
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,620
All right. So number one, hasn't contributed since 2007 18.

841
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:20,668
Number two hasn't contributed since 2012.

842
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:24,138
And then everybody else is like 77 commits or less.

843
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:31,108
So. Oh yeah, low dash basically has not had really any activity since 2000, mid 2017.

844
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:31,279
That's

845
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:33,029
wow. Holy cow.

846
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:33,467
Yeah.

847
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,760
So like there's literally been

848
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:41,600
-- no activity since 2021. There's been no activity since 2021 wild
-- man wild.

849
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,478
But again,

850
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:47,438
like this is these are the kind of things like there's that prevailing attitude

851
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,399
of open source health

852
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,879
and is that a healthy project? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

853
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,860
-- I'm not going to say one way or the other.
-- Uh No, actually. OK. So the last commit was in

854
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,239
uh April 23rd of 2021.

855
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,179
-- What? To Low
-- Dash?

856
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,419
And then there's a commit from September 17th, 2023.

857
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:06,879
Formatting some

858
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,350
nits

859
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:08,530
horrifying, I

860
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,159
mean, and

861
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,790
bugs.

862
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:11,550
It's, well,

863
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:11,689
it's

864
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,629
-- hasn't been developed in two years.
-- I should look at that because that

865
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:19,199
anyway,

866
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:21,360
if you're running a node project, LO Dash

867
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,000
is in it,

868
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,639
probably 20 or 30 copies of low dash are in it.

869
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,760
Not even just one anyway. I am calling this one. Thank you, Kurt.

870
