Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast.

1
00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:12,810
Episode 50 with myself, Curtsey Fried and my partner in crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:15,520
I think you mean this is episode L

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,649
I agree in principle, but nobody knows.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:20,850
Oh,

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,360
speaking of, nobody knows.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,530
I wore my reading Rainbow t-shirt to my kids' school the other day.

7
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:29,100
-- Is that a Minecraft
-- shirt?

8
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:30,049
What,

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,119
-- what does it look
-- because it's got like an eight bit.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,490
It's, it's, uh, I did,

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,599
I participated in the Reboot Kickstarter for reading Rainbow, right,

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,549
a few years ago

13
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,229
and they had this really nice sort of eight bit pixel art of level of armor, like,

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,439
you know, leveling up like,

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,790
you know, anyways with reading

16
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,869
and, but three of the kids did know what reading Rainbow is. Thank goodness.

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,930
But the majority of them thought it was Minecraft related.

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,590
Of course

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,939
I did. It's,

20
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,889
-- that's the only place they would have seen pixelated graphics. I kind of get
-- it.

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,770
-- You know.
-- That's,

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,569
that's

23
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:00,869
a

24
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:01,130
good

25
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,439
-- point.
-- It does please

26
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,220
me though, that my Children call them eight bit graphics,

27
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,129
which brings a smile to my face.

28
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:10,139
That's right. I bet they don't know why they call it that though.

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,529
They do not.

30
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,260
So we don't

31
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,059
-- like, I still
-- use like,

32
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:19,580
do you like when you are in a youtube video and you want to go forwards or backwards?

33
00:01:19,589 --> 00:01:21,690
What do you say? Do you want to go forwards or backwards? Do you want to rewind?

34
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:22,760
Do you want to fast forward?

35
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:25,540
See, fast forward still makes sense in that context,

36
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,029
but rewind makes absolutely no sense anymore.

37
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:29,589
-- It's
-- why is the save

38
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,239
icon a floppy disk,

39
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,069
right?

40
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,779
Because quite frankly, what are we going to replace it with?

41
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,720
And, and that's kind of how it works, right? Is the notion of rewind.

42
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,559
Well, obviously, it initially meant

43
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,849
tape

44
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,550
it no

45
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:44,860
longer

46
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:45,930
physically, rewind

47
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,569
it and, and, but there's, there's, I'm sure there's plenty of other words

48
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,769
that are just like this. It started out with one meaning

49
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,089
and just kind of evolved with society.

50
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:56,680
But anyway. All right.

51
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,760
So episode L uh L is Roman numeral 50 for those of you playing along at home.

52
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,040
Uh I also speaking of the Romans,

53
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,410
I looked up some interesting facts about the number 50 because why not?

54
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,500
And it turns out that that in the year 50 ad,

55
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,789
the Romans learn to use soap from the galls,

56
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,009
which seems like a crazy thing. Like you had to learn to use soap,

57
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,589
they use

58
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,750
olive oil. Although I know some people who need to learn to use soap so I can relate.

59
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,250
What's even more amazing to me is the the,

60
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:28,050
the Romans used olive oil and this curve stick that I can't remember the name of.

61
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:30,000
But essentially they would put a li like,

62
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,009
they would basically cover themselves in a little bit of olive oil,

63
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,449
get all greased up essentially.

64
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,889
And then use this curved stick to like, scrape it off.

65
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,520
And so they, they actually tried this out, like, you know,

66
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:41,429
it was a documentary on this,

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,559
they tried it out and it actually works really well for getting you clean

68
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:48,639
and it doesn't feel, apparently, feel nearly as disgusting as you would think.

69
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,880
And then the best part is, here's the best part.

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,289
The essentially that oil would, you know, take all your body odor with it.

71
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,139
So the Gladiators would sell this stuff.

72
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,949
I've heard that, that, that Gladiator sweat was considered magic.

73
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:03,589
That's great.

74
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,350
Anyway, this is disgusting.

75
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:07,679
Yeah,

76
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:11,059
-- let's, let's move.
-- The problem is we both probably watch a lot of Q

77
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,520
I,

78
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:16,080
I do not watch Qii, I don't know. IQ I isn't all right.

79
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:17,919
Number one, I barely watch any TV.

80
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,639
And Q I

81
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:19,779
locally

82
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,919
I don't watch a lot of youtube.

83
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:24,690
Well, when I do watch youtube it's usually video game videos.

84
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:29,199
So I'm, I'm not gonna watch Q, I, but I'm familiar with many of the topics.

85
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,250
It, it's a good show. Don't get me wrong.

86
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,419
It's just, it's, it's not convenient enough. I'm lazy.

87
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,729
Like if it was on Netflix, I might consider it. It might be. I've never found it.

88
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,720
But anyway, um,

89
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,690
I must say there's one other immense travesty that's

90
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,860
going to happen very soon is in the US.

91
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:48,169
Futurama is leaving Netflix on July 1st, which is

92
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,919
like, ruined my life.

93
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,649
I

94
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,050
wonder if it's leaving in Canada.

95
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:52,429
I, I,

96
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,169
I rumor hands that apparently Fox is trying to start their own streaming service.

97
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,130
That's just what I need. I need 50 streaming services. Right.

98
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,610
That's totally what I want.

99
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:06,449
Uh I get why they're doing this because that is their mindset, right?

100
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,369
We have the content

101
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,169
but the problem is, it's like that was the mindset of Blockbuster

102
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,970
how that work out.

103
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:14,100
I

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,540
granted Fox has a little bit more of

105
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,928
an entrenched position because they actually own content

106
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,700
-- that people want,
-- but they don't have enough content. Look, I love Futurama

107
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,450
but I'm not, I'm not going to sign up for the Fox streaming service just for Futurama.

108
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,350
That's like CBS is doing this with, there's a new Star Trek series coming out

109
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,579
and

110
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:32,320
yeah, I,

111
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:38,980
you know, I don't know, I don't think it's retro, I think it takes place in the

112
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,730
future of existing Star Trek

113
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:42,410
but

114
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,420
in the NG or

115
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,290
I

116
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,190
think I don't, whatever, I don't remember.

117
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,070
But anyway,

118
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,170
the idea was they expect people to sign up for their streaming service.

119
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:52,510
And I'm like, I, I'm just not going to, I'm going,

120
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,390
I don't care enough to sign up for your streaming service.

121
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,230
I just don't,

122
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,890
you know, it's funny because even if it was like,

123
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,269
let's say, for the sake of argument, $12 a year,

124
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,410
how do you get it? Like, is there an app for it?

125
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,790
Does my Apple TV support it if my Apple TV doesn't support it. How do I watch it?

126
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:09,350
I,

127
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:12,130
I would hope that it's supported by these TV s

128
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,019
but it's gonna be probably closer to $12 a month

129
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,070
-- and, well, but more
-- to the point if I don't have an app to watch it,

130
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,359
how am I gonna actually watch it?

131
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,950
That's what these guys seem to forget.

132
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,670
-- Let's,
-- we'll,

133
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,200
we'll assume there will be an app because I think

134
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,070
they're at least clued in enough to do that.

135
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,209
Right.

136
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,079
But my point being basically is like with all the stuff like Roku Apple TV,

137
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:33,089
S and all those, they basically, you know, they support a lot of things but,

138
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:37,850
you know, you better hope Apple plays more is willing to play with you otherwise.

139
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:40,190
Yeah, I mean, you don't get on that device. You're dead in the water.

140
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,070
See, and that would be my fear of starting a streaming service now is like,

141
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:47,269
how do you get enough device coverage to make it worthwhile compared to say Netflix?

142
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,899
Because these are short sighted people who don't know what they're doing.

143
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,029
It's, you know, you know,

144
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,329
it always reminds me of and this is so true even in security world where

145
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,609
people think something's really easy

146
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,700
and then it turns out, hey, those guys who told you it wasn't easy. Yeah.

147
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,700
Maybe they knew what they were talking about after all.

148
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:08,209
Well, yeah, there's that XK CD comic for it, you know, like,

149
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,160
right,

150
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:09,989
I mean, some of these,

151
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:13,049
you know, I, well, I had somebody sort of offhandedly asked, like, you know,

152
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,690
what is the guidelines for certificate lifetimes?

153
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,010
I'm like, oh,

154
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:21,299
you really want me to answer that? Like, really? You want to go,

155
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:21,679
there we

156
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:21,820
go

157
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,799
there. But they want you to give them a number one number

158
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:26,519
and that's all

159
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:28,209
that's

160
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,429
probably fair.

161
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,959
Probably should have said 92 days because then you don't,

162
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,510
you can only do it every quarter.

163
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,690
-- You should
-- have said 92 years and then they don't have to worry.

164
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:37,920
Well,

165
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,440
I've actually,

166
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,959
I've created a new P GP key that does not expire

167
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,799
and I will be rolling over to it this year.

168
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,489
Yeah.

169
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:45,760
My,

170
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,140
my old key expires in about four or five years.

171
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,200
So that's kind of really annoying.

172
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:51,640
Yeah.

173
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,760
No, I understand.

174
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:53,119
And, well,

175
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,859
in P GP is one of those things that

176
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,489
if I was doing something legitimately exciting with it,

177
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,179
I would be very particular about

178
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,339
maintaining my key and, and changing keys and all kinds of things like that.

179
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,000
But the reality is I do,

180
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:12,899
I basically use it to log in over ssh and to do get pulls. So, you know what I can,

181
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,410
I can deal with a key that doesn't expire.

182
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,500
Yeah.

183
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,579
Well, and it's not like a, you know, it's not like milk where it

184
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,149
actually expires.

185
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,880
I mean, you know,

186
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,179
unless you've got some absurdly short key or

187
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,660
something and somebody actually wants to attack it.

188
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,350
But, um,

189
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:28,899
yeah,

190
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:29,230
and

191
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,059
my thought, and my thought on the certificate, lifetime thing was,

192
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,109
it was actually less about sort of the act,

193
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,899
like I'm less concerned about the day to day security of like, oh,

194
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,149
somebody compromises the certificate and then uses it for like,

195
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,829
90 days without us finding out and some bad things happen.

196
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:44,309
And I'm more concerned about actually, you know, having

197
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,369
like, certificate rollover

198
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,820
processes that work and like having it, you know, basically,

199
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:53,040
if you have to do something quarterly, chances are, you're probably, well,

200
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:55,890
you should notice pretty quickly that it doesn't or doesn't work.

201
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:56,940
That's a really good point

202
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,510
actually.

203
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,100
And, and you're right, you're gonna

204
00:07:59,690 --> 00:07:59,880
have

205
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:00,769
every month.

206
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,299
That's why I reboot my systems every month is to

207
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,799
make sure they actually come back up if the,

208
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,359
if they get rebooted.

209
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,359
Right. So when it happens,

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,380
sort of outside of my control, chances are it'll actually come back.

211
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,100
My file server in the basement is, has been up 700 days now.

212
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,109
I hope it reboots

213
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:19,970
me

214
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:20,760
too.

215
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:22,720
That's all I keep thinking is like,

216
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,640
thank goodness the UPS is still working because I, I don't,

217
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:28,320
I don't ever want to turn it off if I do.

218
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,720
Well, I actually I had one machine, I rebooted, it rebooted fine.

219
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,239
But one of the fans actually seized,

220
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,000
it was sold, you know, like

221
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,140
one of the fans when it stopped moving, I guess it just, it,

222
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,640
it didn't start again.

223
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:41,979
I, I believe that

224
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,159
that's, I mean, these are mechanical pieces. Well, think about it.

225
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,229
We're running consumer grade hardware and in some cases I,

226
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:49,150
I've looked at the dates on these machines.

227
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,239
I write it on the inside. I mean,

228
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,359
these things have like $10 fans that have been running nonstop for like seven years.

229
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,880
-- I think about that a lot. Yes. And it's
-- very impressive

230
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,400
and,

231
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:00,809
and the machine I have in the basement actually is like comically old at this point.

232
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,960
And the hard drives are, I've had both.

233
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:05,409
I, I've, I've got, what, four hard drives in it, I think.

234
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,280
And I know two of them are at least five years old

235
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:10,840
and, and I think one might be even older than that. So

236
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,200
the day is coming

237
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:17,200
in my defense, I have meticulous backups of this data

238
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,859
and I, I have little considered

239
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:19,429
the

240
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:21,830
three.

241
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,260
So I

242
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,880
have

243
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,520
as part of it and I keep

244
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,979
diss I, I have a disk I also use because I figure what I would do is sync off disk first,

245
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,030
an external drive.

246
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:33,590
Yeah, like an external hard drive that,

247
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,770
that when I remember I'd like to say once a month,

248
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,440
but when I remember I go plug it in and in our sync

249
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,190
and I figure I can probably R sync that and then pull down the last,

250
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,390
probably 1020 gigs of S3 to just fix it.

251
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,690
Yeah.

252
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,210
But,

253
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,830
yeah, that's my biggest concern is, well, you ran into that.

254
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,679
It took you how many weeks to upload all your data?

255
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,400
It took me more than a month.

256
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,700
Yeah, exactly.

257
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:55,179
A

258
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:56,530
hard drive.

259
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,090
Yeah, pretty much. I mean,

260
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,390
that's where I am with doing an off site backup right

261
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,130
now as I've gotten to the point where it's like,

262
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,400
uh, unless I get a new provider, like they're

263
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,130
supposed to be, I'm supposed to be getting fiber at some point in the next year.

264
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,400
They redid all the poles.

265
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:15,609
Well, no, they redid all the utility poles and moved the power lines up about 4 ft.

266
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,640
Right. So they actually had to replace a whole pile of infrastructure,

267
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,960
uh, before they can run fiber out to the, you know, houses out here.

268
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,679
-- So
-- they're hanging fiber in the air.

269
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:27,309
Yeah, it'll be fiber in the air.

270
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,469
Basically the exact same physical path as like your actual phone line.

271
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,849
Like your copper phone line. Right.

272
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,690
You know, it's a triple, it's a classic triple play from the phone company. Right.

273
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,349
Your, um,

274
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,650
uh, what is it? Your voice TV?

275
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:41,289
And internet, you know, over one line fiber fast, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

276
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,030
Um,

277
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:45,669
and hopefully in the next year or two, I'll get it because the main thing is like,

278
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,070
otherwise my upload is capped unless I buy like

279
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,299
the biggest plan at like 15 megs per second.

280
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:51,460
Nice.

281
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:54,849
I, I don't even remember what I have. It just took a long time. All right.

282
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,669
Anyway, we should move on to, like, this is a security podcast effort.

283
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,130
So, any more

284
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,440
interesting facts? About 50

285
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,500
I know.

286
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,820
Well, I guess the one that,

287
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,159
that you'll probably like is apparently on Canadian roads with,

288
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:12,030
without posted speed limits, the speed limit is 50 kilometers per hour.

289
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,140
That is correct.

290
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,659
Which is what, like, 30

291
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,640
-- miles per hour.
-- It's a hair over 30 because it's 1.6 kilometers per mile.

292
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,380
So it's like 3132 miles an hour.

293
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,369
So, anyway, let's, uh, maintaining the topic of Canada as well.

294
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,869
Did you see the picture of the guy mowing his lawn with a tornado in the background?

295
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,299
Yeah, that

296
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,789
-- was quite
-- classic.

297
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,169
That's like risk management 101 right there, folks.

298
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,099
And I love this

299
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,130
was what I'm keeping an eye on it.

300
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,960
Well, it's funny because in Edmonton we had the tornado back in, oh,

301
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:48,679
I was actually supposed to look this up for my son Edmonton tornado.

302
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,900
Uh, we had a tornado in Edmonton back in a tornado.

303
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,299
87. Yeah. So I was 10 years old.

304
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,219
Um,

305
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,739
in, in what, that was like the last tornado you had other than this one?

306
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,450
No, this one was in Calgary. That's like 400 kilometers away.

307
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,109
So,

308
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:05,669
yeah,

309
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,750
but that's the thing. Right.

310
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,200
Tornadoes are rare enough that it actually has, like, its own Wikipedia

311
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,130
and it's an underscore tornado. Right.

312
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,809
We just generally don't get tornadoes around here.

313
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,890
It's, that's just it. Right.

314
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:16,929
And then, you know,

315
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,539
part of the problem is that's why everybody was

316
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:20,289
so freaked out about it because it was like,

317
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,940
it's really never happened before or since. Right.

318
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:29,169
Um, and it actually did cause, yeah, here, yeah, I killed 27 people

319
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,340
and destroyed 300 homes. So, you know, it was actually,

320
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:37,489
-- it, it mattered. Right. Like, it was a bad tornado.
-- This is the one when you were a kid.

321
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:37,940
Yeah.

322
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,200
And,

323
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,450
um, but like I said, like,

324
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,489
it's known as the Edmonton

325
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,030
tornado

326
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:49,030
-- singular. Like, it's that one time back in the days.
-- Oh, man. You know, it's awesome.

327
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,479
So, yeah, tornadoes are rare enough here that we generally don't

328
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,679
think about or worry about them that much.

329
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,520
I guess that that might be part of the problem and,

330
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,289
-- and I'm going to bring this back to security, a black
-- sheep or

331
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,409
a

332
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,030
swan event.

333
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,809
-- Right.
-- Exactly. So, like you're a dude mowing your lawn, you see a tornado and think?

334
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,770
Oh, that's neat because you don't understand how dangerous it is.

335
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,270
And this is totally, like,

336
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,549
when you've got security people who they see an anomaly

337
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,650
going on in their infrastructure or whatever and they think,

338
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,780
oh, that's neat because they just don't understand the gravity of the situation.

339
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,390
What happened with him?

340
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,750
There was a guy out on a farm who basically was photographing it

341
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:26,500
and then he realized all the clouds were moving around him

342
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,619
and that's when he realized, oh, I should go in the basement. Right.

343
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,080
But again, you know, like, I mean, I wouldn't,

344
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,880
you know, most people wouldn't pick up on that out here because,

345
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:38,880
like,

346
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:42,520
well, like in a lot of the US, you guys have tornado drills and stuff, right?

347
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,539
And you have, oh, I mean,

348
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:46,320
at the Denver airport they have tornado shelters in the airport,

349
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:47,640
right? They both signs

350
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,330
and

351
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,840
I've never seen that before.

352
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:50,919
You know.

353
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,460
So

354
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,719
actually, you know, it's really cool.

355
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:56,580
You bring that up and,

356
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,340
and to change the subject briefly is I was taking a walk in town the other day with,

357
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:01,260
with my son

358
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,030
and he says, dad, what's that sign?

359
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,539
And there was a fall shelter sign on the side of a building.

360
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,340
Yeah, I'm like, that's, I, I took a bunch of pictures. I said this is great.

361
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,659
He's like, why are you taking pictures of that?

362
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:12,580
I said, because you don't see a lot of these anymore, you know,

363
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,070
then he asked what's a follow up shelter and we ended up, you know,

364
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,530
talking about

365
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:18,409
Russia.

366
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,010
So

367
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,159
that's ancient history at this

368
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:20,710
point for them.

369
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,599
Uh, yes. Yes, it is. It's true. I could have just talked about the Romans and

370
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:26,369
too

371
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,599
much. I mean, World War One would have been the same.

372
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:30,650
Seriously.

373
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,659
I know I've often thought about that. Right.

374
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:36,950
Because what was taught is historically relevant and when we went to school versus,

375
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,690
like, what's historically relevant now,

376
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:39,750
you know?

377
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:40,349
Yeah.

378
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:40,859
Yeah. Yeah.

379
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,289
Well, it's like anything, I mean, and, and

380
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,659
every generation

381
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,539
for either forgets or chooses not to carry knowledge forward

382
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:52,919
and, and in some ways it's good in some ways it's bad.

383
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:53,419
We'll,

384
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,039
we'll see what happens in the context of

385
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,599
security since we barely even have tribal knowledge.

386
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,510
Well, we keep recreating,

387
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,210
you know, we keep, well, people keep rediscovering like a great example.

388
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,849
Multi-tenant systems are hard. Well, guess what mainframe

389
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,219
and then guess what the UNIX guys discovered

390
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,320
and then guess what the internet guys discovered and

391
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,599
then guess what the web browser guys discovered and then

392
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,119
now guess what the container guys have discovered?

393
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,590
Oh my God. When you let

394
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:19,429
people touch each other,

395
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,979
-- you know, it gets really messy really fast
-- getting PG 13,

396
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,159
you know,

397
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,460
and, and like, well,

398
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:29,820
this kind of goes to that pseudo thing like that pseudo security flaw where you could

399
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,840
like go monkey with another user's TT Y and see what they were doing potentially.

400
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,330
Well, that's a great argument to like containerize all this stuff and just like,

401
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,309
look here, you log in, you can pseudo you can do it within your container.

402
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,969
You cannot,

403
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,760
you have a different like dev

404
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:46,039
name space than that other guy

405
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,289
or whatever, you know, and you just can't monkey with each other.

406
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:53,030
So, you know, temp flaws, not our problem, you know, things like,

407
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,409
um,

408
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,659
I mean, do you remember it was what, probably 5,

409
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:59,890
10 years ago when temp flaws were just, it was awful.

410
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,770
They still are, they still are.

411
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,570
But I don't think anyone cares anymore because now they

412
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,150
just, like, run a VM or a container. Right. Go.

413
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:11,283
Well, a great, I mean, part of it is the whole concept of shell services has gone away.

414
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:12,343
Remember when, you know,

415
00:16:12,353 --> 00:16:15,263
I remember paying five or 10 bucks a month for access to a shell server,

416
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:17,192
I remember shell and that was like the best

417
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:20,103
part about college is there were shell accounts everywhere

418
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:22,742
and I didn't have to pay anymore for shell access.

419
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:25,023
Like I just had shell access and I was,

420
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:26,143
-- that
-- was a big deal.

421
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:27,663
And now, I mean,

422
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:27,992
uh

423
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,835
you could get a VPC for five bucks a month

424
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:31,166
without

425
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,075
even trying to shop around for a deal

426
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:35,546
or just get a raspberry pie for

427
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,835
$5 and put it in your basement.

428
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:38,835
I mean, it's,

429
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:40,255
well, that's the other thing, right?

430
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,526
Everybody has always on internet connectivity because you don't have to worry

431
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:45,075
about your mom picking up the phone and interrupting your doom download,

432
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,906
which by the way, I'm not angry about,

433
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,315
but I'm just going to say that that's a memory of my

434
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:52,536
-- childhood
-- 16 hours in. Right?

435
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:58,809
-- Well, and you know, not every B BS had like reget capabilities.
-- I do remember that.

436
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,210
There were,

437
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,650
there were some that did not and it was

438
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,840
terrible when you were downloading your one megabyte file.

439
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:06,689
But, uh, yeah, I mean, it's just these things are, you know,

440
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,410
it's like worrying about not having, well, all those old timey movies.

441
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,770
Where does anybody have a phone?

442
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:13,829
Right.

443
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,229
That's true.

444
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,670
You know, quick call, somebody call the cops.

445
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,979
Oh my God. There's no phone.

446
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:20,189
Go find a pay phone or,

447
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,910
or like literally somebody having to go run to find a fire pole station,

448
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,558
which for those of you that don't know what that is.

449
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:29,379
It's literally a physical box with a physical handle,

450
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:33,088
like a fire alarm that you pull and that lets the fire department know that that fire

451
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:36,889
handle was pulled and then they would go there and then ask you where the fire is?

452
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,838
That totally scales.

453
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:40,109
Yeah.

454
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,739
Anyways. But uh

455
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,380
yeah. So,

456
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,939
yeah, I don't know the whole, yeah, people forgetting the,

457
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:52,400
the lessons of the past and I think it's even

458
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,890
not so much forgetting the lessons of the past,

459
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,500
but forgetting the problems of the past.

460
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,219
I, I have a great lesson of the past.

461
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,300
So as, as many of you are aware there was recently in an attack,

462
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,089
a terrorist attack in London on, on the bridge.

463
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:09,349
And what's the first thing their prime minister does blames

464
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,660
encryption and says we should ban encryption and put backdoors in

465
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,890
that

466
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,449
this is never going to die. I feel like someday we're going to be old men

467
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:21,829
and the politicians are still going to be talking about encryption backdoors.

468
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:22,770
I

469
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,050
think part of it

470
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:27,709
is, I suspect, well, it's a multifaceted issue and I think,

471
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,880
I think some of the big components are number one,

472
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,530
these politicians fundamentally don't understand it.

473
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,449
The reality is like my bathroom scale has strong encryption.

474
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,000
That's true. That would have been illegal to export like 10 years ago.

475
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,930
Yeah, exactly.

476
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,489
Uh Number two

477
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:46,300
even, you know, ignoring that you have the whole open source angle.

478
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,689
Like everybody has

479
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,890
uh how many copies of the open SSL libraries are there on the planet

480
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,310
a lot?

481
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,319
Well,

482
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,630
that's exactly it is. Even if

483
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,119
they wanted or, or let's say,

484
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,959
let's say these politicians convinced some of the big companies

485
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,760
that they need to

486
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,640
backdoor the encryption or they need to weaken the encryption.

487
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:07,800
Well,

488
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,869
heck we heck the US weakened encryption back in

489
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,250
the nineties and look where that got us.

490
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:11,869
But anyway,

491
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,910
let's say they say you need to do this stuff and let's say those companies comply.

492
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,069
Do you think the bad guys are going to use

493
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,260
that stuff or do you think they're just gonna download

494
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,479
or even write their own algorithms

495
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,599
that, that have strong encryption? Right?

496
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,959
One argument the politicians would make there is,

497
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:29,400
it's kind of like the whole banning VPN S like there's some of

498
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,280
those countries where they've successfully banned

499
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,469
VPN S because largely to provide,

500
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:33,640
you know,

501
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,199
the incumbent telephone operator with the ability to generate revenue still.

502
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:37,680
Right.

503
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,260
You know, so they've banned things like Skype and then obviously had to ban things

504
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,420
like,

505
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,619
well, no, no, no. But basically the, the problem is the bad guys.

506
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,689
Yeah,

507
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:47,650
the bad guys can make their own crypto and the politicians argument would be like,

508
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,339
oh, well, we'll detect that and know that these are bad guys and we'll go arrest them

509
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,589
or whatever, right? And that's just not gonna work.

510
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,469
I would argue even in the countries that have banned VPN S for whatever reason,

511
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:00,430
there are still people using them

512
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,540
and all you end up doing is hurting the normal people

513
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:07,540
because the people who have a reason to do that,

514
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,199
they will still do it. They will find a way.

515
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,859
And I think that's what you just said is fundamentally part of the problem is,

516
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,939
I think this is less about encryption and more about hurting

517
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,160
the normal people controlling them to some degree or making their,

518
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,599
you know,

519
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,650
being seen to be doing something that the normal

520
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,260
people don't really understand is kind of pointless,

521
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,760
you know, or, or a fool's errand, right?

522
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,339
It will be,

523
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,250
it's the goalkeeper's dilemma, right?

524
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,390
You have to be seen to be doing something even if it's meaningless,

525
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,199
you know, talking about meaningful things when Theresa May, you know,

526
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,079
was secretary, uh what was it?

527
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,719
The home secretary, which is essentially, you know, the interior ministry

528
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:47,880
that she cut back, police,

529
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,000
you know, funding and, uh, what was it? 20,000 policemen got cut and,

530
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,530
well, yeah, I mean, that's, that can't be helpful.

531
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,859
It, it,

532
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,709
it's such a weird act these politicians put on because, I mean, let's face it.

533
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,439
It's all just a big game. Right.

534
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,859
They, they're always shocked at something in reality, you know.

535
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:07,880
Yeah, you've done that before.

536
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,949
But it's things like encryption is bad.

537
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:11,079
You know,

538
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:15,180
we don't want that because the bad guys can use it and oh protect the Children and oh,

539
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:16,439
we need to cut the budget.

540
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:19,660
So let's get rid of these things that aren't. And it's just, it's kind of madness man.

541
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:19,959
And,

542
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,119
and I think this is one of the things that just irks me

543
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,000
and I, I even see this

544
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,040
outside of politics

545
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,589
is where you have a group of professionals that like

546
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,760
these are people who actually know what they're talking about

547
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,479
and nobody listens to them.

548
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:38,290
And it's just like the, the story of humanity is that

549
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,489
where nobody listens to the guy who knows what he's talking about.

550
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,609
Like every,

551
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:47,750
every single legend and folk story is people not listening

552
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,130
to the guy who knows what he's talking about.

553
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:52,630
And the lesson at the end is listen to the guy

554
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,410
who knows what he's talking about. Yeah, like it will never change.

555
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:59,810
Well, you know, I have that problem right now with one of my sons, he's like,

556
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,770
we're like, maybe you shouldn't do Xy or Z, you know,

557
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,469
like play with your fidget spinner right next to

558
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:06,410
your ipad because the fidget spinner has a big,

559
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,290
you know, has metal in it.

560
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,560
And if you smack your ipad screen with that, you're gonna be sad.

561
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,910
And it took a good 23 minutes of talking to him to kind of convince him that it

562
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,430
really was maybe not a good idea to play with this fidget spinner next to his ipad.

563
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,420
-- You know, things like
-- that,

564
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,739
let him break it

565
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,270
-- and he will learn his lesson. Then
-- I have to pay for it.

566
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,040
No, you don't.

567
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,609
You tell him to go get a job there.

568
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,520
It's a little tough for a six year old to get a, a,

569
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:30,500
you know,

570
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,900
-- job.
-- Don't you have coal mines in Canada?

571
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,140
We do? But they're mostly open face with, you know,

572
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,189
-- automation.
-- I

573
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:38,400
know

574
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,150
it

575
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,180
anyway.

576
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,189
Well, you know that and there's a great example, right?

577
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,060
We got to bring it back to the coal industry and the coal jobs.

578
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:48,869
And it's like what R B's in the US is a bigger employer than the entire coal industry.

579
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,989
-- Actually.
-- You know what's funny is you bring this up?

580
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,180
And I was listening to a podcast just the other day

581
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,339
and it was somebody talking about manufacturing and the fact that

582
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,670
exporting jobs to other countries isn't the problem

583
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,609
apparently back in the fifties and sixties,

584
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:07,010
there was something like 16 or 20% of jobs were in factories

585
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,290
today. It's 7%. And we're producing like, four times the output. We were back then.

586
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,920
People used to be farmers. Now.

587
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,060
It's like 1.5, I think

588
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:21,540
now, like one dude with the tractor can do the work of 400 people.

589
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,520
-- Yep. Yep. Oh, totally. It's exactly the same story.
-- Yeah.

590
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,569
No, we were driving out to the cabin and we saw everybody was seeing, right?

591
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:31,030
And like the size of the cedars,

592
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,609
like, they're 40 50 ft wide.

593
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,099
It's

594
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:34,410
crazy

595
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,079
how big this stuff is, man.

596
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:39,449
And so I, I know, I, I have some friends who do farming, like,

597
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,630
large farming for that matter and it's al,

598
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,109
it's fascinating talking to these guys because,

599
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:44,770
like,

600
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,680
this equipment is hundreds of thousands of dollars

601
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:50,810
but it lets them be so obscenely productive.

602
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:51,969
It's not even funny.

603
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,849
I mean, yeah, it's crazy. One guy can basically run a farm now

604
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:56,520
to be.

605
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,400
Well, I mean, it's like with cloud, right?

606
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,079
And, well, the whole point of it has always been automation.

607
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,280
Right. That's what we

608
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,750
define the problem and get a computer to do it.

609
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,359
The computer doesn't need to take naps.

610
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,300
Yeah, that's

611
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:10,000
it.

612
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:14,119
And this is one thing I love about the whole, you know, robotics

613
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:14,385
thing

614
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:17,214
is like, well, what, what, what do you consider to be a robot?

615
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:19,935
Like, does it have to be a physical like arm that, you know,

616
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:21,795
has four axis movement or whatever.

617
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,055
Like, what about, you know,

618
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:27,255
somebody writes a script to make a task 10% more efficient.

619
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,775
Oh, man, wouldn't it be great if all of our pearl scripts get taxed in the future?

620
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:31,780
Yeah.

621
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,219
Well, then how do you even measure work?

622
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:34,739
You know,

623
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,839
I know, I

624
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:36,160
know.

625
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:36,920
You

626
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:37,089
know,

627
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,619
actually this is,

628
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:39,400
you just,

629
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,660
I think made a point that kind of brings all of this together is the fact

630
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,709
that you look at these politicians talking about

631
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,900
banning encryption or filtering the internet or whatever,

632
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,130
right?

633
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,660
Pick some insane thing or taxing robots or

634
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,699
there's millions of things they can pick on about technology and

635
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:57,660
what it really comes down to is

636
00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:00,770
the government or, or people in charge

637
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:04,369
they don't understand and can't keep up with technology,

638
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,290
which I think is extra funny because in the last episode and I still believe this,

639
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,650
we were saying that like the only way to fix security in iot is regulation.

640
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:13,930
But how do you,

641
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:16,489
if you have an organization that can't even figure out encryption and

642
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,969
now you want them to regulate a space like IOT it's,

643
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:21,180
well,

644
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,650
one way to regulate, well, one way to regulate it would be, for example,

645
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,069
to give consumers

646
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:29,270
rights and protections, which for example, in Europe,

647
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,760
they have some fundamental laws saying basically

648
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,829
if you sell something to somebody,

649
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,170
it has to be fit for purpose

650
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,829
for a certain period of time like one or two years.

651
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,000
So right there, boom, you,

652
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,589
you have to be giving security updates for one or two years.

653
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,410
Otherwise they can

654
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:45,670
they have the legal right to go return it and get their money back.

655
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:51,319
So for example, there would be a great way to just simply regulate it in the sense of,

656
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:52,699
you know, this thing has to work

657
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,030
and I think it would be reasonable to assume that, you know,

658
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,650
plugging a network device into a network, you know, would be a reasonable use case

659
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:02,630
and that not having security updates on that for

660
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:05,310
whatever, you know, public facing thing

661
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,380
means it's no longer fit for a purpose.

662
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,099
And if people can go return it, then all of a sudden, you know, the manufacturers, um,

663
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,930
would have, you know, well, the,

664
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,520
the people selling this stuff would have a huge

665
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,260
incentive because they don't want to do returns,

666
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,790
you know,

667
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:20,280
for a two year old device that, you know, is worth basically nothing.

668
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,790
And so the manufacturers would have an incentive to actually, you know,

669
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,089
stand behind their products.

670
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,719
You, you may have a point.

671
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:28,939
It's right.

672
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,780
It's such a weird topic.

673
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,380
Well, I think so

674
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:37,150
highly prescriptive regulation, like you must do exactly this, this and this,

675
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,680
I don't know that that's a good idea because things change so much.

676
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:43,359
I agree with that and, and, and, and sometimes it's not even that

677
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,310
like, but the fundamental, like

678
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,359
I would you know, 20 years ago,

679
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,819
if you told me my bathroom scale would be on the internet with a secure web server.

680
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:52,739
I would have been like, yeah. What? No, what?

681
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:57,819
-- And an idiot would do that. Yeah, exactly.
-- And now it's like, that's a normal thing.

682
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:00,430
You know, my light bulbs might be on the internet at some point.

683
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,280
Um,

684
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,699
and having the descriptive

685
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:05,099
sort of stuff,

686
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,520
you know, you have to put you,

687
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:10,869
you, you fall into that trap of the company saying, well, we did the best practice.

688
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,140
We did the, you know, we encrypted it with rat 13 standard industry wide encryption.

689
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,219
What could go wrong?

690
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,930
So I really think it boils down to is, you know,

691
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,890
let consumers return it and get a refund

692
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,849
because the other problem is a lot of these flaws don't show

693
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:28,430
up for a year or two or three or by definition,

694
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,489
if you're, if you know, a company might support it for a year

695
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,130
and then stop supporting it because a new model came out,

696
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:36,280
you know,

697
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,589
so I think fundamentally you put some lifespan on the device that's reasonable,

698
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,239
say two years, five years, whatever.

699
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,719
And you say essentially the consumer can return it if it's not fit for purpose. And,

700
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:46,949
you know,

701
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:50,140
you have a strong legal watchdog or arms buds.

702
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,859
Uh How do you pronounce that word ombudsman?

703
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,939
I have no idea what you're even trying to say.

704
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,050
The ombudsman, you know, the, the, the, the essentially the, you know,

705
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,199
whatever entity you can go to, to get, you know,

706
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:03,579
assistance and legal redress for whatever, you know, a specific type of problem.

707
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,349
I don't know

708
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:06,910
that that could be. It's,

709
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,949
it's outside of my vocabulary. I live in the United States. We have no rights here.

710
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,430
-- So, yeah,
-- the, the ombudsman. Ok. Well, we actually have one here in Alberta but

711
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:16,109
um,

712
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,979
the Alberta ombudsman responds to complaints of unfair treatment

713
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,260
by provincial government authorities

714
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,130
and designated professional organizations.

715
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,390
So it's this legal entity I can go to, to, you know, seek redress if I get like,

716
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,069
you know,

717
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:29,540
uh an unpleasant experience with the government or whatever.

718
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,459
That's not quite right.

719
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,310
And so you have one of these

720
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,189
for, you know, consumer goods, uh, they, I believe in Britain.

721
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,550
It's like the, uh what is it,

722
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,319
it's covered under the Fair Trade Act, I think anyways.

723
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:44,150
And, you know, fundamentally, if, uh, like, for example,

724
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,560
somebody comes and repairs your door and like, completely, you know,

725
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:47,670
makes a mess of it,

726
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,750
you go to the, what is it, the Office of Fair Trade or whatever in the UK.

727
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,250
And like, you know, there's a complaint process and

728
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:55,420
you get redress. Hopefully.

729
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,689
Interesting.

730
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,170
So, you know, you basically have that and

731
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,780
the reality is, you know, these large companies,

732
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,310
like a lot of these companies are already doing it quite well.

733
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,310
Like a lot of

734
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:09,589
like Microsoft, for example, they turn the ship around and Microsoft is doing,

735
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,729
you know, like

736
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,770
the fact that they actually, for example, shipped a patch for XP for that, uh,

737
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,729
wanna cry thing.

738
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:17,699
That was,

739
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,250
you know,

740
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:20,619
if they hadn't done that, I would have been like,

741
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,780
I don't,

742
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,660
I, you know, I wouldn't have been angry at them for not doing that.

743
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:27,979
I would have said they're, well, within their rights of, like we end of life,

744
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:29,979
this thing a couple of years ago, people,

745
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:33,660
well, part of me thinks they shouldn't have just because

746
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,660
they were without question

747
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,780
many other problems.

748
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:39,050
Well, well, there's been

749
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,140
there, there are way worse problems, I imagine in XP than that.

750
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,380
And so,

751
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,260
like, stop, stop using it.

752
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:49,709
That's just not an option though. For a lot of people.

753
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:52,780
Right. There's just budgetary constraints, like

754
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:55,030
the whole, you know, the NHS thing where they have like,

755
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,010
roughly a million machines running XP.

756
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,439
But,

757
00:29:59,359 --> 00:29:59,599
you know,

758
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:01,500
the problem is they've let the technical debt

759
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,380
accrue to such a degree that essentially you,

760
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,109
you'd like,

761
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:07,890
you basically have to default on it or

762
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,650
something. I don't

763
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,939
like, I just, if you asked me, like,

764
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:14,939
what is it gonna take to upgrade a million machines from Windows XP.

765
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:15,699
I would have been like,

766
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:19,319
I would put my money on a meteorite. Like,

767
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,839
I, I can't even imagine this a problem at that scale.

768
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:24,920
Exactly.

769
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:28,709
You know, it's not even like you can take bite size pieces and, and make

770
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,469
meaningful progress. Like

771
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:33,800
you upgrade 50,000 machines. That's 5% of the fleet. That's,

772
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,810
-- you're still stuck with 950,000. It's
-- not even just

773
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:38,739
creating

774
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:43,109
50,000 machines. The hardware is probably terrible.

775
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,079
-- And so
-- you

776
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:44,140
don't

777
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,020
replace the hardware

778
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,160
apps.

779
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,150
Right.

780
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:53,489
It's, it's basically you have to rebuild the NHS it from ground up effectively just,

781
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,959
but within the existing constraints that of what you have,

782
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:56,969
which makes it even worse.

783
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,250
Put it in the cloud

784
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,709
fine.

785
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:00,790
Yeah,

786
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,939
actually that that's a really good point is

787
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,020
imagine if Aws had to backdoor

788
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,829
all of their crypto

789
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:10,939
in the cloud. Do you like

790
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,689
-- no
-- organization would use

791
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:13,369
the cloud?

792
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,579
-- Well, just the key management aspect of that would
-- be

793
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,410
two man,

794
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,609
-- I can't
-- even

795
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:21,339
like I am already does key management

796
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:24,660
at this scale, but now you're basically doubling it

797
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:27,560
more than doubling it because you figure every

798
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:30,380
freaking government's going to want their own key,

799
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,699
they're not going to share.

800
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,849
And then there's the other problem of like the whole hardware security modules,

801
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,000
the whole,

802
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,780
like we have an entire industry designed around exactly preventing this scenario.

803
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,339
Right.

804
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:44,140
Yeah, literally.

805
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:45,339
Yeah, it's,

806
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,890
oh, you gotta love it. You know what else I always think of too is

807
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,099
these politicians love to blame encryption. But the reality is this is just,

808
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,250
this is good intelligence is how you solve this

809
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,329
in putting backdoors in encryption isn't gonna help.

810
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,770
You need good

811
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,170
intelligence. You need

812
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,369
agencies,

813
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,859
three letter agencies that actually are doing good

814
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:12,369
work and not just collecting worthless data.

815
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:12,890
Right.

816
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,319
That it's like the Israeli airport story.

817
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:17,729
We always talk about where those are people that are

818
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:22,099
actually conducting good intelligence and it's making a difference versus a

819
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,130
bunch of ridiculous theater that just

820
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,640
inconveniences everyone and doesn't actually help.

821
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,040
Yeah. Well, I mean, it doesn't help the underlying problem.

822
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,609
It does make people feel safe to fly and they keep flying,

823
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:37,280
even though statistically it's still like, I, I'm more,

824
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,800
I'm honestly more afraid of, like,

825
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:42,630
when I walk my kids home four blocks and we have to

826
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,400
cross a major road which has a pedestrian controlled light that turns red

827
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:51,189
and like, you know, 99 times out of 100 so far the cars have stopped.

828
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,199
I know. No, that's not true.

829
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:55,180
No, actually two weeks ago a car did not stop,

830
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:57,979
but in fairness it was a police car with its lights on doing about 100 and 10.

831
00:32:58,739 --> 00:32:59,750
Sweet.

832
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,239
So, you know, again, but then, you know, the system works. Right.

833
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,270
And he had his lights on.

834
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,479
Um,

835
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,359
did he, do you have the siren going too?

836
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,569
-- Uh,
-- he did not actually, which I

837
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:09,709
found

838
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:12,630
and then another c car came screaming up.

839
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,290
So anyways, but the point being, you know, is that, that, that's,

840
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,310
that's a failure scenario we've planned for

841
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:19,520
and I've been teaching my

842
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,140
corner case. Right. It's,

843
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,329
it's not every day.

844
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,540
Well, no, no, not every day. But

845
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,079
I mean, when you do, like

846
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,630
when you cross the street, even if the light is in your favor,

847
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,069
you should still look both ways because like fire trucks, ambulances, police cars,

848
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,560
drunk drivers, texting drivers.

849
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,089
Um, or my favorite that youtube video showing a cop directing traffic,

850
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:41,920
I think somewhere in eastern Europe and you're like, oh God,

851
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,810
I hope he doesn't get hit by a car and then out of nowhere, a cow comes running into

852
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:45,150
him.

853
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,359
I haven't seen that. That's awesome

854
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:51,930
because, you know, it's just all these videos is like, oh God, oh God, I hope he's ok.

855
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:54,930
And then a cow just, just runs over him and it's like

856
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,569
that must have hurt. But

857
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,689
man, it's funny.

858
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,849
That's fantastic.

859
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,630
You know. So,

860
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,630
yeah, you should look both ways when you cross the street.

861
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,900
But I mean, back to the whole security argument. Yeah, I mean,

862
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,780
we should plan for failure,

863
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,610
which, because it's gonna happen.

864
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,929
Yeah. No, people,

865
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,250
you know, it's, um, and I,

866
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,199
I don't know what the answer is because a lot of these companies will, you know,

867
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,580
make claims that like, oh, yeah,

868
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,489
we have security and then two years down the road they don't.

869
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,750
Well, then what? Right.

870
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,330
And if we allow people to return these devices, well,

871
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,978
if nothing else that'll start maybe teaching the people who sell these

872
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,540
things to be a lot more careful about what they say.

873
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,909
The only way that would work is if you had enough people returning them

874
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:33,873
and, I mean, let's look at the market today.

875
00:34:33,884 --> 00:34:35,333
It's pretty terrible and,

876
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:38,884
-- and people would have
-- to have that many returning them for it to be a big

877
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:42,572
because think about how much, like, how, what is Best Buy's marginal stuff,

878
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:44,063
like 0%

879
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:47,474
like, yeah, basically it's a few percent

880
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:49,954
because they have to, like, price match Amazon Prime.

881
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:54,914
So you don't even need, like, if two or 3% of

882
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:59,154
people return their stuff, that's, that's all of Best Buy's profits gone.

883
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,070
But that's just Best Buy.

884
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,429
Although, although where would you put the, I guess,

885
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,979
where would the liability live with the shop?

886
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:07,459
You have to

887
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:07,959
put it on

888
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,129
the,

889
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,739
you have to put it on the end shop like they do in Europe. Otherwise it's so

890
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,179
it just doesn't work, right?

891
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:15,959
Because the manufacturer can go out of business or

892
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:18,379
change names or stop being a legal entity.

893
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,649
You know, like here in Alberta, they're, they're,

894
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:23,010
they're looking at having this database of home builders

895
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,110
where like you would actually have to be registered,

896
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,870
it would be the name.

897
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:28,489
So even if they change legal names and stuff of their company,

898
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:30,649
you could still look up and see if this guy is legit or

899
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:33,719
not because there's so many horror stories of like these builders that,

900
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:34,129
right?

901
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,530
Just like this one guy, you know,

902
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,290
paid like 28 grand or whatever to have his uh driveway resurfaced like, you know,

903
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,570
with uh asphalt

904
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,090
and he like, did all the research, he, you know, he actually interviewed previous

905
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:49,649
clients of this company, blah, blah, blah,

906
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,729
you know, and the whole thing turns into a disaster,

907
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:53,580
right.

908
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,979
And there's fundamentally not enough consumer protections and not

909
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,810
enough information to make a truly informed decision.

910
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,800
And the reality is we won't have enough information to make an informed decision.

911
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,679
We just won't,

912
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,080
we can't, these devices are new,

913
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,030
you know, like with VR headsets,

914
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:12,879
which VR headsets are causing people to go like cross in five years.

915
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,649
Well, we won't know for five years.

916
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,949
So a really good indication of this is that the

917
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:22,959
US military only allows their pilots 15 minutes in VR Sims

918
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:25,250
because they don't want to mess up their vision

919
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:28,649
uh studies. I've been looking at indicate pre

920
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,120
teens

921
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:34,649
uh with developing vision, it can permanently affect and alter their vision.

922
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,729
So like the Nintendo three Ds warning is real

923
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,729
to some degree.

924
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,429
I thought they made that up.

925
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:44,820
No. Well, part of its legal liability, but part of it is

926
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,959
we, we're not 100% certain.

927
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,179
Um

928
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:49,909
you know,

929
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:53,340
-- so
-- anyway, it need to be the test case, right?

930
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,739
-- Yeah,
-- so, so fundamentally, I mean, you,

931
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,159
you put that legal liability on sort of the end seller

932
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:01,320
of it and at least for the major sellers like,

933
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,620
you know, Amazon and best buy

934
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,820
that forces them to be a whole lot more careful about what they sell.

935
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,750
-- Now,
-- that's really interesting. Well, you look at Amazon, they sell everything.

936
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:11,659
Mhm.

937
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,030
I don't know.

938
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:16,010
It's, it's wild to think about.

939
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,260
I, I'm not opposed to it by any means just because I think things are,

940
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:21,649
things are silly the way they work today.

941
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:26,070
Well, it's definitely the consumer has very little

942
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,100
-- chance of redress when things do go wrong
-- regardless of redress.

943
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,949
You don't even know when things are going wrong in a lot of instances.

944
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,699
I mean, how many of those video cameras are hacked

945
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,360
and mining Bitcoin or something? And you don't even know,

946
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,669
although what is it? I read that

947
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,729
the whole mirror botnet mining Bitcoin can generate like, what,

948
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:46,510
three cents a day or something

949
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:46,919
like

950
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,100
that,

951
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,989
millions of devices.

952
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:50,949
Well, it's like the wanna cry thing.

953
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:53,209
They only made a couple of 100 grand and, you know,

954
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,649
it cost the industry

955
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:59,120
if I had to guess I would say on the order of definitely more than $10 million.

956
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:00,280
I bet it's in the billions.

957
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,729
Well, I was gonna say, possibly more than 100 million and

958
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:06,649
a not insignificant chance of more than a billion

959
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:08,439
when you consider all the time and

960
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,070
the time is a big one.

961
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,489
And I mean, you think like the NHS got hit in a handful of organizations got hit,

962
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,810
but I think just the fact that

963
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:19,310
the universe had to deal with this over the weekend.

964
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,780
So you're talking about overtime and ruining people's

965
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,000
lives and just dealing with the madness.

966
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,629
I bet it was in the billions easily.

967
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,659
Yeah. Oh, I could believe that.

968
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,780
Oh, the battery in this thing died. Sorry,

969
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,139
I just bought some new tablets and the battery

970
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:35,419
life is apparently when you buy $100 tablet,

971
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:36,750
the battery life is kind of terrible.

972
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,649
I'm shocked

973
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,129
who could have known.

974
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:40,810
Yeah.

975
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,379
So, no, I'm actually quite happy that it lasted

976
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,830
-- five hours or so.
-- Five hours seems ok.

977
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,729
And actually some of these as well,

978
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:51,949
if you run the battery down and up a couple of times it, it will get better

979
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:54,830
where, like, charge it, drain it, charge it, drain it.

980
00:38:55,189 --> 00:38:56,550
I thought that was bad for lithium

981
00:38:56,689 --> 00:39:00,209
-- ion batteries to completely drain them.
-- It is not good

982
00:39:00,649 --> 00:39:05,000
is my understanding, but from what I've seen, my suspicion is the,

983
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,810
there's an internal,

984
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:09,379
uh, computer that measures battery level

985
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:11,780
and apparently to calibrate it,

986
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,909
you charge it and drain it and charge it and drain it and once it figures out what it is,

987
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,850
then it can give you the proper amount of battery life because my,

988
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,929
I suspect they said it very conservative out of the

989
00:39:20,939 --> 00:39:23,050
box and let it teach itself what to do.

990
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,750
Right.

991
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:25,860
I mean, quite honestly,

992
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,620
I don't care because all these things will be thrown away in 2 to 3 weeks.

993
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:33,580
-- Right.
-- Well, I mean, you know, it's 100 it literally cost 100 and $20 Canadian,

994
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:36,179
which is, yeah, it's basically 100 bucks us

995
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,209
-- actually a bit less.
-- Is it running Android? 4.2?

996
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:41,540
No, Windows 10?

997
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:43,659
Oh, nice actually. So that,

998
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,370
that crappy Windows 10 tablet. I have

999
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:47,250
it. Uh

1000
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:51,850
it got the update to like Windows 10 creator or whatever the heck the new version was.

1001
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,449
And I'm thinking, I, I literally paid

1002
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:57,770
Windows 10, got some big new update. Uh maybe two months ago.

1003
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,979
I think it's Windows 10 Creators edition or something they called it. But anyway,

1004
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,689
this tablet, I literally paid $50 for got the update. And I'm thinking

1005
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:09,060
this is madness like Android, the Samsung tablet,

1006
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,419
my parents own hasn't gotten Android updates.

1007
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:17,179
I won't buy an Android tablet is I want to buy an Android

1008
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,080
tablet that will get at least one or two years of updates.

1009
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:23,159
Does Google make a pixel tablet again yet?

1010
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:23,500
I

1011
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:23,830
don't

1012
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:24,310
know

1013
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:25,129
the other.

1014
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:27,989
Well, and the other catch me because I want to pay 100 bucks for this tablet.

1015
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:28,919
Yes, you are

1016
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:29,350
that

1017
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:29,830
there,

1018
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:30,919
there is that minor

1019
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:31,260
detail

1020
00:40:31,669 --> 00:40:31,729
tablet.

1021
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,129
Um Yeah, so I mean, as a consumer, right? Like I,

1022
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,290
you know, should a tablet, for example, have like a guaranteed two year lifespan,

1023
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,219
you know, and I can return it to Best Buy if it's

1024
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,280
not getting security updates or something.

1025
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:49,939
I I would love to see that, but I, at least in the U si doubt that will ever happen.

1026
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:55,399
Uh Anyway, speaking of the US, speaking of the US,

1027
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:58,639
have you heard about the hack back bill

1028
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:00,080
that's been proposed.

1029
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:00,770
I

1030
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,100
know

1031
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,129
a

1032
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:02,550
few

1033
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,070
times.

1034
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:04,209
I

1035
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:04,649
know

1036
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:07,120
just what gets me is,

1037
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:11,419
I can't imagine any real hacker actually hacking from their own system.

1038
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:11,669
Of

1039
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:11,919
course

1040
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,500
not.

1041
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,929
It's

1042
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,560
not only

1043
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:18,860
if there's someone you're mad at break into their system right

1044
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,399
now,

1045
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:19,639
all

1046
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,159
of a sudden

1047
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:21,300
vigilante justice

1048
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,770
is by and large, you know, these, these people that are being,

1049
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,120
being used as a platform to hack, other people are unaware of it.

1050
00:41:29,129 --> 00:41:29,899
Obviously,

1051
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,239
you know, I would hope they're unaware of it because if, you know, by definition,

1052
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,600
they are aware of it and letting it happen.

1053
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,889
Well, that, that's terrible.

1054
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,050
Um,

1055
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,260
so my concern would be is you get two organizations that are like,

1056
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,909
you know,

1057
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:44,729
one thinks the other one hacked them so they attack back and the other one is like,

1058
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:45,070
oh my God,

1059
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,050
we're being attacked and then they start actively

1060
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,189
hacking back or hire somebody to do it.

1061
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,379
This seems like a really fast way to cripple the US economy,

1062
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,199
the world.

1063
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,610
It's just, it, it's so comically ridiculous. I mean, it,

1064
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:06,000
this is like saying if, if you think your neighbor stole something from you,

1065
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,000
you can go take something of theirs, right?

1066
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,500
You don't need proof, like whatever, just you think they took your lawn mower,

1067
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,020
go take this.

1068
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,669
It's fine,

1069
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:13,639
you know. Right. Right.

1070
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,489
It's just, yeah,

1071
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,020
and that's the other thing is the level of proof required is going to be.

1072
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,280
Well, you know, the IP address.

1073
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,399
Well, as we all learned from the whole file sharing, you know, suing debacle,

1074
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:25,169
like uh those are quite often wrong or those records aren't quite,

1075
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,330
the whole thing is comical on so many.

1076
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,010
Again, though, this comes back to politicians have no freaking clue.

1077
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,300
And

1078
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:38,520
I assume they're coming from a like stand your ground kind of Castle Doctrine law

1079
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,010
perspective of like their thinking being that like

1080
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,500
this is like standing in your house,

1081
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,840
somebody's breaking in and you shoot them with a shotgun.

1082
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,540
You know,

1083
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,875
and even that quite often doesn't go very well.

1084
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:50,794
Like in Canada it's just, it's illegal.

1085
00:42:51,044 --> 00:42:54,114
-- It should be illegal. Duty to retreat.
-- Right. Don't,

1086
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:56,024
don't shoot people. All right, folks,

1087
00:42:56,195 --> 00:42:59,395
there's one thing you take away from the lesson of this podcast is,

1088
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:00,635
is don't shoot anyone.

1089
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:01,254
Ok.

1090
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:02,395
It's just,

1091
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,064
-- they
-- probably need

1092
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:06,274
these guys

1093
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:07,594
unless it's what,

1094
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,919
unless it's really needed. And legal and

1095
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:10,750
in some cases

1096
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,050
just don't shoot people. All right, don't shoot people that should be the default.

1097
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:17,820
You know what? It probably is. These people probably watch the Matrix

1098
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:20,689
and they're like that, that's how computer hacking works.

1099
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,179
Right. And it's just,

1100
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,280
oh, my goodness.

1101
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:25,820
I have no words to describe the stupidity.

1102
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,629
Well, see,

1103
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,590
I think the fundamental issue is the physical world

1104
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,969
doesn't really translate to the virtual world very well,

1105
00:43:30,979 --> 00:43:33,919
especially now with the internet being everywhere all the time.

1106
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:36,050
What about cloud? Actually, that's a good point.

1107
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,810
Think about, like, what you're going to hack back into Aws. Yeah.

1108
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,469
Good luck with that guys. Right.

1109
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,129
Well, and then Aws sees you doing it, do they just, like, flatten your link?

1110
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:47,270
-- Like, I don't know if again, going back in the
-- day,

1111
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,209
that's my point. Right. Aws is going to put up with that crap.

1112
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,689
-- They're gonna shut you down.
-- They already put up with that crap. Right.

1113
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:54,840
They already ignore it.

1114
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,610
Like, my understanding is for a lot of these major providers, like Aws,

1115
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,760
that background noise is so loud that they just ignore it because what, you know,

1116
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,679
it's like,

1117
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:05,429
given, you know, here's a list of machines we know sending out spam.

1118
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:07,560
Do you want to do something about it? No, just blacklist them.

1119
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:08,949
I'm not gonna get them.

1120
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,879
Are you kidding me? I'm not going to waste my time,

1121
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,030
you know, like with the Marai Botnet, like,

1122
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,639
here's a list of all the 100,000 system owners.

1123
00:44:16,649 --> 00:44:18,939
Yeah. Who cares? What am I gonna do with this? Tell them

1124
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,810
right.

1125
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:27,169
Here's the NHS with a million machines that are not just out of date but, like,

1126
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:28,560
off life support.

1127
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,919
Like, they're not supported by the vendor anymore.

1128
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:33,719
Everybody knows this. What are we gonna do?

1129
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,459
You know? I, I think the problem is we're back into that.

1130
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:38,040
The problem of large numbers.

1131
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,260
Oh, yeah, that's very true.

1132
00:44:41,899 --> 00:44:42,520
I mean,

1133
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:44,500
it's, uh, yeah, it's just,

1134
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,620
I think the fundamental reality is the whole security posture we've had

1135
00:44:47,629 --> 00:44:50,600
for the last 3040 years has been around a manageable number of systems

1136
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,379
but they aren't anymore. Right. We're talking, you know,

1137
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:53,649
a

1138
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:54,879
w says how many

1139
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,179
I'm gonna say hundreds of millions of computers.

1140
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:58,929
Oh,

1141
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,689
at least,

1142
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:00,010
at

1143
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:00,270
least

1144
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,570
more than 10 million,

1145
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:02,330
you know.

1146
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:04,909
-- Yeah,
-- I, my brain hurts thinking about it.

1147
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,479
Yeah. So,

1148
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,340
and then within that how many containers and how many,

1149
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,090
you know, virtual servers are running?

1150
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:12,949
Right.

1151
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:13,979
Right. Watts.

1152
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,090
Anyway. Anyway, hacking back doesn't work

1153
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,320
well. It, it's just,

1154
00:45:21,189 --> 00:45:25,169
-- I'm not really clear on what it's supposed to accomplish.
-- I, I have no idea.

1155
00:45:25,229 --> 00:45:28,850
-- I, I can't, it's
-- not gonna be a deterrent because as a deterrent it's like, great.

1156
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,649
I will actually go to somebody I don't like and use

1157
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:32,689
their systems to hack the other guy I don't like.

1158
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:33,929
And so like, when,

1159
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:34,610
uh,

1160
00:45:34,629 --> 00:45:37,820
it's certainly not going to work as like

1161
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,919
an actual physical kind of protection because,

1162
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:40,050
yeah,

1163
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,300
people will just buy a shell host and that poor shell hosting provider will get,

1164
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,540
you know, slammed.

1165
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:46,830
And, um,

1166
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:48,669
yeah,

1167
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,739
anyway,

1168
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:53,100
I,

1169
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,879
part of me hopes it happens sometimes just

1170
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,729
to see how horrifically terrible it would be.

1171
00:45:57,739 --> 00:45:58,379
I,

1172
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,290
no, I'm gonna say no, I,

1173
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,129
part of me thinks you have a point and then part of me thinks this is,

1174
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:11,689
this is like you were saying about your, your son with his fidget spinner in the ipad.

1175
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,580
There are,

1176
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,260
there are things I'll let my kids do

1177
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:16,219
that

1178
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:19,340
I know there will be a valuable lesson to come out of the other side of it.

1179
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,439
And there's some things I won't

1180
00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:25,840
because it's, they're probably going to die or they're going to ruin my life. Right.

1181
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,020
-- And, and
-- there's a, there's a high probability of maiming. Right. Right.

1182
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,149
You have to draw a line somewhere for things like this.

1183
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,560
And I think hacking back is well across the line of,

1184
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,040
let's just let them learn a lesson by doing this.

1185
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,110
Right. It's,

1186
00:46:39,939 --> 00:46:42,600
well, this ignores the whole international aspect of it too.

1187
00:46:43,669 --> 00:46:46,639
-- Yeah. Right. I'm like, you're right,
-- all of a sudden. Right.

1188
00:46:46,649 --> 00:46:50,479
Like everybody else in the world is, like, wait, what now? Right.

1189
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:53,280
Then they can all pass their hacking back laws and then,

1190
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:55,120
then everybody can stop getting along.

1191
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:56,260
Yeah.

1192
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,939
Well, the reality is you can already do this.

1193
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,889
It's just questionably legal but I,

1194
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:03,800
I've never heard of anybody being successfully prosecuted

1195
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:04,719
for this.

1196
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:05,929
Like, as a company, you know,

1197
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:09,800
there's been a few individual hackers that have been prosecuted but by and large

1198
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:12,489
even that is pretty few in pharmacy

1199
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,000
has an actual company ever done this before though.

1200
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:16,729
I

1201
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,729
mean, I don't know of any, I know of people who've done stuff like this before.

1202
00:47:21,649 --> 00:47:23,219
Well, I mean, there's, I don't,

1203
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:25,669
I don't think there's any companies that have publicly admitted to this,

1204
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:26,949
but clearly

1205
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,790
somebody somewhere has, had, had to have done it at some point.

1206
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,040
Um,

1207
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,570
and there's companies that have engaged in

1208
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,820
behavior like that where it's like borderline,

1209
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,510
you know, like the Sony rootkit debacle,

1210
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:41,580
you know, they basically hacked a whole bunch of, you know, customers machines.

1211
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:42,219
Right.

1212
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,879
That, that's stupidity though. Right.

1213
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:46,669
That's not, I guess that's the other part of it.

1214
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:49,709
This, this whole idea is malicious intent.

1215
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:53,989
Right. It's not stupidity. If you're hacking back, it's malicious intent.

1216
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:58,669
-- Well, mens rea, it's intentional. It's not like, oops.
-- Right. Right. Yeah.

1217
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,989
Sorry for hacking you. You know,

1218
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,260
I didn't mean it,

1219
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:04,830
which I'm sure would stand up in court.

1220
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:06,909
Uh Which one?

1221
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:09,699
All of them?

1222
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,580
Oh my goodness. It's, we need to end this.

1223
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,379
This is no, no, no more good will come to this conversation.

1224
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:19,459
We ramble on about nonsense for far too long. So,

1225
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,260
thank you for listening. Everybody. If you've made it this far. Congratulations.

1226
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,520
You have far more fortitude than I think I would have.

1227
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,989

Kurt episode 50. Congratulations, man.

1233

It's a long time.

Kurt, you have, you have a great day.
