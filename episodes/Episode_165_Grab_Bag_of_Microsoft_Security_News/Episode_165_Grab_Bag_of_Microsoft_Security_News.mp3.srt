-- What show on 165
-- one 65

1
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:06,139
-- looks prime.
-- It might be quasi prime. I don't know.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,140
-- That'll never get old.
-- I agree.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,399
Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast.

4
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:19,909
Episode 165 with myself, Kurt

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,149
Siefried and my partner thought crime. Josh Bresser.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,180
-- Oh,
-- what's new man?

7
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,379
-- Uh,
-- snow? Lots of snow.

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,420
-- Yeah.
-- You live really far north and it rains a lot where I live now.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,979
And if, if it was snow I would have like, 4 m of snow,

10
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:38,810
it would be insane.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,159
So, I'm glad I don't,

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,229
we've only had like light flurries that melt as soon as they hit the ground.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,419
But, like south of us in Calgary where they get a lot more humidity. They, uh,

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,779
they got foot of snow or something yesterday.

15
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:53,200
You live in Canada? Aren't you supposed to use the metric system?

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,279
Well, I use the metric system for most things,

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,250
but if you're asking me my height and weight

18
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:03,290
and sort of day to day measurements, I tend to default to feet and inches.

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,535
But also, well, part of it is all our building supplies are imperial,

20
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:09,235
like a sheet of play it's four by eight.

21
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:13,324
-- That's probably because you get them all from the US and
-- we export to the US.

22
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:15,025
But like IKEA ear

23
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:20,205
shelves are exactly a foot wide. Like, not about a foot wide, but like

24
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:22,154
exactly a foot wide.

25
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:22,375
I

26
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:23,334
don't know,

27
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:26,455
I measured because I was measuring them because I wanted to put up some sides on them.

28
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:27,635
So stuff wouldn't fall off

29
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:29,025
and I measure it

30
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,529
and I'm like, oh, it's, it's exactly a foot like give or take a half a millimeter.

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,379
But I'll use, I'll use millimeters for like that fine,

32
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,849
half a millimeter because I'm not going to be like 1 32nd of an inch

33
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,319
or whatever because I have no idea what 137 2nd of an inch is.

34
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,949
I mean, I mean, it's

35
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:44,949
about 0.8 of a

36
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:45,940
millimeter. But,

37
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:50,080
but, so what I find interesting is depending on how much meat I'm ordering.

38
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:52,580
If it's a small amount of meat, like one or 200 g of meat,

39
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:54,900
like enough to make a sandwich or two, I'll order in grams.

40
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,180
But if I'm getting like ground beef for dinner, I want a pound of it.

41
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,720
Like I'm not going to ask for 450 g or 454 g of ground meat.

42
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,680
I'm gonna be like, can you give me a pound of ground beef?

43
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,119
-- Now, can you order either or?
-- Oh, everywhere.

44
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,119
Yeah, we all do this or my classic at Ben's meat deli.

45
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,610
I'm like, give me about a fist of, you know, raw beef.

46
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:15,720
Like, that's about how much I want

47
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,309
advanced, like, so volumetric. Right.

48
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,559
-- And I'll hold my fist and we'll be like, I want about that much raw beef.
-- Right. Right.

49
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,559
That's awesome.

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,740
-- Oh, my God.
-- So,

51
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,899
well, this, this ties into what I wanted to talk about today and it's, um, it's

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,520
about Microsoft. So

53
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,979
let's set the stage here. So you would agree that Microsoft is a big company.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,009
I think that's an understatement.

55
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,699
They've got to be in probably what the top 20 or 30 of giant companies on the planet.

56
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,350
Uh, probably shockingly not because there's some really, like,

57
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,570
well, like, like some of the oil companies like Exxon Mobile and stuff. Yeah.

58
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,860
But anyways, well, by tech standards at a minimum, they're big.

59
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Right. Of course.

60
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,020
So,

61
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:57,880
and we would agree that they're a mature company in

62
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,839
the sense of they've been around a while and,

63
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,600
you know, they, they sell to enterprise, they sell to consumers, they're,

64
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,309
they're sort of everything to everyone.

65
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:10,779
Right. Right. Yes. So in general, if Microsoft is able to make a decision,

66
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:11,589
uh,

67
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,369
like a major decision that changes something they've historically done,

68
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,600
it's probably worth listening to and looking at for other people as well.

69
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,339
Maybe. I mean,

70
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,619
so, II, I have a, I

71
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,470
don't exactly know what you're going for here because you won't tell me again.

72
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,580
But I think if you look at Microsoft historically, they have

73
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,419
generally made decisions with their own best interest in mind.

74
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,509
I won't necessarily say

75
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,470
they make the right decisions, but I will say

76
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,059
their decisions are worth investigating and understanding.

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,380
Yes. Ok. Ok, perfect.

78
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,070
So a

79
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:49,380
big one this week, well, last week,

80
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:56,199
by the time this podcast comes out Windows 10 had an update KB 4516071, you know,

81
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,669
Bit Locker, right allows you to encrypt your hard drive in Windows,

82
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,509
which is something everybody should do because, you know,

83
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,339
if you lose your laptop or somebody steals your desktop,

84
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,860
you don't have to worry quite as much.

85
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,050
Right. Right.

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,100
So Bit Locker kind of did something that five years ago I would have said,

87
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,770
sounds sensible,

88
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,010
which is if the underlying hardware it's running

89
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,850
on like the SSD it's running on says,

90
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,970
oh, no, no, no, I, I support encryption.

91
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,410
Like

92
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,750
I can do that then Bit Locker would be like, oh, ok.

93
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,809
I don't need to encrypt all the files in the file system. I will just use you to encrypt

94
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,839
all the data on your,

95
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,049
on your device.

96
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:39,359
-- Ok. I'm not a fan of this, but,
-- well, Microsoft reversed this decision this week.

97
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,019
They explicitly if your hardware says, oh, no, no, no, I can do encryption.

98
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,910
Bit Locker goes. Aha. Yeah, I heard that one before

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,429
and Bit Locker then goes and does all the encryption because I mean,

100
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,260
to quote Microsoft,

101
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,440
uh well, not quote Microsoft specifically,

102
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,380
but there's a lot of S sds out there that have encryption with, you know,

103
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,579
backdoor accounts or, you know, default passwords

104
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:04,529
-- and so on. And so
-- I would not trust a hard drive maker to get this right.

105
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:07,190
And the thing I always think of here is Schneier

106
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:08,320
has

107
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,959
a blog post.

108
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,700
It's very old now, but it's based,

109
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,440
I think it's titled The Security Market for Lemons.

110
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,570
And he specifically picks on a

111
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:21,320
USB drive that claims to be encrypted, but just like,

112
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,359
wasn't at all to a level that it was ridiculous.

113
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,079
And he points out the fact that

114
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:30,029
it's really hard to refute this. It's really hard to test for this.

115
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,609
And so there's actually

116
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,769
you're going to make more money selling garbage that

117
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,820
doesn't work than you will actually doing it,

118
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:36,269
right.

119
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,779
I mean, so I just

120
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,230
checked that article from 2007,

121
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,510
but it's actually worse than that.

122
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:51,230
As I did some testing of file wiping programs. I found this is way back in the day.

123
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:53,329
Oh, my goodness.

124
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,450
Um This is going back to 2004.

125
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:59,970
So Windows has this thing called alternate data streams in a file.

126
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,089
Basically, you have a file

127
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,440
and in the command line, you can append, what was it? A full colon.

128
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,540
I want to say, yeah, you

129
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,529
append a full colon and then more text and it

130
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,010
kind of creates like a sub file within the file

131
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,049
and the ntfs file system is like no, no, there's a text file here.

132
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,545
But if you know about alternative data streams, you be like, no, no,

133
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:21,644
give me the alternate data stream called like file name,

134
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:22,304
you know,

135
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:22,524
full

136
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:23,125
call and metadata.

137
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:25,385
Like you could put your metadata in it or something.

138
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:25,734
That's

139
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:26,035
kind of

140
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:27,355
right.

141
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:28,445
Exactly.

142
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:29,345
And

143
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:31,924
so I found a whole bunch of these file wiping programs

144
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:36,105
just and antivirus programs just didn't know about alternate data streams.

145
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:39,464
That does not surprise me. I think most people don't know about them.

146
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:42,665
I, I haven't had anyone ask me in a while,

147
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:46,505
but for a long time I remember people would say, oh, did you, did you know about this?

148
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:48,695
It's like, well, yes, didn't everybody.

149
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,079
And ironically, the only reason I learned about them

150
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:57,600
was I worked in a window shop back in probably 2001 give or take. And

151
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,869
we used to

152
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,570
pull pranks on each other by just like

153
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:04,019
doing stupid things with alternate file streams.

154
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:04,720
And

155
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,760
yeah, I just assumed everyone knew.

156
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,549
But no, no, no, I bet there's lots of people listening now that, that don't know

157
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,070
what.

158
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,589
-- And
-- here's another clever thing the ntfs file system has,

159
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,970
um I think I want to say a four

160
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,010
kyte block header size to kind of store data about the file.

161
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,850
But if the file is small enough for the, for the,

162
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:27,850
the file metadata and the contents of the file to fit in that,

163
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,019
like four kilobyte block or whatever it is, it basically stores it.

164
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,059
And

165
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,829
this thing is called the master file table, the MFT.

166
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:36,339
And the deal with the master file table in NTFS

167
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,839
is if you touch the master file table in NTFS,

168
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,559
you probably have a dead file system.

169
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,880
Like you don't touch it right.

170
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,040
You let windows touch it,

171
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:47,160
but you do not touch it because there's also no documentation on it.

172
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,910
Like I actually a Microsoft person looked for me and wasn't even able to find it.

173
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,279
It's just black magic and yeah, and so that's from 2002.

174
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,239
So the reality is, yeah, I

175
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,399
think what it boils down to is if you have a layer below you claiming. Oh, yeah.

176
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,140
No, no, no, it's all cool. Everything's encrypted here or handled properly.

177
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:09,200
You probably don't want to believe them.

178
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,600
I'm 100%

179
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,459
in agreement with that. I would not trust

180
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:14,869
any. In fact,

181
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,899
this happens all the time where I'll see an encrypted

182
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,170
disk or an encrypted thumb drive or something and think,

183
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:21,880
oh, I should get that.

184
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,700
And I'm like, no, and I slap my hand away and I keep thinking this is,

185
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,799
this doesn't work.

186
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:29,799
Don't waste your time and money because they're always expensive.

187
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,659
Well, every time I see them at RS A or Blackhead, I'm like, well,

188
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,909
how do I validate that?

189
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,520
You know, because they have some really slick ones now that have like,

190
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,150
um it's like a hardware USB device with like a little 10 digit keypad on it that you

191
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:40,280
p

192
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,619
and they look really slick and I mean, if they were cool, great. But

193
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,669
for example, like,

194
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,010
do they have like a secure enclave so that I only get like

195
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,630
10 attempts to enter the pin number before it wipes itself or,

196
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,270
or can I like crack?

197
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,590
Can I shuck the package open?

198
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,080
Just,

199
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,440
you know, because I don't care how big of a pin number you set with a 10 digit code.

200
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,320
-- I can brute force that.
-- Right.

201
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,820
And it would not shock me if most of these devices,

202
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,479
if you like cracked it open and basically chopped off the encrypted

203
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:10,679
keypad part that you could probably just read the disk behind it.

204
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:11,640
Like a

205
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:15,039
-- lot of these
-- suck. Well, and that's assuming it's even encrypted.

206
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,750
Right. Well, that's what I mean. Right. I'm saying.

207
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,520
I bet in, in some number of them the data is probably not encrypted at all.

208
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,080
And there's like a secret blocking device between

209
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:27,320
the USB port and the data.

210
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,559
And in fact, I remember this when, I mean,

211
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,929
I don't remember if this is in Schneier's article or if

212
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,469
it was just related to things happening at the time,

213
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,400
but there was an encrypted USB drive

214
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:38,799
that you plugged it in,

215
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,280
you had to type in a password and then you can

216
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,380
access your files and it turned out that the password prompt

217
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:48,869
basically was all on the computer and there is actually nothing

218
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,070
physically happening on the USB drive.

219
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,440
So, if you just didn't have the software installed,

220
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,820
you could just read the drive and it's like this is the dumbest thing ever.

221
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,150
Yeah. Well, I mean, the, the challenge being is if you give me

222
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,880
one of those encrypted hard drive things,

223
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,500
how do I validate that it's actually

224
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,309
properly secure without basically tearing it physically

225
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:09,989
apart

226
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,349
and, you know, reading directly from the US from the memory chips and being like,

227
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,369
oh yeah, so that looks encrypted and then

228
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:19,469
you know what I mean? And working your way back, like is the secure enclave secure?

229
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,390
Like do I only get 10 pin attempts before it wipes itself?

230
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,789
-- You know, things like that?
-- Right.

231
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,409
-- I mean,
-- so look,

232
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,900
normal people shouldn't be expected to do this.

233
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,830
-- And I mean, this is one of the reason there's, we
-- shouldn't be expected to do this.

234
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,830
-- Well,
-- well, I mean, right.

235
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,530
But I mean, there's things like I'll pick on Phipps 1 40-2

236
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,690
where the idea there is you submitted your security thing

237
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,210
to a lab

238
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,859
that did exactly what you're talking about where they, you know,

239
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:48,580
tore it all apart and they really looked at

240
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,609
it good and they asked lots of questions and

241
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:55,090
they're willing to say we did a bunch of work on this and we verify it's real and

242
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,210
some of that maybe. But even then

243
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,479
I,

244
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,309
I don't know if a lot of these labs have

245
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,309
the actual expertise needed to truly analyze this stuff.

246
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,200
And

247
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:12,200
I, and a lot of these companies, I'm not saying they're malicious necessarily,

248
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,840
but a lot of them don't know what they're doing.

249
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:17,940
I think it's done in Kruger. Right. They, they, they know a little bit about it.

250
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,849
So they think they know a lot when in reality

251
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:22,039
they really don't know anything and what we're going to,

252
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:22,179
uh,

253
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:23,479
in the show notes,

254
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,679
there's a great video of the lock picking lawyer

255
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,280
picking a lock that consumer reports couldn't pick.

256
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,940
And it's a really

257
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,940
simple technique to pick this lock.

258
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,450
Like it's not some fantastically complicated magical thing.

259
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,700
It's actually just, you just need to know

260
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,090
an additional technique.

261
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:41,460
That's it,

262
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,000
-- you know,
-- and

263
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,590
consumer reports

264
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,080
probably isn't the best at measuring security.

265
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm guessing they may be like, I'm guessing they don't have

266
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,960
the lock picking lawyer style of person and staff.

267
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:57,200
So they either call a locksmith in or

268
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,200
they have somebody who's pretty good at it because

269
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,469
I was watching a video, I think it wasn't consumer reports.

270
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:04,500
It was um uh I think it was underwriters laboratory.

271
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,159
The guy that breaks into safes and he's like,

272
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,809
so like this say says, you know, 15 minutes with tools

273
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,419
and then like, but the video is only five minutes long.

274
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,390
Is that because he broke in?

275
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:15,840
Yeah, because he, he like,

276
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:19,869
he just side grinds off a triangle piece and then jack hammers the bejesus out of it.

277
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,599
-- And then he's like, yep. I mean,
-- that's an example actually of a really easy attack.

278
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:28,000
We can understand as a human, I understand taking an angle grinder to a safe,

279
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,219
I know it needs to be done.

280
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:29,380
Right.

281
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,590
Grind off the hinges and if that doesn't work, just like,

282
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,719
start grinding the wall and something's going to happen.

283
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:36,349
Whereas you talk about how do I

284
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:38,046
analyze the security

285
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:43,036
of an SSD that does on board AES 256 right? Like

286
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:48,486
99% of humanity doesn't even know any of the words I said after SSD

287
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:49,866
-- pretty much,
-- I

288
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,245
mean,

289
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:51,385
I get it.

290
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:56,065
It's hard and I think Microsoft is totally doing the right thing in this instance.

291
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:00,085
It is unquestionably good for them and good for their customers.

292
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:02,442
What's really scary is there's all those people running around with

293
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:06,392
Bit Locker enabled that are not protected unless this thing,

294
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:06,611
you know,

295
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:07,952
unless they make this change and kind of

296
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,572
re encrypt everything because there's a lot,

297
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,041
there's dozens of S sds out there that have, you know,

298
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:14,812
a default backdoor password or a hard coded password from

299
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:19,452
the manufacturer or whatever stupid backdoor type thing exists,

300
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:19,771
right?

301
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:22,031
I would be shocked if Microsoft re

302
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,372
encrypt someone's hard drive without them knowing

303
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,650
that sounds super sketchy.

304
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:29,969
It's well, I mean, you, you hopefully prompt the user, right and say, hey,

305
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,710
I noticed you have this potentially dodgy bit of hardware.

306
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:36,080
-- You want me to do something about it.
-- I, I think that's potentially fair.

307
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,799
Yeah.

308
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,130
So then the next piece of news coming out of Microsoft, which is,

309
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,090
I'm really not quite sure what to make of this.

310
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:47,309
So when you install windows, traditionally you create a user account,

311
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,169
this is normal.

312
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:53,070
This actually is pretty normal across all barbering systems for the last 30. Right.

313
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,929
Well, 2025 30

314
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:55,640
not even

315
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:57,469
like five or 10.

316
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,070
Linux

317
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,869
back in the day.

318
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,369
Yeah, but Lin

319
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,419
has always been bizarrely non mainstream.

320
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:02,679
Well,

321
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,239
and Windows even Windows 95 you created a user account

322
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,359
and granted it was not really secure per se.

323
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:10,460
-- But what
-- you didn't create a user account, Windows 95

324
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:11,260
I did

325
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,260
-- what I need to revisit this, I don't
-- remember moving along.

326
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,320
So

327
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:20,619
traditionally you in most of these operating systems, you can create, you know,

328
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,700
an offline account because, well, to put it bluntly,

329
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,650
that's all we had back in the day, right?

330
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,359
You create a local account, Bob or Josh or whatever

331
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,679
with a password and that's how you log into your computer.

332
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,109
And

333
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:33,770
now with more modern computers in the cloud and everything, you know,

334
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,049
you can choose.

335
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:36,559
Well, for example, with a Mac,

336
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,250
you can choose to log in with your icloud account versus a local account, right?

337
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,969
Well, Microsoft is now by default, getting you to log in using

338
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,030
an online account, not a local account.

339
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,479
And apparently there are ways around this, like you can kind of

340
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,489
enter a fake phone number or whatever, enough times to like,

341
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,409
sort of air out and let you do a local account.

342
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:57,570
But it's, uh, shall we say it's, it's kind of that dark ey pattern of like, no, no, no.

343
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,960
I want you to do it this way

344
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,530
and I really want you to do it this way and I'm

345
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,330
not going to make it easy to do it any other way

346
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,630
of, you know, logging in using your, well,

347
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,280
essentially an online Microsoft account.

348
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,900
Did they give a reason for this? I do remember seeing this story.

349
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,380
I haven't, I was looking and I haven't,

350
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:20,099
as far as I know Microsoft hasn't made a statement as to why they've done this,

351
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:20,700
right.

352
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:26,059
That's the impression I have as well as of the time we are recording this episode,

353
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,150
which generally how these things work.

354
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,010
Now in 15 minutes after I hit stop,

355
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:31,659
there will

356
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,799
be a statement,

357
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,489
but that's ok.

358
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:39,005
Ok. So I've actually been thinking about this one

359
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:44,364
and I'm gonna say bad Microsoft and I'm going to agree.

360
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:47,525
The reason I'm going to say it is because

361
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:48,885
I think

362
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:52,724
the world of P CS and when I say P CS, I'll pick,

363
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:56,585
I'll say Windows specifically and I'll maybe clump Linux into this a little bit.

364
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:58,914
But there is a culture of choice

365
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,520
in that universe where historically speaking, by the hardware, you want,

366
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,239
install the operating system, whatever you want.

367
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,909
And things are the way you want them to be. And that's great.

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,239
And on the other side of that coin is Apple

369
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,400
where they're like, you're going to shut up and do what we tell you to do. Right.

370
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,719
And if you try to ask a question,

371
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:22,119
-- they slap you in the face and that's the apple way
-- because you're holding it wrong.

372
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:22,960
That's right.

373
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,450
We didn't build it wrong. You're not using it. Right. And

374
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:28,119
in the Microsoft world,

375
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,099
I don't know if that's going to fly because that's just not the culture they have.

376
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,979
Now. Conversely, I can understand

377
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,140
when you take the apple like approach,

378
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:42,340
you can create a very refined user experience that can make it much,

379
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,679
much nicer for people.

380
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,169
But I don't think that's their universe.

381
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,200
And I mean, they tried to do this with, remember Windows eight

382
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,000
like that monstrosity where they were trying to do some magic tablet.

383
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,890
-- Everyone loves everyone sort of operating system. And it was awful.
-- Oh, the tiles.

384
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,950
Yeah. The whole thing of how do I even log into this or log out?

385
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,200
And I remember

386
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:06,699
-- using it once and, and I was confused.
-- Right. Right.

387
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,400
And I feel like this is another attempt of theirs

388
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,439
to impose their rule on the users.

389
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,260
And I am 100% confident they're going to roll this one back.

390
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,380
I will bet money that they do not.

391
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,680
I think overall that they're wrong,

392
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,005
but I suspect or at least I hope that they're doing

393
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,314
this for what they think are good reasons such as,

394
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:34,074
oh, you know, now we can back up your important data to your Microsoft Onedrive.

395
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,555
Yeah, it's not the worst thing in the world,

396
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:38,875
but this also assumes that people have enough upload bandwidth for that to happen,

397
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:41,675
which not everybody has. I mean, you until recently,

398
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:42,430
you know,

399
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,369
really terrible upload bandwidth, I can do it and, and, and you,

400
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,150
we live in the first world, you know,

401
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,569
nothing to say places with much more terrible internet.

402
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,989
I would be shocked

403
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,910
if this is the reason they're doing it.

404
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,079
My guess is the only real reason they want to do

405
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,219
-- it is so they can track what you're doing
-- there.

406
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:00,390
Is that for sure?

407
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,880
But the reality is there is the potential for

408
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,599
a much better user experience in the sense of,

409
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:05,170
you know, auto

410
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:06,875
magical backups,

411
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:09,214
account recovery. You know, how many,

412
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:13,114
like I used to have a burn CD with, what was that windows?

413
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,055
Password reset thing called?

414
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:15,925
I

415
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:18,895
-- don't remember, but I know what you mean. Yes.
-- Yeah.

416
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:21,734
You know, and like, so unless the hard drive is encrypted, basically, it just,

417
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:24,625
you boot up the computer off the CD and it rewrites the, um,

418
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:28,645
the NTS a security account manager database to reset the password.

419
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:29,155
You know,

420
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:31,704
because how often did people forget their password

421
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:33,655
and they're just locked out of the machine?

422
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:34,494
And I'm like, well,

423
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,140
unless you've encrypted the hard drive. No, you're, you're fine.

424
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,459
Like, if nothing else, I can just read all the data off the hard drive for you.

425
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,380
But

426
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,339
normal people by and large were like, I forgot the password. I'm, I'm screwed.

427
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:49,930
I did that more than once where I would actually, my problem was always,

428
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:54,969
I would set up the computer and create the default account that would auto log in.

429
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,569
And then for some reason in a year,

430
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,630
it would like not auto log me in and say you have to type in your password and I would,

431
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,550
I have no idea what my password is.

432
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,430
I probably said it to something really clever a year ago, but

433
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,910
no idea.

434
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:08,589
Yeah.

435
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,229
See the other thing that they announced that maybe ties into

436
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:15,709
this is Microsoft Windows virtual desktop is now generally available.

437
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,430
-- I don't
-- know what that one is. It's exactly what it sounds like.

438
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,550
It's a virtual desktop.

439
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,989
It's like Amazon workspaces where you get an instance of Microsoft

440
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:29,339
Os and productivity apps running in the cloud and you log in remotely to it.

441
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,229
How do you know how expensive it is?

442
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:35,560
-- Because the Amazon one is actually fairly pricey.
-- Uh Amazon workspace.

443
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:36,489
I think we're paying,

444
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,369
I have one instance of it that is costing me about 30 bucks a month,

445
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,719
which is ok.

446
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:44,959
I should say if you're a business that's cheap when you're just some weirdo who wants

447
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,819
a really cheap desktop in the cloud

448
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,819
-- that's
-- without office and some other stuff, like, if it was

449
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,069
an actual proper desk,

450
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,260
-- I think it's more like 70 or 80 bucks a month it works out to about,
-- and, and,

451
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,140
but with Amazon you also have to pay for storage, which gets expensive as well.

452
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:03,130
-- Sort of with workspaces, it's, you get storage with it. Oh, do
-- you? That's new then?

453
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,579
-- Because when I looked you didn't,
-- I don't know how much

454
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,719
the, uh, the virtual desktop cost. But

455
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:11,390
what I'm guessing is that they're trying to move

456
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:18,150
to that model of if anybody remembers. Oh, what were those Java terminals called?

457
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,030
-- Where you just stuck your card in and presto? It was your
-- desktop?

458
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,780
-- Oh, the Sun fires, right?
-- Yes. Sunfire.

459
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,180
Those things were freaking awesome, man.

460
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,189
Because for those of you that have, have no. OK.

461
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:32,250
First of all, Sun was a company back in the day.

462
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,310
Let's back it up here a bit.

463
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,910
Uh And then Oracle bought them. They made awesome gear.

464
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,550
Yes. So made awesome hardware and software and then Oracle bought them.

465
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,709
-- So that's why you've never heard of them.
-- It was, man, I remember

466
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,869
I was in college.

467
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,510
It would have been about 1999 probably when I used the Sunfire for the first time.

468
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,349
And they, they worked really well.

469
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:57,739
You basically plugged in a card and then it gave

470
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,410
you like a remote desktop to another machine somewhere else.

471
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,569
And our workstations,

472
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:04,520
they were ba basically ended up being split in half where you could,

473
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,130
a human could sit at it and use it and another one could

474
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,489
like, sunfire in whatever they call their, their remote session.

475
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,189
It was awesome. It was really cool.

476
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:16,890
And, and to be clear when we say card, we mean, like, just like a plastic smart card,

477
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,189
like nothing big and bulky, like it goes on your, in your wallet or whatever.

478
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,770
It's nothing, you know. It's, yeah, it was,

479
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:26,410
it was, I never used one, but it looked like a really good system because

480
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,459
you could do it

481
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,050
for hot desking or anything.

482
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,400
This is kind of before laptops were generally available.

483
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:31,650
Well,

484
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,489
what we needed them for actually at the university is a Sun workstation was very,

485
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,420
very expensive,

486
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,650
whereas the remote terminal was not.

487
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,560
And so basically by buying one BV workstation,

488
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,719
-- you got two out of the deal is what happened,
-- Sunray,

489
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,790
not Sunfire. Sunfire

490
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,030
was

491
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:48,949
sun

492
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:49,189
fire,

493
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:49,609
was it?

494
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,180
Yeah.

495
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:50,510
Yeah.

496
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,339
So the idea,

497
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:54,910
and I suspect maybe that's kind of what the idea of what Microsoft

498
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,380
is going for here where you log into a Windows machine with your Windows

499
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,449
online account and then

500
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,459
your desktop and all your data,

501
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,819
which for example, Apple does, right? If you log in

502
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,260
to Apple and you either have your icloud tied into that

503
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,660
local account or you're just logging in with your icloud.

504
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:14,359
Like your, your, your documents directory is

505
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,119
your documents directory.

506
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,839
You know,

507
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,599
it's just magically synchronized.

508
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:18,939
Yeah.

509
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:20,079
But if you don't pay them,

510
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,290
then you fill that up because they give you like seven megabytes of space,

511
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,790
like five gigs for free.

512
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:26,680
Just honestly for free. That's not bad.

513
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,119
-- It's
-- not, it's not enough

514
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:28,869
but for free.

515
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,920
Whatever, man, I just paid them a bucket full of money for a computer.

516
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,260
They can give me some freaking free disk space

517
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,239
-- that recurring revenue
-- back when, back when I had a Mac.

518
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,255
-- That was of my many complaints about the
-- system.

519
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:44,685
I don't know with what they charge I got over it. But

520
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,574
I think more to the point,

521
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:50,204
this is the inevitable way forwards.

522
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,655
Yeah, probably. I mean, look at chromebooks.

523
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:54,775
-- That's basically how chromebook works.
-- Exactly.

524
00:22:54,785 --> 00:22:56,854
Well, chromebooks are a perfect example of that.

525
00:22:56,864 --> 00:23:00,305
Yeah, you, you can't even log in with a local account. Can you?

526
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:03,724
-- I don't think you can create a local account.
-- I don't think they exist.

527
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:07,694
I think you have to, it has to be a Google account and I think you have to be online

528
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:08,869
now.

529
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,050
There's also going to be that complaint about

530
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,390
Microsoft about what about people who are offline.

531
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,989
But

532
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,469
my argument basically there is going to be,

533
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:19,069
there's nobody left offline.

534
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,030
And if you are offline,

535
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,849
you are a one off for these organizations and they're just going to

536
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:29,910
increasingly not care which is right or wrong is the way it is.

537
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,719
If you're not willing to pay for internet,

538
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:34,130
you're probably not willing to buy their stuff.

539
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,199
-- That's
-- probably also

540
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,390
true. Right. Like,

541
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:40,109
literally the only places I know that are offline now are, like,

542
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,079
-- because I've gone camping,
-- I would not camp anywhere.

543
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,410
I didn't have cell reception

544
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,130
just saying.

545
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:46,920
Yeah.

546
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,949
Well, in the mountains,

547
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,050
I think fundamentally it doesn't matter if we agree

548
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,550
or disagree with this because this is what's happening.

549
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:52,959
And, I mean,

550
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,890
you look at a Mac or an Apple product.

551
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,640
Yeah, you can log in sort of locally without

552
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:03,589
using icloud. But the experience is limited, shall we say?

553
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,939
And a lot of stuff doesn't work and you

554
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:08,229
wouldn't be able to download and install any apps,

555
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:08,489
right?

556
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,969
-- So it basically would be broken.
-- Uh Maybe, I don't know.

557
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:15,209
Well, you have to log into the App store with an icloud account.

558
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,449
I don't know if I ever installed apps out of the App store, I think might be.

559
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,819
So this is again where I am not their target audience.

560
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,420
I think when I had a Mac,

561
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,660
I pretty much installed Homebrew and then pretended it was Linux

562
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,489
for the two years. I used it

563
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,449
and then I got rid of it for Linux because it

564
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:37,119
wasn't Linux enough for me because it's a Mac and,

565
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,900
but at the same time, so here's the deal though.

566
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,979
I recognize I am not Apple's target demographic and I

567
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:46,109
don't argue that they should change things to benefit me.

568
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,479
-- I just say not mine and that's good enough.
-- Right.

569
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,739
Yeah. So

570
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,099
I don't know, we'll see where this goes,

571
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:55,300
but I can't imagine Microsoft Backpedaling on this.

572
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:00,260
-- I think they will. I still do what,
-- what are consumers going to do? Not use windows?

573
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,439
Right.

574
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:05,694
-- But everybody who gets broke enough has already moved to Linux or a Mac.
-- Maybe

575
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:13,064
there's a lot of users of Windows for specifically, I'll call it games

576
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:16,165
and that's a weird group of people and it's

577
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:19,125
probably a very noisy group of people as well.

578
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:21,125
And so I think they'll be the ones to watch.

579
00:25:21,135 --> 00:25:23,734
And in fact, I mean, I remember when Windows eight happened,

580
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,175
that's when Bell started pushing the steam boxes,

581
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:28,415
which was essentially let's play games on Linux.

582
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,770
And that I, I mean, unfortunately, never worked out.

583
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,780
I would have loved to have seen more games on Linux.

584
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:39,280
I read an article, one of these game developers published about kind of their

585
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:42,410
AAA year of Linux gaming or something like that.

586
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,260
I forget the, I'll, I'll try to find it. I'll put in the show notes if I can.

587
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,859
I don't guarantee it though because it was obscure

588
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:51,020
and they basically point out that like 98% of the

589
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,099
crash reports they were getting were coming from Linux.

590
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,579
And I

591
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:53,750
remember

592
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,890
like 2% of their users.

593
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,050
Yeah, I remember this and they, and they said sorry,

594
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,369
we're not going to do Linux anymore

595
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,910
and I don't blame them at all. I would do the exact same thing.

596
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,339
And I get that too because I played a lot of games on Linux with Steam

597
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,579
and I think I had 100% of them crashed at some point on me, like without question.

598
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,380
So, I mean, I guess this is the inevitable March forward.

599
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,819
Everything is online and because everything is online, everything

600
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:20,219
-- will be online.
-- It is true.

601
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,729
It is true.

602
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,680
I, I don't know, I guess we'll see where this, where this ends.

603
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:29,719
I, I still, I bet you Microsoft ends up doing some backpedaling here.

604
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,390
What you can to be clear, you can still log in with the local account.

605
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,410
You just have to basically, you just have to

606
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:36,300
fight the U I.

607
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,130
I've seen this with other providers where, you know, um, well,

608
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,959
it was an authentication provider where

609
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:44,250
they want you to use their authentication app to do the two factor authentication.

610
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,380
And I'm like, oh, I don't want yet another one.

611
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,760
So I, I basically

612
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:51,204
made it air out and then it actually presented me with a, oh, you know,

613
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:52,165
this seems to be broken.

614
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,844
Do you want to try Google authenticator or some

615
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:54,114
other

616
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:59,155
standard totp authenticator? I'm like, yes, that is exactly what I would like to do.

617
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:00,915
-- You know.
-- Exactly.

618
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,234
We have standards for a reason.

619
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:04,555
-- This is
-- why everyone should be using

620
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:05,025
Webo

621
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:05,505
then

622
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,395
everybody.

623
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:06,785
Yes.

624
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:08,635
Absolutely. All right, man.

625
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:13,074
I, I feel like this was an interesting hodgepodge of information

626
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,579
and I guess fundamentally, Microsoft would do what Microsoft does

627
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:19,589
-- and that is the way it is. I
-- think that's a safe bet.

628
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,449
That's right. All right. Well, that's fair. All right, cool. So I'm going to call it.

629
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,089
