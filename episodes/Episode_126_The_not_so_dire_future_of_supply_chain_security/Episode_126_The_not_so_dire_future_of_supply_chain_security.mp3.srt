Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 126 with myself,

1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,579
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers,

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,399
or we could call it like 100 and 25.5.

3
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:17,129
Sort of, I don't know. Yeah,

4
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:17,809
that's fair.

5
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:22,850
So anyway, anyone who picked up here, uh this is, this is kind of part two of episode,

6
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,790
100 and 25.

7
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:25,450
So if this is the first episode you're ever

8
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,819
listening to uh go back and listen to 125 1st

9
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:29,816
because it'll make a lot more sense.

10
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:32,016
All everything we talked about there is going

11
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:33,817
to be really important for this conversation.

12
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,766
So, so anyway, anyway, picking up where we left off

13
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:41,716
is we kind of covered a lot of the open source security dependency, just,

14
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:42,937
just nature of the world.

15
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:45,337
And, and we kind of said at this point in time, like there's,

16
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:47,477
there's nothing we can do to fix a problem of like

17
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:50,027
a nefarious actor inserting a back door into open source.

18
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:50,837
And so that

19
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:52,054
may not be fixable,

20
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:53,683
but there are some things going on and I think

21
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:55,223
there's some things we could do in the future.

22
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:57,813
And so kind of well and to be clear though open source

23
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,214
does have a reasonable reactive model for getting these things fixed quickly.

24
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:04,664
Right. We have a community panic and it's the immune system, right.

25
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:06,594
We should call it the open source immune system, right.

26
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:07,033
Where, where,

27
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:10,194
like your immune system generally doesn't do anything before

28
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,793
you get sick and then it kicks in and,

29
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:13,153
and everything magic happens.

30
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:13,674
But anyway,

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,611
yeah, and I'm sure doctors can send us hate mail.

32
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,380
Well, and actually I love this because this is a great example because this one,

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,691
so this thing happened and, and somebody on github

34
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:26,291
did a ton of really good in depth analysis and posted it to the issue.

35
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,291
It's great for like free, right?

36
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,420
And this is like, this is the kind of level of analysis where I look at this.

37
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,411
And I'm like, yeah, I'd hire this guy, right?

38
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,450
Like, literally looking at this one analysis. He did.

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,410
No, this dude's

40
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:41,730
like he is really quite competent and cares and good enough. Well,

41
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:44,470
we don't know if it's a he just for the record. But

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:44,739
yeah,

43
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,540
well, his, his github

44
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,339
account

45
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:48,860
says his name and it's

46
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,069
anyways, that's anyway, whatever, whatever it does, right?

47
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,129
But, you know, and that's what I love. There's a, there's a ton of smart people who,

48
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,180
you know, they don't have the time to do this every single day, all the time.

49
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,330
But, you know, once in a while when we need to panic, we can do that and it works. Yeah.

50
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:04,110
Yeah. Yeah. Ok. Ok. So, so let's,

51
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,730
let's talk about the future.

52
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:09,059
Here's where some of this is going to be real and some of it's going to be made up crap.

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,350
And so here's, here's the stage I want to set.

54
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,710
So

55
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,820
we know where we are today. We know most of the scanners don't work all that.

56
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,720
Well, there's some solutions, some are getting better, some are worse.

57
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,750
There's, there's not enough people to do the kind of work we need to do. And so

58
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,929
I think we can, can I interrupt for a moment, please?

59
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,720
I would say it's, it's not so much about the scanners, not working or working well.

60
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:31,990
It's

61
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,759
the fundamental technologies that we currently have available

62
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,570
that is fair. A lot of them don't

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,089
scale. A lot of them

64
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,649
aren't smart like they're, they're really,

65
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,289
if you look, if you scratch the surface,

66
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,080
you know, it's basically people doing the work,

67
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:51,970
putting it into a system and then the

68
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:53,369
kind of replicates that,

69
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,660
you know what I would compare it to

70
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,779
is, is the space race in the sixties is where

71
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,979
we went to the like humanity.

72
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,720
And I'm, I'm not going to say the United States did this because that annoys me.

73
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,059
But we'll say humanity went to the moon and

74
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,660
we didn't really have the technology to get there.

75
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,059
We had the ability to get there where I would say

76
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,330
we still aren't even to the point where we really have

77
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,740
the technology to actually go to the moon correctly. Right.

78
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,419
And, and it's the same thing with this, like the whole, you have,

79
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:21,869
we solved the three body problem.

80
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,809
My understanding is it's still a tough one. I have no idea.

81
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:24,990
I

82
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,860
don't,

83
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,660
it doesn't matter either because the point is that

84
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,149
the technology we actually need doesn't exist yet.

85
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,169
And that's,

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,710
I think where we should start with before the technology even exists.

87
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,059
We need to imagine crazy things. Half of which will turn out to be garbage,

88
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,580
the other half of which will five years later. Well, of course, it was self evident.

89
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:47,179
Everybody would carry smartphones with them, right.

90
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,729
You know, now in 2018 it's like, of course,

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,259
everybody has a smartphone in their pocket.

92
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,300
You're not going to walk around with a calculator in your pocket all the time.

93
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,970
Yes, I am. Ha

94
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,160
take that math

95
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:57,449
teacher.

96
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,610
Well, you know,

97
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:01,949
I keep telling my parents and everybody it's like we no longer have an excuse

98
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,080
not to know something because we have all of the world's information in our pocket.

99
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,610
Yeah. But bar conversations are way less fun. Right?

100
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,169
It would be way more exciting. Like, like discussing

101
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,250
what, what something may or may not be.

102
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,699
Right.

103
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,860
But anyway, anyway, so, so here is,

104
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:17,630
here's kind of let's set some ground rules for ourselves.

105
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,540
Uh Number one,

106
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,070
I think whatever we see in the future is going

107
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,470
to have to be 100% automated humans need not apply.

108
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,339
Can we agree on that?

109
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,059
Yeah, because even if it's, you know, a millionth of a percent of effort by the human

110
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,000
times a billion lines of code, you're going to run out of parking and washroom space.

111
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,489
Exactly.

112
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,540
We have the law of large numbers is against us.

113
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:37,790
Well,

114
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,880
I think where you can have people involved is people can

115
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,970
be meta involved in the sense of setting policy or setting.

116
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,519
You know, here's our risk appetite,

117
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:48,809
here's what we're willing to deal with or here's what we're not willing to deal with.

118
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,459
So very high level decision making, that's fair. But actual like actual,

119
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:57,649
like basically people can be involved in the strategic component of this,

120
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,290
but they absolutely cannot be involved in the tactical component of this.

121
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,339
Yes, exactly. 100% agree.

122
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,839
And, and I think the second point

123
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,200
that I think will be important is we need to

124
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,470
be in a place where you can do your updates in

125
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,839
minutes

126
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,200
because today a lot of organizations and systems can take hours to days, two weeks,

127
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:21,920
two months.

128
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:26,570
I want to make sure I understand what you mean by updates because for example,

129
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:29,299
are we talking strictly pushing the update out and getting it deployed

130
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,839
and making sure that it's been deployed or are we actually talking about

131
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:33,399
building an update,

132
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:36,320
testing the update to make sure the update solves the problem

133
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:39,820
and doesn't break other stuff and pushing it out as well.

134
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:40,980
Both of those things.

135
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,279
Ok. So now we're talking about essentially from

136
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,079
a problem has been identified.

137
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,750
We go from a problem identified to having a software or whatever workaround patch

138
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,709
or change is needed to the system or to the software or to the service

139
00:05:56,609 --> 00:06:01,339
and that change is implemented tested so that we don't like break everything

140
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,670
and deployed and,

141
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:07,070
and this is the thing that really gets me tested that it was deployed.

142
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:07,869
Right.

143
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,350
Because how many people, like, for example, well, no, for example, my,

144
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,470
my partner works for the government.

145
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,970
A lot of people don't shut their computers off

146
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,670
at night so they don't get the updates overnight.

147
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,000
And I, I guess they're like, and I was like,

148
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,049
why can't they just forcibly reboot the systems?

149
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,760
Oh, yeah. Right.

150
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,440
Because these people leave documents open and they would lose

151
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,970
work and they would complain and it would be under,

152
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,119
you know, it would be like anytime there's a computer problem,

153
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,089
they would blame that for it.

154
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,429
So

155
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,390
don't do, like, they're not going to do that. So,

156
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,739
you know, she has coworkers who are weeks out of date for updates,

157
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:36,200
you know,

158
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,760
95 machine don't ever touch that. Yeah, exactly.

159
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,720
So,

160
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:44,600
I, I would agree that on the continuum of when we say an update,

161
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:47,299
I would say in the ideal continuum,

162
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:50,890
it's from the point of a problem being identified to the point of the problem,

163
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,200
not only being solved

164
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,000
but

165
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,519
confirmed solve.

166
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,019
Like we updated all the servers and rebooted them as

167
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:59,160
necessary or whatever it is that needed to happen,

168
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,920
you know, and that's fine.

169
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:02,929
It's a minor data point in a much less,

170
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:06,839
it's a massive data point because for example, this one cloud vendor, it's a

171
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,720
data point in our story today.

172
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:12,869
I understand big picture, hugely important.

173
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,589
Yeah. All right. So anyway, anyway, anyway,

174
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,980
so, OK, so here's, here's what, what I, I guess I see

175
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,450
is we're talking about massive automation, also safe automation.

176
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,609
I think that's the biggest thing, right? Is we can automate this.

177
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:29,899
But then we're, you know, I've seen a lot of people automate things like

178
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,529
I have automated server updates

179
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:35,190
and they may or may not work. I have no freaking clue. I just hope that they do

180
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,489
now. Could I automate it in a way that's

181
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,250
provably very safe. Yes. Am I going to? No, because it almost never fails

182
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:44,859
again. That's part going back to that risk thing.

183
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:46,739
And I think that's part of it is that this,

184
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:49,519
we need to also sort of acknowledge that

185
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,720
different people will have different

186
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,100
abilities

187
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,049
or, or capabilities or risk profiles where you know what? Oh, yeah.

188
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,309
If we, if we update that system and it breaks, that's cool.

189
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,000
We can, we can have a human poke it and fix it versus,

190
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,220
you know, this system runs the national debt. We can't have it break.

191
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,350
Yeah, I mean that, that's fair. OK. That's fair.

192
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,609
So, so anyway, anyway, here's, here's what I,

193
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,700
I think we're going to see and there are people working on this today

194
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:14,540
where

195
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,260
you can include uh a

196
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,549
dependency in your,

197
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,959
your product or service or whatever.

198
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,640
And like there are scanners today that will say, all right,

199
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,799
you're bringing in this dependency and

200
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,890
this dependency brings in these dependencies.

201
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,700
And now like here's the license on them

202
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,910
and here are known security flaws.

203
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,190
Now, the the biggest problem today with most of those scanners is they're,

204
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,690
they're generally overly conservative and so they miss lots of things

205
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,119
and ironically, the false positive rate is typically very high as well.

206
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,270
Well, it can be right, you have one or the other,

207
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,729
you either have way too many false positives or you fail.

208
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:51,950
And so I, I have no doubt we're going to see systems at some point

209
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,789
that are going to be,

210
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,369
we'll say 80 plus percent correct where you include a dependency and it will say

211
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,359
this dependency has these security problems and you might be able to look at them.

212
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:06,270
And then you're also going to have to have the ability to say

213
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:09,630
I care about these kind of security flaws. I don't care about those kind.

214
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,929
And then you have a system that can basically say you're ok or nope, we can't do this.

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,549
Well, and here's the corrective action.

216
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,789
See, that's the other thing. Right? Is these systems can't just be gatekeepers

217
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,030
because telling somebody no or yes,

218
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,599
there's a bit of value there but there's far more value in.

219
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:30,289
No, but here's what we can do to make it a yes,

220
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,150
it can. It always has to be no.

221
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,159
But, and, and actually this is something I was,

222
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:36,390
I was arguing with someone the other day about is that, you know,

223
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,750
when security is a gatekeeper, people just come on the fence,

224
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,140
right?

225
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,989
And it's the same thing with a tool like this. If, if, if you just tell people no,

226
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,369
they will find a way,

227
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,549
they will find a way. Well, they have to, because they have to ship their product.

228
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,369
You know,

229
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,950
like every project manager I've met the sacred thing is

230
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,729
the schedule and the features that were promised to clients.

231
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,890
And if you get in the way of that,

232
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,309
they're going to run over you with a steamroller

233
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,090
and, and kind of as they should because like if you're not shipping,

234
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,929
yeah. Well, it's their job. That's literally their job,

235
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:09,669
right? Why are people paying you if you're not giving them what they want?

236
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,539
You know, that's

237
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,210
kind of how it works.

238
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:13,909
Ok.

239
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,950
So anyway,

240
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,469
you include your dependency step one,

241
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:20,650
we have a system that gates it and says yes or no.

242
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,229
And if it says no, it's going to give you reasonable alternatives

243
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:27,299
and they could be something like use this version

244
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:29,590
instead or they could be upgrade to this version

245
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,849
because you're trying to pull in an old version or it could even be this thing sucks.

246
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:34,570
Use this other thing over here because it's better

247
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,570
and, and that happens a lot.

248
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,900
I see that a lot where someone will use some sort of dependency.

249
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,780
Not because it's the best because it's what they know

250
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,260
and there might be a better alternative.

251
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,659
People

252
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,830
grossly underestimate integration cost.

253
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,530
Uh Yeah, it's, it's hugely expensive, right? When you pull in a dependency

254
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,760
at a minimum,

255
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,520
you need to add a line import law or whatever your language equivalent is.

256
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,200
And then you need to have at least,

257
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:03,299
I guess one line of code that somehow calls it and uses it

258
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,900
and

259
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,140
usually it's a lot more than one line of code

260
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,179
almost certainly,

261
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,929
you know. And so yeah. No, the, the the cost, I mean, the cost of building yourself is

262
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,469
quite often higher than integrating way higher. Yes. Although not always.

263
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,380
Yeah, people,

264
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,599
I think that's part of the problem is people

265
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,909
vastly underestimate the cost of pulling a dependency and

266
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:27,510
maintaining that dependency because that dependency may

267
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,869
change or something may go away or a new

268
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,320
features added that behaves differently ah in this narrative,

269
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:35,390
uh

270
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:39,190
maintaining it goes away because we have to automate maintaining it. Right.

271
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,760
Well, yeah.

272
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,049
Yeah, that's, that's handled by the automated system to some degree, I mean, right,

273
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:46,200
the automated system has to be able to deal with that and, and I think it will be,

274
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,609
I think it's coming and I think we're going to

275
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,729
see that at some point in the future because it's,

276
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,619
let's face it.

277
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:53,760
It's like someone is holding a giant bag of money

278
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,950
and they're saying someone come catch this giant bag of money.

279
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,500
Oh, if somebody came to me and said, look,

280
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,020
here's the thing that will help you handle your dependencies and make sure that they

281
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,609
don't break your core application because we've had that happen at the CS A,

282
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:03,770
right.

283
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,369
We've had

284
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,809
a library that was used

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,309
the uh the HTML, I think it was the uh file type or object type or whatever it's called,

286
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,729
it was returned was different.

287
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,830
And so of course, it broke

288
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,109
and, you know, once we figured out what was broken and what had changed,

289
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,510
it was really quick and easy to fix.

290
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,659
But man, I mean, if we had some sort of,

291
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,349
you know, massive dependency checker that ran, like,

292
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,270
say some sort of testing to say, hey, wow,

293
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,770
this dependency actually changed the way it's going to work with your code.

294
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,309
Ignoring the security side of that, man. I would love to buy that.

295
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,789
Yeah, seriously. It'd be huge. I think. I, I have no doubt. All right. All right. So

296
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,409
let's assume

297
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:41,570
for the moment

298
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,219
we have the dependency problem mostly solved. Right.

299
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,010
So now

300
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,969
we, we get to a point where we're writing our application

301
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,169
And today

302
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,650
you hear of manual code reviews and you hear of static analysis, code reviews,

303
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:56,330
right?

304
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,150
And

305
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,039
I'm gonna say they both have their,

306
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,210
yeah, it's funny

307
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:05,030
they both have their own set of problems.

308
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,159
And I think we can say manual code reviews need to go over human

309
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:09,619
rights,

310
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:10,590
go away.

311
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:13,349
Should be doing architectural reviews.

312
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:13,780
Yes,

313
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,280
that's a very good point.

314
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,789
And an architectural review would have happened long before we get to where we are.

315
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,700
Right. So we'll just ignore that for now.

316
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:28,479
But I, I do think humans doing architecture of these matters.

317
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:30,900
This is part of what I love about all these conversations

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,570
is we have this massive technical debt.

319
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,450
Like I once unpacked all of R seven,

320
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,539
all the base packages for redhead and Prize Linux seven,

321
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:44,479
you know, unpacked all the RP MS deleted all like the J PGS, images, text files,

322
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,989
like basically got rid of everything I could that

323
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:48,330
didn't appear to be code

324
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,369
and I was left with like 50 or 60 gigs of stuff.

325
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:52,950
Yeah, it's enormous

326
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,090
like we,

327
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,419
I'm not sure if like all of the programmers in humanity stopped

328
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,989
doing what they're doing for a week and spent time reviewing that,

329
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,309
that we could even effectively do that. No, no, just no. The answer is no.

330
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,510
And,

331
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,729
and actually there have been studies done that a human

332
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:10,469
being can actually only do a code review for two hours

333
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,059
after two hours. You're, you're wasting time.

334
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,539
Well, and even worse than that. Do they understand the software they're reviewing?

335
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:20,530
Right. That's the first step. What is this an image library? A web library?

336
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,169
Uh freaking A I neural net.

337
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,869
Can you or I review an A I neural net? No, no, we could

338
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,030
just won't be very useful.

339
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,679
Yeah.

340
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:31,429
OK. So anyway, humans go away. No humans, right?

341
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,090
So we know now we're dealt with essentially what is a static analysis tool to look at

342
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,539
your code commits to look at the code to look at the application as a whole. Because

343
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:42,270
one of the other complaints I always have

344
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,090
is if all you're doing is reviewing commits,

345
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:47,270
like sometimes you need to look at the big picture because you can't just look

346
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,739
at this one commit and what it's doing because it can affect other things.

347
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,059
And so this is where you're going to have things

348
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,979
like you need the ability to check API S.

349
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,140
You need to be able to verify that we're not breaking things.

350
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,320
We have to be able to run like static tests against

351
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,315
one file or one feature.

352
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:05,864
And then also like giant functional testing across the application.

353
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:10,255
And this has to be automated and it also has to run fast.

354
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:12,174
The other dirty secret is you actually now need

355
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:15,145
integration testing against say cloud providers because for example,

356
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:16,515
we ran into a thing where

357
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,409
this um

358
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,900
this library generated essentially generated magic S3 URL S.

359
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,739
So you can, you can have an S3 bucket that's sort of quasi

360
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,190
public private in that it's

361
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,080
the, the data is publicly accessible if you have a magic URL that has like a,

362
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,570
essentially it's assigned,

363
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,679
it's like a, it's a, it's a URL with a non and a crypto string in it that

364
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,869
authenticates you as being able to grab that object publicly, right?

365
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,440
And

366
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:46,340
the default time out that it was setting for these objects was five minutes.

367
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:47,880
And cloud flare sets,

368
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,169
the smallest time out you can set assuming

369
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,960
you don't go to some crazy enterprise package.

370
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,119
It's 30 minutes.

371
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,719
So essentially downloads would work for five minutes and then break for

372
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:58,599
25 minutes and then work again for five minutes break for.

373
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,320
So, you know, this is these are like

374
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:03,630
the this integration testing is becoming a bit

375
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,380
of a challenge.

376
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,979
The other thing I was just, I had the thought kind of back to the Linux kernel.

377
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:12,719
Why are we doing this just for security bugs? Why not all bugs? No. Right.

378
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:14,820
And and yes, actually, that's a really good point

379
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,280
I think because quite honestly if you're building,

380
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,229
you know, in my perfect ideal world, we have a system that essentially

381
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,950
runs these code tests and runs these function and

382
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,159
integration and all the tests possible and looks for

383
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:29,989
wonky or bad or like definitely bad behavior like

384
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,169
system core dumps that probably shouldn't do that,

385
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:36,349
right. You know, because you can have a static code analyzer.

386
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,030
And who cares if it's security.

387
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,349
Right. Right. Yes, it doesn't matter if it's security.

388
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:44,419
I've seen flaws that are worse than security flaws in the, for example, it's a memory

389
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,099
usage issue where it's slowly,

390
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,630
you know, memory,

391
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,659
memory usage builds up over time and then you

392
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:53,020
have to reboot the system and it was like,

393
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,000
the system will run for a max of like, eight hours and then you have to reboot it.

394
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,369
Well,

395
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,479
that's arguably worse than a denial of service because

396
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,950
it's going to happen every eight hours without fail.

397
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,108
No. Absolutely. And in fact, I'll, I'll argue here

398
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,348
where, let's say you're a database vendor

399
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,239
and you have a bug that corrupts all the data on disk

400
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,930
and you have another bug that's a denial of service, right?

401
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,030
Which one are you going to fix first? Not the denial of service.

402
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,060
You have a bug that randomly mangles a little bit of data once in a while.

403
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:20,670
Yeah,

404
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,368
those are the worst actually because then you don't

405
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,189
even know what's going on till it's too late

406
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,949
because if you mingle all the data cool, we know it broke.

407
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,270
If everything breaks cool, it broke, we saw that we fix it.

408
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,069
But if it only mangles one in a million records randomly

409
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,670
and you found it after a year and now all you back

410
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:37,704
are broke

411
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:42,104
anyway. Anyway. All right. So yes, so we can agree unquestionably

412
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:45,064
that there's going to be some sort of like what,

413
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:48,464
what we would call human code review today needs to be dumped off on a machine.

414
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,015
And part of that review is going to be

415
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:53,025
things like testing and making sure that the code

416
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:57,854
you'll have different, uh was it styles you use whatever?

417
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:00,944
So, so we're going to make sure that's all good. And so now we've got

418
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:05,425
our committed application, right. We've got our, our, everything's checked in

419
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,469
now it's time to start thinking about a release.

420
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:09,239
Right.

421
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,250
And now, historically, when someone does a release,

422
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,050
this is when a lot of organizations would really kick in the security work and say,

423
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,660
all right, now it's time to take a look at things.

424
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,959
And I'm telling you, if you're doing it that way,

425
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,520
that's too late. It's way too late. Yeah. Exactly.

426
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,209
Because I'm, you know, we're like, I see

427
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,160
to put it bluntly

428
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:29,140
the people who move towards continuous development win and it's,

429
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,270
I think it's less about continuous development and more about the fact that

430
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:36,599
they are so much faster and more agile than the people not doing it.

431
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,660
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

432
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:40,959
So, so anyway, however, I will say

433
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,739
so you're, you're getting ready for release and at this point,

434
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,150
you shouldn't be running a bunch of new

435
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,989
tests because you should have already run them.

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,410
Right. That's, that's the universe we need to be in.

437
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,410
You shouldn't have to worry about, am I shipping ban dependencies?

438
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,579
Because at this point

439
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,670
you almost certainly have done all your testing.

440
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:55,969
The

441
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,060
other problem too is when you do the testing of that

442
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,369
time frame

443
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,709
backing out is hugely costly.

444
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,520
Yes. And in a lot of cases, I

445
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,060
just don't

446
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,199
say

447
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,459
it,

448
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,819
you know. Yeah, I mean, we can't not ship this product.

449
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:11,369
It's been six months since the last release.

450
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:14,680
And I think that's the other benefit of continuous development and rapid

451
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:19,609
releases is making the cost of a release smaller that too.

452
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:21,280
Right. If you do it a lot, you're good at it.

453
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,910
Well, you have to get good at it or you go bankrupt. Yep. Yep.

454
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,560
Well, and, and you have to write you.

455
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,680
That's true.

456
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,640
You make it easy. I've seen people do it. They're not good at it. They go bankrupt. Ok.

457
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,760
Ok. So, anyway, let's keep moving on. So now we've made it to release, right?

458
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,359
And this is where I think we need to start putting some serious effort into

459
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,109
how we run a lot of these systems because the vast majority of systems out there,

460
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:49,020
if you can break through an application, let's say you, you know,

461
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,670
you go to a website and you,

462
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,040
you send some bad command and now you've got a root shell or not a shell,

463
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,339
we'll just say a shell in the system.

464
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,890
Yeah. Well, here's about Rooney Mar.

465
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,250
If you're running as the web application,

466
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,140
you control everything that web application does.

467
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,199
That's all I care about. Roots are relevant. I agree. Roots are relevant.

468
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:07,000
And, and here's the thing though, like in, in so many systems,

469
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,380
if you can get to that point, like it's done,

470
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,579
right? There are almost no protections,

471
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,119
there's you can do almost anything you want, you can probably move laterally

472
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:15,839
and,

473
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,869
and that's something that really needs to change.

474
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,430
And this is actually this is happening now

475
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,270
with

476
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,829
kind of kubernetes and

477
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,729
sto and some of the things I see there is where people are able

478
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:30,469
to run a container and say like this container can only connect to the database

479
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,030
end of story, right?

480
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,160
Like that is all it can do and that kind of stuff is hugely powerful.

481
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,979
If you can say like this application should never run bash,

482
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,780
right? That's cool.

483
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,839
Well, even more to the point,

484
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,400
I'm looking at things like state uh serverless computing

485
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,390
where a request comes in handle the request.

486
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:51,540
You are allowed to for example, talk to the database back end, return a reply,

487
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:52,459
then you die.

488
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:53,670
And if you don't die,

489
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,640
the system kills you because you get X 100 milliseconds

490
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,859
of compute time or whatever like those cloud flare works.

491
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,282
And then so and actually the the there was a

492
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:04,932
really good presentation by AC CC Chaos Computer Conference guy.

493
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:08,003
I want to say last year or the year before their Christmas conference

494
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:10,463
where he talked about how all the different ways you could, for example,

495
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:15,003
exfiltrate data from a serverless thing in a in Amazon, I remember that.

496
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:20,312
Yeah. And man, it was, it was. But you know, I hope some of those got fixed by Amazon.

497
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,213
But more of the point, it was way harder than a traditional

498
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:25,093
super convoluted.

499
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:29,206
Now, at the same time, this means a lot, a lot of systems and a lot of,

500
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:31,156
I guess solutions will say need to be re

501
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:33,855
architected because most things don't work like that.

502
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,725
And the beauty is once you get to true

503
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,735
Serverless and really understand where your state is.

504
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:40,196
You're sort of inherently building continuous delivery in

505
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:42,225
the sense of how does an upgrade work?

506
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:45,345
Well, I provide a newer version of the software and the next time a request comes in,

507
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:46,666
it uses it mic drop.

508
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:47,806
We're done here. Right.

509
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:49,196
Yeah. Right. Right.

510
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:49,956
You know,

511
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,916
and, and that's the kind of thing, you know,

512
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:53,865
I'm looking at these things in the context of, for example,

513
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,365
I'm working on some Blockchain projects

514
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,489
and obviously a lot of these watching projects

515
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,849
will probably have a web based front end.

516
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,349
OK.

517
00:21:59,359 --> 00:21:59,760
Well,

518
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,810
I don't want you breaking into the web based front end

519
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,930
and camping out there and looking at other people's data,

520
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:04,719
for example.

521
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:05,939
Right. So how can we do that?

522
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,300
Well, like serverless is a good example of you come in,

523
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,119
you break into the serverless state machine

524
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:15,239
and a couple 100 milliseconds goes by and you get the boot

525
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,760
and more to the point, you can't easily look at somebody else's request

526
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,349
or their data. Right. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Right.

527
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,869
Because in theory, it's a different process for every request.

528
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,550
So you just can't get to it if you wanted to. Different server, I suppose. Yeah.

529
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,040
Different server in some cases.

530
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,489
Yeah.

531
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,569
You know, looking at like the cloud flare thing and,

532
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:35,209
and the point is can I architect that in a traditional system?

533
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:37,849
Absolutely. But it is really hard

534
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,079
now, you can't just just say no, it's no. All right.

535
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:42,979
So anyway, we, we're running out of time. We got to keep moving.

536
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:45,900
So now we've made it to a point

537
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,560
where we've essentially released our product or service.

538
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:51,780
And this is where things like our traditional compliance comes into play.

539
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,170
And I'm going to be very specific. Compliance and security are not the same thing.

540
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,750
Right? You can, you can have a compliant insecure application, you can have a secure

541
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,739
unlit application.

542
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,099
Every major PC I data breach has happened at a place that was PC I compliant.

543
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:05,859
That's correct.

544
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:09,500
So, so anyway, but here's, here's kind of my point on compliance is

545
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,180
uh whether you love it or hate it. I don't care because you need it

546
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,869
because it's just kind of where we are.

547
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,959
And, and I will say as well, I view compliance is washing your hands.

548
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:20,880
If you go to a doctor that doesn't wash their hands, the answer is no.

549
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:21,500
Right.

550
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,540
If my doctor doesn't wash his hands, I'm not going to that guy.

551
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,510
And and it's the same deal with compliance like it just because

552
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,290
my doctor washes his hands doesn't mean my doctor is any good.

553
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,520
It just means they wash your hands.

554
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,530
But I know if they don't wash their hands, they're probably really, really bad.

555
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:36,069
Right.

556
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:39,209
That much I can say, well, it's, it's these signals,

557
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,859
I look at places like with the star registry, you know, this, this,

558
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,589
I'm not going to say basic but these, you know, massive list of questions

559
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:46,890
and yeah,

560
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,709
if a provider can't answer things like we do

561
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,540
do we do background checks on our employees?

562
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,910
Ok, thanks. Bye.

563
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:55,790
Right. That's right. Yes, let me give you my personal data. Please

564
00:23:55,949 --> 00:23:56,040
take it.

565
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,270
So anyway, anyway, so here's the thing with, with compliance,

566
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:04,589
there are ways to do like continuous compliance skin and generally speaking,

567
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,189
the way it works is you bring your auditor in,

568
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:08,109
you get everything done once a year and then you're like, hey,

569
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,510
we're compliant and then you stop carrying till next year.

570
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,339
And that's totally the wrong way to be doing this stuff.

571
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:16,550
I think we're going to see a world very soon where

572
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,800
compliance reports and scans are literally happening all the time every day

573
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:23,469
and there's going to be no way around it.

574
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:27,229
And so you're not going to be able to get away from it every day is not fast enough.

575
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:29,390
It has to happen when there are changes.

576
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,689
Yes, that's true. Actually, that's the ultimate thing. Is it

577
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,630
when there is a material or even not a very material change to the system,

578
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:41,510
the system has now changed. Is it still in compliance? Right.

579
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,849
And if you're doing continuous updating and you're updating your system

580
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,050
five times a day or 10 times a day or whatever,

581
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,449
you're right,

582
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:52,810
you kind of need to scan it on a regular basis or you change business process or

583
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,239
you open up an office in another country,

584
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,050
another data center in another country. Those are, those are really good points.

585
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,890
Yes. And this is where actually the world of compliance needs to catch up as well.

586
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,849
But how, how much can I advertise the cloud security lines here?

587
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,579
You can pimp it all you want.

588
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,729
Well, because, I mean, that's what we're moving to, with the star registry.

589
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,339
We're moving to the continuous

590
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,339
compliance model with the star registry. You know, it's,

591
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,020
it's,

592
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,089
it's happening because it has to,

593
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:21,520
you should get someone who's doing that on the show and we can,

594
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,920
we can hassle them about this because that's, that's really cool.

595
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,719
Actually, I, I think, I think it's going to be huge because like,

596
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,770
I look at the way compliance works today

597
00:25:28,949 --> 00:25:31,709
and you sit down for like a week with the auditor and you answer like,

598
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,150
10 million questions and they're just, they're writing pro,

599
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,689
it's not like they're even like, you know, using some sort of

600
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,640
machine. Understandable. Oh, it's Excel spreadsheets all the way down. Right.

601
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,300
It's a mess. And I'm like, this is insane.

602
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,380
This is madness. Like why is it working like this? And, and so,

603
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,099
and, and not only that, the thing that really ticks me off

604
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,569
is at the end, you can have an auditor will say, oh, you need to do that

605
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:59,099
and then you can more often than not, you can talk your way completely out of it.

606
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,400
It's like that is not OK.

607
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,449
That's not how this is supposed to work. Well, my favorite thing was like with the,

608
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,380
you know, with the PC I and the TLS, it's like you have to get rid of this.

609
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,640
Well, except for these cases, like old point of sale systems or whatever.

610
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,030
And if you're like, promised double square

611
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,709
keeps

612
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,859
to like, deal with it at some point in the future, then you can keep doing this.

613
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,589
Right. I know. I know it's anyway, well, here's the thing. What's the alternative?

614
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,239
You can't actually like if compliance actually shut things down,

615
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,550
half the banks wouldn't be running.

616
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,750
It's very true. It's very true. Alright. So, anyway, I guess that kind of,

617
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,750
that's what I think the future is going to look like. And, and I guess,

618
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:38,300
well,

619
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,250
the simple reality is the people that are able to do

620
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,750
this and capable of doing this will clobber the people that

621
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,380
can't,

622
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,819
I mean, look at software releases.

623
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:46,089
Like,

624
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,439
I remember a world where getting a new piece of software

625
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:51,859
on floppy disk every couple of years was totally acceptable,

626
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:52,739
you know,

627
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:57,500
and then C DS every year and then maybe, you know, oh, windows with service pack,

628
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,790
one service pack two

629
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:02,150
totally acceptable. New Linux distro every six months,

630
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,170
you know, and now I expect essentially if you're not shipping the updates as

631
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,229
needed.

632
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,719
Yeah, I'm not going to use you

633
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,589
and, and I do get some constraints like Microsoft Tuesday, you know, like,

634
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,410
like I do appreciate that Microsoft made it a schedule because I remember when it

635
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,969
wasn't Microsoft Tuesday and when we would

636
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:21,439
literally like literally just uh you know,

637
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,520
an email would go around like everybody goes to work now to start processing this,

638
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,109
you know, like literally drop whatever it is you're doing

639
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,109
and

640
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:32,329
you know, Microsoft just dropped a pile of updates panic now

641
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,270
could be,

642
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:33,630
you know,

643
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,310
you remember those, it was terrible.

644
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:38,229
So I'm actually really happy they put it on a schedule.

645
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,520
So I guess here's the question for you and here's how we'll end it is

646
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,520
if you were going to guess

647
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:48,250
on timelines of how far away we are from kind of this, this world that works.

648
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,239
Are we talking about

649
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,650
a single digit years,

650
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,209
tens of digits or do you think it's like

651
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,209
we'll be dead before this happens?

652
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,130
Well, I, I know it's happening in, in the next single digits of months.

653
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,569
It's, it's no,

654
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:05,989
it's not because we're not going to have like dependency scanners that work right,

655
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,800
like some of this stuff maybe.

656
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,979
But I'm saying what I think what will happen is

657
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:12,650
it'll start at the higher level and then filter down

658
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,479
because the high level will drive the lower level like the high level.

659
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,849
I bet you're right people, for example, will have continuous stars,

660
00:28:20,969 --> 00:28:22,229
you know, entries.

661
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,359
Cool. Now, what are you doing about your software? Why is that not continuous?

662
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,359
And not only that if you have stars doing continuous scanning, you can,

663
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:36,079
you can slowly turn the knob up, like boil the frog as they say, where once you,

664
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,400
once you get them hooked, you can really drive some real change in that.

665
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,489
Yeah.

666
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,060
And I think it has to kind of be top down because

667
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:46,589
I think this fundamentally has to be driven by the business.

668
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,229
I, this isn't one of those things like, oh, definitely,

669
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:55,020
definitely a great example is TLS SSL that can totally be in many cases driven

670
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,540
by the techies

671
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,119
because you can just sort of do it and get away with it.

672
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,199
But a great example is um I think was it the BBC or the Guardian or one of

673
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:06,089
those big British news organizations had a really good

674
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:09,050
posting about how they went to HTTP S everywhere,

675
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,089
whatever and like it took them a good year or two because, you know,

676
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:14,760
all the third party stuff, the ad networks that just

677
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:15,979
all of that

678
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,500
to do this properly without breaking their site and making life, you know,

679
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,949
miserable for users

680
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,829
was a very nontrivial matter.

681
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,770
And I think that's part of the reality too, is smaller shops

682
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,329
in some ways have an easier time of doing this.

683
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:30,699
I mean, for, well, one thing they just have less code to deal with,

684
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:31,790
they have less technical debt.

685
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,189
Right.

686
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:35,050
Like a start up has a lot less technical debt than say,

687
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,069
and I'm not going to pick an IBM but I'm going to say IBM because I know they have a lot of

688
00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:42,290
is, is writing the checks for technical debt. Exactly.

689
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,280
It's the big companies that have to cash them.

690
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,459
Yeah, well, they own, they own technical debt bonds that are, you know,

691
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:48,869
20 years old at this point,

692
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,819
you know, they're going to be mature

693
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:51,949
technical debt.

694
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,989
Yeah, exactly.

695
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:55,530
So, you know, a company like IBM, the,

696
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,949
I can't even imagine how many lines of code they

697
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,189
have that they've written and have to maintain and I'm not

698
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:02,930
about just products they've released but like under contract and stuff,

699
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:05,439
I guarantee they have no idea

700
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:05,810
in

701
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,579
part

702
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:06,810
of the

703
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:07,199
problem.

704
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,530
We have no idea of what the US federal code is, you know, for the laws.

705
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,920
Yes, that's true too. Right. We have an estimate of how many like pages it is.

706
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,130
So I suspect like I said, this will come from top down,

707
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,280
especially in the larger organizations.

708
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,520
Alright. Alright. So let's take it from the top down then.

709
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:26,449
So something like continuous compliance.

710
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:31,199
You're saying that's probably we'll say in the single digit years,

711
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:33,229
easily within single digits years.

712
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:36,719
It's something that is actually reasonably achievable.

713
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:37,959
Alright, so let's move down now.

714
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:43,430
So we get to kind of the, the whole universe of lots of magic. Uh uh

715
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:46,510
we'll say hardened systems running like Kubernetes Isio

716
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,859
style things, which is going to be a very serverless like universe.

717
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:51,630
I think we were really close there.

718
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,660
I think I would say mid single digits kind of a 3 to 5 year time frame. All right.

719
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,290
So let's move down. We're kind of at, at magic

720
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:05,560
uh integration style testing slash C I slash coder view all that stuff.

721
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,959
So I think that will happen, you know, again, single digit,

722
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,640
mid single digit years because

723
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:14,119
ignoring the security side of things, if you can say, hey, look,

724
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,959
we can basically guarantee that this code and service we're writing kind of,

725
00:31:17,969 --> 00:31:19,680
we never break it for users again.

726
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:23,089
I think something like automated code reviews are

727
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:24,760
five plus years.

728
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,510
Well,

729
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:26,739
we've discussed this before,

730
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,410
but I don't think necessarily you need automated code reviews because for example,

731
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,609
automated code

732
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:31,979
it

733
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:32,500
the big.

734
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,040
No, no, no, no. Let me finish.

735
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:34,640
I think,

736
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:38,155
I think automated code health would be a good enough start.

737
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,515
Hey, this project is sickly.

738
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,714
It has three committers and two commits over five years.

739
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:44,425
So chances are there will be a a,

740
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:44,885
you know,

741
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:46,824
a problem with it at some point that you have to panic about

742
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:50,185
versus this other library that is equivalent and much healthier and much newer.

743
00:31:50,194 --> 00:31:52,994
Uh, no, you're, you're, we're a level above that conversation.

744
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:53,814
But anyway, all right.

745
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:55,385
So, so I'm saying when I,

746
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:59,265
when I do a check in and I think once you get that then you'll get code reviews.

747
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,050
Ok. And that's fair. That's fair. So, I guess next. Ok.

748
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,069
So, so let's, let's go one more level down and say

749
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:08,390
the, the question of

750
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:10,880
kind of managing your dependence

751
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,410
and I'm going to guess that's 5 to 10 years to do that.

752
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,550
I guess here's let's sum it up because we're, we're totally out of time.

753
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,670
Is,

754
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,430
it sounds like

755
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:27,589
this isn't quite as dire as, as maybe, maybe I thought it was

756
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:32,420
in the last episode. Here's the Dirty Secret and I the Cloud will enable a lot of this.

757
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,510
A lot of this can't really be done on premises easily, but the cloud

758
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:36,939
with that.

759
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:39,189
Ok. No, that's fair. I, I agree.

760
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:39,790
I, I guess I,

761
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,199
I feel more hopeful after this part of the conversation

762
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:44,930
than I did at the end of the last one.

763
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:47,790
So I guess thank you for that. If nothing else. All right, cool.

764
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,949
Well, thank you everyone for putting up with us for

765
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,790
