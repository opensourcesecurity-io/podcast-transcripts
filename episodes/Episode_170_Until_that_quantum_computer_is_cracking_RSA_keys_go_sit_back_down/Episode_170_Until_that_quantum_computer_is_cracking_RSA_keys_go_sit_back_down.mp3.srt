Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 170 with myself,

1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,289
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,539
How are you doing?

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,000
Good. Uh I

4
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,790
-- thought I would open up a bank account today. Oh my
-- goodness.

5
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:19,899
We just argued about not talking about this.

6
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:23,969
So basically the story is this bank in Canada

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,129
and in Canada, you can rather easily open up an account online.

8
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:28,530
You know, you don't have to go into the branch.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,180
Um And this is actually kind of handy because we have a

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,889
couple of banks in Canada that are basically online only or,

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,119
you know, heavily regional.

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,919
Like they, they,

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,729
there's a couple of major banks that just don't have like

14
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:41,090
they have like a branch in Edmonton, right?

15
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,130
Ok.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,950
So anyways, this bank

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,080
was as part of their process to validate.

18
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,830
You was asking for your bank account details

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,040
including your pin number at a different institution,

20
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:53,580
which is really dumb.

21
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,099
I don't approve of that.

22
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,840
And then they also refused. They basically said no, no, it's secure.

23
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:01,000
We scrub the data,

24
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,880
they didn't say what they do with the data, but they said,

25
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,919
and they were very clear that they scrub the data.

26
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:08,610
I'm, I'm sure they're using military

27
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,690
grade encryption.

28
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:10,080
It's

29
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:10,919
scrubbing,

30
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:11,919
right. Everything's

31
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,400
military grade scrubbing. I'm sure that's fine too.

32
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:15,639
Right. Yeah, whatever.

33
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:16,519
It's all good.

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,760
So

35
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,760
yeah, see it asked for all my personal details and everything.

36
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,239
As for my tax info, my sin number, identity verification,

37
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,550
which is, that's all you need.

38
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:31,019
You don't need my banking information at another bank and more

39
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:32,650
to the point what if I don't have another bank account?

40
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,319
-- Because I'm, this is my first bank account. Here
-- is my suspicion

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,319
is why you need to do this. And I recently helped my Children open bank accounts.

42
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,120
So it's been a couple of years a year or two now.

43
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:46,639
But basically when you open a bank account, at least in the United States,

44
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:50,760
you need to present certain identifying information.

45
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:51,599
And in our case,

46
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,419
it was basically passports is what we showed up with

47
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,040
and the banks were happy because passports are hard to get

48
00:01:57,309 --> 00:02:01,160
and they assume if you have one that you went through all the crazy hoops you need.

49
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:04,440
Otherwise my suspicion is this bank

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,830
wants to say, well, if you already have a bank account at another bank,

51
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,490
we're going to assume you already jumped through all these

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,309
crazy hoops and we're going to use this as proof.

53
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,130
You are who you say you are.

54
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,929
And I don't think I'm not saying it's right.

55
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,809
I just have a suspicion that is their thinking here.

56
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,050
Yeah.

57
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:24,309
I, I don't know,

58
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,990
regardless the fact that they won't come clean on how they use

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,110
the data or how they process it where they store it.

60
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:32,500
And they just simply say this, we scrub it

61
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,220
like, you know, no, like it goes to the web server, it ends up in memory,

62
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,729
it might be written to disk in a temporary file, you know, ends up in,

63
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,490
it's going to go to a database somewhere.

64
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,509
Most likely do they scrub the database securely.

65
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:48,199
I bet whoever wrote that doesn't even know what that means.

66
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,809
That's like, I'll never forget when

67
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:55,039
there was the whole Hillary Clinton snafu in the US

68
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,750
email server. And a reporter asked her, did you scrub the server?

69
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:02,149
-- No. Did you wipe the server or
-- no? Did you wipe the server? She

70
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,410
like with a rag?

71
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,229
Oh my goodness.

72
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,899
And that's what I feel like here like you scrub the data.

73
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:11,490
You have no idea what that means.

74
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,740
You,

75
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,539
you probably delete it and you don't realize it's stored on 30

76
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,669
disks because of all the systems it's been transferred through anyway.

77
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,979
Uh It, it's stupid

78
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,779
and I think this is one of those marvelous examples of people.

79
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,380
-- Well,
-- what's interesting is the banking industry of Canada said no, this is fine,

80
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:34,220
like the, the spokesman for the bank, whatever thing of Canada was like, no, this is,

81
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,020
this is ok.

82
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,350
And of course the privacy. Uh Well, this is what annoys me.

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,320
They had a farmer, a former privacy commissioner that of course is like,

84
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,080
this is absolutely not ok.

85
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,080
And this is highly questionable and needs to be explained in detail.

86
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:46,259
You know,

87
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,899
because we have spent all this time and effort teaching people your bank will

88
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,690
never ask you for your password or your pin number unless it's your bank,

89
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:53,919
right?

90
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:56,990
You shouldn't give that information to other banks or other people.

91
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,119
How much time have we spent telling people, you know,

92
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,365
your ISP is not going to be calling you and be like, hey Mr Bresser,

93
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,904
uh I need to reset your account.

94
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,085
So can I get your password, please?

95
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:07,854
Sure, sign me up, you know, or Google,

96
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:09,425
Google is not going to call you and ask

97
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:12,184
you for your email password nor will Microsoft.

98
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:15,044
I have a funny thing I can tell you about is I remember there

99
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:19,983
was a long time ago we were changing cell phone providers and we,

100
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:23,875
I, I use T mobile now and my, my wife is actually doing most of the work because I was,

101
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,144
I was working at the time

102
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,239
and,

103
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,260
and I couldn't get off, I don't even remember the details.

104
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,500
But anyway, she calls me and says we need your password.

105
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,329
I said, oh, I'll just email it to you.

106
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,640
And she's like, ok,

107
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:35,920
and it was,

108
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,359
I think about 50 characters long

109
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,200
and

110
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,279
I, I emailed it to her

111
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,359
and basically the, the T mobile person

112
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,279
insisted on like they typed it in, they for whatever reason.

113
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,720
And I remember I told them, I said, here's like, you know, whatever transfer,

114
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,040
whatever you need, there was a bunch of information.

115
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:56,679
I forget all the details. Now it was special pins and stuff

116
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:00,869
and they were insistent on having this password like, ok.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,660
And then I remember they said, can you make it shorter? And I said no,

118
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,269
like if you won't listen to me and take this stuff I gave

119
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,579
you you actually need instead this BS you can type this in.

120
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:13,339
-- It was
-- beautiful. So interesting. I just got to the screen where it asked me for this.

121
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,660
So it says identity verification,

122
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:15,660
your login,

123
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,359
sorry, it's not my PIN. It's my login credentials from a financial institution.

124
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:22,019
Help us confirm that it is. In fact, you completing the application

125
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,679
and they are, I'm going to click on this

126
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,339
and they actually want

127
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,980
my user name or access card, not my pin number. They want my online password to my

128
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,079
my other bank.

129
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:36,649
-- That's marvelous.
-- I am taking a screenshot of this.

130
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,970
This is no, I, I mean,

131
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,209
I thought it was bad enough that it was like the pin number and stuff,

132
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,369
but they actually want my online account number

133
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,799
-- and the password to access it.
-- That's bananas.

134
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,970
Wow, that's

135
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,570
ok. And if I click my bank is not on the list,

136
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,260
uh what happens here.

137
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:56,359
So they list basically and the thing is they

138
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,720
only list like seven banks which granted in Canada,

139
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,000
those seven banks cover

140
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,000
the majority of people but they don't cover

141
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,559
like they don't have the Canadian Western Bank.

142
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,239
They don't have a TB, you know,

143
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:09,799
Alberta Treasury Branch, they just have a couple of national ones. Um,

144
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,119
and if I click, my bank is not in the list,

145
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,760
I get sent to

146
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:18,480
enter my personal information yet again. Like my name and phone number and stuff.

147
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:19,359
Ok.

148
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,079
What in the heck? Salutation Mr

149
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,480
or Miss Weird.

150
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,929
So this is like this is hysterically terrible.

151
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,029
I'm not even a little surprised. I don't know what to tell you. Kurt. I think you have

152
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,670
your, your expectations don't match reality, the vast majority.

153
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,690
Oh, they're forcing you to make an appointment.

154
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,635
They, they will not let you complete an all online account set up without giving them

155
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:47,595
the login details to another live bank account that you own

156
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:53,075
or you can go see them and show them your documents, which is acceptable.

157
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:55,834
But I think giving online information is bananas.

158
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:56,765
Yeah,

159
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:57,845
I am.

160
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,375
-- Wow. I mean,
-- anyway,

161
00:07:00,484 --> 00:07:00,855
wow,

162
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:01,535
this is,

163
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,024
I didn't expect it to actually like the,

164
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,059
I,

165
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,410
I kind of want to set up an online bank now and just

166
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,739
apparently this is acceptable.

167
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,579
No, your, your plan of defrauding your customers is illegal.

168
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,540
-- They're not
-- my customers yet. Nope, they're not my customers though.

169
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:21,040
These people are just dumb.

170
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,380
There's a difference, right. Fraud and stupidity

171
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:25,779
aren't the same thing.

172
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:30,209
See, here's what gets me is how many people did this before this one guy spoke up

173
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:34,059
and raised a ruckus about it. Right. That a lot did unreal.

174
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,670
Well, so to the guy who spoke up, I'm not going to say, well, you know, you,

175
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,369
you're in the news.

176
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,739
Ok.

177
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,839
So, uh, to Paul

178
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,510
Kaminsky, good on you, buddy, like straight up,

179
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,160
good on you for going to the press and raising a stink about this.

180
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,679
That, that was the correct thing to do.

181
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,600
You know if you see something really weird, say something.

182
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,855
Yeah, except do you think anyone's going to care enough here,

183
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,615
here's how this is going to go down.

184
00:07:55,626 --> 00:08:01,055
If the Canadian banking regulators decide this is bad, they will shut this down

185
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:02,996
if it's just up to the press,

186
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:06,485
nothing's going to happen because enough people don't understand this.

187
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,765
I don't think you're going to see a high enough level

188
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:12,096
of outrage from the public to actually drive any change.

189
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:13,351
Hopefully.

190
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:18,462
Well, hopefully this piece of, uh, can be an educational opportunity to, um,

191
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,712
you know, like no, really,

192
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:23,372
when we say you shouldn't be giving your user name and password to other people,

193
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:26,712
you really shouldn't even if it is a bank or something,

194
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:31,141
but an educational opportunity for who, who is going to learn from this.

195
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:33,371
-- Well,
-- hopefully people who read the CBC article,

196
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,190
-- how many people do you think that is? I mean,
-- honestly

197
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,909
it's on the front page of the local news online.

198
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,630
And how many people do you think that is of the,

199
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,210
we'll assume you have a population of people.

200
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:50,510
Like, literally everybody I know in my age group reads the CBC news. That's

201
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,330
where we get the news.

202
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:55,590
Where can we get our news from the sun? The Facebooks.

203
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,140
You forget that the CBC has a special relationship here in Canada. Right.

204
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,950
It's the Canadian Broadcast Corporation and it's,

205
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:05,150
it's similar to the BBC in stature in that. It's a scene as a,

206
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,969
not a fully neutral news organization,

207
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:10,460
but reasonably neutral and reasonably truthful

208
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,429
-- and honest and reasonably
-- correct.

209
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,789
No, no, I understand.

210
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,320
And actually that's probably fair in Canada, it might be different.

211
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,640
But I know like in the United States, the number of people who actually

212
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,429
read the news is laughable at best and even then of them,

213
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,830
I wouldn't expect most people to read or understand this sort of article.

214
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,710
I, I'd be shocked if the reach in the United States,

215
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,820
if a similar story was published on any, let's say, on a national level

216
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,760
to hit more than 10% of, of people.

217
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,630
Yeah.

218
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:45,039
And even then of them, you have to figure,

219
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,729
I bet at least half won't have a freaking clue what's going on.

220
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:51,580
-- Well,
-- I, I think part of the problem here is so, for example,

221
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,909
here we go sharing sign and access with another Canadian

222
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,710
financial Institution for a legitimate purpose such as opening an account

223
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,145
online is acceptable and this is from the uh CB A,

224
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:02,085
the Canadian Banking Association spokesperson.

225
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:02,924
On the flip side,

226
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:05,125
we have the Canadian anti fraud Center which

227
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:07,825
collects information on internet fraud and identification theft complaints

228
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:09,335
and funnily enough.

229
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:12,065
They don't recommend people sharing the login details with anyone

230
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:13,544
which is fair.

231
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:16,215
Yeah, so which is it? See, my concern is

232
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,645
um I've now had the occasion where my bank or one of my

233
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:22,145
banks rather actually called me out of the blue and was like,

234
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,005
hey Mr Siefried bla

235
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,304
bla and I'm thinking it's a sales call, right?

236
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:25,705
So no big deal annoying but not the end of the world.

237
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,815
And they're like, can I verify that you are Kurt?

238
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:28,494
And I'm like,

239
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,030
yeah, and they're like, ok, I just need to ask some personal details.

240
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,429
I'm like, ok and they're like, can you share, you know your um was it like your,

241
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,859
your name and address and stuff with us?

242
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:38,549
And I'm like, no,

243
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,809
he's like what I'm like,

244
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,770
I need you to prove that you're calling from my bank first and he's like, well

245
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,190
uh caller ID and I'm like, yeah, that can be faked.

246
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,869
I'm like, prove to me that you're calling from my bank and they can't, they won't.

247
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,349
And what annoys me is

248
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,520
I have

249
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:51,640
a

250
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,729
pin number with my bank for, for online like for phone banking.

251
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,159
Can't they have a pin number with me to validate themselves to

252
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:03,770
-- me
-- because everyone's going to lose the pin and forget about it.

253
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,650
Well, they already have their pin, they have to keep their pin for their themselves.

254
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,130
So, they're already doing this

255
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,500
if they do online.

256
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,119
No, no, no one's going to do this because nobody cares enough to do it.

257
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,020
How many times do you think the bank has

258
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,969
ever entered into this sort of Mexican standoff situation?

259
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,690
-- You're probably the first.
-- Oh, absolutely.

260
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,830
I'm the first one that's ever happened because they, they literally were like,

261
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,309
I need to talk to my supervisor and then he's like, I don't know what to say or do.

262
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,690
And I'm like, well, thanks. Bye. You know, but I mean, this is part of my frustration.

263
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,409
This is why phishing and, you know, scams work so well is because even the companies

264
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,469
behave like fishers and scammers.

265
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,419
Right. Exactly. Exactly. It's, and it's never going to change, man.

266
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,469
And it's people, this is how people act.

267
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,049
Yeah.

268
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:45,539
I mean, well,

269
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:51,039
at least maybe people can get better educated because the reality is like,

270
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,989
if you teach people it's ok to do this,

271
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:56,809
-- going to do it. No,
-- people are, you can't educate this away.

272
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,330
-- This has to be solved with technology. I agree
-- that you can't educate it away.

273
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,900
But this is like telling kids it's ok to run across the street

274
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:04,890
-- without looking. It's
-- not.

275
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,690
-- And you tell them not
-- to, like,

276
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,250
this is actively teaching them to do something dangerous.

277
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,570
But thousands of Children are killed each year running across the street

278
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,739
without looking and we can tell them all we want and some,

279
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,229
some will listen and some will learn.

280
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,760
Most don't care and some are actually going to get killed.

281
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,219
Right.

282
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,020
But my point is if somebody was telling

283
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,900
Children to run across the street without looking,

284
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,409
I suspect most people would not be ok with that.

285
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,780
Ok. That point I will accept.

286
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,140
However, people understand why running across the street is bad.

287
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,250
People don't understand why sharing your user

288
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,700
-- name and password for the bank is bad.
-- Simple. They can go clean up your account.

289
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:42,020
You're insured. I'm sure it's probably fine.

290
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,010
You're only insured up to a certain amount.

291
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,669
And more interestingly in Canada, especially with online

292
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,890
e

293
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,909
people who've had their like email accounts and stuff hacked.

294
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,530
The banks have said well, too bad.

295
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,289
No, no, no, there's,

296
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,059
this has been an ongoing thing over the last few

297
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,909
months where there's been lots of cases where people,

298
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:00,530
you know, paid thousands of dollars and the company is like,

299
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,219
we didn't get the money turns out, you know,

300
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,250
their account got hacked and the banks like, well,

301
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,489
you should have kept your account more secure.

302
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:05,880
Too bad.

303
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,380
I, yeah, I don't know.

304
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:12,280
I, anyway,

305
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:13,659
anyway,

306
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:14,630
I,

307
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:18,260
I, I think it's time for a transition.

308
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,619
So I'm going to do the worst transition in the history of podcasts and just say so

309
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,450
quantum Supremacy,

310
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:29,070
-- you heard about that?
-- I assume that was a good bond film?

311
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,119
-- Was there a bond film called quantum supremacy
-- quantum of

312
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:32,640
solace?

313
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,710
Was it

314
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,489
the one where they blow that

315
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:37,549
hotel in Peru or something stupid?

316
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:37,869
I

317
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,950
don't know. I

318
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:41,049
don't watch a lot of movies and

319
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,590
I've seen a handful of James Bond films, but that one doesn't ring a bell.

320
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,349
So I don't know if I've seen it or not.

321
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:48,679
I don't know.

322
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,200
Anyway,

323
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,299
the whole quantum computing thing strikes me a lot like Blockchain and that

324
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:56,200
cool technology

325
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,280
not super useful yet.

326
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,369
And I suspect part of the problem is that

327
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,369
quantum is so fundamentally different from classical computing much

328
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,789
like Blockchain is very fundamentally different from classic,

329
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,840
you know, data storage and

330
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,130
processing techniques.

331
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,549
It, it doesn't map well to existing problems that we do understand and want to solve.

332
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,890
But given five or 10 years, we will find problems that it's good at solving and,

333
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,750
and use it for that.

334
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:28,440
Uh I want to add an important point before we actually get to.

335
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,250
The reason I brought it up is

336
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:31,599
the other,

337
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,479
I think unique and difficult problem that

338
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:38,239
both Blockchain and quantum computing have in common

339
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,830
is a nontrivial number of people have significantly over

340
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,659
prosed and comically under delivered

341
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:49,460
the um the, the classic um oh what is it the

342
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:54,929
oh the the the curve of, you know, the hype peak hype and then the, the, the,

343
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,150
the

344
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:58,710
the trough of disillusionment and then the plateau of productivity.

345
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,510
I don't remember the name of that, but I know what you mean. I know the picture.

346
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,229
We'll put it in the show

347
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:02,450
notes,

348
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,059
-- the
-- hope the hype cycle. Here we go. The hype.

349
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,849
It's literally called the hype cycle. I thought it had a fancier name than that.

350
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,010
Anyway,

351
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,570
so, so anyway, here is the reason

352
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:13,630
we bring I,

353
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,010
I bring this up is so Google recently claimed quantum supremacy by

354
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,890
solving some problem that would take traditional computers 10,000 years to solve.

355
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,210
And they did it in a couple of minutes.

356
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:27,330
It's always suspicious to me that it's such a round perfectly

357
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,210
zero filled number,

358
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,919
like not 9000, 927 but no 10,000

359
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,619
whatever. It's an, it's an estimate. They don't know.

360
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,070
Actually, we do know, we do know

361
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,820
we know the answer because actually IBM basically came back.

362
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,780
It was like, uh we can solve that and it takes 2.5 days on our supercomputer.

363
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:47,510
It's like, oh,

364
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,260
well, that's not 10,000 years

365
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,849
and maybe, maybe Raspberry Pi or something.

366
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:57,719
-- Well, on a, on my desktop, maybe
-- probably something like that. I imagine their

367
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,729
measuring stick of a computer was

368
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,729
not good.

369
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,599
And,

370
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,229
but, but

371
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,859
the, the thing I love about this

372
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,530
is, it's,

373
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,659
there was all this hype and everyone's like,

374
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,840
holy cow like it's real now it's the real thing.

375
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:14,729
And then finally IBM is like, no, it's not really yet.

376
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,280
And it's like, oh, my goodness.

377
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:21,099
Come on guys, this is so bad for the industry because yet it,

378
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:22,900
it feels like water on Mars, right?

379
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,909
How many times have we discovered water on Mars?

380
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,489
Or how many times has Voyager left the solar system? And it's like, holy crap.

381
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,340
I don't care

382
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,710
anymore. Like I just saw a story maybe a month ago.

383
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:35,760
They're like, oh Voyager left the solar or what Voyager one left the solar system.

384
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,590
I'm like, again, like how many freaking times this is gonna happen?

385
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:44,690
And it's the same thing with quantum supremacy is it's that constant. Oh Look at us.

386
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,229
Oh Look at us. Oh Look at us. And it's like I don't even care anymore.

387
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:51,239
Like unless you're cracking Rs A keys, I don't care. Shut up.

388
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,700
Well, it's,

389
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,750
that's literally part of the hype cycle

390
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,270
from what I understand of quantum computing.

391
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,950
It's

392
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:57,890
like I said,

393
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,700
it's probably not going to be especially great at solving

394
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,479
the problems we currently understand and want to solve.

395
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:03,840
But

396
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,848
at some point, we will find useful things.

397
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,900
Like, I mean, I look at web servers right back in the day,

398
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,098
web servers with little static content cool

399
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:12,920
turns out what web servers are actually good at is application to,

400
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:15,775
right? You know, I wouldn't have guessed that in 99.

401
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:20,375
Actually, the web server is still delivering relatively static content. It's just

402
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:24,973
there's some magic in front of it and behind it now that we didn't have.

403
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:28,694
Yeah, well, and javascript now. So the client side plus the backside

404
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:30,890
back end or whatever. And, um,

405
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,209
but, yeah, I mean, like, given that in 99 I wouldn't have guessed that, you know,

406
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,150
I'd be doing what I'm like,

407
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,959
I would not have guessed in 99 that I would

408
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,150
be doing my word processing in a web browser.

409
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,310
I

410
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:46,310
-- would agree with you. I feel like that was not necessarily expected.
-- Yeah.

411
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,349
-- No, emacs life forever.
-- Oh You're an emacs user. I still am.

412
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,290
You still use emacs. You're so you're the one.

413
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,329
-- It's
-- because I had eight megs of ra M in my second computer. So it actually worked.

414
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,140
I wasn't memory constrained like all the V I users.

415
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,050
That's right.

416
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,000
Uh That's why actually I remember when I worked at the, the ISP,

417
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,569
we would uninstall emacs because it used so much memory that we couldn't leave it on.

418
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:11,890
And in fact, I mean, we didn't have like V I, this was like V I from Sun.

419
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:12,969
That sucked.

420
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:17,410
But man, those are the days I don't want to ever go back to those.

421
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:17,880
But

422
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:19,329
anyway,

423
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:19,920
uh

424
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,609
Right.

425
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:21,329
So

426
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:26,930
this, I, so the reason I bring all this up and kind of the point of this story is

427
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,369
sometimes I feel like this even ties into

428
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,729
your bank discussion from a little while ago.

429
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:35,770
So look at me tying everything back in a nice bow.

430
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,849
But I think

431
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:42,969
security is notorious for this where we kind of, we, we have historically

432
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,420
and not so much promising fixing things but, like,

433
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,160
like portraying the threats of the industry

434
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,819
is we are constantly over hyping this stuff

435
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,540
and it never shows up and then people are like, well, now what?

436
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:59,060
And I think you end up in this cycle.

437
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:02,900
Well, it's not that it doesn't show up, it's worse, it shows up but it's not useful.

438
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,369
It's like a car with 17 wheels that goes half a mile per hour.

439
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,599
No, not just that.

440
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,939
I mean, how many times and I,

441
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,770
I haven't done this in years and years but I remember where someone

442
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,280
would build like something super insecure and you'd say you'll be sorry someday

443
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,569
and they never were, the only thing they were sorry about was tying to talk to me.

444
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:21,160
You know?

445
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,040
And

446
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,260
I think that's part of this kind of hype madness.

447
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,670
And this is probably where security got itself into trouble is.

448
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,829
We were all about, oh, everything is on fire. Everything is gonna burn down.

449
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,050
It's like, no, it really isn't.

450
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,310
I mean, things are mostly ok and, yeah, there's some problems but whatever.

451
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,359
-- Yeah. No life goes on. Right.
-- Right. And

452
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,680
I always, I always think of this and when people get, like, shocked and appalled

453
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,579
when they learn things like,

454
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,260
you know.

455
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,050
Yeah, I have a, my,

456
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:55,219
my Wi Fi password is terrible and I just connect everything to my Wi Fi network and

457
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,180
I use a password manager.

458
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:58,920
And I have an Android phone and they're like,

459
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,569
I thought you were a security guy and it's like, I'm a reformed security guy,

460
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:03,180
you know, I'm,

461
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,150
I'm not,

462
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,180
I'm not the way I used to be.

463
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,030
So I, I suspect in five or 10 years quantum will start doing some more useful things.

464
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:11,645
But

465
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:13,704
yeah, for now, honestly,

466
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,484
it's not that I don't care.

467
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:19,444
It's, that, it reminds me of speech recognition 20 years ago.

468
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:22,155
You know, it's just around the corner. We promise.

469
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:26,635
-- Oh, no,
-- it wasn't. It was 20 years away from not sucking from not being terrible.

470
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:30,025
So I don't, I don't remember if I've ever told this story on the podcast,

471
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:31,435
but I remember when

472
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:33,905
dragon dictate came out this way I paid

473
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:34,425
for that.

474
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,400
Yeah. Right. I, I was so excited about it and I wanted it right.

475
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,859
So, like I got it, I bought it for my computer. I installed it.

476
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,739
And the first thing you had to do though was train

477
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,890
where I spent,

478
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,310
I bet 10 hours training this stupid thing to

479
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,339
recognize my voice because every time it failed,

480
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,900
I'm like, oh, I just need to train it more.

481
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,569
And then I spent a couple of hours training it

482
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,280
which,

483
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,199
and I'll never forget,

484
00:20:57,209 --> 00:21:00,300
like I actually got it to the point where I would say it was usable.

485
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,260
I won't say it was good, but it was usable

486
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,579
-- and then I'll never
-- forget. Got to that point.

487
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,469
It wasn't good, but it did stop.

488
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:14,109
But then I remember my brother started using it one day when I was gone

489
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,189
and he did some training and like it ruined everything and I was so mad.

490
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,349
I never used it again.

491
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:22,030
-- So
-- best thing the other day,

492
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,790
the insurance guy was over here after my garage got clobbered

493
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,010
and um he's Australian and we were talking about uh the,

494
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,060
the whole voice thing came up, you know,

495
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:35,280
and so he as an Australian actually found that on the Apple iphone, you can.

496
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,300
So Siri can be changed

497
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,130
to have either the like American British Australian and I

498
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,770
think one or two other sort of versions of English

499
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,439
and

500
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,989
Canadian Siri. No, I don't think so. But anyways,

501
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,459
I thought it was just the output was modified, right?

502
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:54,010
Because for a while I set mine to a male British voice because, you know,

503
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,300
pretended it was my butler.

504
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,420
Um

505
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,000
And uh

506
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,109
you got a better use for voice technology.

507
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:04,239
So funny enough, my,

508
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,760
I use ways on my phone and I have ways set to the British voice because I enjoy it more.

509
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,920
But anyway, so I knew that it affected the output,

510
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:15,260
but I didn't realize it apparently also affects the input.

511
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,280
So he has his set to Australian and it understands him better.

512
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,410
But then the problem is when Siri processes

513
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,689
his voicemail because it's all Canadians leaving voicemail,

514
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:23,420
it mangles it.

515
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:24,670
That's interesting.

516
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,550
So basically he has to, he had to make the choice of, like,

517
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,310
having mangled voicemails or being able to talk to his phone,

518
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,050
you know. And,

519
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,469
yeah. So I, I, it strikes me as, I mean, there's a great example of,

520
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,969
can you,

521
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:39,010
to me?

522
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,209
At least it doesn't seem that hard to, like, I hear an Australian accent and I hear

523
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,280
a Canadian

524
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,050
accent

525
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:46,630
and I can tell which is, which pretty much right away.

526
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:46,849
Yeah.

527
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,880
But that's because we're bags of meat that have

528
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,109
evolved to do this for thousands of years.

529
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,270
So, but it's weird to me, like, you,

530
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,859
you think the voice recognition people would be working on that because

531
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,920
especially something like Alexa,

532
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,619
you know, wouldn't, like,

533
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,390
I assume it's better if you understand somebody's accent because

534
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,290
you can then more easily parse what they're saying.

535
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,550
Like

536
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,910
a great example of this is I,

537
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,859
I understand English with a German accent very well because of my mother.

538
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,270
And so there's a lot of cases where, you know, I,

539
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,050
I'll listen to some German speaking in mangled English and I'm like, yeah,

540
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,619
I understand that.

541
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,310
No problem,

542
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:17,319
you know, and everybody else is like, what did they just say?

543
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,390
And I'm like, oh, they want to go to the bathroom or whatever, you know.

544
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,329
-- So
-- I have a great example for you. Is

545
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:26,369
there the

546
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,900
Scottish people talking to computers is mar,

547
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:30,729
because

548
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,369
their accent is not only very Scottish,

549
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:36,410
they have a particular,

550
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,170
very Scottish way of speaking

551
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:41,180
where they're vernacular and just words in general

552
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,609
are, I will say on the borderline of the Queen's English

553
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,329
and there's actually youtube videos of people doing this and

554
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,079
I, I get it and even I think a lot of Americans would struggle to understand

555
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,790
-- someone who's
-- really Scottish

556
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,839
and I did not understand

557
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,180
a thing they were saying.

558
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,790
It's

559
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,099
so, you know, it's really funny. Actually I love is, I'll never forget

560
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,930
the first time I ever went to London

561
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,819
and

562
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,780
I was out having some beers at the pub

563
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,780
and it got late. It's like, all right time to go. Right.

564
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,810
I go back to my room and I turn on the TV.

565
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,560
And it was a Gaelic station or

566
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:21,459
it was a Welsh TV station.

567
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,189
But the noi that like the sounds in Welsh are very English sounding.

568
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:30,459
I remember I'm saying them like, how much beer did I drink? Like I,

569
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,410
I was

570
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:33,680
II, I did not know what was happening.

571
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:37,489
It took longer than I want to admit to realize they were not speaking English and no,

572
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,199
you didn't drink too much at the pub.

573
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,729
Like everything is fine, but

574
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:43,484
we're, we're horribly off topic as we tend to get.

575
00:24:43,494 --> 00:24:45,724
Well, I think this is a great example of like,

576
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:48,265
it strikes me as a classic case of like,

577
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:51,964
how is this not a technology somebody's working on because it feels

578
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:55,145
like it would make things a whole lot more useful and better.

579
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:55,685
No, no

580
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:59,915
people are working on it. It's just really hard to solve.

581
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:03,849
It's kind of like, let's pick on security in general.

582
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:08,239
We talk about how security is a tire fire all the time. And in many aspects it is

583
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,140
and there are people working on it

584
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,939
but it's too hard to solve.

585
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:15,300
And this is one of those places and I'm sure it's the same thing in voice recognition.

586
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,680
Well, I, I would disagree a little bit because one interesting thing is

587
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:21,910
the majority of the voice recognition that is currently kind

588
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,170
of available and being widely used at the consumer end,

589
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,949
not the business end,

590
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:29,510
like not medical transcription software but things like Siri and Alexa,

591
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,760
they can roll out an update to everybody in two minutes because they just do.

592
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,300
-- Right. Yeah. But I don't think that matters security.
-- However, let me put this,

593
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,550
I could come out with the best open source security appliance that does DS ID P,

594
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,150
firewall

595
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,349
threat, intelligence, everything.

596
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,300
-- Oh,
-- dude, if you go to RS A, they're selling those, everyone's got one.

597
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:50,900
Oh, yeah.

598
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,270
Yeah.

599
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,680
But I'm just what I'm saying is even if I had one that was

600
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:56,359
free or even if I had one where not only do you install it,

601
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,160
but I pay you $1000 to install it.

602
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:00,859
Would I be able to get more than one or 2% market share?

603
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,579
No, whereas

604
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,089
Amazon improves Alexa

605
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,020
and Bam Alexa is better for everybody.

606
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:09,180
You know, Apple improves Siri and as soon as they do an OS update,

607
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:11,760
Siri is locally better for everybody.

608
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,420
And um,

609
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,890
my understanding is Siri still does ship some stuff

610
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,520
off to the back end mothership for processing,

611
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,280
you know, same thing with the Google voice is, is,

612
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,300
is it does most of the stuff locally but does ship stuff back to the mothership.

613
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,180
But I'm going to bring this back. We talked about

614
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:30,250
incremental change a couple of episodes ago if you

615
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,020
call.

616
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,219
And I think that's what this is though,

617
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:36,520
is in voice recognition and security for that matter.

618
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:40,540
We are seeing very tiny incremental changes along the way

619
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:45,089
when the reality is and this is kind of part of the quantum discussion as well. Is

620
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:50,640
there needs to be a new breakthrough in research to actually make this stuff better?

621
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,119
I think just slowly improving, it's kind of like,

622
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,479
-- well,
-- it'll get there but in like 20 or 40 years,

623
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,780
but it's not, it's not slow improvements.

624
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,630
All right, we need breakthroughs and quantum is probably a breakthrough.

625
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,599
I I don't know what kind we're going to find out someday.

626
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:09,250
-- I'm sure, I
-- mean, one challenge with quantum as, as I understand it quantum is great,

627
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,310
but you're going to need more than like eight cubits to do something useful.

628
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:12,709
Well,

629
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:16,869
I I think I read an article that Google or somebody's claiming they should be up to,

630
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,329
I think IBM has 40

631
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:21,050
they're expecting hundreds in the next couple of years.

632
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,689
Which maybe, maybe not. I mean, it's, it's complicated and hard to understand it.

633
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:26,750
I'm not going to pretend

634
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,209
I'm an expert at all in any of this stuff.

635
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,329
We'll link to a, uh,

636
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:33,569
there's a good comic strip off S NBC from this week that explains quantum.

637
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:36,609
-- Yeah,
-- that's really, really good. I really enjoyed that one.

638
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:38,489
Yeah, we'll put that in the show notes. Definitely.

639
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,650
But it's,

640
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,660
it's hard,

641
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,410
not many people understand it. I definitely don't, I won't even pretend I do.

642
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,939
-- You
-- know what? Actually? No, I'd say it's worse.

643
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:50,089
It's a lot like Blockchain and, but a lot of people think they understand it.

644
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:53,229
-- Yeah,
-- that's probably true. That's like security also. Yeah.

645
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:57,660
If we just apply more A V to, you know, it rubs the A V on its skin or it gets the hose.

646
00:27:57,949 --> 00:27:58,780
That's right.

647
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,540
I, I know, man, there's, you know,

648
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,089
what's funny is I used to read these security articles

649
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,060
and I would like,

650
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:08,880
actually contact the authors and the people in that would be like you got this wrong,

651
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,020
you got this wrong, you got this wrong now that I'm older.

652
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,520
I'm like,

653
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,739
I don't even care. This article is terrible. It doesn't really matter, you know,

654
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:21,130
and it doesn't because no one's reading it anyway. So it's fine

655
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,599
anyway. Anyway. So,

656
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:28,140
yeah, I don't know. I guess my, my take on quantum computing is

657
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,530
until that thing is cracking Rs A keys.

658
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,709
Like, shut up. I don't want to hear it.

659
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,839
-- That's kind of where I sit right now. I think I'm
-- guessing in five years

660
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:40,204
we have pretty much the exact conversation, word for word.

661
00:28:40,364 --> 00:28:42,494
I suspect we will.

662
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:47,885
And now I, I would bet a pint on that. I wouldn't bet my house,

663
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:48,604
but

664
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,135
I feel like

665
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:51,885
quantum has been

666
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,939
so slow

667
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:54,670
-- and we
-- were

668
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,420
-- so
-- much

669
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,739
some of these problems like cold fusion, speech recognition.

670
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,969
-- They're just a lot harder than we thought they were self
-- driving cars, man.

671
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:07,709
I mean, do you remember what self driving cars came up probably about five years ago?

672
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:09,500
And it was looking like holy crap.

673
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,910
We're going to have self driving cars in a couple of years.

674
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,300
And at this point given what I've seen, I bet we're still a decade away,

675
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,800
which makes me sad because I hate driving and I really want a self driving car,

676
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,260
but

677
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,619
I, I have a suspicion. It's,

678
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:24,800
it's like anything right

679
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,859
that it's the 8020 rule where that,

680
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,310
that 80%

681
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,290
doesn't take long to get to,

682
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,069
but the last 20% really matters and it takes a lot of effort to get that.

683
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:36,599
Well,

684
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,369
and self driving cars are a great example of

685
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,199
where you have an even more difficult problem of.

686
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:43,849
So the car is self driving, but if it ever has to fail back to the human,

687
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,930
the human has to be paying attention and has to be on the ball,

688
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:49,380
which kind of defeats the whole point of a self driving car.

689
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:49,489
Right.

690
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,729
All those people in their Tesla when the

691
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:52,989
Tesla slams into the back of something stationary,

692
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:54,969
you know, when it's supposed to change lanes.

693
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:57,650
And doesn't I, you know, if I'm in a Tesla self driving car,

694
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,579
my understanding is that I can kind of zone out of it.

695
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,109
Not, I have to be hyper vigilant because if I have to be hyper vigilant,

696
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,630
I might as well just drive the darn thing.

697
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,750
Yep. I agree. I agree completely.

698
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,750
The whole point is that I can fall asleep or read a book and I don't have to care.

699
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,589
No, I gotta say I'm on Google's side with this where the, the car has a button.

700
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,619
-- That's it. Yeah.
-- Serious. I, I agree 100%.

701
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,540
Actually, I learned, I,

702
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,140
I read something really cool on Twitter the other day and this is,

703
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,699
we can end on this marvelous piece of advice.

704
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,180
They said when you're stuck in traffic,

705
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,219
uh, just cut off a Tesla

706
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,660
because they have all the right.

707
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,630
They have like all the special computery autopilot stuff in it.

708
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,469
So basically as soon as you start to cut it off,

709
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,560
it will get out of your way and you don't have to worry about getting in an accident.

710
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:37,979
So

711
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,680
there you go. If you need to merge into traffic, find the Tesla.

712
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,189
I've actually been wondering about that.

713
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,959
Can I just like these, these protests where, you know,

714
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,000
can one person just walk out onto a highway and

715
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,920
snarl it up without fear of being run over.

716
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,770
Uh, if there was all self driving cars.

717
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,319
Yeah.

718
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,939
I, I would assume so. I mean, the cars aren't going to hit people.

719
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,819
Yeah, I believe that's a car don't.

720
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,180
Right. I mean, that's, that's the idea. And is that a way you could protest?

721
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:09,180
-- I mean, yeah, you can do that now, even,
-- well, we've already seen that.

722
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:12,060
You know, we've already seen that with the, with various protests, you know,

723
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:15,900
sitting camping out in a bridge or a busy intersection or whatever

724
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:20,489
because most people thankfully are not willing to drive over protesters yet.

725
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,979
You know, even if they are late for work,

726
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:29,609
I'm not, we're going to end this because this conversation could

727
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,469
take a little bad turn for the worse.

728
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:33,449
So,

729
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,060
