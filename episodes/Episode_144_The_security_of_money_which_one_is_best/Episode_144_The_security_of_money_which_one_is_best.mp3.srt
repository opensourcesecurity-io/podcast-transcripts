Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 144

1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,310
with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Baking Crime,

2
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:13,100
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,950
Oh, my goodness. So, all right. The context for you listener

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,459
is that before the show, Kurt says 100 and 44. That sounds like an important number.

5
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:22,829
And I said, I don't know.

6
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:27,280
And then he asked, well, what's, what's a gross, which is 12 dozen, 12 times 12?

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,840
And I said, I don't know.

8
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:31,020
And then Kurt said, well, it's 100 and 44.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,240
And then we had a discussion about the fact that I can

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,159
literally not do math in my head in any meaningful way,

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,990
even though I've taken very advanced math classes through my college career.

12
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,150
And quite frankly,

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,110
I don't care because I literally walk around with a

14
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,290
calculator in my pocket all of the time now.

15
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:49,049
Yeah. No, that's fair. I agree. It's completely fair.

16
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:51,930
And I think memorizing math now is a waste

17
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:54,380
of what precious little brain power I have left.

18
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,889
Uh I think some basic math is good to know off the top of your head.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,849
-- Like people that, you know, can't make change.
-- Uh, I can't make change either.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,209
So, who cares?

21
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:07,010
And, and right, and actually that, that, that, that ties into,

22
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,730
you want to talk about money today

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,269
and I can't make change and I don't care because I think cash is horrible and stupid.

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,629
-- So, there you go.
-- Well, ok, where do we want to start?

25
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,349
So, there's, there's sort of two entry points,

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,910
there's Banksy or there's my credit card you pick.

27
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:25,089
-- Uh, what about your credit card? So
-- the other day I was at the store buying some food

28
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,029
as one does and, uh, my credit card wouldn't work. Ok, luckily my debit card did work.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,139
And so, you know,

30
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,339
I checked to make sure I hadn't accidentally like gone

31
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,430
bonkers on Amazon and maxed up my card or something

32
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,709
because the terminal was giving a weird error. It wasn't like a connection error.

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,129
It was just, or like, you know,

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,760
it was just saying it was declined and I was like, well, you know,

35
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:45,250
um,

36
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,650
but yeah, so basically my credit card didn't work.

37
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,160
My debit card did work thankfully because I, I generally don't carry cash and I,

38
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,769
I actually keep trying to make a habit of carrying cash, but I keep,

39
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,250
I just can't be bothered to, but it got me thinking that.

40
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,489
So there's been some people talking about, you know,

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,529
cash versus debit versus credit and versus, you know, uh, Bitcoin and whatnot

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,260
and something very fundamental to cash that none of these other systems have

43
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:10,949
is cash doesn't require you to ask somebody for permission to spend it.

44
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,050
Whereas all these other systems, debit cards, credit cards, Bitcoin,

45
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:17,619
whatever you have to ask somebody for permission or multiple,

46
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,660
somebody for permission

47
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,529
to spend it.

48
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,690
Right? Like if I want to use my debit card, my bank has to authorize that transaction.

49
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:24,779
Same thing with the credit card

50
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,059
in Bitcoin,

51
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,250
you have to find a miner that will take your transaction and add it to their pool and,

52
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,080
and run it through.

53
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,330
You. You, you know this whole thing of like, oh, you can just spend Bitcoin.

54
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:38,020
It's, you know, you don't have to worry about anything.

55
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,210
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.

56
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,300
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

57
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:44,660
So,

58
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:45,779
ok,

59
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:47,179
I mean, what's your point?

60
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,880
Well, just from a security point of view, it's interesting is we're trading,

61
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,240
we're giving some tradeoffs now.

62
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,460
Don't get me wrong. I love cashless. Right. I love

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,070
having, you know, being able to just download my banking record and be like, oh,

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,759
here's how much I spent on gas or this month or here's how much I spent on

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,800
candy this month or whatever.

66
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,929
Um, but it really, it, it's, it, when it does break, you know,

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,039
when there's a communications outage or,

68
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,809
I don't know,

69
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,750
for whatever reason the terminal just wouldn't let me use my credit card

70
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,880
and, you know what's funny is I was tapping my card.

71
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,919
It didn't even occur to me to stick it in and try that.

72
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,380
Hm.

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,699
Taps

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:22,860
in

75
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,860
Canada for, I don't know, 10 years.

76
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,449
-- I,
-- I love when I can tap

77
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,759
and, and it's even better because now I have, uh,

78
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,839
Google pay on my phone and so I don't need to take my wallet out.

79
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,009
Just whip out the phone, touch to the terminal and pay my bill. It's beautiful.

80
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,110
Yeah,

81
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,720
apparently pretty much all of Asia and the developing world is

82
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:43,399
skipping tap cards and just moving straight to cell phones.

83
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,729
Which totally makes sense.

84
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,179
So

85
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,559
you don't have to mail a card out and deal with all that garbage,

86
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:49,490
you know?

87
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:54,479
Right. Right. And a phone, a good phone has much better security than a credit card,

88
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,179
you know,

89
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:56,770
I

90
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,020
have

91
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,220
to,

92
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,399
my phone

93
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,160
to use it. Whereas my credit card,

94
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,960
in fact, there was, there was a story I read one time where somebody had one of the,

95
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,690
like, the handheld contactless readers

96
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,720
at a festival in Europe and they were like, walking around, you know,

97
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,399
like tapping people's legs and stuff trying to get their, their wallets.

98
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:15,669
And

99
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:16,858
what is it in Europe?

100
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:20,178
I think if the transaction is like â‚¬20 or less, you don't need to sign.

101
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,910
So the contact list just goes through.

102
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,309
So here I'm just trying to think of the,

103
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,750
so it, it depends with, uh, there's different rules with debit versus credit cards

104
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,100
and, uh, for some, it's, the merchant can set a max.

105
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:38,260
So for example, a lot of convenience stores will have like a max tap of like,

106
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,170
say 50 bucks.

107
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:43,630
I know at Costco the max tap is 100 bucks, which is useless at Costco because

108
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:45,679
like, it's a Costco,

109
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,519
I did actually spend less than $100 at Costco one time

110
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:51,920
and I tapped my phone.

111
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:54,970
Then I'm just standing there like an idiot and the lady says you don't need to sign,

112
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,359
it's fine.

113
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:59,040
-- I'm like, ok, that's neat. Anyways, well,
-- you never need to sign here when you tap.

114
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,880
But, um, what will happen is you'll tap and it'll be like, you know, you can't tap,

115
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,679
you have to like, stick your card in and use your pin

116
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,320
to actually authorize that much. But I was buying something that was over 500 bucks

117
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,540
and,

118
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,739
uh, I just force a habit I tapped

119
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,019
and the guy's like, oh, that won't work.

120
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:17,190
And I'm like, oh, yeah, probably will because it was a credit card, not a debit card.

121
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,779
And it went through and he kind of stared at me and I'm like, I'm like,

122
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,859
do you want me to sign that receipt?

123
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:21,920
And he's like, yes, please.

124
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,839
Right. II, I recall having that and

125
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:29,420
I was in Europe

126
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,380
and I think I was buying tickets at the train station. I use my phone

127
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,859
and the guy said, oh, you can't tap for this amount.

128
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,489
I said, well, let's just see if it works. And it didn't he? Like, was speechless.

129
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,690
I looked at him and I said, like, I'm from America,

130
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,660
like our credit card laws are a disaster.

131
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:46,500
Well, that's the thing. Right? It depends.

132
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,989
Sometimes the merchant sets a maximum amount, sometimes the,

133
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,350
the payment processor sets some maximum amount.

134
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:56,290
Sometimes you're issuing bank or whatever entity sets a maximum amount.

135
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:57,809
So, who knows? Right.

136
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,059
And, and then also the rules on, you know,

137
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,209
whether or not you're allowed to tap or you have to stick it in,

138
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,709
in pin or whatever that, that also varies.

139
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,049
And then, you know, and I love that

140
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,529
like I have an American credit card for work and

141
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,209
it doesn't have a pin number and it just, every time I use it

142
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,350
physically, like when I travel, I'm like, oh I forgot the damn pin number

143
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,149
and I get like really annoyed and then I'm like, wait, no, calm down.

144
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,410
It doesn't have a pin, it's OK

145
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,109
because we have a chip and sign which is idiotic. Now, I've heard rumors

146
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,489
that they want to switch to just chip. No signature. Who cares? And let's face it.

147
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:36,670
Nobody ever looks at the signature ever on these cards.

148
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,260
-- The,
-- the only reason for signatures,

149
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:39,869
we have 500 years of case law saying

150
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,609
it's extremely illegal to forge somebody else's signature.

151
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,329
I mean, ok, it's like,

152
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,410
it's like why you can fax a document to somebody

153
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,329
but you can't scan it and email it to them.

154
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,869
Uh I think some of the laws have changed on that recently.

155
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,829
-- But I, I get your point, you
-- know, it's just, it's,

156
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,279
it's why do we do it that way because that's how we've done it for 500 years.

157
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,230
A signature, please.

158
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,679
And you know what's funny is like here, for example, you go to the post office

159
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,700
and you have to sign for your package or whatever,

160
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,739
but it's like an electronic signature.

161
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,839
But if it's like a credit card slip, they make you sign the slip,

162
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:12,600
you know. So it's, it's nothing's integrated. That's the other thing, right?

163
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:15,019
Everybody assumes technology is nice and integrated and

164
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,230
works well. No, it's like a bunch of hodgepodge

165
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,299
anyway, we've, we're in a hole. I think.

166
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,609
So, here's what I want to tell you about cash is

167
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,929
I detest cash and here is my reason why

168
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,570
I think your point about it being readily available

169
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,309
-- has a certain amount of merit.
-- It's not that it's readily available.

170
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,279
It's that you can spend it without permission.

171
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,149
-- That's the one advantage, the same
-- thing.

172
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:38,970
So

173
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,890
I I'm going to say that is a fair point.

174
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,269
But I think this is one of those instances

175
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,739
where if you put all the positives in one bucket

176
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,529
and all the negatives in another bucket or even

177
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,529
the positives of something else in the other bucket,

178
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,929
I feel like the scale tips drastically away from cash.

179
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:58,010
And the reason being, first of all, I have to go get cash,

180
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,399
which I almost never do because I don't like

181
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,829
-- computer printed out. It's annoying. Right. Exactly.
-- It waste my time.

182
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,559
I have to go to the bank or an ATM and, like, physically acquire the money.

183
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:11,869
-- Well,
-- wait, so what time out because a lot of stores here will do cash back,

184
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,730
like the grocery store, Home Depot, whatever they actually

185
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,653
prompt you. Do. You want cash back when you make a purchase?

186
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:19,692
If you use your debit card, you can do that.

187
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:22,852
But if you have a credit card, when you get a cash advance like that,

188
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:24,882
you end up getting charged a certain service fee.

189
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,553
So I'm definitely never doing that.

190
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:27,933
You guys have debit cards, right?

191
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,292
Well, yes, we have debit cards but don't use your debit card.

192
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,562
So from the risk perspective, if,

193
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:35,203
if I lose my credit card or someone steals my credit card,

194
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,635
none of that's my money. I don't care.

195
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,075
And the bank deals with it.

196
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,775
In fact, my credit card for it hasn't in a while,

197
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,364
but it used to get stolen about every couple

198
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,835
of months and I never cared because whatever they,

199
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:49,114
they overnighted me a new card and I was back in business every single time.

200
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:53,554
Now, your debit card, if you lose your debit card or someone steals your debit card

201
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,585
and they start charging things to it.

202
00:08:55,955 --> 00:09:00,554
Your money is disappearing out of your account and you have to go deal with the bank.

203
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:02,525
Usually they'll put some of it back

204
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,340
and while they're doing their investigation and

205
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,900
additionally, depending upon how the investigation turns up,

206
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,669
you could be out of some money for quite a long time.

207
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,469
And so

208
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,890
when you use a debit card,

209
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,260
you're putting a substantial amount of the risk on yourself actually,

210
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,020
versus a credit card where, where like 99% of the risk is on the bank.

211
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,419
-- And I just don't have to care.
-- This is true.

212
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,590
And I, I know locally there's, I've had,

213
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,619
I've heard some hilarious stories where people had

214
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,419
either, you know, like

215
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,739
my debit card, whenever I go to the cabin,

216
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:37,039
it, like, works in one of the towns but doesn't work in one of the smaller towns.

217
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,929
It's,

218
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:42,299
yeah, it's really bizarre. And then conversely I think, uh, a person I know.

219
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,619
Oh, I forget if it was credit card or debit card. But, like, all of a sudden, like,

220
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,900
the, the, basically the person made, like, a purchase of, like,

221
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,960
1000 bucks of alcohol at, like, two in the morning,

222
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:53,419
which would be generally out of character for this person.

223
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:56,530
And, you know, and they weren't called until tomorrow and they're like,

224
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,909
because it was actually a gas station purchase, like,

225
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,190
hundreds of miles away and they're like, oh, and there's,

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,590
there's this other charge that did, did you, you know, did you do that?

227
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:06,750
Do you, do you know about this?

228
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,849
And of course the person is like, yeah, No,

229
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:09,510
I wasn't buying alcohol at two in the morning.

230
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,150
So, the, the fraud systems to protect you against that are, yeah, they're not great.

231
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,169
And as you said, yeah, like, at least in North America legally.

232
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:18,099
Uh, what is it?

233
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:19,489
You're only legally on the hook for,

234
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,919
I think it's the 1st 50 bucks of credit

235
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,349
card fraud assuming you reported lost or stolen.

236
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,229
But, yeah, in general, all the companies are like, whatever. We don't care.

237
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,909
We want people to just use these things.

238
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,460
Yeah,

239
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:32,159
I've never paid a dime for having my card stolen and I've

240
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:35,080
had some hilarious conversations because I remember one time I was,

241
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,979
I was out for dinner

242
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,799
and I, I, you know, give the, the server my card and they come back,

243
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,429
they said it's been declined and I say, ok, well, here's, here's another one,

244
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,250
use this one

245
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,760
and then I get out of the restaurant and I call the credit card company.

246
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,520
They're like, uh, yeah, we, uh, were, were you in Washington DC or Seattle today?

247
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,359
And I said

248
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:54,960
no, they said, yeah, you've got in and, right. So, anyway, it was,

249
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:00,289
there were various charges, like I could not have traveled to the places

250
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,869
that, and I assume that's what tipped off the,

251
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,669
the fraud system is the fact that there were like, impossible charges from, uh,

252
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,059
you know.

253
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,450
-- Yeah,
-- they'll have rules like you can't move more than 500 miles an hour or whatever.

254
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,599
Right.

255
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,429
Well, this was, I,

256
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,159
I think they told me there was a purchase at a gas station in Washington DC and then

257
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,570
like a Target or something in Seattle within an hour.

258
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,609
And I definitely not me, you know.

259
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,080
But anyway, anyway, so

260
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:30,890
that, that's where I see the enormous advantage to credit cards.

261
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,140
A, a quite frankly an enormous disadvantage to a debit card.

262
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:40,210
A debit card I would use after I use cash in all seriousness in like the,

263
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,130
my hierarchy of, of spending money

264
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,599
because debit cards are, they, they come with

265
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,210
all the risks of a credit card, but they're my problem instead of the banks.

266
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:52,289
And I know, like I said,

267
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,690
I know there's a bunch of laws that I can generally get all my money back and stuff,

268
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,159
but I don't want to have to deal with that.

269
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,510
Right. So, like that, that's part of it. Now,

270
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,929
at the same time

271
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,049
with cash,

272
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,169
cash can be stolen from me.

273
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,719
I can lose cash

274
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:06,640
and

275
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,260
obviously I can't make change in my head so somebody

276
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,130
could easily be ripping me off and I wouldn't know.

277
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,849
Right. And so I see those as major disadvantages to cash.

278
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,409
Yeah.

279
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:18,229
So going to banksy,

280
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,859
one of the nice things you can do with and I have to qualify here paper money.

281
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:25,200
Not so much with like, you know, in Canada we have polymer money now.

282
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,299
Like it's plastic money.

283
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,340
-- Right.
-- Right.

284
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,710
You can rip a dollar bill or I

285
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,380
think in the case of Banksy it's a 10 pound note.

286
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:33,630
-- It's
-- a

287
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,179
-- thin
-- half, like it's, it's something he made.

288
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,140
-- No, no, no, it's, it's
-- not a real note.

289
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,719
-- It's an actual real 10 pound note. Are you
-- sure?

290
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:41,770
I thought they were fake.

291
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,190
-- They are fake.
-- They have Princess is

292
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:44,630
fake.

293
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,320
-- They're
-- fake.

294
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:46,640
Oh,

295
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,409
damn it. Well, that's,

296
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,919
that's even better.

297
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:51,320
I love that.

298
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,159
I'm annoyed now because I was gonna say one of the

299
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:56,320
one of the advantages here is you get to piggyback on

300
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,090
an organization that has already spent an obscene amount of time

301
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:01,169
and money trying to make things that are hard to fake.

302
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,320
You know, because the classic spy movie thing, right?

303
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,419
Where, how do you authenticate two people with a physical token?

304
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:06,640
They each have half a bank note

305
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,409
ripped in half and you know,

306
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,570
-- meet a dark alley and you should
-- explain there's some

307
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,919
context to this because you need to explain Banksy,

308
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,729
you need to explain pest control and you have to explain what they're doing.

309
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,070
Yeah. So Banksy is a famous British artist or possibly a collective.

310
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,729
-- I'm not 100% certain
-- graffiti artist slash criminal is

311
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:27,719
the right description here because while I love Banksy,

312
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:27,739
uh

313
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:30,530
he or she is technically breaking the law

314
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:33,580
with nearly every single art display created.

315
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,729
Uh So, yeah, anyways and so Banksy's work is quite,

316
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:39,640
quite highly valued like in the tens of millions now,

317
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,049
I believe uh especially that one painting that

318
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,919
when it was finally sold at auction, it,

319
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:46,919
it activated a shredder and tried to kill itself,

320
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:50,130
which I think is awesome, which made it only worth more money apparently.

321
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,530
But obviously authenticity of this stuff is a, is a hard problem. And

322
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:58,690
how do you authenticate something that cost $10 million?

323
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,070
Well, the answer is they have a certificate of authenticity which, you know,

324
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,140
that's totally legit.

325
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,250
Right. Couldn't fake that.

326
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,979
And then they have these

327
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,940
has it.

328
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,780
And I'm sad now it turns out these fake 10 pound notes with uh Lady Diana on them.

329
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,090
They rip them in half,

330
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,919
-- right? And so one half stays well.
-- Who's they though?

331
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:21,619
Uh oh, sorry pest control, which is the organization business entity that you know,

332
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,510
sells Banksy's work because my understanding is

333
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,109
that it is Banksy is still technically anonymous

334
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:27,840
-- now
-- to my knowledge.

335
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,359
No, like there's, there's some,

336
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,960
I've read some things where people are suggesting they know who it is.

337
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:34,429
But I think like fundamentally,

338
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,440
Banksy is anonymous for the most part and pest

339
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,030
control is like the legitimate wing of the Banksy empire

340
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:46,130
that then deals with the sale of the various paintings and works

341
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,210
and the ability to verify the real and part of Banksy.

342
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,099
And this is where those,

343
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:52,849
those bills you're talking about come into play

344
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,760
and it's quite clever what they've done.

345
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,570
So explain how this works with the,

346
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,369
the fake bills which are hilarious but explain them, please

347
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,840
so they basically rip the bill in half, which

348
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,530
means you have a physical object

349
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,059
or you have two physical objects now that

350
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,109
you can match together because faking a rip.

351
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,469
It's, it's a classic NP, hard problem in that. It's,

352
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,619
it's very easy to verify the answer once you have the answer,

353
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,979
but it's very hard to create the answer, right.

354
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,969
You know. So

355
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,349
you basically rip this thing in half and

356
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:24,849
yeah,

357
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:27,150
it's relatively easy to put the two pieces of

358
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,229
paper back together and see if they match.

359
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,549
But it would be really incredibly difficult and time consuming

360
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,710
to

361
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,030
create a fake half

362
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,650
similar to like a shaw signature on a file.

363
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:44,559
You know, you can very easily, once you have the shaw signature on the file,

364
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,820
you can very easily validate it.

365
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,369
But to create a new file, like if I give you a shaw

366
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,440
256 signature

367
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:55,479
as far as I know with quantum computing power, even that we currently have,

368
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,650
you just you can't really create a

369
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,989
valid file

370
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:00,195
for that signature

371
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:02,085
in a reasonable amount of time and effort.

372
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,125
Not for sha I mean,

373
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:07,885
this is why MD five fell because there is research done into easily creating

374
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:11,215
-- MD five
-- collisions. Was it using playstations? I think

375
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:12,734
the cell processor? I want to say

376
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,655
there might have been some early work into that.

377
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:15,924
But I mean, if we've reached a point,

378
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,195
you could probably do it on a freaking raspberry pie.

379
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:19,325
Pretty efficiently.

380
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:23,344
I mean, it's there've been some really cool research happening there and this is

381
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:27,405
so in fact, this is one of the interesting things is so sha one

382
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:30,890
you almost certainly is going to have a collision problem at some point,

383
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,119
we just have to wait for the research and the compute power to catch up.

384
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,030
But I think it's sha 256 or 512 were

385
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,809
designed in a manner that collision should not exist.

386
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,250
Well,

387
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,960
Shaw 256 is currently widely available and my

388
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:46,770
understanding is that for the quantum crypto resistant,

389
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,429
we'll just simply be moving to sha 512.

390
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:52,299
Uh that that could be, I, I don't know,

391
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:55,280
I haven't actually paid much attention in that space in a long time.

392
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,280
Yeah, it looks like mist is headed that way

393
00:16:57,469 --> 00:17:00,309
and, and right on. I mean, that seems to be the key to quantum.

394
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,150
Well, because to be blunt, what else are we gonna use?

395
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,760
Uh paper money, Kurt,

396
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,469
we'll just use paper money because quantum computers will ruin credit cards.

397
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,858
I'm gonna reel this back in for a minute because as interesting as Banksy is and we

398
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:15,880
could probably do a whole show on just some of the crazy shenanigans he or she has.

399
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,319
-- Let's, let's reset
-- again.

400
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,739
I love that we could just make stuff up about him and nobody would know

401
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,069
you're not wrong. I'll give you that anyway. Anyway.

402
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,839
So I, I wanna, if, if we're talking about money

403
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,160
I think one of the really important things to hit on is cryptocurrencies and,

404
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,119
and like Bitcoin and stuff because there are a nontrivial number of people

405
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,489
who will tell you that Cryptocurrency is the future and it's untraceable and

406
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,670
it's magic and it does whatever you want it to do because Blockchain.

407
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,069
Right.

408
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,550
Uh, how do I put this nicely? They're pretty much all wrong.

409
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,569
Like I, I just did a little, I wrote up a little thing about this

410
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,760
back.

411
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,660
Well, no, but I mean,

412
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,660
fundamentally part of the prompt too is when you say even when you just say Bitcoin,

413
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,459
what are you talking about?

414
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,439
Exactly. Right.

415
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,180
Are we talking about the kind of Bitcoin people who

416
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:04,839
actually have their own wallet with their own Bitcoin?

417
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,900
And if they want to do a transaction, they, they have to,

418
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:11,540
you know, actually find a miner that will take their transaction and blah, blah,

419
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:11,890
blah

420
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,050
or we talking about a Bitcoin holder like, well, for example,

421
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:19,459
um in Canada, I, I personally use shake pay.

422
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,800
They claim to have my Bitcoins.

423
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,380
Uh I hope they do. Uh

424
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,390
for all I know it's just a couple of guys in

425
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,079
Toronto that have my money and are never giving it back.

426
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:29,660
That's entirely possible as well.

427
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,359
But for example, um

428
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:35,130
you know, shake pay if I were to

429
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:40,209
convert my Bitcoin into uh Canadian dollars, well, shake pay is like,

430
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:40,869
cool you do that.

431
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,790
Here's your money,

432
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:42,349
right?

433
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,079
They don't actually have to do like a Bitcoin transaction because they're,

434
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,680
they're holding the Bitcoin in the wallet.

435
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:47,489
Right.

436
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,130
You know,

437
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,050
and so for example, I can get my,

438
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:55,439
I can get my Bitcoins turned back into money in theory and

439
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,810
emailed back to me in a matter of less than five minutes.

440
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,119
Whereas if I was actually holding my own wallet,

441
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,989
I'm not even sure how I would do that without

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,030
using somebody like shake pay to turn it back into,

443
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:06,260
you know,

444
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:06,689
regular

445
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:12,209
-- service.
-- I mean, so I turned Bitcoin into real money using Coinbase. I think it was

446
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,670
last year or the year before.

447
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,839
And basically the transaction to transfer coin into

448
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,619
Coinbase took like two days,

449
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,160
which was really annoying

450
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,000
because what happened was this was when Bitcoin was getting like out of control

451
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,449
and I wanted to move,

452
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,589
it was a really small amount, it was like 0.1 Bitcoins or something.

453
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,010
It was, it was a fairly trivial amount of Bitcoin and I let the client pick the

454
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,329
transaction, uh the fee, right?

455
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,040
And the fee it picked

456
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,770
was fairly low.

457
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,525
And then all of a sudden all the fees like shot through the roof.

458
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:52,685
And here's the other trick to Bitcoin is once

459
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:55,645
you have a transaction sitting in the mem pool,

460
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:58,015
which is like the magic ethereal place

461
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,244
your transactions go before they're accepted.

462
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:05,234
Uh You basically can't get them back out without taking extraordinary steps

463
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:07,885
and I wasn't willing to do that because part of those extraordinary

464
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:08,535
expire,

465
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,719
uh, eventually they will age out

466
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,089
with, but it takes like weeks to age out.

467
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:14,729
So there

468
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,790
is a time out. But it's, it's absurdly long.

469
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,640
Right. Right.

470
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,650
And so my assumption was just, well,

471
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,199
I'll just wait weeks and eventually somebody picked it up and it went through

472
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,119
and then

473
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,280
I, I turned

474
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,140
my Bitcoin into real money and then I transferred my real money to me and like, yes,

475
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,949
I have $50 from Bitcoin and then I claimed it on my taxes and the IRS never called me.

476
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,760
So I assume I did it right. But no, for real, there's

477
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:41,089
outside of a service like that. If you have Bitcoin,

478
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,530
-- uh there's nothing you can do
-- off topic.

479
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,250
But what happens if I do the minimum,

480
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,199
my understanding of the minimum transaction yet?

481
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,010
So here it is

482
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:53,189
0.00000546. Bitcoin.

483
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:56,540
Can't you just fill up the men pool with a pile of garbage and mess it up?

484
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,430
Yeah, you totally could. And the main pool is fairly small.

485
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,189
It's only like 500 megabytes or something like that.

486
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:05,224
And yeah, it's definitely a plausible attack

487
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:08,505
except that attack would actually cost you real money. Well, no, you could just,

488
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:12,094
-- no, it would cost you real money because the, the miners fees, not
-- necessarily.

489
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,545
Here's the other part of it though is there's no reason you

490
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:18,744
couldn't just fill up the m pool with transactions that have zero

491
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,064
coins as a transaction fee.

492
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,969
So there's definitely some attacks you can do against this and I'm not

493
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:27,280
going to get into all the details because I don't totally understand it.

494
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,130
But, but basically yes, a malicious person could totally hose the M

495
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,540
pool.

496
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,849
Yeah, because from what I've looked at Bitcoin and, and most cryptocurrencies,

497
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,689
they're surprisingly fragile against these types of,

498
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,869
I guess you could call it like layer seven attacks.

499
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:41,680
You know,

500
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:43,849
you actually start exploding the logic of

501
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:46,209
the system and how it handles transactions.

502
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,410
Right. Right. Yeah, there's definitely some shenanigans that one can do.

503
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,880
-- Oh,
-- did you hear the recent thing about the Ethereum? The terrible wallets?

504
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,650
Well, the, the you can choose your own

505
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:01,689
number for like your key. Now you should

506
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:03,390
have a computer,

507
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,189
generate a suit like a good cryptographically secure pseudorandom number,

508
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,790
right. For that,

509
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,349
you know,

510
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,189
key.

511
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,589
But apparently some people pick like one

512
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,380
totally random.

513
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,849
And so, yeah, apparently what's happening is because if you can guess the secret,

514
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:19,229
you can hijack that wallet.

515
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,130
Like that's kind of the point, right?

516
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,510
You have the private key, you have the wallet, that's

517
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,050
the whole premise of these things.

518
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,609
And so what's interesting in this article is

519
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:29,290
not only that people have chosen bad key values

520
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:33,390
and had their wallet stolen, but if you choose a bad key value and put it on chain,

521
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,030
it's gone in seconds apparently.

522
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:37,750
And there's more than one actor doing this

523
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,750
Yeah, I saw that they, they traced kind of,

524
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,510
most of the emptying of these accounts to a handful of other, I guess account holders

525
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:48,349
and at,

526
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,410
at the high point they figure

527
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,770
the money they've stolen is worth about 50 million US D

528
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:54,650
which is,

529
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,329
that's,

530
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,599
-- that's pretty wild right there.
-- That's, that's not bad. Well, it's the classic.

531
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:01,369
Well, no, I wouldn't.

532
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,099
It's not even the Superman attack because some of these

533
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:05,219
walls probably had a decent amount of money in them.

534
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:09,729
But, um, see, this is what really worries me about cryptocurrencies is that

535
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,959
with regular money, depending on the circumstances.

536
00:23:13,969 --> 00:23:16,189
Even with actual physical money, you can,

537
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,469
if it somehow gets lost or destroyed, you can, you can sometimes get it back.

538
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:23,000
So, for example, like through insurance or,

539
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,319
uh, well, you know, you have your deposit,

540
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:28,319
you deposit your money in a bank and their FDIC insured in the US.

541
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:29,910
Right. So, if the bank burns down,

542
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,280
it's not like, oh, your money's gone, sorry, or if the bank even goes bankrupt,

543
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,670
you know, you, you get up to, what is,

544
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,199
I think 250,000 in the US or 200 grand or something.

545
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,920
Anyway, there's some, like, cut off.

546
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,780
It's quite a bit though.

547
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:45,650
Yeah. Well, for, for the majority of us working poor that it's not gonna, you know,

548
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:49,979
and I know that there is actually a thing for working poor and it's pretty grim.

549
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:52,359
But, yeah, most of us don't have 200 grand in the bank,

550
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,199
right. That's what gets me about these cryptocurrencies is,

551
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:57,969
you know, if you lose that private wallet, like that guy that throw

552
00:23:58,094 --> 00:23:59,954
the hard drive with like 5000 Bitcoins on it.

553
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:04,354
And so yeah, I'm the other problem is the,

554
00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:08,505
the the transaction speed and volume capability, right.

555
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,744
We've talked about this before you dumped

556
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:11,834
all the Bitcoin transactions into your elastic.

557
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:13,964
And how many total transactions were there? Roughly?

558
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:18,765
Uh it's a hair over 400 million right now, like 402 million give or take.

559
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:20,224
So they've

560
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,785
actually done

561
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:24,369
one day of visa transactions.

562
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:25,939
Right. Right. Yeah,

563
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,270
like, yeah, here we go 65,000

564
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,869
plus transactions per second.

565
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,109
And that's just visa,

566
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,729
right? There's Mastercard, there's Amex, there's

567
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:37,150
discover, there's

568
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,189
good Lord. There's I mean,

569
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,739
yeah,

570
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,540
yeah, when people say, oh, Bitcoin will destroy the banking industry, no,

571
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,699
Bitcoin won't now Blockchain will Blockchain absolutely will be sort of the new,

572
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,050
I think data fundamental primitive

573
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:56,780
that we base a lot of the new technology on just like http hate the world,

574
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:58,979
right?

575
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:04,819
And, and I think that's the an apt comparison because http by itself is nothing

576
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,859
as Blockchain by itself is nothing. It's all up to implementation.

577
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,670
Well, and, and the things that you wrap around it, right?

578
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,540
Like with our certification thing, we're using Blockchain as an immutable ledger.

579
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,140
Cool.

580
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,459
And we're not keeping people's data in it.

581
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:20,319
We're keeping just validation records in it. So that

582
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:24,449
for example, when you know, you have a GDPR request to forget it's, well, no problem.

583
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,030
We didn't put your data there, it's not

584
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:27,390
there. We just,

585
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,349
we don't, you know,

586
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:31,839
it's public so we didn't really, we didn't want it there. And

587
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,849
so there, there are technologies.

588
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:35,780
Well, like you said, like http, first of all,

589
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,319
you're going to need stuff like encryption and hashes and validation,

590
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,859
you're also going to need much higher level things like,

591
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,410
well, you know, in http we have javascript

592
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,410
and in the Blockchain, we're gonna, we're gonna have smart contracts. And

593
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,849
I'll be blunt right now again,

594
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:52,089
smart contracts terrify me because these people are like, oh,

595
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,650
we'll just replace all this

596
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,250
programming and business and process logic for the smart contract.

597
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,040
And it's like, ok, well, number one, the, the,

598
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,989
the smart contract is software so it will have software flaws.

599
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,170
And number two

600
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,689
logic and business process flaws,

601
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,829
like there's a reason lawyers charge a lot of money to write contracts.

602
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,670
Right.

603
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,469
Because

604
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,410
you know,

605
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,180
there's that famous Canadian court case between a telecom provider and a

606
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:20,949
telecom infrastructure owner where it boiled down to the placement of a comma

607
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,069
and that comma was worth several million dollars.

608
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,170
It was whether or not they had to pay to put the, the, the lines on the polls,

609
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,959
if they had to pay extra,

610
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:31,540
if that was included with something they'd previously done or something.

611
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:32,280
Right.

612
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,219
Right. And, and now wasn't, I think it was a theorem that had the smart contract

613
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:37,520
h

614
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,619
where somebody basically set it up. So it kept transferring

615
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:44,280
uh, money to their account anyways.

616
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,839
The point is the thee was like, you know,

617
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:49,900
that thing we never said we do where we said we'd never, ever, ever like

618
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,380
change transactions or roll back transactions or fork, do a hard fork for bla

619
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:55,910
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

620
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:57,040
Yeah, that was neat.

621
00:26:57,229 --> 00:27:03,069
You know. So that's the other thing is despite all of this, oh, you know, 51% attack.

622
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,219
Well, no, actually a 51% attack is actually quite

623
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,810
possible in, in some circumstances.

624
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:11,449
Now, it's not going to be as simple as somebody getting 51% of the mining and

625
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:13,530
hijacking it. But for example, if,

626
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,550
you know, if a second Mount gawks were to happen

627
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,369
in Bitcoin World would Bitcoin roll it back and

628
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,979
declare a shenanigans do over.

629
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,310
I don't think so.

630
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:24,800
I

631
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:25,479
don't think,

632
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:27,619
-- I
-- don't think it would happen

633
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,260
because, yeah, the miners,

634
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,140
there's enough miners that simply wouldn't let it happen.

635
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,270
But, but it's possible

636
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,380
and there's no regulatory oversight and

637
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:35,719
I,

638
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,640
and I get it, that's part of the benefit of this

639
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,400
is that there's no regulatory oversight of the system,

640
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,189
-- you know?
-- Right.

641
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,339
But

642
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,869
for myself wanting to keep my money in something like that, that's,

643
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,630
I'm definitely not putting all my money there.

644
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,130
And there's another really important thing.

645
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,790
I think people sometimes forget about smart contracts specifically is

646
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:02,119
a lot of these smart contract systems are being touted as turn

647
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:05,920
complete and turn complete is just kind of a computer programming term.

648
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,099
That means you can,

649
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:10,390
you can write a program that can basically do anything you can think of.

650
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,510
But here's the problem is

651
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:17,089
if something is turning complete, it's also impossible to secure.

652
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,459
Because obviously, if you have a essentially a state, a

653
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,530
state machine

654
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,170
that can do anything,

655
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:27,089
you can't secure that because the possibilities are infinite and

656
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:29,550
we can only secure a finite number of things.

657
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:32,930
And, and I know some of them even include polymorphic code and stuff.

658
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:36,949
So they actually are explicitly like very powerful systems.

659
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:40,329
And yeah, I mean, it's just, there's no bound on what the system can do.

660
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,260
So yeah, securing that system.

661
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,420
That's a tricky one.

662
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:47,660
-- And by tricky, I mean, basically impossible.
-- OK. So, so let's do this.

663
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,449
I'm, if I was gonna rank

664
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,569
my financial vehicles of choice,

665
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,810
I'm gonna say credit card number one,

666
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:58,260
cash would be my number two.

667
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:00,709
I would put a debit card as my number three and I

668
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:04,890
would put Bitcoin last because while I think Bitcoin is amusing and,

669
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:07,599
and enjoyable to be a part of,

670
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:12,270
I don't view it at this point as being a serious financial vehicle.

671
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,250
Yeah, I mean, well, it's like the web back in 95 to 99

672
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,410
you could put your apps

673
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:19,969
online via web.

674
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:21,380
But No, you, most people,

675
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,969
you did classic client server type stuff because the web just wasn't ready for it.

676
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,089
And now here we are. And I literally,

677
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:29,609
I spend much more time, you know,

678
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:32,229
doing word processing and doing spreadsheet stuff in

679
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,920
Google Docs than I do in Microsoft Office.

680
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,989
Well, in fact,

681
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,680
I, I just ran into something yesterday

682
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,520
where

683
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,520
I was,

684
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,300
it was some product that wanted me to download their client.

685
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:47,219
And I was like, no, I'm not doing that. You know, I'm gonna, if it's not a

686
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,160
page now, just, no, I'm not,

687
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,130
I'm not interested in installing your piece

688
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,329
of garbage software that's going to overwrite.

689
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:56,430
Who knows what on my system. Just, just, no, I don't want to do that.

690
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,349
For me,

691
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,550
it would be credit cards first and one of the biggest reasons

692
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,010
would be is if I buy something large and they don't deliver

693
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,420
the darn thing I can get my money back real easy from

694
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,849
the credit card company and actually have that happen with a couch.

695
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:10,079
Uh Second, I would say debit card, but that's because I live in Canada

696
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,390
and third cash and Bitcoin would be a very,

697
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:19,969
to me. Bitcoin is not a practical currency.

698
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:23,750
It's more of an investment vehicle or product,

699
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,500
right at this point. It's just part of it is just

700
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,069
it,

701
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:27,900
ironically,

702
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,660
I don't think Bitcoin is liquid enough because when you

703
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,510
look at how long it takes for transactions to happen,

704
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,310
uh I don't think you could consider it liquid at all.

705
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,270
Just given the amount of time it takes to turn Bitcoin into money.

706
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,250
It's also very, very thinly traded. That is to say

707
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:45,770
like if you look at the daily Bitcoin volume,

708
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,479
something like 80 or 90% of that is Bitcoin washing.

709
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:50,390
So it's people just tumbling Bitcoins back and

710
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,339
forth to make them less traceable because it

711
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,569
turns up Bitcoin ain't anonymous at all.

712
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:56,260
It's fully traceable, you know,

713
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,280
and heck you have every Bitcoin transaction in a giant graph network database,

714
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:00,569
right?

715
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,189
I cannot trace transactions though. It's actually complicated to trace them.

716
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,310
-- So what ends up happening is
-- complicated but not

717
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,920
impossible. It is not impossible.

718
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,160
And you have to be watching the men

719
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:14,094
because that's where you have to figure out who put a transaction in place.

720
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:17,214
What was their IP address? But like I don't have any IP addresses in my

721
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:20,474
-- data, the ledger itself. No IP S
-- but it's thinly traded.

722
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:22,275
So the actual daily volume,

723
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:24,854
the majority of that volume is actually kind of I don't want to say fake volume,

724
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:26,324
but it's not like actual

725
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:30,744
transactions involving exchange of value between like a buyer and a seller.

726
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,964
It's just people moving their money around to make it harder to trace.

727
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,994
And so when you look at the actual number of Bitcoins being like

728
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,420
converted from like people buying into Bitcoin or

729
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,150
people selling their Bitcoins and getting out,

730
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:43,609
that's an incredibly small number.

731
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:46,770
And so, you know, there's that paper basically looking at the, um, the ramp,

732
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,250
the Bitcoin ramp up to $20,000 back in 2018.

733
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,489
And, you know,

734
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,670
saying quite convincingly looking at the data and it looks like essentially it

735
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,680
was one person or one small pool of speculators that drove that up.

736
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:01,729
I believe it because it crashed hard when it came down. Yeah.

737
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,130
What was that? There was a Bitcoin

738
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,459
uh themed cruise

739
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:07,140
that,

740
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,949
or was it a Bitcoin conference?

741
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:12,089
Either way they, they weren't taking payments in Bitcoins because the,

742
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,359
between the time it takes to convert Bitcoins into money and the time

743
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,589
and the, the, the, the fluctuation in the value

744
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:22,030
they, you know, it, you just can't get paid

745
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:22,989
sensibly.

746
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:29,160
-- Yes. That, that I think is very telling if, if that is the case. So
-- I think even New E

747
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,400
stopped taking Bitcoin.

748
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,609
They were taking Bitcoin for a while and

749
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,479
then they had to stop because the fluctuations.

750
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:36,530
Yeah, I believe that. I would not doubt it. So.

751
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,209
All right, man, I think we should call it, I guess in summary.

752
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:42,810
Just, yeah, bury, bury your money in the yard. That's probably the best bet

753
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:44,994
if it's plastic notes, if it's

754
00:32:45,104 --> 00:32:45,685
right.

755
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:50,474
That's true. That's true. My, my US paper money. Well, I guess cloth, whatever.

756
00:32:50,484 --> 00:32:51,324
I don't know, whatever it is.

757
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:52,935
Cotton. Sure.

758
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:54,555
I thought it was denim or whatever.

759
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:55,994
I, I have no idea.

760
00:32:56,094 --> 00:32:59,334
Who knows there and they change it all the time too.

761
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,165
It's probably made of like shaven yak here or something at this point. I have no idea.

762
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,319
Whatever they, they change it. They, they get rid of the counterfeiters.

763
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,880
So they say uh so anyway, anyway, I'm calling it.

764
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,290
