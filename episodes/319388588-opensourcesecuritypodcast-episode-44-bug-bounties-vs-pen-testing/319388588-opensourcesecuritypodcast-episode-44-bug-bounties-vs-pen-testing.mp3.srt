Hello and welcome to episode 44 of the open source security podcast

1
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:12,149
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,069
How are you today? Kurt?

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,340
-- I'm doing pretty good. We had a LEGO party last night. What
-- a LEGO party.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,459
Yeah, we invited friends over to play LEGO

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,610
-- and drink.
-- That sounds awesome. I've never done that. That

6
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,799
I, I've, I'm, I've clearly,

7
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:29,620
I've been missing something important in my life and that might be it.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,290
So, here's a question though is if you have adults playing LEGO,

9
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,110
not LEGOS, LEGO

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,630
and uh they're drinking as well. Uh How much fighting was there over the uh

11
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:46,189
one by four piece that everybody needs.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,389
Well, funnily enough,

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,959
we didn't actually end up really playing with the LEGO mostly just a

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,909
big pile of mini figs and making up a big battle scene because

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,799
like I, so for those of you who don't know that don't know,

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,459
I have just over 100 pounds of regular Lego.

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:00,909
So needless to say

18
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:01,470
I

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,940
bought it online used before my kids were born.

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,339
-- It was about eight years ago when you could get this stuff cheap.
-- Ok.

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,699
-- And now you can't get it cheap because
-- people know what it's worth. It's

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,290
-- really expensive.
-- Yeah.

23
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:16,050
But I was buying the stuff used online for typically around 8 to $10 a pound,

24
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:16,819
including shipping.

25
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,680
Um, new sets are around 40 bucks a pound. It works out too.

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,699
Uh, but anyways, yeah, so we have like, several 100 mini figs,

27
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,639
some really cool ones too.

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,589
Like going back, you know, 1020 years.

29
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:33,059
And so, yeah, we basically just had like this sort of giant Mad Max Spaceman

30
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:38,199
-- Castle battle scene thing going on.
-- And, and how many pieces did you step on?

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,949
Uh Basically zero. I have developed lego radar.

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,199
Lego radar.

33
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,279
Yeah. Also it's uh when, when the lego is out, I, I walk differently.

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,300
I sort of like sweep my feet rather than sta

35
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,419
I, I know, I know exactly what you mean.

36
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,620
It only works on hardwood though. If you have rugs.

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,389
-- Well, you're up the,
-- if you're, if you're on a rug,

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,319
it doesn't hurt as much either if you step on it because a certain amount of

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,889
the Lego goes into the rug and the rest of it goes into your foot.

40
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:06,830
The,

41
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:11,779
the problem I find with rug though is it tends to go down at a diagonal angle.

42
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,419
So then you get the sharp end sticking up, right? Whereas on hardwood,

43
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,500
the Lego tends to lie flat.

44
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,860
I won't lie.

45
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,240
I don't know.

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,699
So, anyway,

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,919
uh you know, though, I, I oftentimes think that there are some lessons for us all in,

48
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:27,679
in LEGO.

49
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:28,860
My son

50
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,160
has many LEGO sets

51
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,270
and a LEGO set is incredibly expensive and some of

52
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,149
them are more than $100 for the things he has.

53
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,470
And do you know what he does? He builds them.

54
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,789
Well, usually I help and I, he suckers me to doing most of the work.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,110
But, but anyway, so the, the set gets built.

56
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,149
It is sometimes played with for a short period of time and then

57
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,029
it is torn apart and put in the box at which point it's

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,190
why somebody bought this for you child. And,

59
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:00,070
and, and I'm torn though because on one side,

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,369
somebody paid a whole lot of money for a Lego set that is now pieces

61
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,710
and on the other side, like what do you expect?

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,300
They're LEGO, it's just how it is, right?

63
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,229
Yeah. See my rules. I don't

64
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,029
uh I do glue some of my LEGO sets together,

65
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,779
uh usually vehicles because they have a tendency to kind of get exploded and

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,149
especially in the large amount of LEGO, I have, they're gone forever.

67
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,229
Um So I do glue some of the smaller vehicles together.

68
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,570
And the trick there is you use Acetone paint, both sides of the legal piece.

69
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,649
Wait about a second and then smoke it together and then you go

70
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,860
like you, you take

71
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:35,589
Acetone and you just paint the plastic and then obviously assume it melts a little

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,089
-- bit and then
-- exactly what you really want to use is methyl lethal ketone Mek.

73
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,809
But, um, thanks to methamphetamine production,

74
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,139
that stuff is incredibly difficult to get a hold of. Now. There's all sorts

75
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:46,970
of paperwork.

76
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,380
Yeah,

77
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,360
that's like when I need cold medicine and I feel like some sort of criminal when they,

78
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:52,130
-- like,
-- looking at a

79
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:52,800
veteran

80
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:52,940
in

81
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,130
it.

82
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,860
-- Oh, man,
-- I hate that. Right.

83
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,360
It's one of the precursors for meth.

84
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:57,330
Um, yeah.

85
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:01,190
so you just, yeah, you just, I, I get a bottle of Acetone at Home Depot, you know,

86
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,039
like once every couple of years,

87
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,970
uh pour a little bit of it into like a ceramic dish.

88
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,259
Obviously, if you put in a plastic, they should start to melt minor.

89
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,190
And um and then you just use like a small cheap

90
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,949
paint brush just to paint both sides and like I said,

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,179
just press it together.

92
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,970
The trick is you got to paint both sides

93
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,029
and also

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,869
you definitely want to wear uh like nitro gloves because that stuff

95
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,790
because the plastic melts a little bit and then it gets

96
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,390
on your skin and it's just incredibly annoying to clean off.

97
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,670
I can, I can see that

98
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,700
nice, very cool.

99
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,649
Um So

100
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:34,920
although I must say he uh my son got

101
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:39,019
the Millennium Falcon and the uh Star Destroyer Lego sets

102
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,720
and apart from the incredible cost of these,

103
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,609
I said these are too cool to take apart and I put shelves really high in

104
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,140
his bedroom so he can't reach them and then I put them on the shelves.

105
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,109
So II I feel like a bad parent for doing that.

106
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,480
But I think it, it's for the good of humanity that I did it.

107
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,769
Well, it's like my one son wants the Lego Simpsons house and the Lego Simpsons,

108
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:58,260
Quickie Mart.

109
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,179
And those are both like $300 sets.

110
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,850
What,

111
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:05,109
-- how big are they?
-- They're really quite big. They're, they're really quite nice.

112
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:06,209
Um

113
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,779
Why do you let your kids watch the Simpsons? Your kids are like six.

114
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:10,279
What's

115
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,579
wrong with

116
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:10,839
you?

117
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:11,320
On

118
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:14,600
the? No, they, they've actually never seen the Simpsons.

119
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:19,260
What they have seen is Lego ST Motion Simpsons on youtube? Ok. Ok.

120
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,380
Right. So he wants that and it's like no

121
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:21,910
abs,

122
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:24,809
I'm sorry, buddy. Like I'm, I'm not spending 600 bucks on Legos

123
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,149
for

124
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:25,450
him,

125
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,500
you know, especially when he has like a pretty good collection of lego to play with.

126
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,980
-- I,
-- I totally get it. Well and it's like typical kids.

127
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:34,959
There'll be some new shiny thing in a couple of weeks and that'll be fine then. Right.

128
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,579
So now that we've talked about something nice and

129
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:40,269
made everybody happy and nostalgic for their childhood.

130
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,029
Should we talk about something that will make everybody angry?

131
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,750
Yeah, we should probably fill them with rage because that's fun.

132
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,790
Ok.

133
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,209
Well, I guess, yeah, you lead off because you brought,

134
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,329
I'll bring it up.

135
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,000
So by the time this,

136
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,750
this podcast is out a blog post I've written is going to be published and

137
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,079
I'm making the argument

138
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,209
that

139
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:03,670
pen testing

140
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,750
in the near future is going to be replaced with bug bounties.

141
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,880
And I made the suggestion of this on Twitter.

142
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,000
And you know, a number of people, like, like they were clearly annoyed

143
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,369
by this statement

144
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,410
which tells me I'm clearly onto something, right.

145
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,829
It's the old saying that if nobody's upset with something you're doing,

146
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,130
you're not doing anything interesting.

147
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:26,769
And

148
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,339
I will explain the story behind what really got me to thinking this way is,

149
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,320
uh, at

150
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:37,470
work, there have been a handful of individuals I I've been dealing with, we're,

151
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,950
we're kind of

152
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,850
someone shows up with a pest

153
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,230
report and will say something like fix it,

154
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,339
right?

155
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,130
And these things have like literally thousands of crap

156
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,209
issues that you aren't going to actually fix,

157
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,869
which then really got me thinking about.

158
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,649
But a typical P test and

159
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,239
every time I've dealt with them in the past,

160
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:57,700
I'd say a normal pen test report actually results in what,

161
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,700
maybe three or four real fixes

162
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:00,500
maybe,

163
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:03,489
right? It's very small. And that got me thinking then

164
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,399
what are you paying per bug? Right? Because

165
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:07,890
the thing is when you do a pen test,

166
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,589
people generally think about kind of cost per

167
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,649
issue found is what most people think about.

168
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,730
But I got to thinking

169
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,899
what about cost per issue fixed?

170
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,209
Because just because the pest

171
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,140
has 15,000 findings in it,

172
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,040
you're not gonna fix 15,000 findings. I mean, that's just the reality of it.

173
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,769
Ok.

174
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,489
And, and I, I don't think anyone's going to disagree with that. Right.

175
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:28,410
Well, unless it's some sort of automated thing, like, um,

176
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,290
you know, I, I, for example, Google with their fuzzing, you know, project,

177
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,630
uh, has also, then, you know, with chrome,

178
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,959
at least kind of automated part of the fixing of that.

179
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,809
But I mean, that's,

180
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,299
that is a very much, you know,

181
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:43,940
way out in left field corner case that is basically proves that

182
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,140
you're right because there's only one person on the planet doing it.

183
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:47,549
Well, in,

184
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,670
in Google is special and I'm also not talking about kind of

185
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,670
internal pen testing because I think an internal P test group can provide

186
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,269
significant value

187
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,869
due to the fact that they have access and knowledge that other people want.

188
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,739
Because let's face it when you show up to do a pen test,

189
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,609
you don't want them to spend a month getting familiar

190
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,369
with their product because you're gonna pay for that,

191
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,220
right? You want to hand them something,

192
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,750
have them do their pen test

193
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,630
and they get the results back, right? That's kind of the reality of that.

194
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:18,320
And then that can be kind of thinking about the context of a bug bounty is

195
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,519
if you're only going to fix three issues,

196
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:23,600
why are you paying for this huge pen test when

197
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,010
something like a a good bug bounty

198
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,209
could potentially get you those three issues for a fraction of the cost.

199
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:30,880
Right.

200
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:31,679
Yeah.

201
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,440
Well, I think a lot of this boils down to so historically,

202
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,380
security knowledge was difficult.

203
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:37,359
I mean,

204
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:38,650
we

205
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,349
led,

206
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,530
well, it, but for,

207
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,039
well, sort of, but for example, pen testing

208
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,450
used to be like, only, you know, a

209
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,830
very small handful of people knew anything about pen testing, let alone how to do it.

210
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,200
Well, And now if you look at, say the OAS

211
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,539
project, they actually have a really good pen testing document

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,109
that describes how to do it. And like, what the top 10 or 20 things to look for are,

213
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,900
you know, they have a list of tools how to use them, you know, like, basically

214
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,440
what was like the top of the line pen test, you know,

215
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,320
five or six years ago or maybe 10 years ago is now like a nice document

216
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,520
and you can walk pretty much anybody through it, you know,

217
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,659
just like setting up an email server used to be

218
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:23,119
like, do you remember the days where if you knew how to do routing,

219
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,950
you can make over 100 grand a year, just like configuring c

220
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,710
-- routers.
-- You know, I do remember those days and, and

221
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:32,580
funny enough is, is we'll take a side note. Here is

222
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:34,090
a long time ago.

223
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:38,330
If you were willing to be a Cisco tech support person,

224
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,030
you would get all of your Cisco certifications for free.

225
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,739
And I knew a number of people who went to Cisco

226
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:46,219
and they became like telephone support

227
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,250
to get all in, like, they're the smartest people I knew.

228
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,169
And so Cisco had an amazing tech support program

229
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,989
because they had all these crazy, smart people who didn't want to shell out.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,650
I mean, it was tens of thousands of dollars to get all these certifications.

231
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:00,109
Right.

232
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,200
So they go to Cisco work tech support for a couple of years,

233
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,049
get all these certifications and then go make like literally

234
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,000
five or six times as much money in the,

235
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,914
in the, in the industry as they were making answering phones at Cisco, which was,

236
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:15,315
I mean, but at the same time I get it right, because Cisco got a huge benefit for a, in,

237
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,955
in a variety of ways out of this.

238
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,765
But anyway, anyway, sorry, back to security.

239
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:19,885
Well, yeah, so back to this.

240
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:23,424
I mean, the reality is, you know, stuff that used to be crazy, difficult,

241
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:26,304
hard is like now entry level knowledge,

242
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:27,559
you know,

243
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:31,280
um and pen testing isn't there quite yet. But for example,

244
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,440
you know, while talking about these, you know, huge numbers of pen test results,

245
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:38,010
like the one thing I always consistently see is people run NUS

246
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:38,979
or N

247
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,390
I or how we pronounce it against the product,

248
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:43,200
you know, and there's a couple of things

249
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:43,429
nus

250
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,479
consistently finds and

251
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,179
they complain about it and you know, these are trivial things like

252
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,119
that just don't matter.

253
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,000
Or they can just, you know,

254
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,440
they can be configured away very trivially in almost every software product.

255
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:55,599
And

256
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:59,969
so, you know, the, the, I think part of it is the, the majority of

257
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,030
companies, um, on the operation side,

258
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,659
you know, they're not really all that strong security wise,

259
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,940
like they don't have good security people typically.

260
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,609
Um, and, you know, most software vendors, um, that I've ever dealt with,

261
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,130
you know, just trying to report a security problem to them, let alone

262
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,080
them having a good security person or team,

263
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,530
you know, it is very rare, right? So I think,

264
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,150
-- but, but this is actually you touch
-- on this is how we ended up in this.

265
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,880
But what I'm trying to get at is this is kind of how we ended up in this mess where,

266
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,700
you know, there's a, let's face it in pen testing.

267
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,179
There's a lot of snake oil salesmen,

268
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,299
you know, I've, I've seen pest reports complaining about, you know,

269
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,130
insecure storage of credit card numbers

270
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,090
when it's like,

271
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:43,280
but the product doesn't do any form of that at all or take any

272
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:47,090
-- payments or anything if
-- I was gonna guess they put that on every report,

273
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,510
right?

274
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,169
-- It's an easy thing to add. Yeah,
-- or we've literally had like,

275
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,880
you know, cross site scripting results in this page and we're like,

276
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,530
there's no page there

277
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:57,880
like,

278
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,380
you know, so just basic stuff like I, I

279
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,460
the quality of a lot of these reports is, is

280
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,219
quite honestly from what I've seen on the being on the receiving

281
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,900
-- some of these, it's not
-- very good.

282
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,679
I, I won't disagree with that, but I also don't want to dwell on that point because

283
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,919
the, the people who are,

284
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:18,219
are now furiously shaking their fists at their computer screen

285
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,200
are gonna

286
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:19,390
be

287
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:23,190
good people. And that's the thing right. There are people who are good at this.

288
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,520
And so I, I'm happy to acknowledge

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,250
that the people who are good at this are

290
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,820
very good at it and they provide immense value.

291
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:32,419
Right.

292
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:34,859
And, and no one can deny that.

293
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,539
Oh, yeah. No, I, I had one p test report done by a very competent person,

294
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:42,950
you know, and, and what they came up with resulted in, like,

295
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,880
I think it was between half a dozen and a dozen CV ES,

296
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,770
you know,

297
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,320
and, and this, but, you know, this is, again, this person is very much a

298
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,630
corner case in the industry, you know, they, they're very, very good at what they do.

299
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,710
Um,

300
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,789
you know, and, but part of the problem there is is, you know,

301
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,750
there's a very finite number of those people.

302
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,229
There's filler. Right. Yeah, basically.

303
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:06,500
No, no, there's, there's more.

304
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,460
But, but anyway, I,

305
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:12,159
I want to go back to a point you had that I think is really important and this is

306
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,119
going to be one of the problems with the bug bounty industry

307
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,479
is let's face it.

308
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:18,280
The,

309
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:20,650
the real purpose of a bug bounty for many people

310
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:23,280
is to help raise their public profile right there,

311
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:24,150
there is money

312
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,239
without a doubt.

313
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,789
But it, I, I see a couple of advantages here.

314
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,429
If you're the company participating,

315
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,140
you obviously get a certain amount of press saying, look at us, we do a bug bounty.

316
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,739
We care about security, which is very true and deserved.

317
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,510
And then the researchers obviously can say, look at me,

318
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,820
I found a bunch of neat bugs in this bug bounty program, aren't I neat?

319
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,320
And, and yes, yes, you are

320
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,109
so good job. But

321
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:48,409
here's the problem is what happens if you're a company

322
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,690
that's relatively small and has a very boring product.

323
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:55,830
Is anyone gonna want to do a bug bounty on your product?

324
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,890
Well, I, uh, ok. I'm just blanking.

325
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,929
What is that name of that email server that was written by?

326
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,640
I think it was Daniel J Bernstein.

327
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:04,599
Q,

328
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,559
right. Q

329
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,729
yeah. Do you remember for the longest time people would say basically Q

330
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,900
was more secure than send mail the postfix because,

331
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:15,510
and I quote Daniel J Bernstein had a $500 bounty for bugs found in it.

332
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,250
Ok. Do you remember that?

333
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,940
-- I do like he, he still has a bug bounty and all this stuff, doesn't he?
-- No.

334
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,359
And yeah, and, and now, ok,

335
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:24,960
and again in fairness D GB is like one

336
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:27,349
of the best software security guys on the planet.

337
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:30,320
But my point is more that people basically said

338
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:34,010
this, their logic train was, he's offered a $500 bug bounty.

339
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,940
Therefore, his product is more secure because he, like stands behind it.

340
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,570
And I think that's one of the big aspects of, of, uh,

341
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,270
bug bounties that, you know,

342
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,989
these large companies will use it to sort of signal security virtue

343
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,049
because let's face it right.

344
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,340
If, if a company says, you know, we're actually gonna stand by in our product and say,

345
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,270
like, if you find a bad flaw it, we'll give you like

346
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,690
10 grand or whatever,

347
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,469
you know, that,

348
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:57,200
that does kind of give me a little bit more confidence

349
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,510
in them in their process than somebody who does nothing.

350
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,809
I don't follow that line of reasoning though.

351
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,270
When I see a company has a bug bounty, I think it means

352
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,880
we understand

353
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,429
our software has bugs and

354
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,770
we would like you to tell us about them

355
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,090
and we promise not to sue you and if it's really good, we'll also give you some money.

356
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:20,590
Well, yeah, exactly. They're signaling virtue in security like that.

357
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:22,619
You know, they're not gonna, like,

358
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,520
be mean to you and that they hopefully also have a

359
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,219
way to deal with these bug bounties like the result.

360
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:33,979
But I, I don't interpret this is, um, suggesting there's a higher quality in any way.

361
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,750
I, well, from what I've seen of some of these, you know,

362
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,450
service providers and stuff there has definitely been, you know,

363
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:42,090
some of that going on for some of them, not all of them.

364
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,659
Um, it's possible,

365
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:47,419
I will also say that I suspect if you're involved in something like this,

366
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,599
you're probably going to improve

367
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,760
eventually

368
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,390
because you're going to have people finding things. And

369
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,799
if you keep making the same mistake over and over again,

370
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,280
I'd hope somebody starts asking questions internally of, you know,

371
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,090
why do we keep doing this?

372
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:06,080
Why have you fixed the same bug in 12 different places and pay 12 different people?

373
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,159
Well,

374
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:10,489
what I've also noticed is people who have bug boundaries kind of have to deal

375
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,289
with it because otherwise the reporters get

376
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:14,130
really angry because they want their money.

377
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:15,650
Right. So, I mean,

378
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,059
you know,

379
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:16,280
makes

380
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:16,650
sense

381
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,090
and there's been cases of that in the past where these reporters have gone public,

382
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:20,609
you know,

383
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:24,750
with these companies that haven't paid out the bug bounty or have, you know,

384
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,210
essentially waffled on it or, you know, done other shenanigans,

385
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,469
shall we say to avoid?

386
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,530
It's really funny. I totally agree with that.

387
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:35,250
And I was talking, I, I, I'm talking to hacker one about this right now actually.

388
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,950
And somebody said to me at one point,

389
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:43,979
well, well, what happens if, if the security researchers get angry with us?

390
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:44,679
And I said,

391
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,700
then I hope they publish something in public because it either

392
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,780
means we're wrong and we deserve to be made fun of or

393
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,340
we're actually, right.

394
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,200
And someone publishing something wrong in this instance,

395
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,580
actually helps it reinforce our correct position on a certain issue.

396
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,219
Right.

397
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,089
And I mean, it, it's totally, this is one of the things about,

398
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:07,630
about security is we love doing things in secret.

399
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,000
And I think that is a huge problem with this whole industry in a lot of time.

400
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:12,890
A lot of cases,

401
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,650
no embargoes are definitely overused,

402
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,358
not even just embargoes. I mean, like a

403
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,910
great example is

404
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,209
if, if you get a pen test report done, do you share it with anyone?

405
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,410
Nobody does,

406
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:24,628
right.

407
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:28,398
How many security bugs did you fix in your last update?

408
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,598
A lot of people don't say that they'll just say we fix some security issues.

409
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:33,279
I mean, even Microsoft does this where

410
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:37,938
if, if they have a certain module with say 20 security issues, they'll say uh yeah,

411
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,688
it's uh one important in,

412
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:43,918
in this module and here's the one C pe ID and like they admit they do that even.

413
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,500
Yeah. No, we've

414
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,319
um, well, I don't want to talk about it too much,

415
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:51,819
but there's been an instance of this happening with a vendor uh regarding CV ES where

416
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:56,479
they basically say they want to sign CV S if the component gets automatic updates.

417
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,969
Interesting. I've never heard it.

418
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,520
And of course, that's,

419
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,430
yeah, so one of the things we need to discuss now in the CV world is

420
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:09,089
uh one of the requirements is, you know, for CV, when the, when the flaw goes public,

421
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:10,369
the CV has to be announced.

422
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,050
So what constitutes going, you know, public with a flaw? Right? Is that

423
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,750
an advisory or is that like just a binary update?

424
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,209
But you can make the argument about a cloud service?

425
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:22,849
For example, if, if there's a problem in Gmail and Google fixes it,

426
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:24,689
do they need to tell anyone

427
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,229
and, and even if they told us why do we care?

428
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,540
-- And that's kind of the same deal on automatic updates,
-- right.

429
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,160
The good news, there is a lot of cloud providers again,

430
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,790
want to be more transparent there because they want

431
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,430
to essentially show that they're doing security better than their competitors.

432
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,020
Ah, that's fair. That could be a competitive advantage.

433
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,260
-- And certainly the cloud world, I can see
-- and we've already found that with, you know,

434
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,069
with the cloud security lines and the stars uh program,

435
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:54,589
you know, there's uh 250 or so public registry, uh like entries for stars,

436
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,790
entries for these companies.

437
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:59,680
I know that there's several 1000 of these entries floating around.

438
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:01,699
They're just, you know, they haven't submitted them publicly

439
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,800
to the public registry.

440
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,359
Um,

441
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:07,680
but like there's a number of governments that basically require this document now,

442
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,650
if you want to sell stuff to them.

443
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,739
That's interesting.

444
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,930
So, yeah, a couple of major universities, a couple of major companies,

445
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,349
they just because part of it is,

446
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,040
it's the same format.

447
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:18,449
So it makes it easy to consume. Right? You can just,

448
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:21,469
you can line up the spreadsheet next to each other and be like they said, yes,

449
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,739
they said no, they said yes, they said yes.

450
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:24,560
Right.

451
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:25,719
It's like, see,

452
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:26,969
like one of the biggest problems I have

453
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,959
with security is it's like cell phone shopping,

454
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:29,859
right?

455
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,160
They intentionally, everybody phrases it differently and does it differently.

456
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,760
So it's like, basically impossible to compare

457
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,800
meaningfully.

458
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,390
It sadly is,

459
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,199
you know,

460
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:40,050
um,

461
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,729
but back to the pen testing thing, I mean, the other, well, the ugly little truth is,

462
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:45,160
for example, the open source world,

463
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:49,229
you know, I very few open source projects can

464
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,069
pay for a P

465
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,750
-- test of their software.
-- Most of them can't because a pest is, is expensive.

466
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,199
I don't think, I, actually, I can't think of one that's ever happened.

467
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,420
-- So,
-- actually

468
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:00,969
that's

469
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:01,140
not

470
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:03,079
true. I've heard of a handful of them. I think

471
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,130
I got a proper, I don't know if I call it

472
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:05,630
A P.

473
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,800
Yeah. Yeah. Ok. Ok. So, yeah, that's true. Yeah, there's been a, yeah, I'm sure if we

474
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,729
Google, there's a handful, but that's my point. Right.

475
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:14,250
That these are, like, very much the exception to the rule

476
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,010
totally. And the reality is the open source world, you know.

477
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,250
Well,

478
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,209
based on the fact that I've assigned 5000 CV S more

479
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,189
than 5000 CV S now for the open source world,

480
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:26,890
like, clearly people are reporting bugs with, without even a financial incentive.

481
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,250
Right.

482
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,810
-- And, you know, so
-- this does work.

483
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:32,250
I read a thing once and I forget who, who wrote this.

484
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,890
But they basically said that

485
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,989
it appears financial incentives

486
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,910
aren't what actually drives people to do the security research.

487
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,619
They, they want to work on interesting things.

488
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,030
Yeah, this is true of a lot of problems.

489
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,069
Um,

490
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,349
there's actually a really good article in

491
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,150
the Economist about this about volunteer versus,

492
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,469
like, paid volunteering.

493
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,520
Uh, and they found that a lot of situations

494
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:56,209
isn't paid volunteering. Called a job.

495
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,290
Well, yes and no, because they're, they're, well, when they say paid volunteering,

496
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,359
there's different kind of forms of this,

497
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:05,829
like volunteering with some sort of reward, like either monetary or lunch or

498
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,030
whatever. Right.

499
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,949
But, so they just call it paid volunteering.

500
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:13,469
But, and I think if I remember right, the example they used was with a ARP, you know,

501
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,030
the, um,

502
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,270
-- what is it, the association of retired people, something
-- like that.

503
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,910
It's, it's an organization when you get old, they,

504
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,199
they automatically stick you in and then you get

505
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,349
cheap dinner.

506
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,050
Yeah.

507
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,790
So, anyways, part of what they had was a program where, you know,

508
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,869
people who used to be like accountants and stuff

509
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,790
would provide like financial advice and tax prep

510
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,369
help and that kind of stuff to other people

511
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,869
that were retired. You know,

512
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,339
because honestly, you know, if you, if you're an accountant doing somebody's like,

513
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,060
what is it in the US?

514
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,410
The 1040. Easy.

515
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,689
Right. It's, it's like a one page tax form

516
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:42,989
and it

517
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,380
is, you know, so for somebody who's like in the industry, you know,

518
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,020
you can sneeze and you're done,

519
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,280
it's easy. But, you know, to like you and me were like, uh, can I deduct my couch?

520
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,239
You can't do deductions on the 1040 easy.

521
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:55,900
See,

522
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,180
I have a really funny story is, but a long time ago

523
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:02,439
I got this,

524
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:07,810
this terrible letter from the IRS where I used to do my own taxes and I made a mistake

525
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:13,229
and basically I had a stock sale that occurred and I, I accounted for it incorrectly.

526
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:15,750
And so when you do that, the IRS assumes

527
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,140
all of the money you make is just income.

528
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,599
Whereas, you know, versus you got what you paid for it minus what you made and blah,

529
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,750
blah, blah, the capital gains.

530
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,119
It's kind of b

531
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,239
and anyway, uh,

532
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,449
they, so they sent me this letter for this ridiculously large tax bill

533
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:31,680
and I first had a heart attack

534
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,439
and then I started calling accountants being like I need help.

535
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:38,719
Can you please help me do this? And this was during tax season

536
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:41,300
and I didn't have a lot of time to send it back in.

537
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,760
Obviously, they all laughed hysterically at me on the phone and then hung up

538
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,719
because, uh, it was, they were already busy and I did my own taxes.

539
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:50,089
They're like, screw you. We're not touching that. Right. And,

540
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,239
and I kind of get that

541
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:51,699
and,

542
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,479
you know, there's probably a security lesson than this of, you know,

543
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:55,780
when you screw something up, like,

544
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,319
competent professionals are not going to help you.

545
00:22:58,619 --> 00:22:59,770
But anyway, uh, so,

546
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,310
you know what I did is I went to the IRS website and I started reading tax code

547
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:04,910
and

548
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,099
I learned so much. It's for what it's worth. It's bizarrely fascinating.

549
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,079
But, yeah. Yeah, I know way more about us taxes than I ever wanted to because,

550
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,089
and funny enough though I fill everything out.

551
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:20,219
I sent it back to the IRS and, and I got a letter back basically saying good job,

552
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:20,979
everything fine.

553
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,739
So I was extremely pleased when that happened

554
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,900
because when I saw the letter come back, I'm like, oh,

555
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,839
I, I hope this isn't like a letter saying they're going to come to my house and,

556
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,280
and audit me to death.

557
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,930
-- But no, they didn't, they didn't. I got out of it,
-- but

558
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,140
back to the volunteering side, what they found was,

559
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,339
was pretty much the minute you started doing sort of paid volunteering.

560
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,739
The number of people willing to do it dropped off dramatically.

561
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,989
I totally believe that.

562
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,939
-- Right,
-- because it's no longer like, oh, I'm gonna volunteer and be nice.

563
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:50,979
It's like, oh, I'm getting paid, like, three bucks an hour to help people, you know,

564
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:51,739
screw that.

565
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,699
Yeah. Well, not only that if, if I'm volunteering,

566
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:58,530
I kind of am willing to deal with more garbage from people, I think,

567
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,579
than if I'm being paid a paltry amount, it's like, not worth it.

568
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:03,449
Right. Like, just, nope, I'm done

569
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,599
so. And I mean, that's, you know,

570
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:10,609
so I think part of it is for me, at least, you know, to me, bug bounties are,

571
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,449
it's not a question of will it work?

572
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,969
It's just a question of like, how

573
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,569
well will it work because

574
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:19,709
it's already been working without money in the, in the open source world,

575
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,489
right? Even not in the open

576
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,520
source world, man. I mean, Microsoft's been getting security reports forever.

577
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,520
Right. Same deal.

578
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:26,339
I mean,

579
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,119
um,

580
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,400
and more to the point too, I mean,

581
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,109
we've seen this sort of economic model across all industries where,

582
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:34,800
uh, you know, a good example is a lot of companies don't

583
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,239
invest in research and development nearly as much as they used to

584
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,589
and instead, you know, they acquire start ups.

585
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,520
-- Yeah,
-- it's way cheaper, right. You know, you already know they're successful.

586
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,390
Yeah.

587
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,400
You know, they've, they've gone to some degree of products

588
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,189
that whatever that their magic sauce is.

589
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,109
I totally get that. It makes a lot of sense,

590
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:53,790
you know,

591
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,000
and that's the reality, right?

592
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,810
As a business, I mean, if I'm only paying for the winners,

593
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,390
you know, like one of the comments on Twitter was like, well with bug bounties,

594
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,810
you're gonna have like a lot of garbage and stuff

595
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,040
to sort through or like a lot of false positives.

596
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,979
-- And it's like, well, not really
-- because you do. You do and, and I want to,

597
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,589
you can outsource

598
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:10,170
that.

599
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:11,619
Well, yes.

600
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,130
Now you can, you couldn't before it's hacker one has a thing now where they can do

601
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,569
the triage for you if you want them to, of course, you, you pay for it, but

602
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:21,849
here's, here's my point to this is

603
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,319
you will get more noise

604
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:24,920
and,

605
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:30,599
and the bug body programs are working on eliminating a lot of the noise and silliness

606
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,800
that you naturally get.

607
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,839
And I mean, look, man,

608
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:36,560
we both dealt with incoming type stuff for various open source projects and it's

609
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,880
the same deal where you've got a guy who's found like a ridiculously pointless issue

610
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,030
and he thinks it's the worst

611
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,010
of sea view requests. I've been uh

612
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:48,910
plowing through all the requests sent to the uh DWO for the last four months. And like

613
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,969
some of it, I, I've just had to email back very politely.

614
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:54,479
Like, you know, what on earth are you talking about? Right.

615
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,380
Exactly. And of

616
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:55,609
course,

617
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,719
they're gonna argue with you

618
00:25:57,869 --> 00:25:58,510
that,

619
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:02,239
that it's super important and you're an idiot for not understanding that.

620
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:06,010
Right. And, and this, but here's the deal. Here's what I see is

621
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:07,910
in the bug bony universe

622
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,280
that is a fixable problem and they're working on it.

623
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:14,410
Whereas the pest industry is basically it,

624
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:16,020
it is what it is.

625
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,790
There's not a lot of innovation happening,

626
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,780
there's not a lot of new and exciting things and there's

627
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,699
not a lot of way forward that I can see.

628
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:27,229
Whereas I think the Bug Bony Universe has a lot of room

629
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,520
to kind of innovate and, and make new and interesting things happen.

630
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,310
-- You know,
-- I've been kind of wondering about pest

631
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,660
because I've always assumed, like, you know,

632
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,819
because traditionally was handcrafted, right?

633
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,969
Like every, every vulnerability is lovingly, you know,

634
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,520
crafts those anymore.

635
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,130
Well, exactly. So it's, it's partially automated.

636
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:47,479
But then I look at these, you know, like

637
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,969
cross site scripting scan results and like

638
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,869
there's so many false positives,

639
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,369
I

640
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,250
bet it's more than 80% on most automated scanners.

641
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:55,609
Yeah.

642
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,689
And, and I think part of the problem is, you know,

643
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,010
a lot of these pen testers want to generate a huge report

644
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,010
with a lot of results because that looks like they did something.

645
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,500
Right. Right. Exactly.

646
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:05,849
You know,

647
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:08,229
and so I think part of the problem with pen testing is that

648
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,949
we're back to the consultants dilemma of,

649
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:14,060
do I want to solve your problem or do I want to maximize my billable hours?

650
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:16,959
No, it's not about, look. Right. That's exactly it is.

651
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:22,550
When you turn a pen test in that had three issues and granted 33 critical issues,

652
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,339
you'd be taken, you'd be hung out to dry.

653
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,989
Right. You better return a pen test with hundreds of thousands of findings.

654
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,780
Not three.

655
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:30,780
Exactly.

656
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,329
And so I think the problem is the pest world to some degree is

657
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,520
incentivized against becoming much, much better. I would

658
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:38,819
a

659
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:40,660
company like a company like hacker,

660
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:47,310
one is severely incentivized to become like super efficient web scale Amazon,

661
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,199
you know, whatever

662
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:52,680
of like, we're gonna handle like 10 billion submissions a minute

663
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:55,709
and pull out that one piece of, you know, gold.

664
00:27:56,089 --> 00:28:00,229
Yes. Yes, I, I agree with. And actually, you know, it's funny as you bring this up and

665
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,760
I think it's bug crowd is letting open

666
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,589
source projects participate in the bounty program.

667
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:08,949
And if I had to guess that's a minefield of data

668
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,479
for them to start figuring out how to start automating things.

669
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,180
Well, you know, that's what I found with the DWF with accepting the CV request.

670
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:16,619
Right. Like

671
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,920
some of them are just flattered insane. Some of them are,

672
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,030
you know, obvious trolls and some of them are like,

673
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,520
actually it's clear that like they're, they're kind of on the right track,

674
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,390
but they need some, you know, hand holding

675
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,880
-- and then some of them are just, like, really good, high quality requests.
-- Right.

676
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,209
Right.

677
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,739
Well, I mean, but this is part of your intent with the DDWF is you'll have

678
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:40,489
something resembling a rating system where there are people, you know,

679
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,329
you can trust

680
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:45,880
that if they show up, like you can just hand them out like it's candy and you're fine.

681
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,719
Well, more importantly, also having a way for the, the, well,

682
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,800
the newbies to essentially get the help and

683
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,310
the knowledge that they need so that they,

684
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:56,079
you know, if they genuinely want to be involved in this and get better at this,

685
00:28:56,089 --> 00:28:56,619
they can,

686
00:28:57,915 --> 00:29:00,415
that's one thing we need is we need a lot more

687
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:03,305
accessibility and on ramps to becoming a security person

688
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:04,755
100%.

689
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:07,935
You know, I, if anybody asked me, how do you become a security person, Kurt,

690
00:29:07,944 --> 00:29:09,224
my answer would be like, uh,

691
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:12,064
you know, and I get asked that that's

692
00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:12,204
a

693
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:13,974
fair bit and

694
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:15,790
it's, it's difficult.

695
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,050
There isn't necessarily a good answer and, and actually I've got something here,

696
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,640
I'm gonna pull up on Twitter

697
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:24,219
that I really thought was hilarious.

698
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:28,469
So there was kind of AAA bit of a thread that went on talking about,

699
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,589
you know, what are, what are we gonna do? How, what do we do with new people?

700
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,689
And it started out with, uh, this new guy.

701
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:37,579
But anyway, it ended up with, uh Steve Christie was involved with.

702
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:40,199
This is, I think I replied to him. But anyway,

703
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,300
uh, basically

704
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,209
one of the guys in this is he's a freaking see.

705
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:48,319
So, and he's talking about like, oh, some companies, what do we do?

706
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,050
Where do we find talent?

707
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,390
And I'm like, you, what I mean, you are in the perfect position

708
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,349
to be leading the way on this,

709
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:57,689
-- but all these security
-- wants to feel mindless.

710
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:02,280
Well, part of it too is we've, we've gotten to this, you know, um,

711
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,949
especially in North America where companies don't want to pay people

712
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,040
to train them to learn. Right. They,

713
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:08,719
you know, we,

714
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:11,060
we literally have ads for jobs where it's like we want six

715
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:13,910
years of experience in this technology that's like six years old.

716
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,400
You know,

717
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,280
like, they don't, you know,

718
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,280
we want somebody with 10 years experience doing something, you know, entry level.

719
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,229
Right. Yeah. No, I, I know, I know exactly what you mean. Which is, which is madness.

720
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,209
I mean, first of all,

721
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,780
if you do get someone to take that job, they're clearly an idiot.

722
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,619
I mean, I, I, or lying. Well,

723
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,229
you, ok. Yeah, we'll take that.

724
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:34,719
But

725
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,469
exactly,

726
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,339
you know, you know what it reminds me of as well is I remember when.net came out and,

727
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:45,660
and it was brand new people, you'd look at job postings and they'd say, you know,

728
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,160
needing five years of.net experience and it's been out for six months.

729
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:52,579
But then it makes me wonder as well. How many people did it say?

730
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,089
They have five years of.net experience on their, on their

731
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,150
CV. That,

732
00:30:59,219 --> 00:30:59,640
although,

733
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,030
although for what it's worth it get pass hr but any

734
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,290
competent technical person to look at that would be like,

735
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,719
no, absolutely not.

736
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:09,160
Well, I mean, conversely, the competent technical person is going to know that,

737
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,780
that, you know, the whole thing is just,

738
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,739
I mean, we, those articles were coming out of Google where, you know, they've,

739
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,670
they've taken all the data they've assembled about job interviews

740
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,670
and resumes and everything and found out that doesn't matter.

741
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:22,619
Right. I mean,

742
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,949
from all the studies I've been reading about because I, you know,

743
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,510
it's something I've become interested in is

744
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:30,550
sort of on the, I, I'm interested in, how do people get hired?

745
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,380
Because part of what I want is I want the DWF to not only help people be, you know,

746
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,229
become better at security but also then make

747
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:38,030
them a bit more employable because the reality is

748
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,540
I, this has to be sustainable. So these people need to feed themselves,

749
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:43,290
you know, and,

750
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:46,709
you know, and probably so in my mind, at least it's

751
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,900
generally a good idea.

752
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,099
Like, if they're doing sort of volunteer security work,

753
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,250
then it probably makes sense for them to work in the security industry.

754
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,969
So how do I, you know, what can I do to help, make them more hirable, more employable?

755
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,030
Um,

756
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,930
but, yeah, like I said,

757
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:02,030
from everything I've seen looking at this whole resume interview process thing,

758
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,010
it's basically like a complete crapshoot

759
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,530
where, uh, what was it?

760
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,410
This one study was like,

761
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,979
basically you should just go with whatever your gut says in the first,

762
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:10,969
like 14 seconds of talking to somebody.

763
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,849
And statistically that that was basically ok.

764
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,949
I believe that

765
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,530
I have hired a lot of people in my day

766
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,849
and I've interviewed tons of people and there've been a lot of folks who

767
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,869
I thought were going to be weak employees that ended up being super strong.

768
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,130
And there were a lot of people who are super strong that quite frankly like,

769
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,130
like they got fired

770
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,489
because they were, they were no good.

771
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,969
And it's, it's hard, man, it's really hard

772
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,050
to

773
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:38,609
put together a good feel for what a

774
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,569
person's like before you necessarily work with them.

775
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:41,979
Now, that said though,

776
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,609
the one thing I will say is

777
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,939
it is wonderful when you can look at the open source world

778
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,680
and see what someone is up to

779
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,109
and you can,

780
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:54,010
their writing, you can look at their responses on email.

781
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,839
You can look at what they're doing on Twitter. You can,

782
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:58,530
and in fact, for what it's worth. Now, when I look at

783
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,050
people CV S, if,

784
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:03,839
if you're not on Twitter and you're not involved on github

785
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,170
and you're like, if you're doing nothing, I throw it away because you're,

786
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,400
there's clearly something wrong with you, in my opinion.

787
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,719
Yeah, I've had the same thing where, you know,

788
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:14,569
people come to me and they want to help with the DWF.

789
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:15,160
And I'm like,

790
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:19,290
who are you, like, literally, who are you? Because I can't find you anywhere but

791
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,540
like a profile on

792
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,959
-- linkedin.
-- That's a huge problem in my opinion. I mean, I don't think it's ok.

793
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:25,810
Well,

794
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:27,920
and I get that some of these people wanna like their

795
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,939
entry level and they want to start and that's cool and,

796
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:31,040
and I want to build stuff for them.

797
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,349
But I've also had people who are like, I want to help you formulate policy and stuff.

798
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,579
And I'm like, what?

799
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,390
Yeah, you know, like we're, you know, let's put the cart before the horse kind.

800
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,300
But also like, you know,

801
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,819
who are you? Like, literally like,

802
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,609
and I, I, you know, I've even had the occasion where I've asked you, like,

803
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:49,260
what do you do in the security industry?

804
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,540
And,

805
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,540
you know, like no answer or some answer. That makes absolutely no sense.

806
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:57,819
Maybe I just don't business bingo words speak enough. I don't know.

807
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:01,959
But there is, there is thought leadership pushing synergies. It's fine.

808
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:02,579
Well, you know,

809
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:05,739
and it's funny because I have actually met legitimate thought leaders.

810
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,510
No, there's no such thing as a legitimate thought leader.

811
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,679
-- If you call yourself a thought leader, you're dragging out what
-- I was going to say,

812
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:14,918
every legitimate thought leader I've, I've met or read or heard of

813
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:17,059
would never call themselves that

814
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:20,059
-- horribly offended.
-- They're doing other work as well.

815
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:21,549
-- Like,
-- yeah, you know, like, like schneer,

816
00:34:21,748 --> 00:34:24,708
for example, he is clearly a thought leader in the industry, right? Like a

817
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,628
blog and it's like he says things that I'm like, OK, yeah, I need to think about that.

818
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:32,967
You know, he's also doing many other things at the same time.

819
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:33,717
Yeah.

820
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:37,618
No, these, these people are like, like Dan Walsh and Se Lennox and stuff, you know,

821
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:40,059
like they're clearly doing work of good value.

822
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,489
-- You know.
-- Right. Right.

823
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,760
Right.

824
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,949
And, you know, you don't have to look them up because it's like, oh,

825
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:44,668
I already follow this.

826
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,409
Right. And remember kids, friends don't let friends turn off se lens

827
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,620
anyways. I'm not gonna talk about that

828
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:52,580
for

829
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:52,800
me.

830
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:55,080
I think it's still out on my computer. Um,

831
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,800
-- yeah. Anyway,
-- anyway. But, uh, yeah, I mean, that is the thing. Right?

832
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,080
Is like part of the, this industry is, like, how do we, you know,

833
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,520
the biggest problem in security

834
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,659
economically? What I've seen is the lemon problem. How do we,

835
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:11,580
you know, tell the, the good stuff apart from the lemons and again,

836
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,409
especially with the people, how do we tell, you know,

837
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:16,739
the visionaries who are a little bit crazy but

838
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,850
very visionary and are going to do something useful

839
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,020
-- against like the crazy snake oil salesman.
-- I think it's hilarious.

840
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,300
You bring this up because actually I'm talking to

841
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:28,560
some, some sales guys tomorrow

842
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:33,239
about this exact topic and I put together some slides because the point is

843
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,100
it, it, there are a lot of companies

844
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,620
talking about security

845
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:38,090
and

846
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,830
there's a lot of people in general

847
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,629
and a

848
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,379
we'll say a nontrivial number of them are full of crap

849
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:46,429
and it is very difficult

850
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,610
to tell which is which,

851
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,949
and I mean, this is a huge problem in our industry I think is,

852
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:54,290
I think it's in every industry that,

853
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,939
you know, highly technical and specialized because

854
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,199
unless you have a ton of domain, domain specific knowledge, you know,

855
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:03,629
he's saying all the right words, it's like car mechanics, right?

856
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:07,239
Like, I don't know what the heck is up with my transmission control unit.

857
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:10,250
-- Like he says, it needs to be replaced,
-- right?

858
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,489
Uh You know, you might have a point there is

859
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,449
it, it is probably every industry.

860
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,929
And in fact, you know, funny enough you say this and this is one of, I,

861
00:36:18,939 --> 00:36:21,290
I bought a Toyota as we talked about more than once.

862
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,810
And one of the things that happened was I got something

863
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,350
called Toyota Care with my Toyota and basically for the first Apple

864
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:27,879
Care, I,

865
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,199
I don't know, I don't know what Apple Care does.

866
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:31,290
Uh But anyway, I fix

867
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:32,000
your stuff.

868
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,550
That's basically what it is, right? And, and I get the feeling that

869
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,969
that has certain advantages because when I bring my car into the mechanic,

870
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,860
I don't care because I'm not paying for it and he has no incentive to rip me up.

871
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:45,939
Right?

872
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,350
-- So
-- Toyota Care literally is Apple Care.

873
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,669
It's like for this period of time we'll just make your car.

874
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,459
It's a couple of years and it's great too because

875
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,790
they include the oil changes and everything. It's fantastic.

876
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,310
Ok. Yeah, see,

877
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:00,949
and, and that gives a much better customer experience, right? Because like,

878
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:03,709
you know, the one time I had my uh my iphone,

879
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,179
the speaker on it died and I took it in and the guy swapped it out and brought it down.

880
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:09,360
He's like he here now it works. And I'm like, no, it doesn't.

881
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,330
He's like, oh, yeah, it doesn't work. Took it back, came back out. 20 minutes later.

882
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,560
He's like, ok, I swapped it again. See it works. And I'm like, no, it doesn't.

883
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,600
He's like, you're right. It doesn't work. That's very weird. He's like,

884
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:19,574
he's like, well, I'm not going to swap it a third time,

885
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:21,314
but we can just do a refurb for 100 bucks.

886
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:22,614
And I'm like, let's do that

887
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:23,034
and,

888
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:23,905
you know, five minutes

889
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:24,185
later

890
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:25,925
-- didn't test
-- it in the back.

891
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:29,604
Well, he, I don't know, man, but whatever point is,

892
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:30,514
you know, like,

893
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:34,504
because my phone was actually off, like I had Apple Care,

894
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:36,395
but it was past the Apple Care warranty period.

895
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,814
I see. Otherwise it would have been a free swap

896
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:40,649
instead. It was $100 swap.

897
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,459
-- And I'm like, you know what, I'm totally fine with that,
-- that box

898
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,489
is worth it,

899
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:44,360
you know,

900
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,709
-- I totally
-- get it. And that's the thing, right? So

901
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,179
I know as long as my Apple Gear is on Apple Care,

902
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,330
it, it's just, they literally are like, just bring in enough pieces that we can

903
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,750
tell what it was and we'll give you a new one

904
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:59,750
and if it's off Apple Care, it's like, it's this much for a reaper.

905
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,189
No, I literally asked him. I'm like, what if my kid takes a hammer to it?

906
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,899
And he's like, well, I'll just bring back a bag full of parts.

907
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,449
He's like, it's not the first time it's happened.

908
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,870
I'm like, oh, ok. Then,

909
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:12,379
so you could, like, cut it in half and I take half, you take half and then we,

910
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:12,540
uh,

911
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,780
I think it's like a dollar bill. Maybe they look for a part with a serial number.

912
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,110
I would, I would hope so.

913
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:18,909
Yeah.

914
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:20,389
But I mean, fundamentally, I mean, that,

915
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,810
that gives the customer a much better experience, right?

916
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,590
Because you and I don't want to actually buy a car. We just want something that works.

917
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,310
I would agree with you 100%. I don't even like cars. So

918
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:31,899
it is what it is.

919
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:33,610
But back to the state

920
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,669
and the level of knowledge needed to tell

921
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:39,310
the bad guys apart from the incompetent guys,

922
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,169
apart from the, well,

923
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:42,870
meaning incompetent guys apart from the actual useful people.

924
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:46,639
Yeah, actually that's a really good way to categorize it because you're right.

925
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:49,870
There are some people who I would say following the end of like evil

926
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,139
and then there are people who are, they have good intentions, but they're,

927
00:38:53,149 --> 00:38:54,909
they're actually gonna make things worse.

928
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,139
And the problem is how do you tell them apart? Because for

929
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:57,689
example,

930
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:00,409
there's like, there's that, you know, we're not going to say any names,

931
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:02,379
but there's a company doing a,

932
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,870
like a cryptographically secure quantum

933
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,149
hardware-based random number generator. Cool. I think that's awesome.

934
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,179
But they're doing a free,

935
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:15,719
like a free random number generator as a service in the

936
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,879
cloud type deal where you get your random numbers from them.

937
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:23,320
-- And I'm like,
-- oh, no, no, it's, no, no, it doesn't do that. Actually. Uh, it's Richard

938
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,000
from Whitewood.

939
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,909
Whitewood encryption, right? Or Whitewood cryptography.

940
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,919
Whitewood is the name of their organization.

941
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:33,010
I talked to Richard at length about this because at first he told me that I'm like,

942
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,510
whoa, dude, that's not cool.

943
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:38,610
But anyway, what, what it ends up being is they aren't, it's not random numbers,

944
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,639
it's entropy.

945
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,489
And here's the thing with entropy is, is now, this is

946
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,199
what I understand.

947
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:47,590
I will apologize to anyone who's actually knowledgeable

948
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,590
in this topic for whatever I get wrong.

949
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:51,250
But the point is uh

950
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,250
in,

951
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,729
in the way entropy works on Linux is you kind of take

952
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:57,620
entropy from lots of places and you stir it in the pot

953
00:39:57,939 --> 00:40:02,530
and it, it, it turns into, you know, gray paint or whatever, you don't know.

954
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,550
And then that's used to generate random numbers

955
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,850
as part of the random number generator algorithm.

956
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:09,120
-- And so
-- it

957
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,959
-- was part of the pr NG. Right.
-- Right. Yes. Pseudo

958
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,169
random number. Exactly. Right.

959
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,250
And so apparently

960
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,969
you can like, I can tell you

961
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:19,229
from

962
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,169
any source safely.

963
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,489
You also have other sources as well.

964
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,179
So you might be, let's say I'm giving you entropy and I know what the entropy is

965
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:31,679
that doesn't give me any advantages necessarily in terms of understanding what's

966
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:34,340
going on because you have other entropy sources on the system.

967
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,229
They're just not very good. Well,

968
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:39,439
yes, they, they exist, they just suck. OK.

969
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,840
They are there. They are bad though.

970
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:46,489
But here's the thing is just giving you entropy doesn't necessarily let

971
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,510
me know what the internal state of your random number generator is.

972
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,449
And if I don't know what the internal state is

973
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,159
that isn't useful to me.

974
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,979
Now, I, I won't say that it is very conceivable.

975
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:00,449
There are some crazy attacks that no one's figured out yet around this.

976
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:04,100
And so personally, I would not necessarily be super

977
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,260
excited

978
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:06,169
to do this.

979
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:07,530
If I owned a data center,

980
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,629
I might be excited to have one machine generating entropy and

981
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,989
handing it out to all of the machines I control.

982
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,629
But I would not be excited to be pulling entropy down from the internet.

983
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:22,030
See, and, and part of me wonders is this just me being old and being like, oh, you know,

984
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,510
it's a security thing and you can't trust some external person and blah, blah, blah,

985
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,229
blah, blah, blah, blah

986
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,030
rum for rum,

987
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:31,300
you know, or is it legitimately, is there a problem there? And the answer is,

988
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:34,419
well, yeah, like you said, it's, it's, it's maybe,

989
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,229
maybe not.

990
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:39,090
If someone with a phd tells me it's OK and then explains it

991
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,870
to me in a way I mostly understood and it sounded legitimate.

992
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:46,899
I'm willing to say maybe I I would feel better if a handful of other very smart people

993
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:48,530
with interesting titles,

994
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,989
put some work into explaining what's going on and saying whether it's good or bad.

995
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,530
But

996
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:53,310
so this

997
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,350
actually

998
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:56,300
you've just hit on exactly the problem.

999
00:41:56,409 --> 00:41:58,080
We are technically not qualified to

1000
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:58,919
answer those questions,

1001
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,629
-- but we're doing it.
-- We don't know. Like, so we don't know. For example, are they evil?

1002
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:06,969
-- Are they? And are they mind eating space lizards?
-- I don't believe

1003
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:07,570
there is a

1004
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,020
completely competent and well meaning and totally legit.

1005
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:11,850
Somewhere in the middle.

1006
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:13,135
I think he's that one.

1007
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:15,895
I suspect that. But I don't, you know,

1008
00:42:16,095 --> 00:42:18,065
again, I, I can't prove it.

1009
00:42:18,315 --> 00:42:19,295
-- I,
-- I spoke with him.

1010
00:42:20,196 --> 00:42:23,226
Right. Well, you can't prove anything. Right. You can't prove that I'm not evil.

1011
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:25,625
-- And this is just part of a great plot. I have to,
-- like,

1012
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:26,065
I

1013
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:27,196
know you're evil.

1014
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:32,345
I hope I'm not evil. I'm a nice guy. Come on. You know, I am.

1015
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:33,572
No, you don't.

1016
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:33,791
So

1017
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:35,062
you think squirrels,

1018
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:37,501
squirrels? I hate squirrels so much. Anyway,

1019
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:39,882
anyway,

1020
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:40,072
how

1021
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:44,181
-- can somebody good hate squirrels,
-- squirrels do nothing positive for society.

1022
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:48,761
-- They,
-- they plant acorns that grow into beautiful trees,

1023
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:52,991
whatever they get into my roof and I hate them all.

1024
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:55,461
Uh, so anyway.

1025
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,310
Right. Right. I think we just proved our point though is

1026
00:42:58,479 --> 00:42:59,050
in terms of sneak

1027
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:03,239
like we are, well, meaning idiots here. Right. We're talking about random numbers.

1028
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,850
We're not evil, but like we don't really know what we're talking about.

1029
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,030
I mean, that's reality but at best I'm parroting something.

1030
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,280
A smart person told me once.

1031
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:10,750
Yeah.

1032
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,840
-- Right.
-- Well, and that's part of what gets me is like,

1033
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,760
kind of, you know, if somebody,

1034
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:20,600
uh, if somebody essentially, if there's an outcome that is sort of quasi evil,

1035
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:23,479
like somebody, you know, inserts a really nasty bug into the code.

1036
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:26,469
Does it fundamentally matter what their intention was?

1037
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:30,399
Yes and no, I mean, hopefully it, well, I think it matters a bit because, you know,

1038
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:34,110
did they do it repeatedly or just by once, you know, do it

1039
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,389
-- accidentally,
-- once we're talking about bug bounties.

1040
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,899
-- And
-- that's what I mean, like, so with these bugs and with these things, you know,

1041
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,239
again, it's, um,

1042
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,780
you know, like, for example,

1043
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,679
a bug bounty isn't going to work for a software offender that has like

1044
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:50,360
a bunch of evil people working for them putting bugs in the software.

1045
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:50,719
And,

1046
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,310
-- you know,
-- I,

1047
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,310
I don't think you can assume that is a reasonable

1048
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,729
scenario because if that's true you have some huge problems.

1049
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,550
Yeah. Well, exactly. And so again, it goes back to this, I mean,

1050
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:08,540
these people submitting the bugs, I think some of them are totally, well,

1051
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,189
meaning just new to the process and they, they,

1052
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,270
and they might really have thought that they found a truly world ending bug

1053
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,870
and, you know, but they just,

1054
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:19,909
they don't have that experience to get that sense of perspective to be like, oh,

1055
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:20,790
it's not that bad.

1056
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,830
I think

1057
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,389
anyone participating in a bug bounty program is going to be fundamentally.

1058
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:27,050
Well, meaning

1059
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,159
because if you are, if you have an ulterior motive,

1060
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,280
you're not going to use the bug monty program.

1061
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,860
Well, there are people that do try to gain the system.

1062
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:39,280
-- There
-- will
-- always be that and, and I think those people are, are borderline.

1063
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:41,060
I would be willing to put them in the neutral

1064
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,830
camp probably because I don't think they're legitimately evil,

1065
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,360
but they don't necessarily have positive intent.

1066
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:53,000
It is up to the bug bounty program to find and stop people gaming their system. Right.

1067
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,419
Well, see,

1068
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:56,370
because I have this problem with CV assignments is

1069
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:58,979
there are people who want to gain CV assignments

1070
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,820
to get as many CV S as possible to their name.

1071
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,570
Yes.

1072
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,729
And so there are some ways to game the system.

1073
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,320
I'm not going to say what they are because

1074
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:08,590
they

1075
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,169
are doing it and they will make my life a living misery.

1076
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:13,250
Folks. You can game the system.

1077
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:14,070
Well, you can game,

1078
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:15,580
that's the nature

1079
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,689
-- of system
-- and that's just it. Right. If there are rules, you can get around them.

1080
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:21,520
And actually this is one of the things that I really like is,

1081
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,870
were you, uh, we, we, we had that meeting or, uh, uh, yeah,

1082
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:27,520
it was a team meeting one time on that Red Hat.

1083
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:27,820
You were there. You

1084
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,379
were,

1085
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:29,489
you

1086
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,389
-- were it was one of those, it was one of those games. I'm
-- actually,

1087
00:45:32,669 --> 00:45:33,639
because I didn't think of that.

1088
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:38,340
It was one of those games where, where essentially you, the idea was, uh,

1089
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:41,409
we got a bunch of parts and we had to build a tower

1090
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,270
and whoever had the,

1091
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,159
the ball, like you had a ball, a little ball, golf ball or something

1092
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,189
and whoever's,

1093
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,189
I don't know, whatever, it doesn't matter,

1094
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,149
whoever's ball was like, farthest from the, the floor or something won.

1095
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,000
And so, uh, we literally did nothing but screw around for, for like 15 minutes.

1096
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,830
So everyone else built towers and then, uh, one of us ran upstairs with our ball

1097
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,530
when they said time's up

1098
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,709
and, and we clearly won by breaking the rules. Right?

1099
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:08,129
-- And, and of course, well, the rules
-- haven't been clarified

1100
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:08,989
properly, right.

1101
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,780
And that was, well,

1102
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:13,389
so funny enough that's kind of the intent to make people think cleverly.

1103
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:16,330
But as, as I was speaking with the organizer of this,

1104
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,409
he was going to refine the rules for certain groups like us

1105
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:21,929
because,

1106
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:25,770
and, and, and this also makes me think of the, like, underhanded c competition

1107
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,929
where basically how whoever won it or, or however it's been won in the past.

1108
00:46:29,939 --> 00:46:31,790
Like now there's a rule that says you can't do that,

1109
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:32,899
right? Because,

1110
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,639
and that's kind of how this has to happen is

1111
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:36,780
as people are found to be gaming the bug bounty,

1112
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,419
you just say, all right, now this is a rule and you can't do that

1113
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,500
and, and that works. I mean, it works

1114
00:46:41,709 --> 00:46:42,219
well,

1115
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:46,300
but sometimes there's systems where you can't change certain fundamental rules

1116
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:49,669
and so they just can be abused. And that's, you know,

1117
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,439
I'm going to disagree with that.

1118
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:54,520
I'm going to say that if you have a fundamental rule and you can't get it fixed,

1119
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,600
you have, you're just fundamentally broken at that point.

1120
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,040
You need to rethink your entire model.

1121
00:46:58,459 --> 00:47:02,399
Yes and no. See, part of the problem is the rules aren't entirely up to me.

1122
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,929
Well, in your case for, for CV E, right?

1123
00:47:04,939 --> 00:47:07,270
Because I mean, you have to work with Miter as well, but in the case of

1124
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:07,449
the

1125
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:10,949
hacker one, hacker one is in charge of their own destiny,

1126
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:11,580
right?

1127
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:12,310
I mean,

1128
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,709
yeah, just change rules if someone's abusing a change of rules

1129
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:18,100
and that's kind of why I see that as,

1130
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,719
-- that's not an excuse of why bug bunnies are bad because not
-- at all.

1131
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:23,179
I mean,

1132
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:26,139
if anything bug bounties are currently immature,

1133
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,850
but I would say that almost all tech,

1134
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:29,919
uh,

1135
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,479
you know, we clearly,

1136
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:33,489
I mean, you know, well,

1137
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,600
I certainly wouldn't drive, you know,

1138
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,560
like when you look at the state of self driving cars, for example, it's like, no,

1139
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:39,830
we still have a ways to go.

1140
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:41,830
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we do.

1141
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:45,530
I mean, you know, I would say the tech industry in general is still, you know,

1142
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,550
we're maturing because for example, we still can't, you know,

1143
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,669
write a web browser that doesn't reliably, like,

1144
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,510
you know, do something horrific when it encounters a weird web page.

1145
00:47:53,899 --> 00:47:55,469
We've been at that for 20 years. So

1146
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:57,250
I know you gotta love it.

1147
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:58,979
We're getting there though.

1148
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,620
We are getting there and, I mean, let's, let's bring it home. It's, it's time.

1149
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:04,820
I,

1150
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,979
yeah, I, I guess the beauty of it is

1151
00:48:08,729 --> 00:48:10,739
for those of you listening, who've made it this far,

1152
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,429
who haven't smashed the computer in a fit of rage is

1153
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:17,949
I'm not opposed to a pen test. And if I had to pick between the two,

1154
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,310
I would pick a pen test if I can only pick one

1155
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,750
because I think it is the current industry standard for the way things work and, and

1156
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,790
you understand what you're going to get.

1157
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,889
I do think eventually the pest will evolve into the bug bounty,

1158
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:32,530
but

1159
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:35,129
we have a long way to go until that happens.

1160
00:48:35,389 --> 00:48:37,060
I think it's inevitable because,

1161
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:40,870
you know, some of these bug bounties were paying like decent money, like 5, 10 grand

1162
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:43,010
and in a lot of parts of the world, you know,

1163
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:48,649
-- that you can make a living doing a couple of those a year.
-- I'm unsure if that's the

1164
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,050
true for everybody.

1165
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,850
-- But, but anyway,
-- it, it would have to be true for everybody.

1166
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,510
Just a sub, like a small enough subset that they actually do it.

1167
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,560
Uh,

1168
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,239
yeah. Yeah. Ok. That's fair.

1169
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,600
Anyway. Anyway, let's take it home, man. It's time.

1170
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,239
Thank you everyone for listening. Thank you, Kurt for the

1171
00:49:04,429 --> 00:49:07,000
crazy conversation as always, which I love

1172
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,639
if you want the,

1173
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,199
there's not a lot of show notes,

1174
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:12,429
but if you're interested in them or more importantly,

1175
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:15,320
if you wish to yell at Kurt or myself

1176
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,949
via social media, you can find links.

1177
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:18,580
That's right.

1184

if nothing else, Kurt,

1185
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:41,479
you have a fabulous day and I cannot wait for the hate mail we're going to get.

1186
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:43,669
Yeah, I'm gonna go shovel snow.

1187
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:44,639
I

1188
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,120
thought it was spring.

1189
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,909
We got like 23 more days of snow coming.

1190
00:49:49,459 --> 00:49:50,800
Happy spring, Kurt.

1191
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:51,879
Happy spring.

1192
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,860
All right. Bye bye.
