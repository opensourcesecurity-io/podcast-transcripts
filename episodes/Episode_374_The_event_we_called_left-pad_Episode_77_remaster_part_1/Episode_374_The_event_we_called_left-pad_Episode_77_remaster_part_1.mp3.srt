Hi, all Josh here,

1
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:06,590
today's Remaster is going to go back in time for a blast from the past.

2
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:09,869
And we're going to talk about the left pad

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,229
security incident when Curt and I discussed this,

4
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,590
we didn't understand

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,620
exactly what we were dealing with yet, which is fascinating

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,969
to look back at all of the opinions and discussions.

7
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:24,100
We had, some of them were a bit dated.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,889
I won't lie and I think we've changed some of our thinking sometimes drastically,

9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:33,330
but I think the conversation is worth a listen because

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,349
an amazing amount of what we discussed is still valid today

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,779
and some many things have gotten better.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,029
I'm not trying to doom and gloom the universe, but

13
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:47,060
it's a really cool discussion and it surprised me a great deal

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,869
and I think you'll really like it and I highly encourage you to give it a listen.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,509
Kind of keep that thinking cap on and think about how

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,330
things are today and what they were like five years ago,

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,580
which is an eternity in this industry.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,540
Thanks for listening.

19
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,819
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 77

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,239
with myself Kurt Siefried and my part of the thought crime.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,989
Josh Bresser,

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,610
what's New Kurt?

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,500
-- Uh, we're finally getting some snow.
-- Finally.

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,680
You live in like the up north of the Arctic Circle and you haven't had snow.

25
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:21,559
We've had,

26
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,599
we had a little bit of snow early on in the year and then

27
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,959
we had a little bit of snow a few weeks ago and it,

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,970
it got warm

29
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,730
and so my front lawn was actually, I would say maybe only two thirds covered in snow.

30
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,449
And then there was that really terrible brown looking grass.

31
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,400
You, you've told me all the skiing you've done though,

32
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,150
I assume your ski hills have the magic snow machines.

33
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,050
Yes.

34
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,139
Well, I mean, snow valley is literally inside the city.

35
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,849
It's a 15 minute drive away and so you can actually take a bus there if you want.

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,569
So, if, if they're in the city and they make snow,

37
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,349
do they accidentally like it snow on someone's sidewalk.

38
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,690
-- Uh, no, they're in a
-- valley. The ice was

39
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:54,980
the

40
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:55,319
name.

41
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,540
Yeah, exactly.

42
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,349
Yeah, I know.

43
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:57,849
Yeah.

44
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,400
And, well,

45
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,220
the trick with snow making though is it has to be below a

46
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,889
certain temperature and they usually make snow at night because it's colder then.

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,419
And so we were lucky because this year we had essentially,

48
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,008
we had very early snow for about a week

49
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:14,328
and then we had a cold snap of like, minus 1020 degrees for about 23 weeks.

50
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:17,819
I assume this is Celsius. The gentle no temperature scale.

51
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:24,128
-- The one that all of the world uses except for America,
-- except for that one place.

52
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,039
Uh, yeah. So

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,600
they were able to make a ton of snow early in the season.

54
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,740
So, we've been going skiing, like, 23 times a week for a couple of months now.

55
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:32,220
Very fun.

56
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,940
Yeah, it's awesome. It's winter.

57
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:36,910
And, uh, it's funny though because we had a cold snap and was like, oh, my God,

58
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,500
why is it so cold?

59
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,619
And I'm like, it's the first week of January and

60
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:40,899
like, that's,

61
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,220
that's normal

62
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,220
global warming.

63
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,339
I know.

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,830
Yeah.

65
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:51,160
So, well, I mean, I guess this week's latest kerfuffle is the whole no Js thing again.

66
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:53,960
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. This one's really good actually.

67
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,440
Well, there's,

68
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,580
there's kind of two stories I really like on this one is there was the issue of

69
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,740
I, it's, what is it left pad this time or something?

70
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,720
-- Well, it was kick and then left pad.
-- Ok.

71
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:09,039
And that was no, but that was a few months ago when that happened.

72
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:10,320
Ok. Ok.

73
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:11,559
Kick was this one?

74
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,850
No kick led to left pad

75
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:14,309
kick

76
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,630
and it's just being brought up again because there was just tell this story. Ok.

77
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,509
So the two main things are so no Js is, well, no Js

78
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,199
and like many modern things.

79
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,809
It has a packaging system so that you can, like, go grab a package that, you know,

80
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,330
converts dates or changes the font color of your, uh, log files.

81
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,389
And there was a developer who had a package called KK Kik and

82
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:41,570
there was a company called Kick and they exchanged some emails apparently and

83
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,630
essentially they couldn't come to an agreement.

84
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,539
So the company went to the uh N PM people and under their

85
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,130
sort of package name, dispute

86
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:50,360
resolution process,

87
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:52,910
they booted the developer with Kik off and let

88
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,669
the company take over the name of that package.

89
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,610
So essentially they

90
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,289
N PM controls the name space for well N PM.

91
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,889
And that's important because like when you, you know, node install

92
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:08,740
blank, you're getting whatever it is they send you, right. Hopefully it's

93
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,729
what you expect. So basically this developer, I guess,

94
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,979
didn't really appreciate that. So they deleted

95
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,829
all of their packages off of N PM and they had one package called left pad,

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,108
which basically like straight up, just

97
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:24,109
left pads, text.

98
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,200
And so it was used and depended on by,

99
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,730
by thousands or hundreds or thousands or whatever of,

100
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:33,510
of other N PM packages which then all failed

101
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:34,380
in the

102
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,359
another thing to remember too is

103
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:39,279
in any sort of packaging ecosystem.

104
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,950
It's turtles all the way down because everything depends on everything.

105
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,660
-- Eventually.
-- I wonder if we've gotten to the point of circular dependencies.

106
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,920
-- I suspect we
-- have, I guarantee they exist.

107
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:52,369
Well, I remember writing dependency algorithms.

108
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,040
I

109
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:55,890
don't remember why I even did. Oh no, that's right.

110
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,239
I worked for a company called Progeny Linux systems like a million years ago.

111
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,450
And one of the things we were doing

112
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:03,850
was trying to build like customizable Linux distributions.

113
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:07,470
And so obviously a package dependencies. It was, it was crazy, man.

114
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,220
This was back in like 04, maybe 02. I mean, it was, it was a cool idea back then. Right.

115
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,822
And the answer ended up being containers, but, well,

116
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,162
the answer ended up being jam it all until it works.

117
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,083
And I, I remember writing

118
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:21,733
something that would kind of go through all

119
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:24,602
the dependencies and figure all this stuff out because

120
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:25,303
yeah, it was,

121
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:28,203
you'd end up with things like circular dependencies and you'd have to make

122
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:32,562
sure certain things depended on certain other things in certain ways and,

123
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:35,213
and things got crazy out of hand doing this.

124
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:36,583
And I remember that that was actually

125
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:37,976
really fun work,

126
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:41,885
-- but it was ultimately unsuccessful.
-- Yeah. So anyways, it's

127
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:45,635
so that's the first kind of story about the N PM.

128
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,966
And, and this has also happened with lots of other, you know,

129
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,895
package systems like uh Ruby gems.org is a good example.

130
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:53,705
Ruby gems.org is sort of the Ruby gems package or

131
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:56,235
that or site that won the Ruby Gems Wars.

132
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:58,325
There were actually sort of three main ones to begin with.

133
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,626
And so you essentially had three separate name spaces.

134
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,920
And so for example,

135
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:07,920
there were packages that were like have the same name across three name spaces,

136
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:09,459
but were controlled by different people.

137
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,459
Oh, good.

138
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,850
So Yeah, exactly.

139
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:15,480
Like, and, and some of these were pretty clearly, you know, not super good guys.

140
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:19,380
I think one of the names that was squatted on was like the B zip two. What package?

141
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,190
Because something to remember is, I mean,

142
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:24,790
the majority of developers, especially in the de develops agile world,

143
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:26,720
they write a bunch of code

144
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:30,329
with a bunch of, you know, import or depends or whatever statements

145
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,690
and they don't audit that code

146
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,670
and they don't audit the code that, that code pulls in and so on and so on and circular.

147
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,779
And I mean, quite literally,

148
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,250
it's quite common for something like a note,

149
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,709
Js application to then pull in dependencies which pull in dependencies,

150
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,649
which you end up with

151
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,609
easily over 100 megabytes of, you know, Min

152
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,079
javascript,

153
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,049
which is literally enough javascript to like, you know,

154
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,369
build an airline reservation system,

155
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,299
-- like straight up.
-- That's a great comparison.

156
00:06:59,429 --> 00:06:59,700
Right.

157
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:00,179
Basically,

158
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,859
it's so much code that nobody will ever be able to

159
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:04,640
audit it and actually determine what it does or doesn't do,

160
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,459
you know, and the system runs on trust and,

161
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:09,459
and, and it mostly works. It's, it's ok.

162
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,119
Right. You know, people find flaws, we squash the flaws and there's luckily

163
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,359
there don't seem to be many bad actors getting involved in this probably because,

164
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,980
well, I don't know why because it is quite a rich target, rich environment.

165
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:27,239
I have some thoughts actually. And, and this is, there was a story someone wrote.

166
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,670
And the title, let me, let me pull the title up here.

167
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:34,619
It's titled, I'm Harvesting credit card numbers and passwords from your site.

168
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,519
Here's how,

169
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,600
and this guy kind of laid out

170
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,239
if he was going to say abuse

171
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:41,179
node

172
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,850
and have a malicious package that was

173
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:45,920
stealing information off of people's websites,

174
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,079
kind of what he would do.

175
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,519
And I started reading this

176
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,869
and I was thinking this is extremely plausible. Oh, it's totally doable.

177
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,559
And no, no, here's I, I don't think it is anymore.

178
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,079
I, I put a lot of thought into this and, and I think

179
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,140
this sounds like something that, that will work in a very short term.

180
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,739
But you have to remember this is the long game we're talking about here, right?

181
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,619
And,

182
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,070
and the thing is you only have to get caught once I

183
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,559
view this as kind of like the reverse blue team problem where

184
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,980
the blue team has to succeed every time the red team only has to succeed. Once

185
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,209
in a situation like this,

186
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,850
you have to stay undetected forever

187
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:29,329
-- once you're detected, once it's game over,
-- well,

188
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,640
you don't have to stay detected forever.

189
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,690
But I mean, for example, let's say the guy.

190
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,808
So the the premise of the article is this guy wrote a N PM package

191
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:39,869
that actually, yeah,

192
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,900
changed the phone color of your log files to

193
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,895
make pretty and then also harvested credit card numbers.

194
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,715
And they had some tricks like only harvesting credit

195
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:49,164
card numbers between like 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. and

196
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:52,015
trying to do it intelligently so that if you were

197
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,924
using like square or things with like good security,

198
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,494
it wouldn't, you know, get in the way of that and kind of block it.

199
00:08:57,585 --> 00:08:59,005
And here's the thing.

200
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:00,914
I mean, it takes a lot of work up front,

201
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,585
which probably is why a lot of Attackers aren't doing it because it

202
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:06,341
are going for, like, I want to break into a website in half an hour,

203
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:09,062
harvest a pile of credit card numbers and sell them online.

204
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:12,062
Not, I want to invest six months building up this long call and,

205
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:13,721
and then harvest a pile of credit card numbers.

206
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:14,021
Right.

207
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:18,341
I, I think that's part of it. Yes. And, and not only that though,

208
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,742
you do this

209
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,021
and you'll be successful for a little while, but like all these mitigations,

210
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,182
this guy talked about

211
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,710
those mitigations might work at 80% of organizations,

212
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,270
but they're not going to work at 100.

213
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,039
Right. And again, you only have to get caught once and the con is up. True.

214
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,109
But the question is like,

215
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,090
-- does the con go on long enough to harvest a big pile of credit
-- card?

216
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:42,229
And, and I, yes, it certainly could.

217
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,150
I think if you actually started this,

218
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,549
you could probably get thousands or hundreds

219
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,869
of thousands of numbers before you're caught.

220
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,380
The kind of the point being. And, and the thing I keep thinking of is

221
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:59,190
I would be surprised if you could get away with this for more than 3 to 6 months,

222
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,359
maybe a year if you're lucky.

223
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,080
And now, granted that's a super long time. I'm not saying it isn't.

224
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:07,909
Yeah, I was gonna say, but you're gonna get caught.

225
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:11,289
And that's what tells me the fact that we haven't heard about this

226
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:15,489
before suggests to me no one's done it because you're gonna get found,

227
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,869
you're not going to be able to do this 100%.

228
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,320
Right.

229
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:18,859
Well,

230
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:24,299
there have been modules that were leaking information or exposing information.

231
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:25,500
And then it's the question is, well,

232
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,460
is this a malicious piece of code or just really poor programming?

233
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,679
And, and that I

234
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,520
think we could debate for days.

235
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:37,344
-- I always go with all uh Hamlin's Razor on this one.
-- Yeah. II I kind of agree.

236
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:39,965
I think it's, it's often silly mistakes.

237
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:42,034
Like this story here is,

238
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:48,534
it is hugely complex and, and I think this also makes me think of like movie,

239
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:49,554
movie theft

240
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:50,304
where

241
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,395
you, you look at movie plots

242
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:56,825
and the bad guys have these insanely elaborate plans.

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,619
And it's like in real life, you could never do that

244
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,590
-- in real life. If your plan has more than two steps, you're going to fail.
-- Right.

245
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:09,599
Part of it too is this, this is one of those things where

246
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,260
you need a lot of domain specific knowledge

247
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,530
to even

248
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,409
interact with the systems, let alone interact with them in a malicious way. Right.

249
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:19,849
Yeah, definitely.

250
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,960
You know, he gives the example of, well, I mean, first of all,

251
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:24,419
you'd have to be able to write some useful, no Js code.

252
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,280
Ok. That right there raises the bar of it.

253
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,690
Then you'd have to publish it to N PM. OK.

254
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,909
Then you'd have to convince other people to embed it.

255
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,429
Then you'd have to, you know,

256
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,169
or you'd have to make a lot of other fake projects that embedded to make it look real.

257
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:37,190
You'd have to make a pile of

258
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,794
github accounts that look real. You'd have to, you know,

259
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:43,875
you and granted, you know, if you wrote some tooling around this to automate it,

260
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,205
then you only have to do that once.

261
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:49,224
But again, even, you know, that is a level of sophistication and expertise that,

262
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:52,434
yeah, probably not a lot of Attackers have or if they do have it, you know,

263
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,645
they're going to use it for slightly more targeted and direct attacks.

264
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:59,195
This kind of reminds me of that whole, it's like spam in a way in that, you know,

265
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:01,145
rather than these targeted attacks

266
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:02,635
that we focus on a lot,

267
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,020
these kind of spam level attacks where I'm just gonna like slam everybody and yeah,

268
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,229
like 99% of people will just block it out, right.

269
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:12,070
But 1% might be stupid enough to fall for it and like, you know,

270
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,690
believe that the Nigerian Prince needs your credit card number.

271
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,770
And I kind of wonder if we're also approaching that security era as it were because,

272
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,039
you know, these targeted attacks definitely work. But, I mean,

273
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,669
they, you know, they take, they take a lot of personal effort

274
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,619
and if, you know,

275
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,219
if I, if you tell an attacker, hey, here's a tool,

276
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,619
it'll automatically attack 1000 websites and, you know,

277
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,559
one of them will be vulnerable and you'll get credit

278
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,299
card numbers and you just run it for an hour.

279
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:39,880
Yeah, they'll probably start doing that.

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,349
I, I think you might be right.

281
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:45,659
And, and not only that, speaking of Nigerian Princes, I remember reading a,

282
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:48,260
an interview with one of those scammers once

283
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,559
and someone asked like, why, why is your spelling so bad?

284
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:56,099
And, and like, why are these stories so ridiculous? And he said

285
00:12:56,489 --> 00:13:00,609
you have to make it as over the top as possible because that way, you know,

286
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,409
anyone who replies

287
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,340
is you've got them right?

288
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:05,989
Because these aren't people who,

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,390
who probably have a firm grasp on what's going on around them necessarily.

290
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:11,169
It

291
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:12,919
reminds me of three card Monty.

292
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:16,309
If you don't know that somebody on the street doing three card Monte is a scam,

293
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,020
-- then, ok, you're the mark.
-- Yes, that's exactly right.

294
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,200
You know how, how anybody thinks they can win a three card Monte on the street?

295
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:29,140
-- I mean, that, that game is literally 100 years old,
-- but the guy before me just won.

296
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,739
So I know I can because I'm sorry for him.

297
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,219
Yeah, that's true.

298
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,159
That's true.

299
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,349
Oh, man. I know.

300
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,119
And you know what's funny about that is I was, I was

301
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:39,330
at,

302
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,950
oh, I was, there's this touristy trap in Wisconsin called Wisconsin Dells.

303
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,960
And, right, it's all full of water parks and it is a nice place.

304
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:50,030
And we were, there was a street magician there and the guy was like, hey,

305
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,369
you guys got to come here and do this.

306
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,669
And I,

307
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,070
I literally kept my hand in my pocket on my wallet

308
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,440
the entire time he was doing his magic because I'm like,

309
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,349
this dude's gonna steal my wallet

310
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,690
and I'm not gonna know it.

311
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:05,090
-- And like I the things he did, it's, it's,
-- did you, did you check for your phone?

312
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,369
I did not. That was in my pocket. And

313
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:12,440
I admit I was slightly less concerned about, oh, here's the thing though.

314
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,450
The street magicians never steal someone's cell phone, right?

315
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,369
They always steal the wall,

316
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,080
right? Like that's the, that's the gimmick.

317
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,260
And so

318
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,520
in fact, now that you say it,

319
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,710
I think a street magician stealing your cell phone would be very cool.

320
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:27,340
But no, it's always the wallet, man. You should know that.

321
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:28,989
So anyway, and, and,

322
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,750
and yeah, the crab, this guy did, it was like, I

323
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,440
people are terrible at dealing with hucksters like this, right?

324
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,059
And the guy was great, right? He gave everyone all their stuff back.

325
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,979
He stole from him. But

326
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:40,984
it's like,

327
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:44,984
holy crap if this guy wanted to be. Although I guess that's part of the story. Right.

328
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,825
That guy could become a pickpocket and he would probably do ok.

329
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:49,465
But I get, he's, I,

330
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:52,575
I bet he makes way more money as a street magician than he

331
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,705
-- would stealing from people
-- and he doesn't have to worry about getting caught.

332
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:57,544
-- Right.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

333
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:00,125
I mean, heck, I gave him like, 20 bucks because my kids were just, like,

334
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:01,224
enthralled by this show.

335
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:01,544
Right.

336
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,359
Whereas he, he stole my wallet,

337
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,059
he would have made about 25 bucks. Right.

338
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,530
That's what it would have been because I never have cash

339
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,239
going back to the N PM thing.

340
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,380
Part of what really sort of scares me in a way

341
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,489
is that we have these systems where people own a name space

342
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,030
but is globally used

343
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:26,739
and, and all of a sudden becomes very important, like a great example of this is like,

344
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,559
Yelp.

345
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,250
Yelp owns the kind of Yelp wants to own the name space of all businesses

346
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,960
and, you know, well, it'd be a shame if your business got a bad rating on Yelp.

347
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,190
But hey, you can pay us to get, you know,

348
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,049
those bad ratings suppressed or the good ratings on top or whatever.

349
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:42,320
Right.

350
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,320
You know, same thing like Google

351
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,659
to put it bluntly,

352
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:51,130
-- I don't go to restaurants that score below four on Google Maps. I, I agree
-- with you.

353
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,650
Right. I just straight up. Don't,

354
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:53,979
-- no,
-- I, I totally

355
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:54,460
get it.

356
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,969
And, like, quite frankly Google could,

357
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,280
you know, uh, uh, more and more people are going to be doing this, I assume, because

358
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,700
I, I'm at a point in my life where it's like, wait a second,

359
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,789
there's like a ton of really good restaurants.

360
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,780
Why would I go to this one with like a 3.2 rating where people are saying that, like,

361
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,650
the staff is surly and the food is cold like that.

362
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,799
Why, why would I even, you know, bother looking at the restaurant,

363
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,880
let alone going there to eat?

364
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,479
Now, let me ask this in, in the context of saying no

365
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:23,015
package managers. Is there a way to rate

366
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,375
the packages?

367
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:24,994
Well, see,

368
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,965
and that's sort of one of the things with a lot of these name

369
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:31,594
spaces is they don't really do that or it's sort of implied rating by,

370
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:33,174
you know, how many people use it

371
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:34,164
or like on github,

372
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:37,044
you know, how many people are star this, how many people are watching it?

373
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:38,414
How many people have forked it?

374
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:39,284
Right.

375
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,395
And I use that kind of as a metric when I'm looking at code

376
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,520
to kind of see, you know, like, oh,

377
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:49,039
this code has like, you know, 2000 people watching it. Ok.

378
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,140
It's, yeah, it's probably somewhat legit versus like, oh,

379
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,979
this code has nobody starring it.

380
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,030
Nobody watching it, nobody has forked it.

381
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,419
Nobody cares about this code.

382
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,739
And, but the thing is these,

383
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:05,380
these control of the name space is incredibly powerful because in most cases,

384
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,020
it's very opaque in the sense of like you can

385
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,979
do whatever you want and nobody has any recourse.

386
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,050
Yes.

387
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,739
Uh some name spaces have very official policy and rules like for example,

388
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,689
DNS the domain name system, right?

389
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,890
You know, if I register something.com and there's a company with that, you know,

390
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,300
they can come after me and there's a bunch of

391
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,069
laws they can use to recover that domain name.

392
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,380
And it's,

393
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,250
you know, there's at least some laws and process that are documented, but

394
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,550
you look at things like say N PM and looking at the name space policy,

395
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,819
I'm not really clear why

396
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,819
the company Kik man, you know, got

397
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,619
was allowed to grab this package name away

398
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,609
from the developer who originally built it.

399
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,420
-- I
-- mean, if there's a trademark,

400
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,369
-- the blog entry kind of reads like BS,
-- well,

401
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,060
the blog entry might be and they're not lawyers, but I mean,

402
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,819
you can make legitimate trademark

403
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,280
claims against things like that.

404
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,689
I mean, if you're a company named Kik and you're distributing software,

405
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,530
but the problem with trademarks is that trademarks are quite often just local.

406
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,719
So for example, what happens when you have three different kick companies,

407
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:11,459
one in Canada, one in Uzbekistan, and one in Australia,

408
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:16,130
it's going to fall to probably let's face it,

409
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,329
the American company because I assume that's where,

410
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:23,369
where much of this silliness often happens and where many of these people live

411
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,060
and, and

412
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:28,589
I'm not gonna piss off the local, whoever in my country.

413
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,444
Right. They're the ones I care about. Like, yeah, Canada's great and all, but

414
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:35,275
-- I'm not worried about them. I don't live there.
-- Yeah, exactly.

415
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:36,885
And see, that's the thing about,

416
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:40,805
that's the problem with name spaces is up until recently the world

417
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:44,675
didn't have global name spaces. Right. You,

418
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,744
you generally didn't worry about Bob's Deli

419
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:52,239
in Australia having the same name as Bob. Bob Deli down the road,

420
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:56,140
you know, but now that's a problem with these, especially with these, you know,

421
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,989
single name spaces like

422
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,739
N PM or C Pan or Ruby Jams, you know, where it is global in nature.

423
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:07,859
And then there, you know, for example, you have nouns like Amazon.

424
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:11,619
Amazon is just a well known place name and it's also a large company.

425
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,390
-- It
-- used to be a well known place name na

426
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:14,619
company.

427
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,660
Yeah.

428
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,569
You know, and so like for example, Square, right?

429
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,140
That's a big payment processor. But you know, it's also the word square.

430
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,979
And what if I write package called square that like

431
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,670
measures the space.

432
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,699
I don't know, it does something with squares,

433
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:33,290
geographic or uh geometrically speaking, I don't know,

434
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,060
you know,

435
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,930
should Square have the right to take that away

436
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,699
from you because they have the trademark on square.

437
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,229
Well,

438
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,619
yeah, exactly. Whereas

439
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,719
the name space control and where's the lawyers and all that. But

440
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:47,579
-- I,
-- I think we should save that one for the open source legal podcast. Right?

441
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,520
Yeah.

442
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:48,920
But,

443
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,050
but the really ugly problem here is that most people

444
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,060
use these name spaces without thinking about it at all.

445
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:55,959
Right. So

446
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,000
these people all pulling in left pad, for example, and

447
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,119
it disappears one day and all their apps all break, right?

448
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,229
And I mean, well, I used to work for Red Hat and I still do and this is why Red App,

449
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:05,839
for example,

450
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:10,000
we take software and we package it and we package it in a way so that there's no

451
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,880
like external dependencies, you know, when we install an R PM on your system,

452
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,500
it's not like, oh, I gotta go off to some random web

453
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:18,295
-- and grab a bunch of stuff,
-- right?

454
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:18,525
And,

455
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:24,084
and I think that is still completely valid and I think if you're operating in

456
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:27,035
an environment where you don't keep copies of

457
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:29,344
the artifacts you're putting in your products,

458
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,165
you're going to have a bad day.

459
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,925
Well, yeah, for, and the other aspect too is if that,

460
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,069
you know, if it goes away, you're boned and or if it changes.

461
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Yeah. Can you revert to a known good copy?

462
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,140
Like if somebody hacks a developer account and then puts malicious code,

463
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,270
not even hack a developer account, man.

464
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,640
I mean,

465
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,130
how many of these projects don't have breaking changes between versions where you,

466
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,239
you just literally can't upgrade to a new version, I mean,

467
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,680
it's super common

468
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,959
and, and now we've made it to a supply chain argument,

469
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:01,199
which is totally where this was headed anyway.

470
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:02,599
And, and yeah, I mean,

471
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,469
this is one of the things I, I deal with this constantly,

472
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:08,520
every day and I think about it all the time is the fact that,

473
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:11,290
you know, there is an open source supply chain

474
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,270
and

475
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,689
we aren't doing a good job of,

476
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:16,270
of dealing with it.

477
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,449
Like there's some companies like Red Hat is,

478
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:21,180
is in honestly the poster child for doing it, right.

479
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:24,760
And, and I look at a lot of places that are doing it horribly wrong

480
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:28,449
and I work at a place that I would say is doing it pretty good, right?

481
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,810
I won't, I won't say we're perfect.

482
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:34,069
-- Not that Red Hat was perfect either, but,
-- but here's the one in fairness. There is no

483
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,050
easy tooling or frameworks.

484
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,800
Like for example, there's no N PM as far as I know,

485
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,420
no CPA N PM or whatever framework where

486
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:44,270
you like tied into your C I system and it acts as

487
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,280
a caching layer that also magically keeps a copy of everything.

488
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,589
Uh There, there are some actually, there, there are some,

489
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:53,599
none of them are free and they're really expensive.

490
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,959
And I mean, it, it's part of the problem I think

491
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,060
of

492
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,790
this is really hard to do

493
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,160
and it needs people because we don't have any standardized,

494
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,589
anything today for dealing with this

495
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,130
Well,

496
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,310
I think part of the biggest problem is a lot of this problem exists

497
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,729
not at the developer layer but at like the build and continuous integration layer,

498
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:16,489
right.

499
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,319
If it was at the a developer layer,

500
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:21,109
you would just check the code into your git boom done, right?

501
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,310
But that's not how these systems work. You have your code and get

502
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,910
and then when you build it or run it,

503
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,979
it automatically magically pulls in a whole pile of dependencies, right?

504
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:32,079
Like a deploy time, not at development time, right?

505
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,760
You know, uh well, for example,

506
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,520
like we the the the cloud security lines has several ruby on rails,

507
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,900
applications for like the CCS K and stars.

508
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,589
And you know, we have the code that we've written in,

509
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,579
get

510
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:44,599
cool.

511
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,550
And then, you know, when we deploy it, what is it called rail ties, whatever,

512
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,400
whatever the thing that

513
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,359
magically pulls in all the dependencies is does that

514
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:55,069
on the server keeps them up to date?

515
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,199
And it's kind of like, well, you know,

516
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,040
yeah, how do we, how do we properly back that up in an easy way?

517
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,189
I mean, I can back up the entire server. Cool.

518
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:06,479
But how do I kind of have say like rail ties or whatever

519
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:12,040
kind of give me a cash copy of those in a, in a structured way that I can more easily use.

520
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,280
And the answer is there's not really a good, simple, easy answer for this.

521
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,780
I know some major companies,

522
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,540
what they do is they basically they block access to things like Ruby gems.org

523
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:24,180
and they run their own internal version of it and you know, they, they, oh,

524
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:25,550
developer wants this package.

525
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,790
Ok. We're gonna go download that package, audit it, put it into our local,

526
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:30,410
you know, instance

527
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,650
and you can now use that and it's so it's now, you know, internally

528
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,290
copied and run

529
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,800
and like that's gonna happen with maybe a

530
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,189
couple dozen or 100 companies around the globe,

531
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,479
right? No developer is gonna ever do that.

532
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,920
It's also hard because you need, that's a very specialized skill set and you,

533
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,439
you need to be of a certain size.

534
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:55,250
I mean, start ups aren't gonna be able to do this because it's very difficult, right?

535
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,439
It's, it's, it's hard

536
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,739
and it gets even harder because

537
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,670
you might be pulling in one dependency and you think all right,

538
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm gonna check out this dependency,

539
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,819
but then your dependency pulls in 20 dependencies and those

540
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:09,560
20 dependencies pull in 30 dependencies and it gets,

541
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:11,000
it gets really crazy.

542
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,180
And that's where I think a lot of this

543
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:17,140
kind of let, let's audit, everything can start to fall apart because again,

544
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,420
it's turtles all the way down and it's, it's so hard.

545
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,579
It's so crazy man.

546
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:24,239
And, and this, although I mean, I'll, I'll point out

547
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,359
github is, is hopefully going to help deal with some of this,

548
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,660
with their, their dependency checker.

549
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:34,699
They have, but even that I know is going to take probably years before I'd say it's,

550
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:35,800
it's good enough,

551
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,520
right.

552
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,160
-- This stuff is
-- hard.

553
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,640
I mean, there are things that do this, but again, it's,

554
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,310
they're not really

555
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,640
easy, automat, shareable. You know, there's no,

556
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,660
like,

557
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,239
as far as I know, there's no like,

558
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,270
simple plug in that you can basically like tie into your github

559
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,760
and be like, so every time you build this, the C I system will magically

560
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:56,359
do its thing.

561
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,589
But also this other system will get a copy of everything and keep it

562
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,170
and index it and catalog it and make sure it's the right one,

563
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,569
you know.

564
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:05,739
Well, you know what else? I think part of the issue here also is

565
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,839
what's the incentive to do this?

566
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,829
There's a handful of companies that do it.

567
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:15,160
-- Yeah, it's, it's too hard, I think
-- until it breaks horribly and, and, and, well,

568
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:15,800
the thing too it's

569
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,510
remembers. So uh the, the left pad example is great.

570
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,670
You remove left pad from N PM and it breaks on

571
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,410
a a jillion apps fixing and replacing left pad on, on N PM.

572
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,790
Took like one developer five minutes because he had a like a copy of it,

573
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,150
right? Like it's open source, right? So he just uploaded a new copy, took the names.

574
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,209
Uh N PM allows you to take the name space of abandoned projects.

575
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:39,430
So basically one guy fixed it quickly by you know,

576
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,989
re uploading it basically

577
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:43,020
you compare that to the effort of like

578
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,500
these million projects running local cash stuff.

579
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:46,180
Yeah.

580
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:46,459
No,

581
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:50,800
it's clearly a lot less work to have one guy fix it on N PM than to have a million people,

582
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,920
you know, build a bunker of, of cached files in case, you know, the,

583
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,119
the end times come for that file.

584
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:57,459
Right?

585
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:59,540
And that's part of the problem with a lot of these, you know,

586
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,140
solutions is that everybody has to do it to be safe, you know,

587
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:07,650
and that just between expertise and scale and resources is just not gonna happen.

588
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,530
So we end up with these centralized, you know, attempts at solutions.

589
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,560
Yes,

590
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:16,050
I don't know. I, I think about this one a lot and I don't know what the answer is today.

591
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,479
Uh

592
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,209
There is a project that's really cool actually, some, some ex red hat guys,

593
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,790
what is Tide Lift I think is the name of their company and it's libraries dot IO

594
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:28,390
and it's, it's starting to track some of this stuff.

595
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,280
They've got a long way to go, of course, but

596
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,119
it's,

597
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:35,770
it's the beginning I think and if I was gonna put money on anybody today,

598
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,130
it would probably be those guys because one of my complaints I have and,

599
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,170
and you and I discussed this often,

600
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,849
like we have a standard for tracking security flaws in software.

601
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:47,199
It's called CD E

602
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:49,859
and how many of these private vulnerability database

603
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:52,900
type places actually use CV E consistently.

604
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:55,040
None of them. The answer is none of them.

605
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,819
And I have a suspicion

606
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,180
they don't have an incentive to use CV E because they want to

607
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:04,000
say my database has more stuff in it than their database does.

608
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,900
So I'm clearly better than you.

609
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,819
And it's like, no, you're just all a bunch of idiots.

610
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:11,020
That's not, you're not better than anybody

611
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:12,469
work together.

612
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,189
Well, you know, it reminds you of antivirus companies, right?

613
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:19,869
Like they, they all essentially the amount of duplication of effort is

614
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,250
literally insane.

615
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:22,869
Well, it used to be much worse.

616
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,209
-- I mean, I, I, from what I gather, they actually work together now to a
-- degree they do.

617
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,020
There is a lot of,

618
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,900
there's sharing of coat samples and that's been around for a long time.

619
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,989
But before that even I remember hearing stories

620
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,020
back in the day where one antivirus company

621
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,069
would literally write viruses to attack another antivirus

622
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,750
company's product just so they could be like,

623
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,869
look, our product catches this virus.

624
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,849
There's doesn't, it's like, yeah, that's because you guys wrote it, man. Like

625
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,069
no kidding.

626
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:50,959
The reality is for people to do this correctly. It's kind of like backups.

627
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,310
It has to be

628
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,790
super easy

629
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,869
and super on by default

630
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,479
and require

631
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:59,780
literally no effort.

632
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,479
Yes or so little effort is like you type in one command

633
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,689
-- or something.
-- No, I I agree with you 100%

634
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,209
right?

635
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,719
Because I've, I've looked at this, you know,

636
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,839
for the CS A projects where I'm kind of paranoid, like, yeah,

637
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:13,989
like what if one of our dependencies goes away,

638
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,119
then our outbreaks and I get yelled at and it's going to be a bad, bad week.

639
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,609
But the solution is like, oh my,

640
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:26,020
it's literally a minimum of tens, if not hundreds of hours of engineering.

641
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:28,119
And, and the better question is

642
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,310
you have not spent hundreds of hours implementing a solution.

643
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,209
-- And how many times has your site or project broken?
-- Exactly.

644
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:39,680
Well, and more of the point, you know, again, this, this kind of thing doesn't scale.

645
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:40,579
Well, right.

646
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:46,099
Every single person writing a Ruby Gem app that uses like these common things.

647
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,630
They're going to spend tens or hundreds of hours of

648
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,189
engineering and ongoing maintenance and backing it up and blah,

649
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:51,750
blah, blah, blah, blah.

650
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,989
And the answer is no, clearly we're not,

651
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:56,349
you know, because that's what's happened. The market has spoken.

652
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,020
I'm gonna cut it off here and then

653
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:05,020
we will continue the story next week and next week we focus on

654
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:10,400
the market and the forces that it creates or doesn't create in some cases.

655
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:13,660
And it's a, it's a fun wrap up to the discussion for sure.

656
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,660
So I will see you all next week.
