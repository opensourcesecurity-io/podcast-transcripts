Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,350
and my partner and having to change all their,

2
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:13,920
I can't say that word on the podcast. Passwords.

3
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:17,409
I'm seriously, I want like, I actually have a to do item now.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,129
That's gonna take probably five hours.

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,540
I've been changing passwords for over a week now.

6
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:26,059
So the title of the episode is going to be last pass. Ducked up.

7
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:29,829
-- Oh, we can use the word duck. Right. Right. Autocorrect.
-- Yes, we can say duct

8
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,380
because that's what your autocorrect sent me last night.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,130
Oh, I just got it because there was this one youtuber that made a,

10
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:37,869
he made a quack noise every time

11
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:42,400
I just got it. Oh my God. I am not that. Wow.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,159
How did I miss that?

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,459
It's, it's one of my favorite auto. Corrects.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,159
And I think,

15
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:54,720
I think adding duck to a sentence is vastly funnier now than the actual bad words.

16
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:55,919
So anyway,

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,229
we're gonna talk about last pass today, but I want to frame this.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,349
I want to be very specific.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,560
So there has been an enormous amount of writing

20
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:05,760
about last pass over the last couple of weeks.

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,080
Uh, if anyone who has listened to the podcast for any period of time

22
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,555
is that Kurt and I were, were last past customers,

23
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:14,775
past dance in the past and we recommended it

24
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:17,114
to people who'll rehash some of what happened.

25
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:21,635
What I really want to do is talk about how to get out of this

26
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:26,194
because everyone's complaining about what happened and I don't see a lot of, ok,

27
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:28,595
-- like they ducked up what
-- now?

28
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:30,474
And they, they not just ducked up,

29
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:33,105
but they ducked up bigly because here I want to read you something.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,379
Ok. So this is from lastpass.com. Why do we need a password vault?

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,099
Unfortunately,

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,540
security breaches are becoming more and more common and it's almost impossible

33
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,690
to keep your information safe without the help of an online vault,

34
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,290
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. How secure is the Lastpass vault at last pass?

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,199
Security is our number one priority with local only encryption.

36
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,050
Your data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level data storage

37
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:55,154
vault kept secret even from last pass your master password.

38
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,934
And the keys used to encrypt and decrypt data are never

39
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:59,205
sent to Lastpass server and are never accessible by Lastpass.

40
00:01:59,214 --> 00:01:59,875
Ok. Cool

41
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,415
benefits of the last pass vault, secure storage, blah, blah, blah.

42
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:05,394
Now, what do they encrypt in the vault? Everything? Right?

43
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:07,084
Obviously, from reading this,

44
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:07,785
it

45
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:09,804
turns out no, they don't and see. And

46
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:10,133
I,

47
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:12,729
I mean, I was the last pass

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,199
customer both personally and professionally,

49
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,279
like at a corporate level for several years.

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,240
And I always assumed

51
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:22,399
that everything was encrypted user names.

52
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,470
URL S,

53
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:26,520
the passwords, everything. Because,

54
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,789
well, why the hell else would you do it any other way?

55
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,050
So, I was a personal, last past customer for years and a professional, you know,

56
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,529
corporate customer for years.

57
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:36,679
And I just always had assumed that

58
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:40,160
an encrypted vault meant an encrypted vault

59
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,990
like that everything was encrypted user names,

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,770
passwords

61
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,389
URL S the whole nine yards, like essentially like like this encryption.

62
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,595
When you know, when you encrypt a hard drive, you encrypt the hard drive,

63
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,604
not just like the file contents, but like also the file name,

64
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:53,785
meta data and everything, right?

65
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:54,574
And that

66
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,854
I have to say was I think this is actually

67
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:59,735
a big area where last pass ducked up and continues

68
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,845
to duck up by not making it clear what is

69
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:06,375
and is not encrypted because there's a lot of services,

70
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,315
for example, that use magic URL to log in.

71
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,149
And if you know that URL,

72
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,050
this has come out, I think pretty well.

73
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:17,330
I don't know if lastpass put it in their pr statement specifically,

74
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:19,770
-- but it's
-- not in their current I I just googled,

75
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:24,000
like if you go to lastpass dot column slash features slash password dash vault,

76
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,929
it doesn't mention this at all

77
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,169
on their website.

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,970
-- So
-- they have a APR statement.

79
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:33,830
One of their statements here is the threat actor

80
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,919
was also able to copy a backup of customer

81
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,210
data, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

82
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,149
binary format that contained both unencrypted data such as website URL

83
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,990
S as well as fully encrypted sensitive fields such as website,

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,720
user names, passwords, secure notes and form filled data.

85
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,800
So they're not encrypting URL S and it

86
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,289
is not clear to me exactly which parts of the notes are encrypted or not

87
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,649
because it sounds like some of the notes are

88
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,460
encrypted and some of the notes aren't included.

89
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,729
You keep saying secure notes is

90
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,139
that different? I don't know.

91
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:04,089
Oh, so, oh, there's a, there's a thought.

92
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,029
So if it's a secure note is the secure note encrypted.

93
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,610
But if it's a regular note on another thing, it's not encrypted,

94
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,149
that would suck because in a lot of,

95
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,470
well, literally every time I enter a banking password, I have to add a note of like,

96
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,929
what are my three secret questions and my three secret answers?

97
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,630
-- And I add that as a note and I really hope those are encrypted,
-- right?

98
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,970
And people are adding

99
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,269
like their, uh what do they call the recovery recovery codes, recovery codes.

100
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,640
They call the recovery codes, recovery,

101
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,910
they're adding those to the notes in some instances.

102
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,890
-- So,
-- yeah, of course, because we're also gonna put them,

103
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:34,829
it would never have occurred to me that I would have to use a secure note.

104
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,630
I would just assume that the password record that I have

105
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,440
-- is an encrypted fault.
-- And you mentioned about some of the recovery URL S.

106
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,600
So this is another thing that,

107
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:51,630
that came up in some threads I saw in Mastodon where there were

108
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:54,980
like like account recovery and password reset.

109
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:59,760
URL S that were ended up saved in lastpass, which unencrypted

110
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,529
that still worked later because the company that issued them didn't expire them,

111
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,029
which is is wrong.

112
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,160
-- But,
-- but it's not technically wrong because there's no CWE for it. How do I know this?

113
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,179
Because I submitted one for it a few months ago where literally,

114
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,529
because I noticed that like people send out these links with like, you know,

115
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,119
here's a link,

116
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,339
reset your password or set your password or whatever

117
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:21,739
and you know, if it expires in a few hours or even a day or two,

118
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,309
ok, pretty reasonable.

119
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,250
But a lot of them like never expire, which is horrifying.

120
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,820
And so Microsoft did this research where what

121
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,920
happened is people would basically create an account,

122
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:32,179
you know,

123
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,459
using like Josh at breast.net and not confirm

124
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,089
the email obviously because they don't control it.

125
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,970
And then when you go to the account,

126
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,649
you get like a recovery of it. And

127
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,790
but I'm already in that account with a backup

128
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,730
password or a backup email address or something,

129
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:45,609
you know, things like that.

130
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:45,880
So

131
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,720
it's basically this is hard to do,

132
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,859
especially if you try to kind of compress the workflow,

133
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,119
but back to last pass.

134
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,459
See to me when you say this is an encrypted vault and you put your data in the vault,

135
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,049
it is strongly implied

136
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,179
that you put all the data in the vault, not just some of it, but all of it.

137
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,260
And, and this is where, and ironically, do you know why the,

138
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:09,179
like why we left last pass is because actually

139
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,980
we couldn't reliably retrieve the data when somebody left,

140
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:12,209
right?

141
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,239
Because their master password encrypts it and we had access to it

142
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,679
and we needed corporate data recovery, right?

143
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:19,959
Which one password offers?

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,739
So we ironically left last pass because it was in some ways too secure.

145
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,359
We couldn't, like I said, we couldn't recover accounts.

146
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,869
Ok? OK. You can't say that.

147
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,690
So

148
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,049
I

149
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:31,769
can't

150
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,440
say that

151
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,760
it's too secure.

152
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:34,940
Well, no,

153
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,010
it's not.

154
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,170
Ok.

155
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,750
I don't want to rehash all of the things that happened with

156
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,570
Last Pass in depth because it's been covered by many people.

157
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:46,940
And here is the fundamental takeaway. There, there'll be some links in the show

158
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,570
notes for anyone who wants to go read about this stuff because it's fascinating.

159
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,329
Don't get me wrong.

160
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,970
But the fundamental takeaway of all of this

161
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,160
and the reason I think last pass has

162
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:01,579
lost the trust of security people

163
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,529
is they are being incredibly weaselly

164
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,769
in how they're talking like this is

165
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:13,070
people are taking their press release apart using like lawyer speak,

166
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,190
saying this could mean this or this or this.

167
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,959
Like they're not, they're obviously letting lawyers write the press release.

168
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,470
And it's technically not a lie,

169
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,329
but it's definitely not the truth.

170
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,160
But it's like exactly like this features

171
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,500
slash password vault page on the website where

172
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,859
I'm left with the impression that everything is encrypted, but clearly it's not.

173
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,769
And they haven't clarified this page.

174
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,269
That kind of blows my mind though.

175
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:39,459
Why would they

176
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,540
-- to be honest and truthful and transparent?
-- But that's obviously not their purpose.

177
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,779
So, so here's what happens when there's a breach

178
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,239
and this is true of every breach.

179
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,260
There's basically kind of three paths companies will take.

180
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,929
There's the just pretend nothing happened.

181
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,579
Yeah. Shoot, shovel and burry,

182
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,299
right? No, shoot, shovel and burry, like foot and mouth disease. You just

183
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,829
never happened. I don't know what you mean. Like 10% of the cows disappeared.

184
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,000
It's a thing. Probably wolves. UFO

185
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:05,290
S

186
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,029
UFO S is better like, ok, so

187
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,829
do nothing. Right.

188
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,170
Then there's just we're going to tell you absolutely everything that happened.

189
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,920
-- And there, there have been good instances of that
-- well

190
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,869
clad clod FFL consistently.

191
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,579
Yeah,

192
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,989
-- they were, they've been very truthful.
-- Well, you know what, I'm going to point out

193
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:27,070
how they handle breaches is typically the same way as how they handle like oopsies,

194
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:28,790
almost certain

195
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,850
it's a, a

196
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:32,859
100%.

197
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,239
And then you end up the third path. The middle path is what last pass is doing

198
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:39,799
where basically the lawyers have taken over

199
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,719
and they're not lying,

200
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,799
but you have to like put on a lawyer hat

201
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,400
and try to interpret everything being said

202
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,929
because nothing they're saying is what you think it means. Like,

203
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,130
that's the thing that eats me on the inside is they are

204
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,309
purposely misleading people

205
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,809
-- there.
-- It's essentially a cross between advertising and a badly written contract.

206
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,520
Yes.

207
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:04,099
Yes.

208
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:04,789
And they, they,

209
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,820
they know they're doing this because you don't create this sort of communications

210
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,270
without knowing exactly what you're saying. I mean, I have been part of groups

211
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,549
that have tried to spin things in the past

212
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:16,950
and,

213
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,190
and I will say like this is one of the best things that

214
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,549
like Redhead had going for it is we would try to be like,

215
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,270
how can we make us sound less dumb?

216
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,099
And it's like

217
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,729
it's open source, we literally can't do it. We just, we have to just tell the truth.

218
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:33,270
There's no escape hatch to this at all and we're like, all right, fine.

219
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,710
I guess we'll just tell the truth

220
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:37,070
and then it all goes away a week later

221
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,229
because it's not this.

222
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,640
That's the thing that always gets me is like, especially something like this. It

223
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,900
most breaches are not really ongoing.

224
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,890
And I mean that in the sense of

225
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:48,530
yes,

226
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:50,010
a lot of breaches are ongoing in the sense of they

227
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,710
get personal data and they use it to do bad things,

228
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:54,900
but nobody cares because that's just kind of a normal day now,

229
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,940
-- right? Like I just as well
-- and look the story isn't the last past Breach.

230
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,940
The story is how bad they're effing it up and lying about it, you know.

231
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,619
Well, and to be clear they're not lying about it. They're just using very

232
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,400
specific language in terms to, you know,

233
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,320
create an impression that is maybe not entirely,

234
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,919
I don't want to say it's not correct, but it's, it's easy to misconstrue, let's say

235
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:22,880
it. It is purposely designed to misconstrue

236
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,690
much like their password vault page. I like, I literally still read this

237
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,570
and I still, my gut says, yeah, everything's encrypted.

238
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:30,549
What are you worrying about?

239
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:31,539
Exactly.

240
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,090
So that's,

241
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,429
that's enough. That's enough.

242
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,710
We know last pass is not acting in a way that I would say is upstanding or trustworthy.

243
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,640
And if I'm going to use a password manager,

244
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,669
I need to trust those people. Ok.

245
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,380
Now this is where let's move into the next talking point of all this is. So,

246
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,309
what, what next? Like, I'm a person, I'm literally a person who is using lastpass.

247
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,909
My family was using lastpass. Now we have to figure out what we do next.

248
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,049
So rule number one is you continue using a password manager?

249
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,510
-- Well, no,
-- I'm serious. Right.

250
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,830
Like, because I've, I've seen people who are like, oh, password managers are bad

251
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,150
and I'm like, cool, like, what are you gonna do? Print it out and like, go with that.

252
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,950
I'll just buy one of those books at the

253
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,109
supermarket where I can write my passwords down and

254
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,090
that actually would not be a bad, that's,

255
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,270
I would consider that to still be using a password manager.

256
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,840
-- I'm ok with that.
-- I agree.

257
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,229
I actually have no problem with that.

258
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:26,869
-- Like, if your elderly parents want one of those, by all means,
-- dude,

259
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,989
if you're in my parents house looking in at the password book inside their desk.

260
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,200
All right, we got bigger problems.

261
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,710
Oh, absolutely. 100%. 100%. Ok.

262
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:40,690
So there is a very nice write up from Tavis or

263
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,940
that I'm going to put in the show notes and he basically

264
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,630
explains the, his problems with a,

265
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,169
like online

266
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:53,650
cloud based password manager and it's not that they have access to the passwords.

267
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,609
It's what the password manager plugins do

268
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,059
to the HTML on your website. And I I, his concerns are

269
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,080
-- completely valid.
-- Has there ever been an attack through that mechanism though?

270
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,969
-- Probably
-- not. And, and I think, I don't, I think it's relatively

271
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,245
unrealistic for there to be.

272
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:12,656
And so before we go on the thing you have to understand is there is no

273
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,656
way to work with user names and passwords that is we'll put secure in quotes.

274
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,656
There are tradeoffs and there are risks.

275
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,375
So, like, here's an example, someone will say, well, I'm only going to use key

276
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:22,705
pass

277
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:23,606
XC

278
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:26,056
because it's only on my computer

279
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:28,935
and it doesn't go anywhere and I feel that's safe.

280
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,765
So, yes, you can make the argument that my pass

281
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:35,062
word hasn't gone anywhere else. It's only on my computer,

282
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:37,502
but now you are responsible for keeping that backed

283
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:40,021
up and keeping it synced in all of that.

284
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,572
So there are risks and rewards to every solution.

285
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:45,911
I wanna be clear that this last pass problem has

286
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:49,541
nothing to do with the cloud capabilities of last pass.

287
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:53,031
This is 100% structural issues with last pass.

288
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,581
In fact, if you read what everyone is talking about,

289
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,950
no one is claiming that being in the cloud was the problem,

290
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:03,200
right? The problem is last pass response.

291
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,229
Well, but and also the fact that they,

292
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,880
they created the situation by not encrypting all the things

293
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,679
as was implied. Like I literally was

294
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,090
a

295
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:14,760
customer for years and I just assumed

296
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,544
that everything was encrypted because

297
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:19,005
why would you only selectively encrypt some of it?

298
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,044
-- You know, that's a, that's like
-- a but we're not,

299
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:22,265
we're not worried about the failures.

300
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,184
I don't care about the failures. We talked enough about those.

301
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:30,525
We, we, the value in this show is what to do. We can whinge for hours on why they suck.

302
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:34,025
This is one of the reasons why you need two fa on your high value accounts

303
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,489
because at some point, your password might get disclosed.

304
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,030
We'll get to that, we'll get to that. You're jumped ahead too far,

305
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,690
we're still deciding what to do. Now,

306
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,250
there are going to be people listening and there's going to be people, you know,

307
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,729
who can't stop using last pass for some

308
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,809
reason or another that is not inherently wrong.

309
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:54,979
For example, it took us months to move out and we literally had to start

310
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,559
off that date because like I moved my stuff out of

311
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,409
last pass and it took me several hours of dedicated work.

312
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,169
-- It is going
-- to take most of us days or weeks. And that's the other thing to keep in mind.

313
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,489
This is a slog.

314
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,280
This is not fast.

315
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,049
I have to move my family.

316
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:11,739
It

317
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,119
is not going to be an enjoyable experience for me.

318
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,309
-- We'll
-- say no, you got to reinstall apps, get them logged in. That's

319
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,659
fine.

320
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:21,500
So anyway, even if you're using lastpass,

321
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,099
you need to do the things we're going to talk about even if you keep using it now,

322
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:29,059
which password manager you choose to replace lastpass with.

323
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,179
So you do that

324
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,059
is

325
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,500
it is up to you to figure that out.

326
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,150
I'm not saying everyone needs to go like key pas XC,

327
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,369
everyone needs to go with like a paper book in your drawer,

328
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,309
-- whatever figure it out. Well,
-- one benefit

329
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,299
that is kind of magic.

330
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:48,460
Now is there is things like icloud and Microsoft, Onedrive and Google Drive.

331
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
But there's a lot of options

332
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:55,599
do allow for very easy file storage and synchronization between multiple devices.

333
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,580
And

334
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,900
if the app actually encrypts all the data securely.

335
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,669
Well, let's hope it does well.

336
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,520
And we know keypads X does that because it's open source.

337
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,179
It's actually really easy to say like, OK, here's my keypad

338
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,659
X file and as long as it's protected with a good, you know, master encryption key.

339
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:15,075
Yeah, you just throw it into whatever file because I,

340
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:16,974
I hope our listeners are using some sort

341
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,674
of cloud based file drive storage backup because probably

342
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:24,075
like those family photos are important, please, you know, take care of them.

343
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,104
So I would suggest though, for anyone paying attention,

344
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:29,015
probably look at one password or bit one.

345
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:32,934
Those are the two I would suggest and they're the two. I'm a biggest fan of

346
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:37,075
due to we'll say human constraints of people who aren't me.

347
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:39,674
I'm moving my family to one password.

348
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:42,380
If it was just me, I'd be using bit

349
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,679
warden is how I would describe that for a, a long list of reasons.

350
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,210
-- This is what
-- frustrates me is like Chrome

351
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,450
has a really good built in password manager,

352
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,440
so does Firefox,

353
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,710
but it only works for Chrome and I still have things that

354
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,369
-- are not a web browser and same thing for Mac
-- keychain.

355
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:59,520
But, but my, my specific need,

356
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,950
the most important aspect of password managers to me at this time

357
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:08,039
is the ability to share and manage family passwords

358
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,150
because

359
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,580
I have a variety of needs.

360
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,789
Not just that like I, I have a variety of needs with my Children for,

361
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,469
for dealing with them, they're, they're forgetful.

362
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,919
There's a lot of reasons Right. So I, I, the,

363
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,229
the features one password has are on family management.

364
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:29,700
The thing I need, I mean, that's, that's why I went to last pass because at the time,

365
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,570
last pass had family management stuff and no one else did.

366
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,400
And so that is why I landed there.

367
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:38,369
So now the first thing you need to do is obviously migrate

368
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,580
all of your passwords from wherever they were into wherever you're going.

369
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,229
And there's a lot of instructions to do this.

370
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:47,010
So I'm not going to talk about it, go find them for your password manager.

371
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,739
Fun fact, at least when I tried it last pass,

372
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,549
kind of made it a dark pattern to get your data out of there.

373
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,309
And you can't, I had zero problems and you can't

374
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,710
have, you actually tried closing your account though.

375
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,830
We'll get to that, that, that is impossible. And that's ok.

376
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,290
That's, that's part of the story, right? That's at the end that comes at the end.

377
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,348
The first thing you need to do is get

378
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,848
your passwords into your new password manager system.

379
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:13,060
Do not use the same master password you used with last pass

380
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:18,329
because the Attackers may or may not have your vault. We don't know

381
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:21,489
and your vault may or may not be encrypted

382
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:25,259
with like there. I've been read so many things about

383
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:28,538
last pass claims. Everything was 100,000 rounds.

384
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:29,788
Um No, it's,

385
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:32,068
the modern stuff was 100,000 rounds apparently.

386
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:35,538
-- The old soap was like 5000 rounds and of course you can't,
-- maybe

387
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:38,129
there's, I've heard reports of people with one round.

388
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:40,448
They found out like it, it's unknown.

389
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:41,379
So anyway,

390
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,599
change your master password, right?

391
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,079
Don't use the same one.

392
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,920
And then you need to start changing passwords for your services

393
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:53,359
and you need, your goal is to change every password in your password manager.

394
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:56,660
And that is ridiculous because like, I have 400 accounts in my password manager.

395
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,369
Right? It is bananas.

396
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:01,479
-- How long it is going to take me to change those? But
-- I have

397
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,459
377 and

398
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:09,119
-- only 370
-- seven. That's my personal one. There's also work,

399
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,400
uh actually not too bad, 321 in work.

400
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,630
But you gotta remember, I have a aggressively pushed sso at

401
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,979
the CS A.

402
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,339
-- Right.
-- Right. And, and

403
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:23,609
that's part of the story obviously is if you have sso good job now,

404
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:27,420
you need to prioritize what you're going to change

405
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,369
because

406
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,079
things like your bank and your email are

407
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,349
probably the most important accounts you have.

408
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,229
-- And
-- obviously,

409
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,910
I know email is the most important full stop because that's the recovery mechanism.

410
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:41,449
-- E
-- email is hands down the most important 100% because

411
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,790
if an attacker can gain access to your email,

412
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,670
they own everything.

413
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,619
This is another reason I would highly suggest using two factor authentication

414
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,260
on your email because even if an attacker has your password.

415
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,619
They still can't. Well,

416
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:55,180
they

417
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,810
hopefully can't log in

418
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:57,849
you.

419
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,109
You put the, the codes in your, your notes, in which case they have those too.

420
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,060
No, the number one would be your email, followed by your cell phone

421
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,079
or other phones, then your banks and everything else because

422
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,979
the, the email and the phone are the recovery method. That's the critical path

423
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,020
-- to everything.
-- Yeah.

424
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:20,099
So email, telephone banks and look,

425
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:23,660
this is up to you to figure out what the things you think are most important,

426
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,729
easy because most password managers will kind of show activity and

427
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:28,780
just go by activity by what you use the most,

428
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:30,920
which doesn't always work because like,

429
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,500
I pay my taxes once or twice a year and that's also an important account.

430
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,310
Uh, that's a good point.

431
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:36,890
So there are things anyway,

432
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:37,660
look

433
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,880
through the financial stuff,

434
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:42,810
anything dealing with money or, or I guess meet space, right?

435
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,319
Anything in meet space.

436
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,910
That's the stuff you need to care about because

437
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,010
you've got obviously real world consequences to those passwords being

438
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:53,199
taken.

439
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,640
So, ok,

440
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,910
so we got our master password, we got a new,

441
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:59,449
we got a new password manager, we got a new master password.

442
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:02,109
We started changing all our passwords and that takes forever. Right.

443
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,810
I'm not going to say it doesn't, it takes a very,

444
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:08,420
very long time and it's terrible once you have all of your passwords changed now,

445
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,189
you have to think about what do I do with last pass.

446
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:14,619
And I would suggest not removing your last pass, I guess,

447
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,859
account until you have things mostly sorted out in case you have to go look back.

448
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:21,599
One thing I would say though is definitely

449
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:24,180
remove the last pass extension because I ran both

450
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,219
last pass and one password extension simultaneously for like

451
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:28,910
a couple of days in my web browser.

452
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,050
Can

453
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,599
you do that?

454
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,400
And it was a nightmare because they

455
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,349
basically fight for control over those form fields

456
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,380
with, I mean, this is something Tavis Orman.

457
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,000
He points out in his thing, you know, with the shenanigans that go on there

458
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:41,839
with their, you know, they inject code and stuff and it was just,

459
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,140
it was beyond a nightmare.

460
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,930
Like again, we just had to say drop dead date and just do it.

461
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,319
I didn't even know that was possible.

462
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:51,760
It is possible and it's very, very unpleasant because

463
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,939
the way they um sort of attached to the field

464
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,510
and where they put their pop up is different.

465
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,819
So they, they literally fight each other. It was the

466
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:00,709
do not

467
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:03,689
even a little, I'm impressed it worked it all.

468
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:06,459
I would have expected them to explode or something,

469
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,500
but whatever

470
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,770
-- doesn't matter.
-- Well. But the other thing is

471
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,530
this is the other advantage,

472
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,770
get it out of your uh chrome extension and turn the

473
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,199
app off to essentially force yourself to be moved to whatever new

474
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,689
password manager you have so that you're not sort of accidentally

475
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,699
using the old one and you think you've moved out of it

476
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,719
because that's, that's another thing we have.

477
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:25,869
I, I, you know,

478
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,530
because I had one device where I totally forgot about the device and it was like, oh,

479
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,099
everything works.

480
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:32,619
-- And then I'm like, oh, this, I totally forgot to set this device up.
-- Ah, interesting.

481
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,319
I,

482
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,619
so funny enough, I, I did that I disabled

483
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,099
last pass and enabled. Well, I, I was testing bit

484
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,819
worden in one password

485
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:48,099
and so I just turned last pass off to try the other ones to decide which one,

486
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:49,685
the things I needed to do.

487
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:50,165
And,

488
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:52,885
yeah, you're right though. I mean, make sure you do that right away.

489
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,324
I think that's really good advice.

490
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:54,515
Well,

491
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:57,295
this is one of those things where you can think you've moved everything out of it

492
00:21:57,305 --> 00:22:02,125
and like you can do an export and how do you know you actually got everything?

493
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:02,944
Yeah. Yeah.

494
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:04,935
And, and you might miss things, but again,

495
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:08,484
as long as you have the email address sorted,

496
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,204
you could probably do account recovery.

497
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:11,665
You know what I mean? Now,

498
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:12,944
here's why

499
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,199
one thing we didn't say at the beginning here

500
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,050
is why you need to change all your passwords.

501
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,520
And, and even if you are using last pass today, you need to do this

502
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,449
because Attackers acquired backups of the last pass bolt.

503
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:30,739
So you should assume an attacker has access to

504
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,449
all of your passwords in your backed up vault.

505
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,449
This is why just shutting off your last pass account

506
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:39,739
is meaningless in this context and why you have to change all of

507
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,920
your passwords because the Attackers already have the data while I think it is

508
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:48,489
going to be unlikely they crack a lot of vaults.

509
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,609
-- I think it is still best to assume they can do
-- it.

510
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:57,849
Well, I mean, we have a lot of, sort of, I want to say unconfirmed second hand reports,

511
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,410
but there's kind of enough of them

512
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,199
from enough people that are sort of generally competent that it's like

513
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,569
there's a lot of smoke here. I suspect there might be fire.

514
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,739
Maybe I'm hesitant to say that because I know back when the,

515
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,459
when the breach was first announced,

516
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:14,819
like, you knew some people that had

517
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:18,260
-- incidents with data, they thought they only had in last
-- pass.

518
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:18,680
Well, yeah,

519
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,069
because I got an email from github saying

520
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,089
an access token was used improperly to blah,

521
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,449
blah, blah and we've locked it out

522
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,530
and so did a couple of other people on master like,

523
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,140
-- and,
-- and, but here's the thing, here's what gets me

524
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,739
all of that happened, like, right away

525
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,189
and I haven't heard anything of it since.

526
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:37,349
And so I wonder if those tokens were in the note?

527
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,069
Well, exactly. Yeah. If they were unencrypted, then they're all too easy.

528
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,869
Like, literally too easy.

529
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:46,150
I would have assumed the note was fine.

530
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:47,869
You know what? That's a good point.

531
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,680
That's, yeah, because back then I was operating on the assumption that,

532
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,430
like, it's an encrypted vault, you put everything in the vault, it's all encrypted.

533
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:54,859
Like

534
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:58,290
the fact that they really still weasel about this

535
00:23:58,469 --> 00:23:59,459
drives me nuts.

536
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:01,180
But that's why

537
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,630
last pass has lost my trust. It's not the breach.

538
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,319
-- Oh, yeah, they'll never get it back. You
-- can have a, well, I wouldn't say never but

539
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,050
have a breach.

540
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:12,109
And if you're honest about what happened,

541
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,819
I'm not going to knock you because everyone has breaches, everyone makes mistakes.

542
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:21,540
But the fact that they're trying so hard to weasel out of everything is the problem.

543
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:25,430
Stupid question. But they've never said once, why is this crap not encrypted?

544
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,800
Right. There's no good reason.

545
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,449
It's probably for marketing purposes or something. I mean,

546
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,550
well, actually, you know,

547
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,569
it's probably so on the web you why you can search and stuff?

548
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,369
-- That would be my bet. It just makes it easier
-- to, I had someone point out

549
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,660
that with last pass. If you went to a website that

550
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,849
had, you had an account with

551
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:48,900
the prompt, last pass gave you was different than if you didn't.

552
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,859
You know what I mean?

553
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:52,660
Where it was like, oh, log in with your last pass versus like,

554
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,829
we don't know anything about this.

555
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,180
And so they think that's one of the reasons they captured this,

556
00:24:57,189 --> 00:24:59,449
but obviously there's way better ways.

557
00:24:59,459 --> 00:24:59,949
Ok,

558
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:02,719
-- so where are we at? We're at shutting down
-- last.

559
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,030
So one thing I'm gonna say

560
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:07,420
is while you're doing your password rotation,

561
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,310
consider enabling two fa And it's funny because

562
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,640
I actually just had the experience of

563
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,540
almost being locked out of an account.

564
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,829
Uh So I went to renew my, I got an email to renew my Nexus pass, you know,

565
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,790
my Nexus card to get into the US without having to go in the line of, you know,

566
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,729
silly people who don't know how to take their shoes off.

567
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,310
Uh, no, seriously,

568
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,829
that's why I got the Nexus pass was so I can go on the people who know how to travel line.

569
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,060
That's it.

570
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,979
And it's funny because when I told my mom, she's like, what? And I'm like,

571
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,760
and she's like, oh, I want to go on that line too. And so she got hers.

572
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,939
I went to, you know, login.gov, which man, I love that site that is so well executed

573
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,310
and it's like, you know, oh, good.

574
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,329
My user name and password, you know, and then it's like two a, a code and I'm like, uh,

575
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:49,079
or my, um, my hard work key and it's like, I just rotated my hierarchies and I'm like,

576
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:50,130
I forgot that one.

577
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,369
I totally forgot logging.gov because I only use it like,

578
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,750
every four or five years to renew it.

579
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,199
Luckily they make you do a code on your phone and then let you do the key like Mastodon.

580
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,739
And so I'm like, on my phone I'm like login dot A. It's there. I'm so happy.

581
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,459
So

582
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,739
definitely, if you're setting, if you're, you're using hardware tokens,

583
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,459
make dang sure.

584
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,030
See, this is what I hate about hardware tokens.

585
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,479
Even if you have two hardware tokens at some point in the future,

586
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,260
if you want to rotate them or lose them or something,

587
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:20,729
are you going to be sure that you got all the sites that you log in using the tokens for?

588
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:21,689
Because it's not like

589
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,849
the token will

590
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,780
export a list or tell you of what's in there, right?

591
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,380
That, that's a possibility with 502, there's the discovery protocol,

592
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,530
but almost nobody uses it.

593
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,569
-- Well, it can only hold a set number of keys as well
-- also that, yeah,

594
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,410
but the point is like given a token, I can't query the token for like, what,

595
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,560
what did I set you up for again?

596
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:40,770
Because I don't honestly remember.

597
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:42,810
That's right. That's right. Yep. Yep.

598
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,819
So be careful setting your two fa up. Make sure you have,

599
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,640
well, like set one up on your phone or, or

600
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,000
one password conveniently also does TA

601
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,300
P stuff, right? You can,

602
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:55,520
you can put the thing into one password,

603
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:57,390
you know,

604
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,949
which of course scares everybody because now your

605
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:01,180
two fa is like dependent on one application,

606
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:04,040
but hopefully it's actually encrypted and they don't get breached.

607
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:08,910
It's complicated. It's, I'm not gonna say it's right or wrong again.

608
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,020
This goes back to the very beginning everyone

609
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,319
has tradeoffs for everything you need to do

610
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,750
and losing your second factor

611
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,430
may be realistic or expected

612
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,979
versus putting something into one password.

613
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,709
-- That is a totally normal thing for people to do. We've had it
-- happen for most people.

614
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,739
It totally is like,

615
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,959
we're freaks because we have multiple backups,

616
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,969
which that's actually really hard to do.

617
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:34,290
But one thing that came up is I realized is like S MS

618
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,939
was a fine to fa authentication method until Attackers started attacking it.

619
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:40,800
And that's the thing with these password managers

620
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,239
in theory. Ok.

621
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,420
Something like bit warden is pretty hard to attack

622
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,069
because it would have to be a targeted attack.

623
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:46,339
Right?

624
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:48,310
I have to go after you to get to your machine to

625
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,939
get to your encrypted vault to download it and crack it.

626
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,229
That's really unlikely in theory.

627
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,780
Things like one password and last pass,

628
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,219
they're really good at security and they would prevent this.

629
00:27:57,229 --> 00:27:58,939
Well, oops, as it turns out,

630
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,219
realistically,

631
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,050
I would say,

632
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,640
putting all your eggs in one well protected basket is

633
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,060
fine as long as that basket is actually well protected.

634
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:08,439
And the problem is we don't know that it is.

635
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:09,439
Right.

636
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,560
It's whatever the company says it is and maybe they're lying,

637
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:12,479
maybe they're telling the truth.

638
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,699
And then the second thing of course is,

639
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,380
uh, you know, a tree doesn't fall in a forest until somebody cuts it down. Well,

640
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,660
until Attackers actually start going after one password.

641
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,479
-- Yeah, one password's pretty
-- secure.

642
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,680
I mean, we think it is, it seems to be their security.

643
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:28,689
Well, until anybody tries to attack it,

644
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:32,530
it's fine. But once people attack it, maybe it's easy, maybe it's really hard.

645
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:32,989
Don't know.

646
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,300
And that's the problem here is we're

647
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,780
trying to make security trade offs and judgments

648
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,339
with unknown risks,

649
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,920
very unknown risk. And so

650
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:45,239
I personally shove everything in one password because I'm just like, you know what?

651
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,569
I, I know, I'm absolutely 100% likely to accidentally delete all my data.

652
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:49,479
Much more so than,

653
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,560
you know, like a last password breaking.

654
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,349
I agree with that

655
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:56,589
and it, it was more likely until it wasn't.

656
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,780
And now it sucks

657
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:00,310
-- like the time that guy drove into my house.
-- Right.

658
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,869
No, it never happens until I get home. And I'm like,

659
00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:04,689
look,

660
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,500
here's the thing I keep telling myself as I'm

661
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,420
going through the pain and suffering of changing passwords

662
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:11,209
is

663
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:15,250
this is a Black Swan event. Basically.

664
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,579
I don't expect to have to do this for at least a year.

665
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,449
Right.

666
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,760
I know it could happen again. I'm completely aware of that,

667
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,569
but there's a big difference between having an

668
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:30,030
incident with your password manager every month versus

669
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,050
every year or every decade.

670
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,680
And I think anything a year or more can justify

671
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,410
the multiple hours of pain and suffering we're going through

672
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,369
because this is just the way it is like

673
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:43,687
advantages I get from having a password manager vastly outweigh

674
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:47,266
the probably day I'm going to lose my life changing all my passwords.

675
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:49,006
Well, I've changed most of them.

676
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:49,296
I,

677
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:51,136
so the way I've approached this is rather

678
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:53,136
than like sitting down and slogging through,

679
00:29:53,146 --> 00:29:56,376
I have been changing, we'll say about a dozen a day

680
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:57,416
for,

681
00:29:57,516 --> 00:30:00,516
it's been weeks now that I've been working on this and,

682
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:03,416
and the other thing I do is every time I log into a site

683
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:06,384
I change a password, if it hasn't been changed already, which

684
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:08,933
like I just did that this morning, I got an email from fedex.

685
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:10,663
That was like, oh, we have a package coming for you.

686
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:12,343
You should log in and see what's going on. I log in.

687
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:15,303
And I'm like, oh, good, I'll change this password, you know, and it took 10 seconds,

688
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:17,004
10 seconds time to billion.

689
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:22,053
-- And this
-- is one of the advantages of I've been using password managers for a

690
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:23,583
better part of a decade now.

691
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:27,413
And all my passwords are computer generated

692
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:28,061
or

693
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,921
pretty random in that I just mash, you know,

694
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,191
text into a notepad and then cut and paste it and

695
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:35,110
store it because I don't have to remember the dang thing.

696
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,311
Like,

697
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:37,890
I only have to remember my icloud and my one

698
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:40,750
password pass and my Google pass and everything else is

699
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:44,441
damn, I better get access to that one password file where I am up the creek, you know,

700
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:47,230
and that's the advantage is I only really have three passwords for, well,

701
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,270
and my local login password.

702
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:51,461
So I have four passwords to remember. And so they can actually be good because

703
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,869
there's no way I'm gonna remember 800 passwords even remotely a little bit.

704
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:56,790
Ok.

705
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,380
You just reminded me of something it will end on this note is, well,

706
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,130
there's two other things.

707
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,650
So first of all, shutting down your last pass account, like do it, but it,

708
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,530
it isn't really going to matter

709
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,290
is kind of my, my takeaway there and it's gonna be hard to do.

710
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,689
They already have your account.

711
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,609
-- The horse has left the barn, the horse
-- has left the barn

712
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,000
last pass is not making it very easy to disable accounts.

713
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,040
-- They've definitely done some shenanigans.
-- Oh, it's always been that way.

714
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,030
It's, it was

715
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,260
literally to get our corporate accounts turned off. I basically, like

716
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,619
it was

717
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,500
an arduous process

718
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:30,500
that doesn't surprise me at all. I'm, I'm

719
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:32,959
given everything we've seen. I expect it.

720
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,900
They used to have a lot of dark patterns on their website and from a quick glance,

721
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,219
they still seem to have most of them

722
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,020
and I, from what I've gathered, it's gotten worse.

723
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,060
I believe that

724
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,530
I think they might be in the Doom

725
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:43,839
loop.

726
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:45,410
This kind of behavior says doom

727
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,800
-- loop. To me,
-- it, it, it might be, I mean, I,

728
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,790
I don't think they need to do

729
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,706
Loop. I think this incident is just doom.

730
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:53,806
-- Well,
-- but now people are actually leaving and that's the thing.

731
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:59,576
Like, because you got to think password managers are one of the stickiest apps.

732
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:02,276
I mean, we're all seeing why it's horrible to change.

733
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:05,706
The only thing stickier is probably your email address.

734
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,436
Like we have cell phone number portability.

735
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:10,166
Your email address is super sticky.

736
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:10,806
So,

737
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:13,671
like the fact that people are actually talking

738
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,541
about moving and some people are moving,

739
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:16,761
like, especially in tech circles.

740
00:32:16,932 --> 00:32:20,342
-- Yeah, you, you're done ducked up
-- bigly. Lots of people are moving.

741
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,991
I mean, everyone I talk to, that's like, what should I do at last pass?

742
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:25,072
I just keep saying, like, get off it, don't use it.

743
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:26,112
You can't trust them,

744
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:27,991
you can't trust them. And that's the thing.

745
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:31,352
One, password storage and management is kind of a high trust activity.

746
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:33,671
-- It's
-- a
-- very high trust. Exactly. Exactly. That,

747
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:34,631
all right. So, anyway,

748
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,140
uh, yeah, I guess my,

749
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,040
my one thing I want to leave with that I should have talked about way at the beginning

750
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,500
is master passwords.

751
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:44,680
Don't your master password should be like 20 plus characters long.

752
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,010
It's a pass phrase, right? Don't use short ones.

753
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,089
Even if you think like, oh,

754
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:51,719
I used a letter in a symbol or a number and a symbol or whatever.

755
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:52,239
Like, no,

756
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:54,089
you something very, very long.

757
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,229
There's many, many places, I'll try to find one.

758
00:32:57,239 --> 00:33:01,140
There's a really nice one, Bob Lord actually sent along uh uh some days ago.

759
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:01,650
But

760
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:08,199
there are very nice examples of how to generate pass phrases out on the internet,

761
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:11,859
like look one up and use it and generate a long good pass phrase.

762
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:13,310
I don't care

763
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:17,760
how many symbols you used. Like anything less than probably 25

764
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:20,790
ish. Not, I shouldn't say that. Maybe what, 10 to 16,

765
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,280
anything less than that

766
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:27,250
as a password is just way too short. Now, we have, we have too much stuff to crack.

767
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,930
It depends on how it's stored. So for example, if they shaw 512 hash it,

768
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,880
that is super insecure because Sha 512 is super

769
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:36,020
duper fast

770
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:40,310
on modern hardware because it literally has a Shaw 512 in silicon implementation.

771
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,479
-- Whereas you're getting
-- to, no, that's not helpful advice.

772
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,099
The helpful advice is use a password,

773
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,390
use a

774
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,459
password because the,

775
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,239
and again,

776
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,579
this is back to you're trying to make a security decision based on unknowns.

777
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:51,910
Now, if it's something like, you know, key

778
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,189
pass

779
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,489
X, you can actually check and verify that. Yes, it's storing my ma

780
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,250
or it's doing X encryption with the master password.

781
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,959
But with last pass, like for all, we know it's ro 13 in it.

782
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,599
-- Uh
-- I

783
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:05,260
think there was work done on that, but whatever it doesn't matter, we're out of time,

784
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,459
I guess.

785
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,979
Good luck everyone.

786
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,429
If you're in our boat, we know exactly what you're going through

787
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,770
and it sucks and it's a marathon,

788
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:14,899
but keep with it

789
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,020
and you definitely won't regret it. So

790
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,300
that's that I guess

791
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,149
I just

792
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,280
thank you for listening.

793
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,620
I just keep coming back to like,

794
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:24,958
there are so many things I'd rather be spending my time on than this.

795
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,820
And I'm actually, no,

796
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,199
I'm actually quite angry towards last pass because I actually moved out

797
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,418
of them months ago and I still have to deal with this.

798
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,580
And I'm quite angry because

799
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,379
this is a chunk of my time in life. I'll never get back

800
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,340
because the downside of dealing with like if somebody gets into my bank account,

801
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,889
that's gonna be even more hours of

802
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,010
it would be way worse.

803
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:44,629
It

804
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,929
is what it is like. Sometimes it sucks and we just gotta do it.

805
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:51,050
-- This is like eating vegetables, deal with it.
-- Not if you deep fry them.
