Hello, listener,

1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,609
Future Josh. Here

2
00:00:02,809 --> 00:00:06,099
it turns out that we're almost certainly incorrect

3
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:10,130
in the basis of the Apple lawsuit being founded on copyright.

4
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:13,789
So everything you're going to listen to past this point

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,600
will say may be amusing but is factually incorrect.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,559
I apologize for this heinous error.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,989
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,060
Kurt Siefried and my partner in probably not violating copyright doctrine.

9
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:38,139
-- Josh Pressers.
-- I mean, we violate copyright constantly every day. What is it?

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,599
The average person has over a million dollars

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,099
in copyright violations in a single day.

12
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:43,889
You know what?

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,180
There's actually a really good wired article a few weeks ago about

14
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:48,369
kind of what happened to all those people that got sued for ump

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,009
Kilian infinity dollars back in the day with Napster and stuff.

16
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,389
Remember there were all those law firms sending out, you know, just

17
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:55,619
mass

18
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:58,250
demand letters and suing them and, and

19
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:01,349
what I love is most of these law firms turned out to be totally like,

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,549
I think a couple of them actually ended up in jail.

21
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,129
I'm

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,949
shocked by this. They were so

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,510
uh let's say poorly run.

24
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,199
But yeah. No, it's it's interesting.

25
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,819
So today, uh well, not today, but like recently the Apple

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,980
Corporation

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,059
sued the NSO group to prevent them from using Apple products and services.

28
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:23,870
Yeah, I found that really wild

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,519
when I read this story.

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,879
OK. First of all,

31
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,260
disclaimers me and Josh are, are, you know,

32
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,569
I think we made it very clear in our previous show in the NFL

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,099
group that we're not in favor of companies that enable repressive regimes to,

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,150
you know, spy on journalists and human rights activists, not fans.

35
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,750
No, that's double plus on good. And at the same time

36
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:50,629
though, I, I suspect although I, I'm not certain, but I suspect like myself,

37
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,930
Josh feels very nervous

38
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:54,379
about a company

39
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,209
restricting who can use a physical product or a sort

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,699
of a common service that enables that physical product because

41
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:05,699
I, I'm not going to say Apple has a monopoly, but essentially you have a,

42
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,130
you have a choice, you have Android or Apple when it comes to mobile phones.

43
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,919
And so part of me is very, very nervous about a large company,

44
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:19,419
basically legally banning another organization because it next week

45
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,419
it could be journalists or human rights lawyers.

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,500
I mean,

47
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,449
maybe it's

48
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,660
the service aspect I can get behind because for example,

49
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,220
stores can trespass people who are problematic and say, you know,

50
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:32,089
this is private property.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,979
You can't come on here,

52
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:33,740
done.

53
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:35,330
But Walmart, for example,

54
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,339
you know, they, they generally don't ban people from buying stuff from them,

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,470
say online or whatever. So

56
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,110
Walmart doesn't. But actually a good comparison here would be

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,020
the Walt Disney Corporation

58
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,520
where if you break certain rules at their parks,

59
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:54,220
-- you're banned for life.
-- Well, but again, you're on their physical space.

60
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,539
OK.

61
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,869
II, I feel like this has gone to a weird place.

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,570
Well, no, no, but I think actually, you know, no, there is a close parallel because,

63
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,740
ok, in the physical world you're in their physical space,

64
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,979
there's lots of laws around trespass and all that stuff.

65
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,490
And in the virtual world, like if I'm,

66
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:09,710
if I have an iphone that's not connected to the internet, it's kind of my device.

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,910
But if I, the moment I start using icloud,

68
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:16,309
I'm on Apple's turf, like I'm literally in their servers doing stuff. That is true.

69
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:16,860
So

70
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,940
the service aspect,

71
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,979
I guess I can sort of see the parallels with trespassing and saying, you know,

72
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,869
to put it bluntly if somebody is kind of very abusive of your online services, yeah,

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,789
you're probably going to boot them or restrict them.

74
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:33,869
I mean, yeah, so, so actually a great example is as part of the,

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,350
the now renamed Global Security Database

76
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,770
project with the cloud security Alliance,

77
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,279
which we'll talk about that another day.

78
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:39,550
But

79
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,509
I,

80
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,270
we get these requests from the Linux kernel people

81
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:46,080
to file a bunch of identifiers against the kernel.

82
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:49,210
And so I file generally anywhere between one and 300

83
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,389
things at, at a go

84
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,029
and it is very common for me to trip up the

85
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:54,720
github.

86
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,339
They're rate limiting

87
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,539
their anti rule.

88
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,059
And it's funny because it's very poorly documented.

89
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,610
I don't totally understand what's going on.

90
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:04,440
But, like, yeah, all the time, they're like, oh, you're using too much resources.

91
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,339
-- Ha ha. You're kicked out for a while.
-- Well, and that's an north

92
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:06,779
oral problem.

93
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,039
But one challenge is when you have abuse limiting systems you

94
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,759
can't tell the bad guys what those abuse limits are otherwise.

95
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, it's like the old all the spam that scored 4.9 on spam assassin meant, you know,

96
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,529
the default cut off of five shockingly, right?

97
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,920
And so,

98
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:22,248
and, and again, that, that's another

99
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,319
set of separate set of arguments where, you know,

100
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:27,729
I hate these calf cask abuse systems where it's like you can't do that.

101
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:28,908
Why not? What am I doing wrong?

102
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,618
Well, we can't tell you because then you could abuse it more.

103
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:36,889
So let's back up a little bit and just say like, what is Apple actually doing?

104
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,438
So from what I can tell

105
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:44,799
Apple's goal is to cripple the nso group and not let them essentially find

106
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,109
security flaws in their products

107
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,399
and actively, you know, build products that actively exploit them,

108
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,100
which

109
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,869
-- when I say that out loud, I'm kind of like, I kind of
-- want that.

110
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,750
I mean, I, I don't think anyone would disagree with that necessarily.

111
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,750
And

112
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,484
so it, it sounds like from what I've read and I, I don't,

113
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:04,885
I am not a lawyer

114
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:08,184
and I don't totally understand the dynamics here,

115
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:12,285
but it sounds like Apple is using copyright

116
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,964
as the basis of this lawsuit where they're,

117
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:17,954
they're claiming that the NSO group is

118
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:20,804
violating their copyright on their software.

119
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:21,454
Yeah.

120
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:24,204
And I'm, I'm kind of surprised they didn't go with like end user license agreement.

121
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:24,875
But regardless,

122
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:28,614
I think the reason they're going with copyright is there's a very famous court case,

123
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,674
Costco Wholesale Group versus Omega S A.

124
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:34,109
So the deal is Omega makes fancy watches that cost a lot of money

125
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,429
and they price them differently globally, right?

126
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,600
They'll be more expensive in North America for

127
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,910
the exact same watch than say in Europe.

128
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,709
So Costco is kind of like cool,

129
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,260
that's what you call an arbitrage opportunity.

130
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:50,510
And so Costco, but you know, bought a big pile of watches in jurisdiction. A

131
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:55,000
shipped them in a container to jurisdiction B and sold them there at a profit.

132
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:56,609
And Omega

133
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,350
lost their minds and sued them because

134
00:05:59,459 --> 00:05:59,730
you know,

135
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:04,730
this totally violates Omega's attempts to extract every last penny out of there and

136
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:05,809
consumers.

137
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,609
And so they sued Costco

138
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,730
successfully in uh what is this 2008

139
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:12,130
for

140
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:13,640
copyright violation?

141
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,480
Because obviously every Omega watch has, you know,

142
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:17,489
Omega stamped on the back or the front or whatever.

143
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,019
And of course, Costco fired back with for sale doctrine, you know, like

144
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,690
we bought these things, we, we can put them in the garbage, we can use them as plates,

145
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,230
we can,

146
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,570
I guess, really small cup holders for your, you know, Demita,

147
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:32,279
um, or,

148
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:33,940
you know, we could, we could sell them on.

149
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,540
Right.

150
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:38,929
And unfortunately, in my opinion, the court ruled against them,

151
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,019
uh, and said that

152
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,940
basically the first sale doctrine does not act as a defense to claims

153
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,899
of infringing distribution and importation for

154
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,029
unauthorized sale of authentic imported watches.

155
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,420
that board design registered in the copyright office.

156
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:51,140
I mean, yeah, there's,

157
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,200
there's some legal precedent here for using copyright law to restrict what a

158
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:58,010
person can do with your product that they legally purchased and legally owned.

159
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:58,859
Well, I mean,

160
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:03,660
this isn't comparable to that though because I legally purchased an iphone.

161
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,820
The NSO group didn't purchase my iphone.

162
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,109
No, no, no, but the, the NSO group bought their own iphone stuff

163
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,390
that

164
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,429
exploits

165
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:11,899
and you know.

166
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:15,589
-- Ok.
-- Yeah. Yeah. All right. I understand. I understand.

167
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,290
II, I don't know. I mean,

168
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,220
I, I guess this is where I sit on. This is, I feel like

169
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,850
in many instances copyright has become this strange hammer,

170
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:32,140
everyone uses to just pound every nail.

171
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,540
They see. And this is kind of an example of it. I, I feel like

172
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:40,679
what the NSO group does feels wrong.

173
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,079
It is,

174
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,959
is it illegal? I mean, I think the, the research isn't going to be illegal,

175
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:48,760
right?

176
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,609
But the attacking someone's device I suspect

177
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:54,679
is potentially illegal under certain contexts.

178
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:54,940
Yeah.

179
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,000
So a couple of comments here, I mean, there's,

180
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,059
there's a lot of activities that can or

181
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,480
cannot be illegal depending on intent mens rea

182
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,119
right?

183
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:04,559
So for example,

184
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,350
OK, perfect example, I see fire in your house.

185
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:10,630
So I run in, kick down the front door and go looking for people to take,

186
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,109
take out of there

187
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,929
versus I kick down your front door and take, you know, and I'm, you,

188
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,559
you find me in your living room, you know, uninstalling your TV, from the wall,

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,529
right?

190
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,609
The, the cops are gonna have, well,

191
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:22,920
hopefully the cops are gonna have two

192
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:25,220
very different reactions to those situationss.

193
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,470
I hope

194
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,269
so. I think part of it is intent because

195
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:33,429
clearly the nso group has the intent of, of,

196
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,469
well, you know,

197
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,030
doing things that let's ignore if it's illegal

198
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,200
or not because really that's not Apple's problem,

199
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,429
right?

200
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,900
If, if somebody does something illegal with one of your products,

201
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,869
that's something that the courts should deal with.

202
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,299
Not

203
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:46,909
you. You know what I'm saying?

204
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,190
Like there's a reason they're, they're felonies and they require prosecution and,

205
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,510
and

206
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,880
the justice system,

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,390
you know, it's not up to you to kind of handle that.

208
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,710
Um,

209
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,469
but I just,

210
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,659
and the other thing is copyright law. Yeah, it has become this monster

211
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,469
and I think part of the challenge is because

212
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,460
it has been successfully used like the Omega versus Costco um, court case.

213
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,679
But also if you lose your copyright if you use

214
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,739
copyright as an argument and you lose the case,

215
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:18,719
it's not like your copyright protections kind of go away.

216
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:20,619
It's just you fail to extend them.

217
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,640
Right. Right. Right. And so that makes it a much, sort of safer.

218
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:24,729
I,

219
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:25,960
I would assume it makes it sort of a

220
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:28,760
safer legal argument and that there's less downside.

221
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,320
It's like we can try this and if we fail cool, we can try something else.

222
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,919
-- I,
-- I think there's another angle to this

223
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:34,840
that

224
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,440
I, I haven't seen anyone talk about but

225
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:42,039
if Apple is successful in going after nso

226
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,479
in this way,

227
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:44,510
they could

228
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,219
not just them but

229
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,530
right. Any, any security research could fall under this umbrella and,

230
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,719
and while Apple might say, oh no, we're not going to bother security researchers.

231
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,150
Wink Wink. I mean, are you,

232
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,140
you know

233
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,190
that that specter is always there?

234
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,359
Yeah,

235
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,729
that's, I mean,

236
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,630
not

237
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,575
that, that's what I always say about these poorly written laws where they're like,

238
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,155
oh, well, we're not going to enforce it badly.

239
00:10:09,164 --> 00:10:09,604
We're just,

240
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,494
you know, it's, it's not the greatest law,

241
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,625
but we'll enforce it selectively and do it properly.

242
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:18,645
No, if the law is bad, the law is bad and using selective enforcement of laws

243
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:21,875
-- is not the solution. The solution is to
-- patent trolls, right.

244
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:26,434
Patent trolls are like the perfect example of good intentions gone wrong.

245
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,969
Yeah. Well, and copyright trolls, right?

246
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,349
Suing people for listening, you know,

247
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:33,750
downloading music on Napster and suing them for empty ma jillion dollars.

248
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah.

249
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,169
Right. Right. So,

250
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:36,309
I,

251
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:42,210
I worry because if, if Apple wins this court case, then Apple can. Absolutely.

252
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,369
But the problem is not just Apple, then any company can shut down security research,

253
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,469
claiming copyright.

254
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:50,119
Oh, yes. Yes. Exactly.

255
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,109
And, and I might be slightly less concerned about Apple in some context,

256
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,880
although I know some security researchers that would disagree with me,

257
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,549
but

258
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,190
there are many companies that

259
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:05,369
say are hostile to security researchers and giving them this ammo

260
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:08,380
will just make things considerably worse. OK.

261
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,130
So I can't find a link to what I wanted to.

262
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,250
But basically there are documented cases of technical companies selling software

263
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,080
where the contracts expressly forbid you from

264
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,250
benchmarking the software and publishing those benchmark results.

265
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,119
So VM Ware did that back in the day

266
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:25,809
because

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,369
I, I remember

268
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,729
there was

269
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,489
it was it's around virtualization because

270
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,690
a long time ago,

271
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,609
virtualization didn't happen like in chip like it does where you

272
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:41,799
have like the magic ring negative one in the processor.

273
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:42,619
And so

274
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,010
VM Ware

275
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,770
built special technology to kind of

276
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,090
will say

277
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,349
inspect the pipeline

278
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,559
that's that's being sent to your CPU and then hijack some of

279
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,549
the operations because you couldn't do

280
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,799
virtualization and it wasn't very efficient,

281
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:00,570
but it was OK.

282
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:02,140
But when you had,

283
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,469
when you use VMWARE, they had an explicit cause in it.

284
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,469
They said you cannot use this to benchmark.

285
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,570
And there were obviously competitors coming out

286
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,200
that had some wicked fast technology,

287
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:15,010
Zen Xen, the which now does proper virtualization,

288
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,330
but it did what was called para virtualization back

289
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,080
in the day and para virtualization was very,

290
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,799
very fast.

291
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,000
Whereas actual virtualization was very, very slow,

292
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,710
except no one could show that because VM Ware said,

293
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:29,005
-- well, you're not allowed to benchmark our stuff.
-- It literally says

294
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:33,804
in the license, it's section 1.4. So it's right at the top after, you know,

295
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,424
-- is it still
-- there benchmarking?

296
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:37,655
You may use the software to conduct

297
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,554
internal performance testing and benchmarking studies.

298
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:42,184
You may only publish, distribute the results of the studies to third parties.

299
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,905
If we have reviewed and approved of the methodology, assumptions

300
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,724
and other parameters of the study prior to publication and distribution,

301
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:51,395
please contact us at benchmark and fwa.com to request review and approval.

302
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:52,325
Ouch.

303
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:55,780
This is I googled like VM Ware

304
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:56,780
Ya and

305
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:59,619
last updated may 3 2021.

306
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,859
So it's still there is a bit of an understatement.

307
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:03,780
It's,

308
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,750
yeah.

309
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:05,609
Wow.

310
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,369
I,

311
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:09,849
yeah, I thought anyways and, and that's my, my fear is,

312
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:14,130
I guess the good news is with open source licenses.

313
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,179
They're, they're unlikely to change the licenses to include these kind of clauses,

314
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,299
but they could.

315
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,820
No, no, no, you can't.

316
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,219
That's not open source.

317
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,750
Well, no, at that point, I would agree.

318
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,330
That's like a very fundamental limitation of your, your rights and freedoms that,

319
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,489
you know, Richard Stallman is gonna excuse me,

320
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,460
Richard Stallman is gonna pop out of your closet while you're sleeping and haunt you

321
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,719
-- levels of,
-- you know,

322
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,250
-- Stallman already haunts us all.
-- I know.

323
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:39,190
Um,

324
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:40,580
but, uh

325
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:41,940
yeah, I, uh

326
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,390
because we've already seen this with

327
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,150
cloud services where they just straight up in the term,

328
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,270
say you can't security test this because,

329
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,229
well, and in fairness, it might kind of mess up things for everybody.

330
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,010
I mean, I've been on both sides of this particular problem and

331
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,390
the, the challenge kind of becomes when you're,

332
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,989
when you're a service,

333
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,380
if you have people that want to test your, your actual production,

334
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,070
like

335
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:10,150
I've seen people do like, denial of service and they'll be like, oh,

336
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,340
your prod is broken.

337
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:15,510
It's like, no, you're an idiot, like, don't denial of service stuff like this is,

338
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,570
of course, now that's way harder to do if you have a proper infrastructure.

339
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,119
But, you know,

340
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,710
like 5, 10 years ago, it was, it was very different.

341
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:24,599
But now at the same time when I'm a customer of a cloud service

342
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,770
and I say, you know, show me your p test.

343
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:32,340
They're like, oh, we, we didn't run one and it's like, what now, I mean, come on.

344
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,820
Well, and here's something that all of this fundamentally

345
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,450
misses, uh when people discuss it is that, that really bad people,

346
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,429
they don't abide by the

347
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,359
es in court case like they will go and happily break the law.

348
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:47,619
And I mean, that's just it.

349
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,799
So like the thing is with the NSO group and this is,

350
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:52,020
this is one of the things I've been thinking about is

351
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,309
the NSO group is a legitimate company doing semi

352
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,349
illegitimate things is how I would describe it. It may be completely illegitimate.

353
00:14:59,359 --> 00:14:59,900
You know what I mean?

354
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,299
I, I, whatever,

355
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,340
but now there's obviously plenty of,

356
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:07,799
we'll say sketchy organizations doing similar things.

357
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:12,619
And I think in the case of NSO group, I would just argue, they kind of got caught.

358
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,640
If they didn't get caught, we wouldn't know who they were,

359
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,169
we wouldn't be talking about them.

360
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:17,419
I mean,

361
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:20,799
they're legendary for not answering questions.

362
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,549
Well, I think part of the challenge too is they're doing it at scale, right?

363
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,059
It's, if an attacker finds a zero day

364
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:30,880
and uses it to try and, you know, put crypto mining software on people's devices,

365
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,440
yeah, that's bad.

366
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,859
But it's not that like nobody's going to die,

367
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:34,650
but

368
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,349
with what the NSO group is doing, they're doing it at scale and they're enabling

369
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,169
governments to do things that well, absolutely will result in people dying.

370
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,859
And I, so,

371
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,130
yeah, it's tough because

372
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,210
here's my view on this,

373
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,320
the end result of what Apple is trying to accomplish. I'm like, yeah,

374
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,179
yes. But the way they're doing it and the way that it will allow them

375
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,840
to then apply that to other people. And more importantly,

376
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,289
you know, because we have uh

377
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,150
well, essentially precedent setting cases matter,

378
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,010
this, this is going to, if this sets a precedent, that's,

379
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,650
that's a pretty big precedent.

380
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,539
I mean, it's going to set a precedent either way,

381
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,530
no matter how this ends. I think

382
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,250
humans lose.

383
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:18,710
Yeah.

384
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,010
Well, and I mean, apple,

385
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,010
I assume they have infinity million dollars to spend on this case,

386
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,450
they do have infinity dollars to spend on everything.

387
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,119
Like I'm assuming for them they've budgeted already several, you know, large

388
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,929
numbers

389
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:33,719
and

390
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,849
a rounding error for them. Exactly. You know,

391
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:38,950
17 minutes of iphone sales.

392
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:39,460
That's

393
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:39,679
right.

394
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:43,010
And so I do kind of worry because

395
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,609
also

396
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,359
I just, like I said, the, the, the concern I have is, is

397
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,510
even if Apple pledges not to be evil and even if Apple does a whole bunch of, you know,

398
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,340
legal protections to ensure that they can't use this for evil.

399
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,400
Other companies absolutely can.

400
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,080
And I worry about this unintended consequence

401
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:03,840
of, you know, are we going to see a situation where especially

402
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,729
all the commercial providers and,

403
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:08,618
you know, essentially go wow. Ok. Awesome.

404
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,680
We can just make the security researchers go away.

405
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:12,339
-- I
-- mean, maybe there will be some of that.

406
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:15,520
So let's, let's move this conversation a little bit because I think it's,

407
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,290
it's just becoming depressing.

408
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,098
So here's a better question.

409
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,219
So

410
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,569
Apple wants to stop N Ss O group. Let's say they do.

411
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,930
Is it going to fundamentally

412
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,930
change

413
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,689
the

414
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,510
vulnerability and attack landscape? Do you think?

415
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,040
-- I don't think
-- so?

416
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,420
It's basically going to make it much harder for

417
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,709
this one entity to do it and maybe others,

418
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,410
but fundamentally

419
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:38,369
right, they

420
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:41,770
apple needs to go fix software security

421
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:42,775
and, you know,

422
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,094
iMessage and they need to,

423
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,875
you know, keep improving their face recognition.

424
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:49,574
You know, it's my understanding is, for example, is it won't work if you're asleep,

425
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:51,135
you have to move a bit, which is awesome.

426
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:53,734
You know, that fundamentally,

427
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:58,474
well, the bad, bad people are going to keep looking for flaws because, well,

428
00:17:58,484 --> 00:17:59,935
there's gold in those hills.

429
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:04,614
Well, and so that's just it. Right. So if Apple delegitimize,

430
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:08,655
I guess we'll say above the board security research,

431
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,199
some of those people will go do other things, some of them will just go underground.

432
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,920
There is a huge underground market for this kind of stuff.

433
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,760
And

434
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:18,699
if you, I'm,

435
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:23,300
I'm not suggesting NSO group is above the board by any means in doing this.

436
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:23,619
But

437
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,839
even without NSO, I mean, honestly,

438
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:30,560
this more feels like retribution against NSO than anything else.

439
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,560
Well, I,

440
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,290
yeah, it's, I'm assuming it's getting

441
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:38,175
at these levels, it kind of gets into political territory and all bets are off.

442
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:41,604
-- I
-- mean, maybe, but I mean, fundamentally at the end of the day,

443
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:45,055
let's say NSO group loses, they become

444
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,655
neutered to the point they can't function anymore

445
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:50,895
and they cease to exist like nothing changes.

446
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,375
Yeah, I mean, there, there's a clear,

447
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:56,015
there's a clear demand for that product and service

448
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:59,689
and there's much less, let's say,

449
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,979
ethically and morally bound people who will probably,

450
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:05,880
you know, there again, there's, there's money, there's gold in those hills,

451
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,739
let's go mine it.

452
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:09,199
Yeah. Yeah, there's tons of money

453
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,280
in the zero day market. And,

454
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:12,319
I mean,

455
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,219
here's where I think you can start making some strange arguments,

456
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,300
like you could say, apple should take this money

457
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:20,689
and harden their products.

458
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:21,319
My

459
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,079
thing is they're already doing, like, they're already doing quite a lot of that.

460
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,010
II, I agree. I agree. I, I suspect they're spending

461
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,589
far more than many of us can even comprehend.

462
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,199
They have their own CPU now with, you know, built in secure enclave. Like,

463
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,390
yeah. Yeah.

464
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:37,790
But I,

465
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,670
I mean, I mean. Right. Right. They still do some silly security things.

466
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,719
You could argue. Like, I know icloud backups aren't encrypted very well.

467
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:47,920
And obviously

468
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,939
iMessage still has far too much access to the system.

469
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:53,640
Well, some of that though is there,

470
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,650
you know,

471
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,670
remember when Cal

472
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:57,969
and all the wire

473
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:01,729
essentially when VoIP started taking off and all the phone, you know,

474
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,140
all the, the, the wiretapping laws were like, yeah, that's cool.

475
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,569
But you're still going to need to be able to provide us with wiretaps.

476
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,729
Right.

477
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,780
And I remember, you know,

478
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,959
back in the early two thousands when this was a huge deal and it's like,

479
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,930
I'm sorry, but like, if you're a legitimate phone company,

480
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:19,109
you can't not do this because then the men are going to show up and then the,

481
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,819
and with guns were going to show up and they're

482
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:22,439
going to shut you down for breaking the law.

483
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,170
So, as a company you kind of have to,

484
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,709
you kind of have to abide by the laws of the jurisdiction you're in.

485
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:29,000
Right.

486
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,410
-- That's sort of how this works. The shame
-- and the Clipper chip never caught out.

487
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,709
Right.

488
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,310
Oh, I know.

489
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:34,719
Yeah.

490
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:39,689
Anyone who doesn't know what the Clifford Chip is, just go look it up.

491
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:41,479
You'll, you'll love what you find.

492
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,849
-- It's a sad story.
-- Well, it was born of the time,

493
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:46,699
you know, that

494
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,699
we're not talking about Clipper

495
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:50,609
today, maybe some day, not today.

496
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,729
I do.

497
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,540
I feel like open source is generally safe in this because I, I cannot imagine

498
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,300
like every time an open source project changes their license, you know,

499
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,560
that the world collectively goes a bit bonkers for a while.

500
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:06,599
Well, I don't think it's comparable. I think Apple is using

501
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,984
a very odd and unique aspect of copyright to their advantage here.

502
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:11,224
And it's,

503
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:13,704
it's almost certainly not part of the intent

504
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:16,344
of copyright to exert this kind of control.

505
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:18,954
And I think when you look at things like open source licenses,

506
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:21,214
they explicitly shed

507
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,104
a lot of the copyright,

508
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:24,704
I guess intent.

509
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,469
I, I mean, funny enough.

510
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:29,689
So Apple is abusing copyright against NSO group,

511
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:32,099
whereas I would also argue open source licenses

512
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:34,280
abuse copyright in a completely different way.

513
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:38,410
Oh, absolutely. And and that's part of the legal hack. That, that was the clever bit.

514
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:38,579
Yeah.

515
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,219
Right.

516
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:43,270
Right. Right. Because, I mean, generally speaking, copyright is used

517
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,579
to restrict,

518
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:49,819
whereas in the case of open source copyright is used to unrestrict, which is

519
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,280
depending on that point of view, you know, BS D versus

520
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,839
GP L versus,

521
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:54,989
you know,

522
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,959
who's the end consumer or the company? There's a lot of arguments about that, but

523
00:21:59,319 --> 00:21:59,959
I just,

524
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,630
I do worry that this,

525
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,550
ok, here's a question. So

526
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:10,469
Apple continues to build better silicon and to essentially try and, you know,

527
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:14,010
secure the technical insecurity debt of the past in

528
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,199
all the stuff that's jammed into an iphone.

529
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:16,619
Now,

530
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:20,010
is there anything really new and novel that they could do?

531
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:22,989
I mean, they run a bug bounty, they're apparently shipping, you know,

532
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,160
slightly modified phones to the, to the core security researchers that they like,

533
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,189
that gives them sort of debug abilities to,

534
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,270
to really get into the guts of the phone.

535
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,189
Like, is there really anything more that Apple could do

536
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:36,209
or significantly different? I mean, I guess they could

537
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,739
massively fuzz things, but

538
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,040
we don't know that they're not already doing that.

539
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,359
No, I, I think there's definitely some more they could do here in this space if,

540
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,790
if you

541
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:47,239
pay

542
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,229
-- attention to new novel things that we haven't heard of or
-- no. No, no,

543
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:54,910
I maybe, yes, I think that that's second, that's part two. So

544
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,569
part one of my answer. Is that if you know where to look,

545
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,479
there are a lot of researchers that will say have difficulty with apple.

546
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:05,229
Apple is notoriously difficult to work with their bug bounty

547
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:08,140
from what I've gathered is not particularly well run.

548
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:08,900
They,

549
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,390
they definitely take security seriously,

550
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,949
but they take it seriously in a very apple way.

551
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,140
Whereas I think in the context of their product

552
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,160
usage and just like the universe at large,

553
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,729
they could stand to be a little more open and co-operative.

554
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:26,969
And I mean, that comes with a cost of course, because like I've,

555
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:30,609
I've run many public vulnerability and bug bounty things and

556
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:33,260
there can be a lot of noise.

557
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,150
And so my suspicion is their difficulty is to cut down on their noise.

558
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,390
But I think they're also cutting down on a lot of good, good work from people,

559
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,589
which is a bit unfortunate.

560
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,150
Now, from the aspect of like,

561
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,430
what are the novel in new technologies that could be done here.

562
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,270
I think

563
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:54,890
there's probably a lot of space for them to utilize some existing models,

564
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,810
things like, you know, segmenting all your services,

565
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,459
-- running everything in
-- sandboxes.

566
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,319
And they're starting to do that with the

567
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,680
iMessage blast door.

568
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,280
And I understand this takes time and, and they're working on it.

569
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,469
But I think

570
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,380
we're reaching a point in kind of the defender space around

571
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,760
our devices and our laptops and in kind of everything where

572
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:20,790
II, I don't know if I would call it, the mindset needs to shift. But like,

573
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,920
I think historically, we've had this view of like my device, my stuff and

574
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,949
it's kind of turning into this is Apple's device. I'm borrowing it from them

575
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,280
and I, I have to trust Apple completely

576
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,380
and I think there's probably some space there

577
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:41,060
to make changes and I don't know exactly what that is necessarily.

578
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:43,930
I, I don't think anyone does yet because I think we need

579
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,579
new ways of doing things. I mean, a technology I'd point out to look at is

580
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,670
a MD has this thing they call sev, it's, I think secure encrypted virtualization.

581
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,420
Don't, don't quote me on that. What it stands for, but

582
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,219
basically what it comes down to is when you carve up a machine for virtualization,

583
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:06,880
A MD has the ability to basically like inject a key into your virtualized process

584
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:11,680
that all of your ra m all of your execution. Everything is encrypted in a way

585
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:14,040
that the operator of the,

586
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:15,280
the bare metal

587
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:18,000
has no insight into what that machine is doing.

588
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:19,959
And I think

589
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:24,500
something in that space maybe might be what we have to start thinking about more

590
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:29,079
where like what the machine is doing is so cut off from everything else.

591
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,819
Like let's say you break into

592
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,579
iMessage,

593
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:32,829
that's it.

594
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:36,709
You can't do anything else because it's just completely cut off from everything.

595
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:40,910
Two comments. One, I don't need to escape iMessage to gain a lot of value.

596
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,369
-- No
-- I agree in that case.

597
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,410
Yeah.

598
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,189
And the other thing,

599
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:45,349
I was just thinking you're talking about mindset and I was just thinking like

600
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:47,760
there's already big chunks of my life where

601
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,020
that stuff is very much strongly legally mine.

602
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,869
But for example, all my money is just a bunch of numbers on a screen that,

603
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,790
you know, off of like td.com.

604
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,180
And

605
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,329
there are obviously various legal protections.

606
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:03,290
But on the, and on the flip side, of course, there are, you know,

607
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,140
banks doing stupid things like accidentally giving control

608
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,640
of accounts to Attackers and saying like,

609
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,109
well, too bad,

610
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:08,560
you know,

611
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,130
they phoned up and we were really convincing and

612
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,540
where we think it might have been you anyway.

613
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,680
So too bad unless you can prove it wasn't you,

614
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,300
we're not getting your money back,

615
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:17,939
you know, until the media contacts them and they're like, oh whoops,

616
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:19,800
we made a whoopsy, we'll fix that,

617
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:23,239
right? So I, I do wonder if we, because,

618
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,560
well, for example, money is very integral, right?

619
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:28,439
You need money to pay for stuff so that you don't die,

620
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:30,719
right? Food, shelter, things like that.

621
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,040
And

622
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,640
a smartphone is no longer a nice to have thing

623
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,199
like a smartphone is how you access government services.

624
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:41,199
It's, it's how I prove my COVID vaccination, right?

625
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,160
It's how I, well, I, and I could print it out on a piece of paper.

626
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,530
It's QR Code, but for example,

627
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:49,000
it's how I validate other people's vaccination records.

628
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:51,040
That's kind of a big deal nowadays.

629
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,130
And so a smartphone is no longer a nice to have thing. It's,

630
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,400
it's like wearing pants in public. It's just something we all do basically.

631
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,000
Right.

632
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,199
And I think maybe do we need to look at some legislation around sort of

633
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:09,439
consumer protection or sort of setting standards of behavior

634
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,640
for

635
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:13,770
not just the phone companies but the phone device makers,

636
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,839
you know, uh, in the eu we've already seen things like was,

637
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:19,599
I think they require five years of security updates for phones now,

638
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,989
-- something like that.
-- Yeah.

639
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:25,880
So maybe, maybe we need sort of that level of thinking around smartphones and

640
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,260
-- smartphone services.
-- I, I think

641
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:29,844
you're right. I think

642
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:31,844
I've fallen into the trap

643
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:35,405
of assuming the solution to the problem is technology,

644
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:37,165
but it's really not. I think

645
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:40,074
uh a huge part of this is regulation

646
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:41,005
and

647
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:43,834
having kind of governments and making sure that when

648
00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:47,364
there are attacks happening by a foreign government against

649
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,885
another government that there is diplomatic

650
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:54,234
retaliation to a degree. And, and I think,

651
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:58,060
I think as tech people, we often try to default to tech, but you're right.

652
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:01,130
This is, this is probably less of a tech problem and more of a,

653
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,560
a

654
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,270
go

655
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,979
like, like part of its law enforcement, part of its diplomatic relations,

656
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:11,140
part of its my government, I expect my government to, to protect me.

657
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,640
I mean,

658
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:13,579
if, if a foreign government

659
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,319
like wants to break into my house and steal my stuff. I totally expect

660
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:22,140
the United States government to be, got to have my back. You know what I mean?

661
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,420
And, and, yeah. Yeah, I think you're right. I think,

662
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:27,030
and what's fascinating here is Apple just recently again,

663
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,130
like within the last two weeks,

664
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,369
uh

665
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:32,500
Apple's created an alert system for basically,

666
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,089
if the company suspects state sponsored hackers

667
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:35,699
are targeting your Apple account or devices,

668
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:38,040
you'll receive a notification by iMessage and over email.

669
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:42,319
So obviously it's like Apple doesn't do this kind

670
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,180
of stuff because they're trying to be extra special.

671
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,979
Nice for Christmas like this is a problem

672
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,810
that they're trying to fix. This is some hypothetical

673
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,910
and, and I think it's not just Apple's job. I think there's also

674
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:56,069
there's a certain amount of,

675
00:28:56,349 --> 00:28:57,670
of local government

676
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,869
that that needs to happen here.

677
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,650
I think one challenge though is, is

678
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,949
the level of expertise needed to just understand this problem,

679
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,599
let alone do something constructive about it.

680
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:08,219
I

681
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,400
I feel like this is like a federal government type of thing.

682
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,790
Definitely not provincial or municipal.

683
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,670
Yeah, sorry, not, not local. I mean

684
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:16,689
in, in

685
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,589
the country where you reside.

686
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,709
Yeah,

687
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,930
pretty sure this is outside the city of Edmonton's remit.

688
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,880
Right. No, a absolutely. Absolutely. Alright.

689
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,420
Yeah.

690
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:29,920
Yeah,

691
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:31,680
it's,

692
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,199
I think stuff like this is inevitable though

693
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:37,739
because again the the smartphones have become like,

694
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,109
I I cannot imagine a modern journalist

695
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,010
not having and using a smartphone

696
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,060
and I would extend that statement to

697
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:48,119
essentially anyone.

698
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:48,880
I mean,

699
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,109
yeah, I agree. And I think

700
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,839
as a citizen of a country,

701
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,160
I think having the ability to

702
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:58,630
live your life in this modern age,

703
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:02,439
if you don't feel like you can trust your technology,

704
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,359
-- that is a problem.
-- And the technology provider.

705
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:06,550
Yeah. Right. Right.

706
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,420
Yeah. Yeah. Ok.

707
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,310
I buy it. I

708
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,160
buy it.

709
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,420
Right. Man.

710
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,439
I don't

711
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,160
-- what a boring ending like,
-- well, I mean, it's,

712
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:23,319
I think part of it is framing, the problem is, is a, is a beginning

713
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:26,180
and that's framing like what do we want?

714
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:30,020
And I want to be able to securely live my digital life and,

715
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,339
and I guess you know what else?

716
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:32,719
Here's, here's how we'll end it

717
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:34,430
is I think Apple using

718
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,040
copyright in this instance

719
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,859
is

720
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:41,000
just proof that the existing legal frameworks and

721
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,310
regulations are incapable of handling the situation.

722
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,510
And so Apple's trying to hack the system,

723
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,219
but of course we think this hack could have it will, it will have

724
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:53,829
future ramifications that we don't even understand yet.

725
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,770
So really the problem is just the fact that

726
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,290
the rules and regulations have not kept up with the technology and it's reached

727
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,709
a flashpoint and this is, this is the result.

728
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:06,030
Yeah.

729
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:06,359
Yeah.

730
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:07,109
Well, yeah,

731
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,369
obviously if there was a good law that covered this Apple would be using that, not,

732
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,189
not so copyright, it is

733
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,349
an old copyright

734
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:17,560
can do for us.

735
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,900
Alright.

736
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,780
What can, what can copyright do for you.

737
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,339
Alright. I'm calling it.
