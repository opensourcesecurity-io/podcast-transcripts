Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:11,340
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Ransomware Crime.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,100
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:12,710
Now,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,670
I

5
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:19,270
don't think I've ever been involved in any ransomware crime that I know of.

6
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:23,430
So this topic, holy cow. It's all I have to say.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:28,610
We put this on the calendar maybe a week or two ago before the timer recording.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,989
And in that week,

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,668
I think what I thought we were going to

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,880
talk about has probably drastically changed at least three times

11
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,990
like what is going on.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,319
I mean,

13
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,875
I basically titled this. So, so we, we track all of our episodes and get, um

14
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:48,534
and the title of this issue at the moment is like,

15
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:50,895
what the hell is going on with ransomware?

16
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:51,455
And

17
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:54,014
maybe I don't know if that'll be the title when it comes out.

18
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,334
But like, I don't even know where to start right now.

19
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,174
There's a couple of things that are most interesting to me.

20
00:00:58,185 --> 00:00:59,935
Number one that this has now made

21
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:00,764
the media

22
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:04,940
like we had, you have reporters at a White House press briefing,

23
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:08,860
you know, saying, asking, I'm going to say it asking stupid questions and yes,

24
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,129
folks.

25
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:11,309
I'm sorry, there are stupid questions,

26
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:17,050
asking stupid questions. Like, you know, like ransomware seems to be somehow

27
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:20,849
caused or correlated with the new administration coming in.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,160
Like, no, like ransomware has been a massive problem. It's just,

29
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,580
there hasn't been a very public ransomware attack

30
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,339
that actually affected America in a meaningful way,

31
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,819
ignoring things like not

32
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,069
pua,

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,559
like Maersk almost collapsed, you know, kind of a big shipping line.

34
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:40,059
I won't disagree that there's a correlation here but it's the same way there,

35
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,519
there's a subreddit that I forget the name of it.

36
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:43,629
But it basically, it's,

37
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:47,309
these people take completely unrelated graphs and they overlay

38
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,730
them pretending there's some and it'll be things like,

39
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,940
like, right, like this peanut butter sales versus, you know,

40
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:55,050
shark attacks or something,

41
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,930
two clearly unrelated events

42
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:58,459
that,

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,809
and, and this is the same thing like, yes, we have a new administration.

44
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,250
Yes, we have more ransomware,

45
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:06,440
but we don't have more ransomware because we have a new administration,

46
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,369
huge ransomware attacks. But, and I think part of it

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,479
and this is gonna maybe sound

48
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:12,929
anti-american but

49
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:15,919
like when you mess with certain things in America, they care,

50
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,410
like messing with their gasoline prices

51
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:20,800
cares

52
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,199
because as we saw people filling up grocery sacks with gasoline

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,570
in their trunk.

54
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:31,199
Well, and apparently that that kind of plastic is actually ok to store gasoline.

55
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,250
But obviously, you know, if there's anything sharp in the trunk that's going.

56
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:37,589
Oh, really? I, I didn't know, you could actually put gasoline in those.

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,110
-- Well,
-- if it's the same kind of plastic as a plastic gas can,

58
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:41,759
I see

59
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:42,600
that's

60
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,639
fine. The only, well, the only caveat being as mechanically it may not be

61
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,169
strong enough.

62
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,160
We're not. Ok.

63
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:55,339
Look, if you listen to this podcast and you don't understand why putting

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,270
any liquid in a garbage bag is a bad idea.

65
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:01,369
Well, if you've ever taken the garbage out and had to dribble all over the floor.

66
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,460
-- Right.
-- Anyway,

67
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,000
anyway,

68
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,009
imagine that it's a couple of gallons of gasoline.

69
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm gonna, I'm gonna set that bar and say,

70
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,130
I expect all of our listeners to understand why putting

71
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:14,869
liquid in a plastic bag is a bad idea.

72
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,130
-- Well,
-- and not just liquid but flammable liquid.

73
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:19,794
Anyway,

74
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:24,354
anyway, I do think you are correct that when people mess with,

75
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:28,395
with petrol in the US, everyone understands that

76
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:31,845
the American lifestyle for those of you who don't live here,

77
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:35,294
it is heavily dependent on personal automobiles.

78
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:38,434
And so when the price of gasoline increases,

79
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:42,175
it affects people in a very personal way that annoys them.

80
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:44,645
You would not believe how much people complain about

81
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:46,395
the price of gasoline in the United States.

82
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,779
And then you go to Europe and it's like four times expensive. It's hilarious.

83
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:54,139
I remember when I was in the USA few years ago

84
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,460
and literally one of the ads on TV, for one of the gas station companies,

85
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,029
their tag line was fill up on a tank of freedom.

86
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:02,800
And the idea being that like, no,

87
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,979
that you had this car and you could drive wherever you want and do whatever you want,

88
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,839
right? The American dream.

89
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:08,960
Let's not,

90
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,580
let's not turn this into an analysis of what's wrong with America today.

91
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,250
I think it's unique in that.

92
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,320
Well, and then like a week later we have that attack on J BS which is

93
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,100
like the,

94
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,140
it's the world's largest global beef supplier. And again,

95
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,440
-- you mess with Americans hamburgers. Don't do that.
-- That's true.

96
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,320
People love hamburgers here anyway.

97
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:32,420
Anyway, so here's what makes this even more crazy.

98
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,540
So there was the pipeline ransomware which they paid,

99
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:40,980
there was the J BS ransomware which I don't know if they paid that one or not. And then

100
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:46,549
a little bit after that, we find out that the FBI has reclaimed

101
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:51,350
the pipeline ransom payment somehow. We don't know exactly how they've done it yet.

102
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,559
-- Well,
-- I imagine with that much Cryptocurrency,

103
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,309
you're going to want to wash it or run it through an exchange.

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,989
Well, and so here are the,

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,059
here are the theories I have heard and at the time of recording,

106
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,747
none of these are terrified in any way.

107
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:06,076
This is pure speculation.

108
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:12,256
The there's also a story about how the FBI basically like took over this encrypted.

109
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,356
-- Well, no, they
-- didn't take over it. They built it.

110
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
-- Oh,
-- they built it from scratch,

111
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:19,397
but basically the FBI was selling criminals secure cell phones

112
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,516
which apparently weren't very secure.

113
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:26,717
-- It turns out
-- well, no, it was an app for like it was a signal style app for criminals.

114
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,356
So there's the, the theory of the FBI is running

115
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:31,367
a crypto

116
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:32,824
washing service.

117
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:37,134
And so when they saw the will say right amount of money come in from the right place.

118
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:42,563
They were like, oh, this is ours now, too bad. There's a theory that the FBI somehow

119
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:48,114
acquired access to the wallet through there will say illicit hardware,

120
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:52,144
-- no technical means is the term you want.
-- Sure. Ok. Ok. That's better.

121
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:55,924
But right, so they, they had access to a hot wallet,

122
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,084
which if you're in the Cryptocurrency world,

123
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,343
you know that

124
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:01,591
being a hot wallet is a terrible idea.

125
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:01,890
Well,

126
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:04,851
but the problem is you when you're receiving three

127
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,571
or multiple millions of dollars in ransomware payments,

128
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,170
it,

129
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,020
it has to be in hot wallets at some point at the beginning

130
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,610
of the transition because it's not like you can just bump it offline

131
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,131
like you have to transfer the money into your wallet like online.

132
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,911
Ok, so no, here, here's how this would work actually because I've,

133
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,710
-- I've used to do this
-- with so like this came

134
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:23,371
up on the cipher trace episode where you know,

135
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:25,170
people do take ransoms and then

136
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,230
let it sit and get cold,

137
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,250
so to speak.

138
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,140
But

139
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,320
-- like I need to pay the rent now. I
-- mean, maybe

140
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,559
so the, the way you would normally handle large quantities of crypto.

141
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,500
And this is things like Coinbase, does this as well.

142
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,640
So this isn't just for criminals is the fact

143
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:44,359
that you would generally want to generate a wallet,

144
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,519
kind of, you know,

145
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:49,399
on a computer not connected to the internet or not connected to any networks at all.

146
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,880
You generate your wallet, you transfer just the public portion of the wallet and,

147
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,959
and then say, here's the address you send the money to

148
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,329
the money gets sent and then

149
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:06,010
you have basically a single use computer that you're going to put the private key on,

150
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:09,690
use that to move the money and then destroy that computer.

151
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,809
And it is obvious that is not what was done here.

152
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,760
-- Well,
-- or even if it was done when they maybe went to the washing service or something,

153
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,179
we, we don't know exactly what happened, but that's, that's part of what makes this

154
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,679
just kind of bananas and, and I guess

155
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,304
we will come, you can cover all these topics.

156
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:30,484
But the thing I think that really is in my brain over all of this,

157
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:34,325
everything going on is I feel like for the last decade,

158
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,964
the criminals have been light years ahead

159
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:39,744
of law enforcement in terms of capabilities.

160
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:43,885
And I feel like in the last month law enforcement,

161
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:46,804
like they clapped back and holy cow.

162
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:51,200
Well, and a big part of the problem too is a lot of these gangs operate out of,

163
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,140
for example, Russia.

164
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:55,440
-- Where they're effectively state sanctioned.
-- Some of them do.

165
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,029
Actually the pipeline, the Biden, the,

166
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,679
this is another thing the Biden administration said

167
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,329
a couple days ago that

168
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,859
they believe we'll believe in quotes.

169
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:11,279
The pipeline ransomware was not state sponsored by Russia.

170
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,869
Well, no, I don't mean, I don't, I didn't, I don't mean state sponsored.

171
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,309
I'm saying state sanctioned. Yeah,

172
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:22,994
we have this group of Russian hackers that is creating problems for

173
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:25,644
Western nations and extracting money from them.

174
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:26,315
Oh,

175
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:28,225
that is so terrible.

176
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:31,994
We must do something about this at once.

177
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:33,205
Right. Right.

178
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:38,155
It's, I mean, and this is what just makes all of this mixed together in this pot.

179
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,994
So, mind boggling and strange,

180
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:44,434
it's so hard to explain this stuff. It's so weird

181
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,929
and I feel like the more I learn, the less I know.

182
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:49,390
Well, II,

183
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,369
I really wonder how much ransomware has been going on out of the news because

184
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:57,510
I remember what was it? I want to say about three, maybe four or five years ago.

185
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,630
Remember Bitcoin? All of a sudden a lot of companies started buying Bitcoin

186
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,159
and I was like, huh?

187
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,520
And then somebody I know who works with law enforcement.

188
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,809
He's like, oh, yeah, they're all buying it for, to, for ransomware payments.

189
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,969
Like to have it ready to go because here's the thing, I'm a company,

190
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,549
let's put $100,000 into Bitcoin.

191
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,419
So if a ransomware incident happens, we can just pay it and move on

192
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,760
in days. Right.

193
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,169
Oh, I agree. Yeah. I mean, as much as I hate it

194
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,739
and as much as I think we should not pay ransomware and, you know,

195
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,359
you don't pay kidnappers because then you create a market for kidnapping.

196
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:32,979
Yeah. As a company I get why they would do it because also it's not illegal.

197
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,820
It's interesting.

198
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,820
You mentioned the pay kidnapper thing because that's

199
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,020
a legit economy in parts of the world.

200
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,580
Like, I know people who have been kidnapped, paid their ransom and then got out.

201
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,460
-- But
-- here's the thing in North America,

202
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:49,489
the FBI and the RCP Canada essentially

203
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,299
said we're not going to tolerate that behavior

204
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:52,130
and,

205
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,450
and in public that is their stance and in

206
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,690
many instances we'll say that is probably true.

207
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,429
But there are places that is not true at all.

208
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,400
Well, yeah, it's, I mean,

209
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,760
here it's rare enough that when a kidnapping

210
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,989
for money happens it makes the national news.

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,210
-- Right? Whereas in Colombia that's Tuesday.
-- I know

212
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:15,299
a nontrivial number of people who have been ransomed

213
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,210
and

214
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:21,809
I don't know many who've paid and most of them didn't pay because they didn't know how

215
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:25,330
and they wanted to and they were like, help me buy Bitcoin.

216
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,580
I'm like, no, I'm not, I'm not helping. I'm not being a part of this.

217
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,929
I bet you there are thousands a day at least.

218
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,719
Well, I mean, can you really blame some dental office with one guy that does it?

219
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:39,609
-- For them and has no backups.
-- Right. Absolutely.

220
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,789
It's tough because, like, what's the alternative? You go out of business?

221
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,739
Well, so funny enough. My, my wife is on the board of a local museum.

222
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,200
Right. It's down the street from my house and

223
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,200
they're always having tech problems and their tech person

224
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,200
used to be someone who worked with the museum

225
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:56,020
that then,

226
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,739
like, they, they, they left the area

227
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:00,619
and now they're like, we don't have any tech people.

228
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,260
And I'm like, well, yeah,

229
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,900
that's because you don't use freaking volunteers to run your tech.

230
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,599
Like this is what happens.

231
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,710
They're like, will you do it?

232
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:10,500
And I'm like, no, I'm not doing this because I'm on the hook for all this crap and like,

233
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,700
I'm not, no, you, you get trapped

234
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:16,539
and, and I get it when you're a small business or something. It's super hard.

235
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,299
Well, not really.

236
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,760
You hire AAA managed service provider and M MSP and

237
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,940
-- you pay the MSP to manage your stuff
-- now now.

238
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,979
But I will say like,

239
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,419
I know some people who run like little local consulting places,

240
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,070
they're like 20 years behind.

241
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,789
They're all about, oh,

242
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,809
you got to run a server in the closet and you got

243
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,909
to run your own exchange and all this and it's like,

244
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,590
just put all this crap in office.

245
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,140
-- 365.
-- Both my accountant and lawyer have a server

246
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,460
and I've confirmed with both of them that they have a tape well, not a tape.

247
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,780
And that's a classic one. They have a tape, but no, they

248
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:47,460
have

249
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,179
a tape rope,

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,549
you know,

251
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,770
-- and they also back up to the cloud and I'm like, cool. Good enough.
-- Anyway.

252
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,309
Anyway, so, ok,

253
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:58,840
I don't want to get into a discussion about

254
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,929
small business.

255
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,119
It's, it's, I think the problem is

256
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,479
there's a market for this because the numbers

257
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:08,299
we're seeing is there have been some ransomware payments

258
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:09,440
that are

259
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:10,809
in the millions,

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,359
like seven and eight figures of us dollars at the time of the ransom.

261
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,270
Now, obviously with Bitcoin prices and stuff.

262
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,710
Yeah. Well, what's really comical to me is some of those previous ransoms paid,

263
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,789
man. I hope they help those Bitcoins because, wow, you know, Bitcoin had a good year.

264
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,969
I remember when a ransom would be like five or 10 Bitcoins and that was like 500 bucks.

265
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,909
Exactly.

266
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,179
-- Not anymore.
-- But the problem is it creates a market and

267
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:40,530
like if the bad guys make two or $3 million that's going to fund a lot

268
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,179
-- more misery and criminal activity. And
-- this is a mind

269
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:46,719
boggling industry as well.

270
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,969
I will try to find a link but I listened to a podcast on,

271
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,530
I think it was uh cipher from the Vice

272
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,130
folks,

273
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,789
vice.com and they were explaining how the business model of all this

274
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,489
ransomware works where you can basically go to a company in,

275
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,250
I think they were in ST Petersburg, mostly Russia

276
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,349
and basically say, like I want to run a ransomware campaign.

277
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,270
This is what I want this many

278
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:16,030
people to get rooted or, or whatever terminology you want to use and

279
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,390
you pay them some money and then it's on you to, to take it from there.

280
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,799
This is nothing new. We saw that with the old uh email phishing.

281
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,510
But when email phishing was still, you know, sophisticated,

282
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,219
even just being able to send an email that looked like it was from a bank

283
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:32,429
was beyond most people's capability.

284
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:36,340
And so you like, I'm talking 20 years ago, like this is back when I worked,

285
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,599
like this is in 1998 and 99.

286
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,900
So actually more than 20 years ago

287
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,840
and they, they literally,

288
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:44,820
these software guys would come out like now with support for Ebay,

289
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,130
you know, and, and when I say support for ebay, I mean,

290
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,580
like it would send out emails that looked exactly like they were from ebay or,

291
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,820
and also have like

292
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,619
the web page and login screen that looked exactly like ebay

293
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,719
and harvested credentials, you know, for all the banks.

294
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:02,820
Like you got to remember 20 plus years ago, there was no such thing as two fa for,

295
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,599
for people using, you know, web banking or paypal or,

296
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,200
I mean,

297
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,659
I remember actually getting an RS a token for paypal

298
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,369
and talking with one of their employees about it.

299
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,739
And he's like, yeah,

300
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,299
even internally we can't get people to use these

301
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:14,820
things because they're such a pain in the ass.

302
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,570
Well, and I remember talking with one of the local school techs and he's like,

303
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,969
we are having a real problem rolling out RS a tokens

304
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:26,789
because our older teachers can't type the number in fast enough,

305
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,429
I suppose. Right.

306
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,929
You get a 70 year old teacher,

307
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,299
like a 70 year old kindergarten teacher and you want her to like,

308
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:36,140
whack in a six digit RS, a token code on her computer to use the D.

309
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:39,770
-- No, no, Miss Miss Grindle can't do that. I,
-- I feel that there's, there's

310
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,234
probably a term

311
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,905
that describes this feeling, but like any time

312
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:50,484
I'm looking at the two factor off app on my phone and it's like less than five seconds,

313
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:53,015
there's like this angst I feel of can I make it?

314
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,905
Can I not make it? And I'm like, I'm too slow now, I'm too old.

315
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:59,755
This isn't a video game like I will not make this,

316
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,325
just wait for it to flip and then do it again.

317
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,155
Exactly.

318
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:03,554
Yeah.

319
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:04,094
But

320
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,770
-- I can relate to
-- that, this kind of thing where, you know, you buy a

321
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,150
software package that allows you to then just

322
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:14,549
like literally these people would go buy a list of email addresses,

323
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,049
-- go buy a software package, basically smash the two together and
-- profit.

324
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:18,390
I mean,

325
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,609
I think ransomware now is the natural

326
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,239
evolution of these industries because obviously,

327
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,539
if we think about these criminal, so

328
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:26,835
where creators

329
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:31,505
as entrepreneurs, they're going to go where the money is and of course,

330
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:35,145
sending phishing mails is probably not profitable anymore.

331
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:37,594
But ransomware, there's a lot of profit in that.

332
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,864
So let's head in that direction,

333
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,525
especially like I look at my email inbox and it blows my mind that I still

334
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:46,594
do get some degree of spam through because it seems so obviously spammy to me.

335
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:50,099
But at the same time when I look at how much,

336
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:53,929
like I know how much spam I'd be getting if I ran an unfiltered email address.

337
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,039
Right, because I've run email servers on the public internet and I know

338
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,799
like it's bonkers,

339
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,179
-- that's why we quit.
-- Exactly.

340
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,489
We admitted defeat and we let someone else do the hard work and I get that and,

341
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,770
and I mean, honestly,

342
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,890
I think part of the ransomware story is going

343
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,159
to be a same outcome where we're just going,

344
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:12,465
I have to admit defeat

345
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:16,224
and outsource a crap load of this stuff to someone else.

346
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:18,275
Well, and I mean, I've already, you know, for example,

347
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:22,385
I use a cloud based backup of all our Google Drive stuff because not

348
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,815
because I'm worried about ransomware and not because I'm worried about an attack,

349
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:28,065
but I'm worried about somebody fat fingering nuking a

350
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:30,034
directory and then emptying the trash and being like,

351
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,224
whoops, it's gone because we actually had,

352
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:35,265
it happened twice now where somebody bought a new Huawei phone

353
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,960
and the calendar up on the Huawei phone,

354
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:38,890
at least in the past had some sort of glitch where,

355
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,780
when it like syncs to your Google account,

356
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:44,229
it just cleans out the calendars that have been shared to you.

357
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:44,969
What,

358
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,770
what a weird bug.

359
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,960
So not your calendar, but the ones shared to you that you have right access to.

360
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,104
And so we literally twice had all of our scheduled events white and

361
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:56,335
this is like three months after Google had added the whole delete something.

362
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:58,445
Calendar goes to the trash bin. It doesn't go away forever.

363
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,424
And I'm like, thank you, thank you, Google.

364
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:02,405
Like no, because otherwise I would have been up

365
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:05,584
like I would have been in a situation of like, well that it's gone.

366
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:10,425
I remember doing that in the early days where I would accidentally delete

367
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:12,344
an invite and like

368
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:14,545
-- it was gone. You never come back
-- too

369
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:16,185
bad. You don't get to go to that meeting

370
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:21,829
and don't get me wrong sometimes that was for the best. But

371
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,530
it blows my mind.

372
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,780
I get 20 years ago that when you deleted data,

373
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,709
you kind of expected it to be gone because also we didn't have a ton of space.

374
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,000
But nowadays,

375
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,979
like I, I don't delete data. My Google drive is some ungodly huge pile of garbage.

376
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:40,479
Oh my Lord. 110.19 gigabytes used. What's in there? Oh, that's pretty good.

377
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,300
And the answer is,

378
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,890
-- I don't know or care anymore because I've
-- search their search kind of blows,

379
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,920
but that's another story,

380
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:49,150
-- but it's better than a pile of local files.
-- Oh, yes,

381
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:49,900
for sure.

382
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,699
What gets me is that, you know, this,

383
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:54,359
it needs to sort of fundamentally transition and

384
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:56,579
shift sort of how they think about things

385
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,109
because

386
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:58,949
here's my concern about ransomware.

387
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,599
If you are vulnerable and not to the leak part,

388
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,800
because the leak part confidentiality, that's hard.

389
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,300
But if you're, if you're vulnerable to the integrity and availability of your data,

390
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,579
like if somebody encrypts your file system and it's gone and you don't have that

391
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:14,209
-- well. But what if the building burns down or you drop the computer? Right.
-- Right.

392
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,579
I think it's just, it's an un,

393
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:21,439
a previously unknown threat against your infrastructure, right.

394
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:24,739
-- Where it is comparable to fire. You
-- know, it's like getting a cold.

395
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,310
It's gonna happen at some point if you're vulnerable.

396
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,150
Like, yeah, like every time I let myself get stressed and run down, bam, I get a cold,

397
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:35,349
you know, except for last year where I got pneumonia, which was worse,

398
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,660
infinitely worse than a cold.

399
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,229
The one thing we saw with organized crime, if you remember back in the day,

400
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,160
especially with Capone.

401
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,739
I'm talking, like, way back in the day is they got Capone on tax fraud, right. They,

402
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,459
with the drug trade,

403
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,699
the one thing they realized is we can't stop the drug trade,

404
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,900
but we can follow the money.

405
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,060
And that's what I find curious is if they can

406
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,369
find ways to follow the money and recover most of it.

407
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,949
-- Well, that's a problem for the criminals. I mean.
-- Right.

408
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:02,209
And I think that's the expected next step in the

409
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,530
evolution of this game of cat and mouse is,

410
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,810
I think as law enforcement catches up to what the criminals are capable of doing now,

411
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,329
which it looks like that's happening, which is awesome.

412
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:15,089
That means the criminals are going to have to evolve

413
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,489
-- into something else.
-- I suspect we'll see

414
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,260
thing, like,

415
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,560
as well where the law enforcement can deal with

416
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:22,140
large crimes but they can't deal with small crimes.

417
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,530
Like, if your bicycle gets stolen, I'm sorry, your bicycle got stolen.

418
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,680
I hope it's registered.

419
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:27,579
They don't care.

420
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:30,699
I hope it's registered with the bicycle registry and I

421
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,939
hope you had insurance on it if it was expensive.

422
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:36,339
But fundamentally, I don't, you know, it's, it's, it's like the big Lebowski,

423
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:36,670
you know.

424
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,699
Yeah, we'll get our best detectives on it right away, you know, working,

425
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:40,949
working shifts,

426
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,099
you know,

427
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,930
like

428
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,469
I'm sorry,

429
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:48,469
but there's just at some level it's not cost effective or even

430
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,510
sane when we have real crimes and real problems to deal with.

431
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,030
And the ransomware people know this as well

432
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,770
because if you ransom a normal person's computer,

433
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,680
the ransom might be $250.

434
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:02,109
But if you're ransoming a pipeline company,

435
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,989
the ransom is not $250.

436
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,310
And in fact, I remember this was a funny story.

437
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,859
This is probably five years ago now, like a hospital got ransomed for like 500 bucks.

438
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:15,530
-- They're like, just pay it. Like, who cares
-- as much as I hate that.

439
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:16,089
Yeah.

440
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,280
Like the,

441
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,689
just having a consultant load the tape will take longer. Right.

442
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,369
And the story was you idiot should have charged us more, you know?

443
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,849
And of course, that's, that's where we are now,

444
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:32,469
but that's the obvious evolution of ransomware is a business, you know.

445
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,130
And, and so now there's kind of the,

446
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,160
the end of this conversation is something to think about is there's a

447
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,510
story I will link to from Adam Shostack where he basically talks about

448
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,680
like we keep obsessing over ransomware.

449
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:47,930
But the actual problem here is that our computer

450
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:50,969
systems are all basically like insecure piles of crap.

451
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:54,609
I don't think he's wrong. Here's the thing

452
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,089
for us to think about it.

453
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:00,109
Kind of along this line of blaming crappy, terrible computers.

454
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,630
Like we used to have this discussion about viruses,

455
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,010
we'll say 10 or 20 years ago where it's like

456
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:10,030
viruses shouldn't exist. These operating systems have terrible security.

457
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,430
And I feel like that's not, I mean,

458
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,040
it sort of solves because Windows comes with Windows defender

459
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,239
now and I will say it does an acceptable job,

460
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,670
but it's not like,

461
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,989
I don't feel like a lot of these fundamental

462
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,790
problems have been solved in the context of viruses.

463
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,369
I think it's just that the Attackers have moved on to something that

464
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,864
makes them money instead of just being a pain in the butt.

465
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,094
Well,

466
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:33,035
there used to be viruses that tried to extort money but they weren't very effective.

467
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:33,824
Right. Right.

468
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:35,625
Well, it was, you couldn't pay people. Right.

469
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:41,224
This is where we need the Cryptocurrency to anonymously send money across borders.

470
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:41,805
Which,

471
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:43,234
like, yeah, I mean,

472
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:47,109
write me a check and then mail it to this, my home address. You know,

473
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:48,709
it's not going to work.

474
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,150
Actually,

475
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,630
I think I feel like there was a super early virus that did something like that.

476
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,849
That was one of the first ones like, yeah, one of the fly,

477
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:58,250
it said mail money to some guy in Pakistan

478
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,900
or whatever and it was like completely ridiculous.

479
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:04,150
But, but anyway, anyway, the point is

480
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:06,989
I'm, I, I feel like saying

481
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:10,579
that operating systems should solve this problem and we shouldn't

482
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:14,579
-- have defaults that let this
-- Apple and icloud you,

483
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:17,500
your data is in the icloud by default and granted.

484
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,079
Well, not just icloud, ignoring icloud. I don't care about data backups.

485
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,130
That's kind of, I think a secondary conversation

486
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,790
if we look at what Apple's doing with some of their later operating system versions.

487
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,680
For example,

488
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:33,050
a binary can't write to random places on disk, right?

489
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,459
It's, it's like sandboxed into certain spots.

490
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:37,770
Well, for example, you know,

491
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,209
Dan Walsh back in the day has a whole pile of articles talking about how to get E Linux

492
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,250
wrapping. For example, your web browser and then allowing printing.

493
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,969
I remember that. Yes. Why does my web browser have access to my SSH key? There is no

494
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,609
no circumstance under which I want that to happen.

495
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:57,449
I think that's also a good counterexample though because while the work Dan did

496
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:02,130
with making Se Linux sandbox binaries on Linux was nothing short of phenomenal.

497
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,569
It never caught on because fundamentally no one cared and it was

498
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:08,609
hard to use even if we made it easy to use,

499
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:11,333
unless it is literally the default way

500
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:15,682
-- the system works. No one would ever use
-- that, you know, on my Mac now, right?

501
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,703
The, the Apple is getting more and more walled garden

502
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:19,863
with how Binaries work. And I'm having, you know,

503
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:23,552
I'm having more and more trouble sort of jamming in the sort of

504
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:27,353
weird open source third party free apps that I really want to need.

505
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:28,292
But I'm pretty determined.

506
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:31,192
I'm still, I take that mallet out and I'm just like, yi, I, you know,

507
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,672
and Apple's giving me increasingly dire warnings and I'm like,

508
00:23:33,993 --> 00:23:36,005
I, I think I know what doing so, like just, you know,

509
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,056
I'm going to pound that peg into that hole.

510
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:42,576
-- I don't care.
-- I get it. And, but here's the thing, you're a weirdo.

511
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:43,395
Oh, absolutely.

512
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:44,086
You're not.

513
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:45,416
I mean, I look at, for example,

514
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:47,515
my wife is one of my favorite examples to pick

515
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,095
on about stuff like this is she has a computer.

516
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:53,985
She basically runs a web browser on it now and that's pretty much it.

517
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:57,296
You know, every now and then there will be something else that needs to be run.

518
00:23:57,306 --> 00:23:59,375
But I would say 99% of the time

519
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,020
she runs a web browser.

520
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,500
And so like, yeah,

521
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,209
she's never going to need to install random binaries

522
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,119
off the internet and if she's trying to,

523
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,800
thank goodness they won't let it happen.

524
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:10,479
Well, and,

525
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:13,119
and it's interesting you say that because you actually can install

526
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,959
random binaries off the internet on your web browser chrome extensions.

527
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:17,000
And now for example,

528
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,400
Google just within the last few days is coming up with a

529
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,130
project to try and clean up their chrome extension space a bit

530
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,060
and also give you some warnings about like this publisher

531
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,959
is new because I remember looking at chrome extensions trying to

532
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,920
find the original publishers of them,

533
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,760
like a whole bunch of them were just super

534
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,520
anonymous or like didn't even have a website.

535
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,800
-- What was
-- the extension that was basically bought by malware people?

536
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,160
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

537
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,000
Well, and then, and then a whole pile of people popped out of the woodwork saying,

538
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,329
yeah, I run a pretty popular extension too.

539
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:46,199
And here's like the terms I was offered and it's kind of like

540
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:49,560
those are actually not bad terms like I might have taken that money,

541
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:50,079
right?

542
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,410
Boom, that's, that's a ready made attack base because here's the thing,

543
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,869
if you run a piece of software that has an update or built into it, which is, uh,

544
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,280
let me check all of them

545
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,069
and somebody gets access to that system,

546
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,709
either by hook or by crook or by paying for it.

547
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,989
They can now install software on your system.

548
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,130
Well, I mean, that's literally what happened at solar winds. Like, literally,

549
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,569
I think we're going to see a lot more of these sort of simple,

550
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,079
effective metrics around software.

551
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:19,390
Like, is this publisher well known? Are they new? Are they old?

552
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,859
Yeah, I think that's part of it. Absolutely.

553
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:24,390
A topic for another day that I think is related to this though,

554
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,215
is as we see law enforcement finally catching up to this game of cat and mouse.

555
00:25:29,225 --> 00:25:30,406
I also think

556
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,566
we're seeing

557
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:36,676
some push on the policy side where there's some real interest being paid into.

558
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:41,845
How can we actually just, you know, like chop these attacks off at the, at the root

559
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:43,485
and, and get rid of them.

560
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:46,816
And so I'm not going to say it's going to solve all the problems, but I think like,

561
00:25:46,826 --> 00:25:49,806
you know, we talked about that executive order a couple of episodes ago.

562
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:52,715
I think this kind of stuff while

563
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,982
of is going to be measured by in decades,

564
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:59,891
I feel like we're at least starting to point everyone in the same direction,

565
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:02,102
which is a huge first step.

566
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,901
Well, I mean, a big step, Latvian woman charged in us with R and cybercrime group.

567
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,421
So this lady apparently writes ransomware.

568
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:12,692
This lady is charged as part of a 47 count indictment with

569
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:15,511
participating in the cybercrime organization known as the Trick Bok group,

570
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:18,702
which authorities say operated in Russia and several other countries, blah, blah,

571
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:19,222
blah, blah, blah.

572
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,241
But the point is

573
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:23,839
she better not travel outside of her country

574
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,489
or she's going to end up on a plane to the US

575
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,000
where she, you know, and,

576
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,089
and then things are going to happen that she's probably not

577
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:32,760
going to be a fan of doing things like that.

578
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,079
I mean,

579
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:37,300
it is, you know, when they do it against North Korean generals, whatever, who cares.

580
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,599
But right now this lady is kind of, if they do more stuff like this,

581
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:44,099
I suspect there are some people that are on

582
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,680
the fence about joining a cybercrime gang to,

583
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,479
you know, make money

584
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,229
that she

585
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,579
would say no because they don't want to end up in a US prison.

586
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:51,719
-- But
-- at the same time,

587
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:55,839
the only way to have the ability to do things like charge foreign nationals is

588
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:00,079
to have enough intelligence to know who these people are and what they're doing.

589
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:00,479
Right.

590
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:05,040
And I think historically that wasn't the case, but now it's becoming more obvious.

591
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,864
I mean, the thing is this is exactly the type of thing that the FBI is set up to do.

592
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:13,084
You know, they just, they, the focus was on terrorism and now we're,

593
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:17,064
I think we're realizing that there's a lot of other like post 911,

594
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:21,074
we ignored a lot of financial crimes and, well, 2008 rolled around and I mean,

595
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:22,535
we're still feeling the effects of that.

596
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:23,224
Right. That's

597
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:23,545
right.

598
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:24,425
So, I,

599
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,145
I think we're at the point where this is

600
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:27,864
painful enough that we can no longer ignore it.

601
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,464
That's the story of humanity. Kurt,

602
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:35,780
I'm going to end it on that note because

603
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,750
yes,

604
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,369
no one can argue with that. So, thank you everyone for listening. Thank you, Kurt.
