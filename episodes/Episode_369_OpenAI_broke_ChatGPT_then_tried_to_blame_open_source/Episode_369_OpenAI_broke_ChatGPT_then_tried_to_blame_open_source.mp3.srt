Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:12,090
Kurt Siefried and my partner in embracing the future Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:13,439
Actually, I did embrace the future.

3
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:13,930
This weekend,

4
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:16,068
I have a fun story I was going to talk about because

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,770
even though I had a very busy and tiring weekend in general,

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,629
I added a bed leveling sensor to my 3D printer.

7
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:27,409
It didn't come with one. No, it is amazing. Ok. So, no. Ok.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,809
I've, I've explained this on the podcast several times.

9
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:33,310
-- You obviously don't remember. I have the worst 3D printer
-- in the world. That's true.

10
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:37,369
-- Yours is a couple of years old at this point,
-- not just old. It's more than a couple.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,130
It's probably almost five years old now.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,389
But more importantly,

13
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:46,610
it was a very cheap Chinese knockoff of a Prus I three. It's called an Anne A eight.

14
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,250
I mean, this was like a burn your house down 3D printer, right?

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,930
And I've since upgraded it and added numerous safety

16
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,790
features so it won't burn my house down.

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,869
And the one thing it didn't have was auto bed level. Yeah, I mean, for real, like

18
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,040
this is one of the reasons I didn't get a 3D printer five years ago because I'm, like,

19
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,110
these things are not safe, like,

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,580
straight up they might catch fire and with a

21
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,309
big spool of filament that could be a problem.

22
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,010
Yeah.

23
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:12,080
Oh, there's plenty of pictures of 3d printers, like,

24
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:13,389
literally bursting into flames

25
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,269
anyway.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,500
And, like, this printer didn't have any thermal runaway protection.

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,589
So, if, like, the heat,

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,150
the sensor fails, that detects the temperature of your extruder,

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,750
it'll just heat forever.

30
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:24,309
Right.

31
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:24,449
You know,

32
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:29,080
like the new firmware have like thermal runaway protection where it's like if the,

33
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,430
if, if the temperature is reading zero, it's like something might be wrong.

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,360
Maybe I should

35
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,989
stop heating. Maybe off scale high is a problem.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,419
Anyway. I, I buy this 3D printer. It's called the BL Touch

37
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,260
and

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,739
I hook it all up.

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,459
I wire it in, I had to rebuild my firmware many times because I kept, like,

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,370
missing little bits and pieces and, and whatever

41
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,419
and I get it working and like this feels like cheating.

42
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:59,050
It used to take 20 minutes to level the printer bed

43
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,419
and I don't have to, I just hit print and like,

44
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,410
it figures it all out and it's magic and it prints perfect every time.

45
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:05,040
And I'm like,

46
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,199
I don't even know what to say.

47
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,008
This is as I feel like I'm living in the future,

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,000
like 1000 years in the future with how easy this has become.

49
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,009
And that's the thing. Right.

50
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,929
Like just like as we've seen with open source,

51
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,050
like I'm looking to buy a 3D printer in the next few months and,

52
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:23,225
and they all have bed leveling by default or a perfect example is

53
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,494
I am sitting next to a little machine here.

54
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:29,585
This little machine is a Ryzen 7 5800 with 80 gigs of ra M

55
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:32,524
210 terabyte hard drives and raid one for the media content.

56
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:34,654
A 10 terabyte hard drive for youtube downloads.

57
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:38,274
Like because I have four terabytes of youtube video and a two terabyte M two

58
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:42,615
drive hooked into a PC I four X slot to run on my virtual machines.

59
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,455
So that I don't have to hear the hard drives going,

60
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,139
you know, whenever something happens.

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,809
And like you would agree

62
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,009
10 years ago,

63
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,929
that's a pretty monster server

64
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,369
and 20 years ago, unimaginable.

65
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,410
And now it's just my little media box.

66
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,330
You know what you just reminded me of

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,449
is I was thinking about a project over the weekend. I was thinking it would be funny to

68
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,750
build a thing.

69
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:05,869
So,

70
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,039
you know how like on the hard drive light still

71
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,509
turns on in your computer when it reads your hard drive

72
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,250
thing is now

73
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,919
it would

74
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,475
amuse me to build a little thing that made

75
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,235
fake hard drive noises every time the light turned on

76
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:19,214
it wouldn't,

77
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:20,764
I would love that because

78
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,835
I won't lie.

79
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:23,514
There was a certain,

80
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:25,035
just comfort

81
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:28,274
in hearing the noises and knowing something was happening.

82
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:29,384
Like

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,479
anyway,

84
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,720
we have a real topic to talk about as much fun as it

85
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:36,089
would be to go on and on about our old person tech problems.

86
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:38,279
So, open A I

87
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,539
and

88
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,869
-- we're not going to talk about.
-- No one knows what that is. Chad GP, T

89
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,190
GP.

90
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:43,330
Who

91
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,699
knows what Chad GP T is?

92
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,619
-- Well,
-- chat GP,

93
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,460
T is the model that open A I built and you can access chat GP T either through open

94
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,270
a.com or through bing or through a third party

95
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,669
service that essentially is buying access to the API.

96
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:55,250
That's right

97
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,740
to be clear. I am a chat GP T fan boy. I love it. I'm using it a ton

98
00:03:58,899 --> 00:03:59,380
but

99
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,210
-- I'm not so sure about open A I the company,
-- I'm not even a little surprised. OK.

100
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,750
So here's the,

101
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,539
the, the quick TLDR open

102
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,210
A I had a security incident

103
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,630
-- and
-- a pretty bad one too.

104
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,170
-- Like it was, it was uh
-- it was leaking other people's data. And

105
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,748
I mean, that's

106
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,739
-- remember cloud bleed
-- from

107
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:24,558
-- their
-- perspective. That's critical. I agree.

108
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,399
But basically

109
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,540
they blamed the open source library

110
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,440
instead of themselves.

111
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,149
Initially, I will say that the initial tweet

112
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,230
they sent out was very this open source library broke our stuff

113
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,100
and then they wrote a blog post where I

114
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:45,570
feel like it was definitely less blaming open source.

115
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:45,670
Uh

116
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:48,160
Did you see the responses to his tweet?

117
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,790
Like,

118
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,809
yeah, the the community was pretty clear on what they thought of his tweet.

119
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:57,549
Yeah. And, and that's fair and, and I think the blog post is toned much better.

120
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:00,140
It still could be a little nicer. But again, I mean,

121
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,709
so who knew like tweets could be problematic for getting yourself in trouble.

122
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:04,630
How could we

123
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,100
possibly

124
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:05,779
no

125
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:07,679
one, no one knew, no one knew that

126
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,839
no one knew.

127
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,510
But

128
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,799
it, I

129
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,140
don't think the open A I aspect of this is necessarily super

130
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,839
important because I think you're gonna find people who view open A I

131
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,500
in a multitude of directions.

132
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,179
Like my favorite example is you get a lot of complaints because when they started,

133
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,440
they were what, like a nonprofit foundation or something?

134
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,049
-- They are still a nonprofit.
-- Are they technically still a nonprofit?

135
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:32,059
The most profitable nonprofit?

136
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,649
So,

137
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,850
and that's part of what people complain about is it's

138
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:39,500
a nonprofit that now has transitioned to a for profit,

139
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,190
right?

140
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,524
No, that's what I mean. They, they, you are a for profit corporation now, right?

141
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:43,994
Or not?

142
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:45,605
Well, ok, in 2019,

143
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:49,274
open A I transitioned from nonprofit to capped for profit

144
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:52,654
with a profit capped at 101 100 times any investment.

145
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:53,024
Ok.

146
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:56,234
So essentially whatever somebody invests into open A I,

147
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:58,565
they can only get up to 100 times back.

148
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:01,304
And then my understanding is open A I, I gets to keep the rest

149
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,654
anyway. It doesn't matter, doesn't matter. I don't want to dwell on it.

150
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,869
The point is

151
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:06,410
they have a product,

152
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,470
there was definitely a bug in an open source library because

153
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,649
I'll put the bug in the show notes like it,

154
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,089
I, I it's there

155
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,970
and

156
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,730
they decided to blame the open source library,

157
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:21,679
I think in an attempt to make themselves look better.

158
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,600
Right. That's, that's always the intent of blaming someone else.

159
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:29,010
We took Chat GP T offline earlier this week due to a bug in an open

160
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:30,839
source library which allowed some users to see

161
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:33,535
titles from another active user chat history.

162
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:34,834
But we

163
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,234
built a thing that

164
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:36,755
yeah,

165
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:37,894
like come on it. True.

166
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,244
That's true. That's as, that's as under the bus as you can go.

167
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:47,184
And now here's the topic. I think that is interesting in all of this.

168
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:48,375
And this is

169
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:54,515
going back to our Red Hat days. Red Hat had this saying inside the company.

170
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:55,975
I, I imagine they still do

171
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,424
but it was, if we ship it, we support it.

172
00:06:58,434 --> 00:06:59,934
Well, it's kind of the whole point of the company.

173
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,190
I mean, one would think, but

174
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,309
-- like that's what people are paying for it.
-- That feels simple when you talk about it.

175
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,190
But remember this was a time

176
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,029
when

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,269
even then

178
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,600
there were other groups that would use open

179
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,725
source software and they would say that is not my software,

180
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:21,424
open source did that. I'm not responsible.

181
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:24,054
And Red Hat purposely said

182
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:27,575
if it is in our product, if it is going out our door,

183
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:30,345
we will support it no matter what that means.

184
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:33,005
But I think part one of the challenges Red Hat was always

185
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,549
an open

186
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,070
source company.

187
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,100
Now, I know that there were,

188
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,290
there were technically a few close source things like

189
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,109
there was a Red hat enterprise virtualization version one,

190
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:41,600
had an,

191
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,980
had a binary component that they got rid of in version two.

192
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,200
And there were some binary components in

193
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,679
manage iqevm that was acquired and like they

194
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,190
got rid of them as soon as they could within a year or so.

195
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,350
But so the point is red hat was always either pure open

196
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:58,260
source or very close in trying to be pure open source.

197
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,049
Whereas somebody like IBM or so

198
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,000
back in the day.

199
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:02,739
Yeah, not even a little bit.

200
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,450
Oh, no, no, for sure. Absolutely not.

201
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:07,079
And, and so anyway,

202
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,109
this amuses me

203
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,839
because it's just part of my DNA in a way I can't escape.

204
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,029
I mean, I, I say this at work all the time where someone will be like, oh,

205
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,929
we're shipping this.

206
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,589
I'm like, if we ship it, we support it

207
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,079
then they're like, oh yeah, I guess you're right.

208
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,190
Well, you know, it reminds me of as a car manufacturer,

209
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,510
a car manufacturer can't be like,

210
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,980
oh, you know, we got some bad screws like

211
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,920
go yell at the screw guys like

212
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,549
you

213
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,510
sold me this car and said it was fit for purpose and like

214
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,669
wouldn't like the engine wouldn't fall out on the highway.

215
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,109
That's right.

216
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,940
Well, was it, there was, uh,

217
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,080
there was a court case, I think about this.

218
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,679
-- I feel like
-- it's been more than a few court cases.

219
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,090
No, no, no, no, no. There was a very specific court case about this.

220
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:51,390
I will try to look it up, but I'm trying, I think I remember this correctly.

221
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,669
This was a talk I saw at a Bide Las Vegas

222
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,630
from

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,369
her name is Wendy. Wendy CK is what she went up as on Twitter.

224
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,299
I, I don't know if she's on Masteron. It's been so long. But anyway,

225
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,099
uh

226
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,530
there was a court case at when the car industry was becoming a thing

227
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,369
where basically, like someone got hurt because the tires on the car were bad

228
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:18,299
and the car manufacturer basically said not our problem. It's the tire guy

229
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:22,599
and the courts were like, it's totally your problem because you sold the car.

230
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,280
You don't get to blame the tire people.

231
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:24,950
You can't

232
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,000
use a bad component

233
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:27,809
but

234
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,690
pass the blame.

235
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,289
No, no. We,

236
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,590
you say that as if it makes perfect sense,

237
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,090
but I don't think it always does. And especially this is where human nature kicks in

238
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:42,340
because how many times have you made a mistake?

239
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:47,359
And the first thing you did was try to figure out who can I blame? How is this?

240
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:48,210
Not my fault?

241
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,789
We've all done it. Don't pretend you have.

242
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:53,460
But I also caught over quickly because my favorite was

243
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,210
always staring at the blue screen of death that said,

244
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,250
please contact your sister administrator for more help.

245
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,080
And I'm like, that's me.

246
00:09:59,419 --> 00:09:59,960
Damn it.

247
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,210
Right. So I got over that at a very, I think early age because

248
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:07,080
nine times out of 10, I built the system that failed.

249
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:08,820
Uh

250
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,739
Yeah, it's me. But, but it's just human nature.

251
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,289
I think it's human nature to try to get out

252
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:17,840
of getting in trouble when you make a mistake.

253
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,359
I still experience this all the time

254
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:20,109
where

255
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:25,119
there will be like a security vulnerability in a thing I'm responsible for.

256
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,099
And the first thing I'm like is, can I prove this doesn't affect us?

257
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:30,400
That's literally the first thing I say immediately,

258
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,770
it depends on your, like, that's my, that's what I want.

259
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,809
I want to say this doesn't affect me.

260
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:37,770
But I think the difference here is,

261
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,030
is you're going to go see if you are affected or not.

262
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:42,809
And if you are affected, then you're going to immediately do the right thing.

263
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,090
That's a massive difference.

264
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,000
It's also my job

265
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:47,390
in

266
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:48,250
the

267
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:48,440
sense

268
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:48,599
of

269
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,150
being

270
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:52,570
-- vague,
-- but in the sense of like, I remember with Jackson data bind and satellite,

271
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,109
you know, constant XML. Um, the, uh,

272
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,840
the, the, the stream processing which satellite didn't use.

273
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,469
And so

274
00:10:59,900 --> 00:10:59,969
deer,

275
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:01,780
yeah, object deser.

276
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:03,000
There you go.

277
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,609
And so I immediately would be like, I would check,

278
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:08,309
I would like every time I would double check grip for the function

279
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,289
Yeah, we're not vulnerable, we're not fixed,

280
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,239
but it's coming from the space of like

281
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,400
that's part of the fix to it is are we actually vulnerable or not?

282
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,239
And if, then we are vulnerable then Kurt has to go

283
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,570
try and get people to fix it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

284
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:22,239
But,

285
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,330
but that is very different than

286
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,849
immediately seeing.

287
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,359
Can we, we like, can we weasel our way out of the blame

288
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,840
right there? That's a very different intent than

289
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,820
are we actually affected or not? Oh, we're not affected.

290
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,299
Thank goodness or oh, we are affected. Let's fix it.

291
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,000
That's

292
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:39,250
fair.

293
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:39,669
And

294
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,900
I think that's where a lot of people get this thing confused.

295
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,989
That's fair. And I think

296
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:51,669
the other thing I'm grateful for that red hat instilled into my bones

297
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,789
is when you are an open source company, you basically have to tell the truth.

298
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,950
There's no way you can weasel out of a lot of

299
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,590
this stuff because it's just all out in the open.

300
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,809
There was more than one time I was in meetings where we were basically saying,

301
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,349
how can we not look like idiots?

302
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,969
And at the end, we're like, we have to look like idiots.

303
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:14,010
We have no way we can do this because the source

304
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,090
code and the patches are all going to be available.

305
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,950
What also really astounds me is so many people I think are and not just people,

306
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,760
but companies are

307
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,750
really overly afraid of bad news.

308
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,489
And I get that sometimes it's legitimate because they've

309
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,109
done something truly terrible that will make the national news

310
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,789
and get them, like, in front of Congress, you know, hearings,

311
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,049
congressional hearings, like the tiktok thing.

312
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:35,989
If you haven't seen

313
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,070
the tiktok ceo, giving extremely evasive answers to Congress,

314
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,270
it's a thing,

315
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,330
especially with a lot of the software that people buy.

316
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,500
Number one,

317
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:50,340
they probably did a lot of research and ended up buying

318
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:53,619
that one is like the least worst choice that they could make

319
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,590
and they're stuck with it. Like

320
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,640
you can't just

321
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:01,440
like, I don't care how angry I get at Mac Os or Windows. I can't not use it.

322
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,979
Yeah, you can, you just won't.

323
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,380
Well, it just, I get certain other things and benefits and you know

324
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,359
that it's just,

325
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,690
yeah, I can't, you know,

326
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:09,820
I,

327
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,409
I don't like the fossil fuel industry but I'm gonna

328
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:13,780
have to go guess on my car this week.

329
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:14,979
That's fair.

330
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,799
What, what frustrates me here is,

331
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:19,900
I think open A I could have been a lot more forthright

332
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,070
and said like, yeah, we used an open source library.

333
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:25,890
We built a caching system.

334
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,179
See,

335
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,080
here's fundamentally where some of this really

336
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,260
frustrates me is multi-tenant systems are hard,

337
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,599
especially if you want them to be efficient, right?

338
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,359
Because I've seen multi-tenant systems where you essentially stand up at

339
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:39,679
a new instance for each tenant and they're very separate.

340
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,239
Like in the sense of like they have their own VM, their own database,

341
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,099
-- running their own V
-- M.

342
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:46,900
That's not multi-tenant, that's called single tenant cloud. Well, exactly.

343
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:49,177
But they refer to it as multi-tenant because, you know,

344
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:51,007
there's multiple tenants on the system anyways.

345
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:51,666
The point is,

346
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:54,026
and then there's, you know, like shared databases.

347
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,677
Well, but databases have pretty good security. Right.

348
00:13:56,687 --> 00:14:00,507
We've been doing that for a while now. I mean, it took them 20 years

349
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,346
and this is one of the reasons my SQL and PHP took off,

350
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:08,236
right is my SQL had really pretty good solid multi user access.

351
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,036
For example,

352
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:13,796
time nobody used that crap back in the early days of my I SQL

353
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:16,054
everyone just had like one user

354
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:16,573
and

355
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:21,283
-- you just created a new database for everything you did. And if you got
-- into a

356
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,364
new table, everybody got their own table

357
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:24,434
-- or a
-- new table.

358
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:29,093
If you got into a my sequel instance, you almost always had complete rain over it.

359
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:30,333
It was hilarious.

360
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,544
This is actually why Post Chris was better

361
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:35,393
because Post Chris had really good fine grain access

362
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:37,943
-- nobody
-- could use because it was complicated.

363
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:39,713
It was too complicated. I agree.

364
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:42,570
But that's why that's why my sequel won, right? It was easy.

365
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,370
It was, it was worse and so it won.

366
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,500
But going back to this, I think they've been more forthright and said, look, we built

367
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:51,931
a really multi-tenant system that's very efficient and has this

368
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:53,010
caching layer that

369
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:56,830
oops. Yeah, everybody went like oh OK. That happens, right?

370
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,151
Like clouded are great, like not clouded.

371
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,830
But there's many examples where people have built caching layers where like, yeah,

372
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:04,950
you got somebody else cash result back.

373
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,911
Oops, that's

374
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:06,870
really bad.

375
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,169
But it happens like because

376
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:13,340
caching layers are like anybody who's like oh caching is easy. I can do that. Yeah.

377
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:16,590
Go ray curl. I think they could have been very forthright.

378
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:20,309
The reason I'm very concerned about this is open A I is at a very

379
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,820
delicate point

380
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,830
where building trust with people is very important

381
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:27,510
and I have to say

382
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,630
my impression of them.

383
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:32,780
Uh It's funny because I'm actually just in the middle

384
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:35,080
of reading one of the major security papers about chat GP

385
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,570
T and about how they really spent a lot of

386
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,400
time and effort trying to make it safe and not,

387
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,450
you know, answer questions like,

388
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,239
what's the, you know,

389
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,190
what's the easiest way I can kill the most amount of people for $1?

390
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,549
And it, like, spits out some answer like, do this

391
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,804
or, you know, how do I make like nerve gas at home music,

392
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,924
like common household ingredients because like, it,

393
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:50,765
it,

394
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,094
it can sort of answer those questions.

395
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:54,395
It totally can.

396
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:57,215
So what frustrates me is they're at a point where they need to

397
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:01,854
really be building trust with people about the safety of their system.

398
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,200
And

399
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,000
I look at this and it's just like

400
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,429
I'm reading the security paper,

401
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,169
they did a lot of work but then I see how they

402
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,619
actually handled a security incident and it's like they handled it.

403
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:18,090
Ok. But it took a, like, one thing that also concerned me is there was talk of this

404
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:22,039
people getting other people's results for a while before they shut it down.

405
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,590
You know,

406
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:26,289
I mean, they're not going to shut it down unless they have to, let's face it.

407
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,789
Well, no, but they, they only shut down the threat

408
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,455
history. They didn't shut down the whole system and you can live without that.

409
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,466
Like, it's, it's awkward and annoying not to have

410
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,716
your history,

411
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:35,325
but

412
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:36,685
the product still works.

413
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:37,656
Ah, gotcha.

414
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:42,955
That's fair. Ok. So, look, here's what I would say to what you're talking about.

415
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,815
Being concerned about the trust in. Open

416
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:46,125
A

417
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:47,346
I as a company

418
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:47,935
open

419
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:49,346
A, I's DNA

420
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:51,315
doesn't contain

421
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:55,116
that critical response, emergency

422
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,111
aspect that comes with security

423
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:58,211
but

424
00:16:58,452 --> 00:16:59,411
-- they don't have time.
-- They

425
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:00,182
don't,

426
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,242
they don't, it doesn't matter what you say,

427
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:05,671
they don't have it and they're not going to have it and here's what's going to happen.

428
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:07,462
How many companies have you seen

429
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:09,952
that when it was crisis communications time?

430
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,561
They let the lawyers run it

431
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:16,661
-- but a lot,
-- they actually delayed chat. GP t to give it some time to make it safer.

432
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:17,362
They actually looked

433
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:17,571
at the,

434
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:18,761
what I'm talking about.

435
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:18,942
I

436
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:20,092
understand, but just let me finish

437
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:20,842
different.

438
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:21,411
But

439
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:24,082
the concern I have is that

440
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:29,869
they don't have a lot of time and space and runway to grow up and mature.

441
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,829
No, they're out, it's done. It's too late.

442
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:32,609
And

443
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,729
the other thing is to put it bluntly like they're tightly entwined with Microsoft

444
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:40,099
and Microsoft knows how to do this and does do it quite well.

445
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,300
-- And
-- that's the thing if Microsoft bought them,

446
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,939
it would solve a lot of these problems.

447
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:44,989
Microsoft can't buy them.

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,219
They,

449
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:47,209
Microsoft did invest in them but it's structured

450
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:48,859
so that they can't be taken over easily.

451
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:51,810
But so the Microsoft and opening I

452
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,459
extend partnership was announced, you know, a month ago, blah, blah, blah,

453
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:55,685
but dumb.

454
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:56,854
-- So
-- this is, I mean,

455
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:59,505
this could be a serious problem that if you have an organization

456
00:17:59,515 --> 00:18:02,905
that essentially can't be acquired by someone more competent and capable,

457
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,415
you could potentially have a serious issue because they

458
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:09,354
obviously aren't prepared for dealing with a crisis.

459
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:12,145
And why would they be, this is not the sort of

460
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:17,844
behavior or skill you, you, you learn, you don't learn this on the fly.

461
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,949
And so what's gonna happen is lawyers are going to take over

462
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:25,550
and they're going to start dealing with risk, but in the lawyer way,

463
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,319
which is often just risk, aversion, not actually dealing with risk.

464
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:32,150
And what I'm saying is they should have been prepared for this.

465
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,869
They should have been,

466
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,650
-- this is not some little start up.
-- Why would they be, why would they know this?

467
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,229
-- But why would they know this because
-- they

468
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,709
built a hugely complicated system that by definition,

469
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,469
they even like looked at how

470
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,729
those are different things.

471
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,750
-- But the point
-- is building a complicated system is not the skill set of crisis,

472
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,770
communications.

473
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,839
They could have asked chat GP t how to do crisis communications maybe.

474
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:56,510
Well, no,

475
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,400
but this is a perfect example of they should have

476
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,790
anticipated this happening and built the capability before they needed it

477
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:03,239
because

478
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:04,630
you, you anticipate this. You

479
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:05,380
have a major

480
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,270
-- in.
-- No,

481
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,319
they don't. No one, no one knows they're gonna have a major incident.

482
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,150
No one, no, Kurt, I have built

483
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,839
enough product, security teams.

484
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,439
I'm telling you, I'm going to Dunning Kruger.

485
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:24,829
You right now when you start at any organization or open source project or anything,

486
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,670
people are unprepared and unaware of the pending need

487
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:33,729
of security crisis, communications.

488
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,949
You don't think Microsoft talked to them about this or somebody like

489
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,280
I don't, this is

490
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:38,739
a,

491
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:43,050
this is a company now valued in the tens of billions of dollars building.

492
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,489
Arguably one of the most amazing hottest

493
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:51,785
things that by definition people are gonna try and abuse and beat up and compromise.

494
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:53,454
They're learning now.

495
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:57,984
But I'm telling you this is not something normal people think about. We are freaks

496
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,545
because we do this.

497
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:01,025
Well,

498
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,839
ok, I don't have the paper handy but the thing, no, seriously, please listen,

499
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:06,219
the paper, for example,

500
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:10,599
talks how they actually engaged with and hired dozens of a I

501
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,500
safety experts to red team it and to beat it up,

502
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,560
of course they did.

503
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:17,000
And I'm saying like, how did they manage to do that? But

504
00:20:17,104 --> 00:20:19,724
-- not this, this is, I'm sorry, like
-- let's let,

505
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:21,944
let me rewind this to a whole different place.

506
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:27,645
Ok. I sadly have been on this wild ride more times than I want to be

507
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:32,694
and I'm on it again at a start up. So I'm, it's all happening once again,

508
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,805
the thing is

509
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:37,869
why would someone who is an expert in A I

510
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,300
-- safety or security or whatever you want to call it?
-- No, no, I'm not saying them.

511
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,689
I'm saying the company had the foresight to hire these A I security experts

512
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,699
and to deal with this and to try and yes,

513
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:50,550
because they're A I people but to try and head these crises

514
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,469
off for them to not have built a good robust response process.

515
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:55,755
That's

516
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:57,255
what I'm

517
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:58,676
-- saying. There's
-- no reason,

518
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:03,456
no, there is no reason they would, there is absolutely no reason.

519
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:05,765
A competent A I

520
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:07,326
researcher

521
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:11,656
would imagine this will ever be a problem because it is so far.

522
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,786
-- It's, it's what's the old Rumsfeld quote, the unknowns, unknowns
-- to imagine.

523
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,871
There's no flaw in your security, open source

524
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,161
stack. I mean,

525
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:23,602
we're freaks. Kurt, we live in a world. No one else does

526
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:25,842
like, ok, let me give you a good example. Right?

527
00:21:26,082 --> 00:21:28,702
I finally, after months of brow beating

528
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:30,842
the kids on that robotics team I help with,

529
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:33,251
I have them all using password managers.

530
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:38,641
Now, this took me like six months of basically constant harassment

531
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:39,640
right

532
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,310
now that they're using password managers.

533
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:45,060
They're talking about how complex their passwords are.

534
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:48,810
And I'm like, whoa, no, complex passwords are bad.

535
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,290
You want a very long password and you're like, wait, what?

536
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:53,670
Then I'm like, ok,

537
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,260
let's talk about this and I explained like how we got to where we are, how the

538
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,949
guidance was wrong because they actually made it up

539
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,510
and once you sit down and explain to them, they're like, oh, ok. That makes sense.

540
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,729
Why would a high school kid

541
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,050
understand that pass phrases are better than passwords that

542
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,349
have like a million weird characters in them.

543
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:15,099
There's no way they would understand that because they

544
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:18,109
don't have anywhere to even begin discovering that knowledge.

545
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,010
And that is what we are talking about.

546
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:22,030
An A I researcher

547
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,930
doesn't know that security events are even

548
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:28,130
going to happen because they've probably never been

549
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,150
involved in them because they've been living in academia for the last 10 years.

550
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:33,560
The thing is their,

551
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:36,939
their safety and security paper explicitly mentions a lot of concerns.

552
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:37,790
They have like,

553
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,920
open A I being attacked and made to do bad things.

554
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,170
And it's different. I'm saying, like, I'm sorry,

555
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,959
but here's the thing you're saying. Oh, how could they possibly imagine?

556
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:49,270
Oh, it's too hard. Well, I'm sorry.

557
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,790
But you, like, when I imagine a house I don't get to just write the plans for it.

558
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,329
I hire an architect who hires an engineer

559
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,270
that builds me a foundation that doesn't

560
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,829
immediately fall down because Kurt's like,

561
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,000
what's the foundation?

562
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,589
I just want to build a house. Why do I need a foundation?

563
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,270
And that's what I'm saying is we're at this

564
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,449
point where they need to build trust and show

565
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:09,040
well that they're trustworthy

566
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,660
and

567
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,479
no, they do. They absolutely do.

568
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,290
But they just found out now

569
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,959
that they have to do this.

570
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,380
I I'm telling you

571
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,959
beyond a reasonable doubt when they sent that tweet,

572
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:26,400
they probably thought like this is the get out of jail free card.

573
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,400
Everyone will be like, oh cool, cool.

574
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,994
It was open source everything fine now and that is not what happened and

575
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:35,954
anyone in our place would have looked at that tweet and been like,

576
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,265
you can't send that at at all.

577
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:40,675
Like, no, that is the worst thing.

578
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,635
Like if we were going to rank all of the things you could say

579
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:48,055
that is probably the absolute bottom of the list. Unquestionably

580
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:50,074
again,

581
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:53,474
this is a skill set people don't have

582
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:58,905
and you can't learn it on the fly. Well, you learn things on the fly

583
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,770
but like

584
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:01,989
-- it's hard.
-- But see, here's the thing,

585
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,310
the start up you work for managed to find you.

586
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:06,239
You're saying open the eye with tens of billions of

587
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,280
-- dollars can't find one of us
-- if they will.

588
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,569
Now, I think they know about it now.

589
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:13,199
But, but here's the thing,

590
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:16,719
here's the thing you got to remember the start up I work for came to get me

591
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:22,079
because I worked with some of them at Red Hot. And so they were aware this is a problem.

592
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,199
I bet you most of the people at open a I spent a long time in academia,

593
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,439
they probably never ventured out into the scary world of product.

594
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,699
And so they didn't even realize this was going to happen

595
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,459
in, in the world of academia.

596
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,839
You could totally go to your department head and say, oh, we use this open

597
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,989
source library and it screwed everything up and,

598
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,229
and so it's totally open source library's fault,

599
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:46,099
but we'll fix it later and it'll be cool.

600
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,709
-- OK? And you'd be like, all right, good job.
-- Right. I don't know. Like I said, I just

601
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,030
either they do have a security team and this is the result of it,

602
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,750
which is not encouraging.

603
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,510
I, I don't think they do or they don't have this capability,

604
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,430
which is also very worrying.

605
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,880
So either way it's, I'm not,

606
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,300
I'm a little bit worried

607
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:09,459
this conversation ended up in a place that I, I didn't expect at all in

608
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,900
any universe.

609
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,400
But I,

610
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,560
I think here's the important part and I want to bring us

611
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:16,219
back to the thing I was actually hoping that we would talk about

612
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:17,550
and we didn't,

613
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,939
but it's basically

614
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:23,189
we exist in this open source universe now where

615
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:25,939
everyone is using open source in everything they have.

616
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,969
And there is definitely

617
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:28,750
a,

618
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,869
I think simplistic view that says when one of the packages I'm using

619
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,780
has a bug or a security vulnerability or something wrong with it,

620
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,069
it's not my problem. It's the problem with the open source

621
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,790
and

622
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:41,810
you'll see this.

623
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:46,829
If you look at some of the the bugs filed against open source packages,

624
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,750
we only have people being like you need to fix this. This is breaking my product.

625
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,829
It's like, no, we don't like why don't you fix it and send us the patch.

626
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,880
It is really interesting to me that people have a lot of people, not all people,

627
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,270
but a lot of people have formed this,

628
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:02,790
I get to use this and

629
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:07,369
I get to use this for free and I get the benefit of being able to ship it

630
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,180
and I get the benefit of being able to

631
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:11,640
charge money for either shipping it or supporting it.

632
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:15,469
And somehow they get to make demands of the open source people,

633
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:18,640
which again goes back to, you know, Tomas, I'm not a supplier thing.

634
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,069
And

635
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,380
yeah, I just, it's wild to me that like,

636
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,609
yeah, it's just, it's such a, it's an obviously pervasive

637
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,410
like it's a very common mindset

638
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,599
and maybe it's because for example, people drive on roads and complain about,

639
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:39,770
you know, the quality of the roads of the roads are like jammed up.

640
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,890
We need more roads because I pay taxes, you know, I pay your salary,

641
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:44,380
you know,

642
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,829
and maybe it's part of that. But

643
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:48,979
how do I put this nicely?

644
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:51,569
Like, when it comes to negotiating with an open source project?

645
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,550
I think what people forget is by definition,

646
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,930
if you're negotiating or making demands of an open source project,

647
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,849
you're in a position of weakness because

648
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,280
to be, well,

649
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:06,719
if you were involved in it, you'd be like, hey, everybody, we found this bug and hm,

650
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:08,040
I don't know how to fix it, but like,

651
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:11,609
you know, you, you're the subsystem owner. Can you, can you take a look at it, please?

652
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,170
And thank you or, you know, we have a proposed patch

653
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,010
and

654
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,900
that would be a much easier discussion to have than like, yeah,

655
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,280
I need you to fix this patch now so I can show my product

656
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,020
that

657
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:21,510
all

658
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:21,910
the time

659
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,689
and, and,

660
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:24,410
and, and I think that's,

661
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:28,790
I think a lot of companies are gonna be up for rude awakenings. But,

662
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,329
and what's kind of funny to me is I don't think it's

663
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:34,410
actually gonna be that bad for most companies because most open source

664
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,449
is

665
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:37,930
shockingly robust and secure.

666
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,849
Like when you consider that somebody wrote it in their spare time

667
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,319
to scratch an itch and

668
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,500
yeah.

669
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,130
No, it is. I think for if you compare these security bugs per lines of code of open

670
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,410
source, destroys most of the competition in terms of quality,

671
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,150
we'll never know will.

672
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,810
We like, that's the thing, right?

673
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:56,280
We can say whatever we want about closed

674
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,369
source because they'll never release that stuff.

675
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,829
That's a good point unless they like,

676
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,550
do a massive code cleaning effort and then release it.

677
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,010
Definitely not.

678
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:07,739
Anyway. All right, I've got one last point before we end.

679
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:13,569
This one is, I just looked up so the guy who tweeted that, that open A I tweet

680
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:14,479
gaming gratis,

681
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,449
that guy's the CEO.

682
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,310
Oh, sorry, I should have mentioned that.

683
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,859
-- I didn't know that. I don't know anything about open
-- A I Yeah.

684
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,550
No, he's the CEO like this is not some Rando.

685
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:24,630
You think

686
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,729
if the CEO is sending out a tweet like that they have a security team, like come on,

687
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:33,609
-- that's all I'm saying.
-- So good news is they have a bug bounty.

688
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,770
-- Bad news is no rewards that
-- they don't have a bug bunny.

689
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,989
Well, no, no, no worse.

690
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,280
What they've said to the community is if you find a bug

691
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,790
and you wanna get rewarded for it, go to the bad guys.

692
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,680
No, that's what they're saying.

693
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:50,030
If Apple did this, would anybody cut Apple any slack? No.

694
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,119
And they shouldn't.

695
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,030
They'd be like Apple, you have to pay money,

696
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:56,359
you have to pay money for these phones to fix our phones to keep us safe.

697
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,050
And I'm Yeah,

698
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,270
that's right again, I'm a huge fan of chat GP D I think it's world changing.

699
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,209
You know, I'm looking like my, my one son is using it already and loving it,

700
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:05,500
uh,

701
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,510
for historical research purposes

702
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,900
and like, yeah, I, yeah. No, they, they need to, they need to get better at this.

703
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,140
Like now they don't have a year or

704
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,390
I agree. And that's what scares me. I'm not afraid of chat. GP.

705
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,500
T I'm afraid of open a, I,

706
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,699
because I'm not convinced

707
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,819
they have the mental fortitude

708
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,099
to deal with everything coming.

709
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,670
Well, the good news is,

710
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,189
is they are tightly twined with Microsoft who can hopefully

711
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:36,010
be the adult to help them achieve this quickly.

712
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,670
I hope so because uh like I

713
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,750
look at their coordinate vulnerability disclosure policy.

714
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,390
Like, and, and basically they expect you to

715
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:47,469
essentially they expect to be treated like an open source project

716
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,609
except

717
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,589
they're not, they're, they're a multibillion dollar entity,

718
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:52,469
right?

719
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:53,099
Like

720
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,339
-- I'm sorry,
-- poor little open A I don't be picking on us.

721
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,660
-- We're just a poor little billion dollar company.
-- This isn't, you know,

722
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:03,910
Daniel doing consulting work for curl. Like

723
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,689
no, this is they have resources

724
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:11,260
-- if they choose to big
-- curl pushing their agenda. Like anyway.

725
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,949
All right, I'm, I'm calling this one.

726
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,660
What a conversation, Kurt, I don't even know what to say

727
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:21,109
-- anyway. Thank you, Kurt.
-- We should have chat GP T analyze this conversation.

728
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,219
No, I don't think we should. It'll probably tell us things we know it's true.

729
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:28,180
We don't want to admit. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you all for listening. Go to open
