00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,070
We're recording a podcast.

1
00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:03,430
We're a security podcast. Remember?

2
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:06,800
Hello and welcome to the open source security.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,319
I'm just going to leave all this in from the time I said,

4
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:11,909
or a security podcast.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,989
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,969
-- and my partner and this is not technically job. So we're ok, Josh Pressers.
-- Ok.

7
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:29,850
So it's funny you say that because it amuses me every now and then I'll get an email.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,610
-- Like I get a lot of pitches for guests like a lot. You know
-- what's

9
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,490
weird is I get pitches and they don't CCU

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,610
but then I'm like, oh yeah,

11
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,349
and sometimes we're both CC and it wouldn't shock me

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,310
at all if we each get the same pitches.

13
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,270
-- Oh,
-- maybe they don't know how to use CC maybe.

14
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:46,509
-- And
-- if you go to the Contact Us page, like you and I

15
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:49,193
both listed anyway, every now and then someone will be like,

16
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:50,783
how much money do you want for this gap?

17
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:52,423
And I'll always say something like

18
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:55,603
we don't accept money. Our currency is ideas

19
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:59,022
and they have never once replied when I say that to them,

20
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:02,603
what does that tell you.

21
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:06,193
And I love when they're trying to pitch them and make it sound good and I, I, like,

22
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:09,383
look them up or I look up their thing and it's like to be blunt.

23
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:11,303
Wow, they actually hired a pretty good pr firm, like,

24
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:13,703
because they're trying to real hard, pitch them and stuff, but, like,

25
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:15,623
they have nothing to pitch and look

26
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:19,456
ok with that, like, hire apr firm, pr firms doing it like whatever. I get it.

27
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:22,875
-- I get it
-- all well, but gets music clearly. Never listen to the podcast

28
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:23,195
either.

29
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:25,676
That too. It's like, do you know who you're dealing with?

30
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,325
And who was it? There was, I don't remember who.

31
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:32,066
-- Now we had a guest one time
-- with the Minder.

32
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:33,155
The minder.

33
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:34,435
That one amused me greatly.

34
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:37,676
-- We've had what I think we've had two or three guests now with Minders which,
-- 00,

35
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,236
lots of people have the, the, the handlers, whatever.

36
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:40,625
That's fine.

37
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:40,786
I

38
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:41,356
don't mind it.

39
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:45,115
Anytime I do stuff with work they send a handler along to for some reason.

40
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:46,379
Yeah, for some reason.

41
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,699
Anyway,

42
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:48,660
anyway,

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,300
there,

44
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,410
there was someone one time that they were a

45
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,139
guest and then they sent me an email afterwards.

46
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,660
You're like, you guys are just like yourselves in

47
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:59,379
because they, they, they didn't expect it. Like this is who we are.

48
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:03,639
-- Like this isn't some like persona.
-- We're not like radio show hosts,

49
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:03,900
right?

50
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,199
And so the before, like during the recording and then after it was,

51
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,429
this is what you get,

52
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,720
like, what did, what did you think you were going to get?

53
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,860
Like, I'm sorry, I disappointed you, I guess, I don't know what to say.

54
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,910
And maybe the difference is in, in the sort of professional, like,

55
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,389
newscasting type world.

56
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:22,779
They, they are kind of almost actors in a way that's probably fair.

57
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:25,190
And so there is like a professional persona of, like,

58
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,240
the way they read sad stories and talk about sad news is, you know,

59
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,509
not how you and I would do it.

60
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,190
Yeah. Right. Right. And, and we,

61
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,789
we, we're not getting paid.

62
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,429
No one's here to be like,

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,990
we're taking your money away if you don't start

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,339
-- acting like professionals
-- or the sponsors will pull.

65
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,149
And that's why I don't want sponsors either because

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,940
we can be clowns and no one cares anyway.

67
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:45,550
All right, we, we have an actual topic. We've,

68
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,630
ah, I don't know,

69
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:49,940
but to be fair, the right sponsor for the right price. We're open to it.

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,809
Look anything over a million, like you're in like, yeah,

71
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,419
we'll literally talk about anything for over a million dollars.

72
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:56,789
Just, just throwing that out there.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,529
No, not cheese. No, no, man. I live in a place with lots of cheese. I don't need cheese.

74
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,309
What I need is a million dollars,

75
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,380
million dollars each.

76
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,910
No, I was actually just expecting you to take the million bucks.

77
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,740
And, well, that's true.

78
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,229
I could just take it, I have basically total control over this process. But

79
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,149
anyway,

80
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:14,740
anyway,

81
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,570
anyway, so

82
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,809
this is sadly related to the topic. Let's get to the point.

83
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,309
Yeah.

84
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,119
So, so what happened is,

85
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,610
I guess Equifax either got suspicious or wanted to

86
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,550
try an experiment or something and they basically,

87
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,860
Equifax used to be a credit ratings agency and by, used to be, I mean,

88
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:35,449
like decades ago now they're like every piece of data about every human

89
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,429
on the planet company basically and probably jealous of Facebook and they,

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,779
they have data like payroll stuff and all that.

91
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,139
So anyway,

92
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,320
so they basically brand the data and found out a

93
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,270
bunch of their people had more than one job now.

94
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,039
Ok, let's set the stage here for a sec.

95
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,600
Number one people who apparently work for Equifax sign an agreement,

96
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,990
a contract that says they will only work for Equifax.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,389
And so to be blunt, if you sign a contract and then violate it,

98
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,429
yeah, that's gonna suck for you

99
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,240
because that's kind of the whole point of contract law is

100
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,550
we agree

101
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,869
on a thing

102
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:08,190
and sign it and then abide by the rules of it. And then

103
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,110
if we don't, there's penalties or like getting sued and stuff,

104
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,059
I signed the same contract when I went to work

105
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,669
at Elastic where I was not allowed to take on

106
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,428
extra work without first consulting with

107
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,519
like the company. And that's fine.

108
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,910
-- I mean, I was fine with it. They
-- basically

109
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,450
what really gets me is how do I put this nicely?

110
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,160
A traditional problem with white collar work

111
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:30,600
is we can't

112
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,000
measure productivity now for a lot of blue collar jobs.

113
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,940
That's a really critical thing.

114
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,839
Like if you have a machinist running a million dollar CNC machine,

115
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,670
well, he

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,470
like seven parts that Met specs versus this other

117
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,600
guy who produced like 14 parts that Met specs.

118
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:44,799
Ok.

119
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:45,200
Well,

120
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:48,130
maybe we can have the 14 parts person train

121
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,829
the seven parts person and figure out a better workflow

122
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,489
and, and that's where you get into like six sigma and efficiency management,

123
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,350
all that, you know, Taylorism and blah, blah, blah.

124
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,029
Right?

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,230
And,

126
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,910
and that works actually shockingly well for like

127
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,559
the manufacturing and stuff world because like,

128
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,390
as you can see now,

129
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,059
like I can get random things from China delivered to my

130
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,119
doorstep in a day or two and most of them work.

131
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:11,720
I I want to clarify a point there because I

132
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,470
think something we forget is manufacturing has been more studied,

133
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,170
I think throughout history.

134
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,040
And so

135
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,970
it's not that you can't measure white collar work.

136
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,429
I would say it's, we don't know how to measure a lot of white collar work.

137
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,049
I would say it's even worse than that.

138
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:29,950
Do we even know what success means?

139
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,089
-- And
-- I'm not starting that conversation

140
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,380
and,

141
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,029
and I would say we probably don't even know really what success means.

142
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,369
So then how do we like, what do we measure

143
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,839
-- share price.
-- I, I think it sort of comes down to the end of the day is you have companies

144
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,690
and fundamentally the thing the company is going to look at is the

145
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:45,985
revenue coming in. Right.

146
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:49,575
They expect the revenue to be growing quarter over quarter year, over year.

147
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:51,415
-- Yeah,
-- and profit and whatnot as well.

148
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:54,976
And profit is another story that's kind of different now in the universe we live in.

149
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:56,885
But basically you want revenue to go up, right?

150
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,976
And if revenue isn't going up, there's something wrong.

151
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,925
But the problem is especially when you have some of

152
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:04,825
these large companies revenue can go up company wide.

153
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:08,915
But you could have parts of the company that are like extremely sick

154
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:11,782
and actually dragging everything down around them.

155
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,492
We don't always have a good way to figure that out.

156
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:17,511
Well, you can also have an entire company that's doing well,

157
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:20,141
but is essentially in a dead end industry.

158
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,712
That is also true. You know.

159
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:22,761
So for example,

160
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:25,881
all the companies that were didn't make the transition to smartphones.

161
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,141
A lot of them had really good,

162
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:30,272
like Blackberry up until the end had some pretty good quarters and then just

163
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,122
off a clock

164
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,291
-- that
-- is
-- like

165
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:37,519
-- literally like and anyway, so
-- let, let's reframe this now.

166
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,820
So you've got Equifax looks at their company.

167
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:44,929
Here's, that's not as scary as the the story I dug up from business insider.

168
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,750
They found there were people have been found at some of these companies, like,

169
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,799
literally collecting paychecks from two companies

170
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,459
at the same time,

171
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:58,160
two full time jobs, like, in Equifax's case, some of the people were doing that,

172
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,760
it sounds like.

173
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:01,339
And a lot of the people just had a second job,

174
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,119
like they were doing something in the evenings or whatever,

175
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,290
one of my concerns there would be.

176
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,880
So, if company a is paying you for, let's say,

177
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,040
for the sake of argument for 40 hours a week.

178
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,179
Yeah, I mean,

179
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,459
what's to say?

180
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,049
Somebody can't work 80 hours a week and just be really busy and sleep and work and

181
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,809
eat, take out food.

182
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,290
I, I'm like, I'm not saying it's, it's a good idea,

183
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:23,049
-- but it's
-- the business insider story.

184
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,929
They don't explicitly say it,

185
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,649
but it is well suggested that people were not doing their jobs.

186
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,750
They were basically barely doing enough to not

187
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,089
get fired while working at two companies and basically

188
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:35,325
-- doubling their pay.
-- Well.

189
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,255
And see this speaks to why does it take so

190
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:38,964
many months for these companies to figure this out?

191
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,105
Like, literally,

192
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:43,894
if somebody like is on an assembly line and not doing anything that day,

193
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:46,725
you hopefully figure it out pretty quickly when like the tires

194
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,165
start falling off cars at the end of the assembly line.

195
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:51,625
Right? And that's the thing with white collar work. It's hard.

196
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:54,704
But at the same time, like people, well, I remember simple things like a red hat.

197
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,464
We kind of kept a log of what we did. Right.

198
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,184
And sent it in every, what was a week or something. I want to say

199
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:02,144
it was, it was weekly and I, I do that now. I mean,

200
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,549
I am on anchor's management team and we fill out a management report every week for

201
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:08,980
Anchor

202
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,709
and, and that's cool. Like,

203
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:12,609
the,

204
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:17,230
the problem I have is like, what can I put in like 100 million things I've done,

205
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,709
I can put five in, like which five should I put in?

206
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,510
-- So I,
-- I mean,

207
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,320
this is an example of why I like ticketing systems and things because it's like,

208
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:24,029
I don't have to fill,

209
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,980
it's just like here's a pile of tickets I touched and solved and opened and whatever.

210
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:33,549
It's like turning your get commit messages into the change log for the release.

211
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,989
-- And
-- I get some of it was tough because I remember at Red Hat,

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,280
I got grief for not doing enough, but I'm like, I'm not gonna put like, doing email.

213
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:39,960
That's like just

214
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,630
things that I like, how can I not do email and my job?

215
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,330
So I want to reframe this conversation because

216
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,729
I think we're getting a little off track.

217
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,739
And the reason I was interested in this topic when you kind of

218
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,989
brought it up and brought it to my attention is that I think

219
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,150
measuring

220
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,380
or I shouldn't say measuring, but rather understanding

221
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:02,479
what people are doing at work, especially from the new work from home universe.

222
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,640
Where in the past you had managers staring at people, sitting at desks,

223
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,309
typing away doing something.

224
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,440
And now you have people at home so that environment doesn't work.

225
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:16,010
But then we look at things like the world

226
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,960
of security and how many security teams have no way

227
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:24,054
to show any progress or effort that they're doing.

228
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:26,515
-- And I feel like there are enormous parallels
-- here.

229
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,145
You said the word understanding,

230
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,145
which I find fascinating because I would say a

231
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,715
lot of places aren't even at the observing stage,

232
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:34,414
let alone understanding stage.

233
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:36,994
I don't think observing is important.

234
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:39,695
Well, observing is step one because without observing,

235
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:40,895
how can you then understand?

236
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:41,414
Right.

237
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,520
And which I think this actually speaks to what a lot of companies try to do,

238
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,179
which is they put on these horrifically intrusive,

239
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,960
monitoring things that like monitor your key clicks and stuff

240
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:54,760
because I suspect many of them equate observable with understanding,

241
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,049
which speaks to you saying all managers used to like walk around

242
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,000
the floor and observe their workers and know that they were working.

243
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,039
-- No, like half of them were doing the New York Times portal. They were,
-- but they,

244
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,809
they're sitting in a chair so they could justify paying that person for,

245
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,489
for working.

246
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,349
And I put that in air quotes versus now I can sit at home and watch

247
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:15,130
youtube all day and they wouldn't know it because they don't know what I do.

248
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,219
And there's no way to show that my day

249
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:22,130
resulted in this particular outcome for the organization,

250
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,549
right?

251
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:24,349
And so we're going to leave that whole

252
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,159
aside because it's way too complicated.

253
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:30,770
Now, as far as security goes, for example, there are sometimes directly observe

254
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:31,359
things.

255
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,419
So a perfect example is this weekend,

256
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:37,789
I enabled two of a for everybody in our Microsoft 365

257
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:38,900
finally got that done.

258
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,989
I was supposed to enable single sign up for docusign,

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,969
but their documentation doesn't match their webinar face and it didn't work.

260
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,669
I think I know why I didn't work but I want to make them make sure that anyways,

261
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,179
I I don't basically want to troubleshoot

262
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,950
it when their documentation should be correct.

263
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:53,969
That's fair.

264
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,469
You know,

265
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:59,429
we're in the process of finally getting like everybody up keys and rolling that out.

266
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,719
So

267
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,960
for example, like, one of my basic goals this year is to get everybody up keys,

268
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:08,630
get our Google locked down to hardware authentication tokens, only

269
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:13,650
Microsoft two fa because I'm not willing to pay for,

270
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,450
what is it E five or E six or whatever the heck

271
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,549
it is to get single sign on and all the fancy stuff.

272
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,820
And you know, most of our documentation goes public anyway.

273
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,869
So I don't really have, it's,

274
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,479
we're a nontraditional organization in that way and

275
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,179
that like the majority of what we produce,

276
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,109
we actually desperately want people to read

277
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,929
like no. Right. That, that's one of the reasons. I like working for Red Hat.

278
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,080
It's like, oh,

279
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,969
you read our source code, huh?

280
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,539
Yeah. Did you find any bugs? Can you please tell us?

281
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,299
Right? Like, we can't pay for it. But

282
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:43,559
-- can you please tell us?
-- Actually, I have a funny side note there is.

283
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,479
So I'm helping out a first robotics organization at my son's high school.

284
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,400
I'm the programming mentor for the group, which is a ton of fun.

285
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,760
Like, they're great kids.

286
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,479
I'm, I'm learning a lot.

287
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:53,659
Like,

288
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:56,719
it's stuff like I'm not III I would love to like

289
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:59,010
actually program the robot because that would make my day.

290
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,630
But I, I I'm not allowed to.

291
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,409
You can make it so much better than these kids.

292
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:06,510
I know, I feel like come on, I've only got 30 years of experience over you.

293
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:10,270
It's so simple anyway. So it's funny because

294
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:11,599
they have a Discord.

295
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,309
They have a github.

296
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,989
They have all this and like, they give it to me.

297
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,599
And the first thing I did was like, I just,

298
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,559
I opened it everything wide open and they're like, what are you doing?

299
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,849
The other mentors? I'm like, this is just way easier. Like default to open, trust me.

300
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:22,650
And it was funny,

301
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,289
they thought I was like a crazy person and after a month they're like,

302
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,489
this is a lot easier.

303
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,799
Like I told you,

304
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,469
yeah, like least privilege is great until you actually have to get work done.

305
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,890
-- Especially with kids.
-- I know, it's horrible.

306
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,750
And they're like, you're a security guy, I'm like, you'll see

307
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,140
anyway, anyway,

308
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,169
back to measuring security.

309
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,729
And then,

310
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,640
and then another thing I would point out is essentially cloud security

311
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,469
lines and data breach are not words you will find in Google.

312
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:49,440
-- I
-- mean, not yet. Don't, don't ever say that so

313
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:49,780
far.

314
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:51,859
I've done a decent job and that's part of it. Right.

315
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,840
Is, is a perfect example because I was talking to my son, you know,

316
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:58,270
because my recently my credit card got compromised somewhere and on Sunday a

317
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:02,200
week ago, you know, it got popped and used in Singapore to order food.

318
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:04,440
And so I was talking with my son Felix about this,

319
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,929
you know, talking about how blah, blah, blah.

320
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:07,989
And, you know,

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,940
I pointed out like one of the things I did at the CS A to make

322
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,640
sure that we would never have this happen is we just don't handle payment cards.

323
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,710
Like we outsourced it to paypal and braintree,

324
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,059
which is totally the right thing. I made that choice over 10 years ago.

325
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,929
And like not my problem just if, and if paypal gets reached like I

326
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:27,619
man, who else am I gonna pick? I get? Not everybody can do that. But

327
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,219
the thing is like, there are

328
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:33,109
sort of measurable things you can do to

329
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:33,890
try and

330
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,669
improve things.

331
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,760
Yeah, like as far as sort of the day to day goes, it's,

332
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,729
it's like basically doing plant maintenance it's like, yeah,

333
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:43,440
-- I tightened all these bolts and, like, nothing caught fire, I guess I did my job
-- and,

334
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,780
and so that's part of the challenge I think is when you are in many of these roles,

335
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:50,590
if nothing happens, you've done your job.

336
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,039
You know what I mean? I mean?

337
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:55,580
And that's one of the funny things sometimes, like, if you have a programmer,

338
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,119
you can say, oh, this programmer

339
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,979
wrote this much code. But I, I remember I was reading

340
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:01,280
added a feature.

341
00:14:01,349 --> 00:14:01,840
Well, I,

342
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:05,520
I was reading an article and I think it might have been Ken Thompson who did this.

343
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,299
But they, they worked somewhere and they, at the end of every day,

344
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:09,260
they were supposed to,

345
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,219
they had to send a report saying this is how many lines of

346
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:16,179
code I wrote this day because someone decided they were going to measure programmer

347
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,409
output lines of code

348
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:18,309
and they, they,

349
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:22,219
they deleted a bunch of stuff like they were like clean refactoring code or moving.

350
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:27,190
And so they sent the report where like I wrote minus 10,000 lines of code today.

351
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,559
-- That's an incredibly important
-- sometimes.

352
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,450
But their manager got really mad at them for

353
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,989
that because they obviously didn't understand what was happening.

354
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,229
But at the same time, like there have been days I have written

355
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,059
10 lines of code

356
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,919
and it legit took me eight hours to write those 10 lines.

357
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:47,150
And there have been days I've written like hundreds of lines of code

358
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,989
and the 10 lines,

359
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:54,340
-- like where I was far more proud of, you know. So
-- you weren't on the last GSD call.

360
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:56,130
But I showed them my myro board with my,

361
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,159
the kind of layout of the software and it's like,

362
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,770
that represents tens of hours of work plus, well,

363
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,690
sort of implicitly hundreds and thousands of

364
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,049
hours of understanding spanning back two decades.

365
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,599
And all I've got is basically a one screen size thing with like 20 post it notes.

366
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:12,700
But it's,

367
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,070
and everybody was like, oh,

368
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,580
-- it's actually really good. But
-- that's the thing.

369
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,640
That's the thing.

370
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:18,479
How do you show

371
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,969
that you're doing work in an environment like that?

372
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:23,460
And especially like one of the other things I was thinking about.

373
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,590
So let's say you've got a situation where someone's like, oh, are you,

374
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,849
are you doing your work?

375
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:28,570
And

376
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,880
I have been on projects that have taken like more than a week

377
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:34,580
before we had a result.

378
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,000
So at the end of the week, I could be like, well,

379
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,780
I've been working on this but I literally have nothing to show for it.

380
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,080
Well, it's funny because there's a war blogger

381
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,880
pin who talks about this, how he talks about um

382
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,150
scientific advancement

383
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,669
isn't like in a computer game where it's like, ok, go, you know,

384
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,179
uh uh send a million dollars or a million minerals

385
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,020
to buy the upgrade for the building armor or whatever,

386
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,940
like in Starcraft

387
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:58,039
in the real world. You spend, um,

388
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,369
a jillion dollars

389
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,640
and like you, you might get nothing or worse than nothing,

390
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,500
you might end up with something that's poisonous.

391
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:04,760
Right.

392
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,440
It's not like, it's, it's, if I give you a billion dollars to do R and D,

393
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,015
it's not a guarantee that you're gonna

394
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:11,974
get something useful out of that.

395
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:15,804
I think R and D money is rarely wasted

396
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:19,614
because what happens in the world of R and D and this is actually this, that we should,

397
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,875
this might be the key.

398
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:22,075
So in the world of R and D,

399
00:16:22,224 --> 00:16:24,604
you're given money, you're told to do something,

400
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,585
you do the thing and then you write up a huge report whether it works or doesn't work.

401
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:32,895
And if it doesn't work, you gain new knowledge that you can then apply

402
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,895
in some meaningful way in the future.

403
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,479
Whereas I feel like in the world of security today,

404
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:40,010
we often are in a situation where it's like here's,

405
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,159
I need a million dollars to buy this tool

406
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,419
and then you give me a million dollars and like did the tool work and you're like,

407
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,919
-- I guess
-- like

408
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:51,140
again, it came up like in the scientific, like there's no controls, like,

409
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:51,409
yeah,

410
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:54,989
we spent a million dollars on this uh security system to reduce the

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,690
number of flaws uh through our software in the C I CD pipeline.

412
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,809
Well, would they have happened without it,

413
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:03,700
-- would they have been caught without it? Like, is it you know what I mean?
-- Like,

414
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,209
yeah,

415
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,729
like I have a SIM, right. A security,

416
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,180
what information and event manager

417
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,368
manager?

418
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,880
Yeah, I never remember that.

419
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:13,530
It's funny.

420
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:13,868
I've worked,

421
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,250
I worked for a company that freaking made one and I can never remember it.

422
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,449
I still have to look up how to spell red hat with the space or without,

423
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,209
who cares. Anyway,

424
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,608
-- like,
-- well, the point is, like,

425
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:24,630
I worked there for seven years and I still have to look at like, oh,

426
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,150
and you're wearing a t-shirt and it's wrong.

427
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,089
I'm wearing a literal

428
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:27,999
red hat. But this is the

429
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,499
shirt but there's no space in the

430
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:30,918
shirt I'm wearing. But

431
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:32,668
my guess is if I worked there,

432
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,468
the brand people would probably yell at me for earning this shirt.

433
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:38,509
I, I've kept some choice red hat shirts.

434
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:42,389
But anyway, ok, so, so let's say we have a SIM. Right?

435
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,329
And this is a great example of it. It monitors incidents. It looks for events.

436
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,150
You're, you're digging, you're sifting through all this data and

437
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,280
the people using it are very busy. Right. Extremely busy. Probably too busy.

438
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,670
-- But does it, does it matter?
-- Well, no, I know many security teams that are just,

439
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,760
they, they need more work. Like they're complaining they're bored, they need some

440
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,670
have never met a security team.

441
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:06,465
I'm being sarcastic.

442
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:06,745
I

443
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:06,975
like,

444
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:07,115
I,

445
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:10,595
like, I want, I wanna work on that security team.

446
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:14,015
But anyway, the point is right. I've got a Sim, I've got all this data. It

447
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:17,515
doesn't matter. We think it does

448
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:20,586
but we can't actually prove it. Does.

449
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:24,765
Have you actually used it to, like, block or stop an attack?

450
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:31,232
-- No, you've never seen one actually stop an attack.
-- Well, or not to stop an attack.

451
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:34,001
But like the cat, like my credit card got, they caught it finally when they're like,

452
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:37,141
oh, a couple of $500 transactions for food in Singapore that might not be current.

453
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:39,702
-- Maybe we should stop it.
-- That's fraud detection. That's different.

454
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,832
That's something different. We're not, I don't want to go there. Uh

455
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,562
Sim, specifically. So here's the thing with Sim. Right?

456
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:48,261
You can have your endpoint, what, what do you call the, the new

457
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,582
antivirus, endpoint detection? Sure. We'll call it endpoint detection,

458
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:52,060
right.

459
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:52,390
You've got like,

460
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,540
-- your endpoint detection running
-- or endpoint management or control

461
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,689
-- the
-- stuff that, like, looks for

462
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,619
strange behavior

463
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,469
and like, shoots the process in the head or whatever. Right.

464
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:03,449
I have no idea what it's called.

465
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:03,739
So,

466
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,329
you've got some of that and I have very

467
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:09,619
little experience with that doing actually catching bad things.

468
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,770
Generally speaking

469
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,569
99% of the time it's false positives.

470
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,750
Then you have SIM alerts where you've got like weird traffic on your network.

471
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,599
You've got weird log entries and that's the thing,

472
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:23,040
like throwing up constant errors to the,

473
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:27,959
the security analysts looking at it. Right. Then you have the,

474
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,329
like, post

475
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,079
incident research that's being done.

476
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,609
And that part where you go look at log files,

477
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,119
you look at what's in the SIM you tie all this information together and you can say,

478
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,520
OK,

479
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,229
this malware got on this laptop

480
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,199
and then it later moved to this server over here

481
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,079
and then it stole this data from that server

482
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,359
like that.

483
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,310
It's very good and useful for. But some of the other things

484
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,979
I, I can't tell you it like actually, I mean,

485
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,199
now if you ask any company that works on it, they're gonna give you

486
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,709
tons of examples of it doing its job. But I can tell you that I,

487
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,920
I am more suspect of that data.

488
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,069
So question does the si have a thing built in to

489
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,239
sort of capture and build an artifact around that event?

490
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,229
Because I'm thinking about the real world and

491
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:15,410
real world security where when there's an incident,

492
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,040
there's always an incident report and or maybe even police report,

493
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,339
like everything gets

494
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:21,000
like,

495
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,229
like you can go like the Edmonton police service has a GIS database

496
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,989
that

497
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,469
you or anybody on the planet can go look at like

498
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,030
neighborhoods in Edmonton and say like over this 30 day period,

499
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:34,920
what happened, you know, like

500
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,489
and, and see that data

501
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:37,189
and

502
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,030
because what I'm thinking of is like in the real world, it's,

503
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,000
it's really easy to get data and statistics and stories,

504
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,209
not just anecdotal stories,

505
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:46,229
but like news stories like properly researched

506
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,500
things that have been confirmed and verified

507
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,349
about

508
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,709
criminal incidents, right?

509
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,270
Like uh think about the news like that,

510
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
that's one of the main things the news covers typically.

511
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,630
But in the cybersecurity world, like how many companies put out really,

512
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,189
like really truthful

513
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:08,660
uh detailed post mortems of security events. And like, I there's like five r

514
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:11,359
like there's like Google cloud flare.

515
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:14,680
Well, look, they, they don't even put out the kind of data you actually need.

516
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:17,400
So what happens in this universe is

517
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,640
what you really need are things like IP addresses and

518
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,670
operating systems and behavior you've seen on

519
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,420
your network and there are sharing platforms

520
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,439
you can, there's things like sticks and taxi which have the intent

521
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,260
is that you have like organizations come together

522
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,609
and share some of this like threat material.

523
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,270
Well, heck we run one like

524
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,839
true star like we're,

525
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,770
yeah, but, but they're not,

526
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:46,880
they're not super useful, like there's some good stuff in there. But the problem is

527
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,040
I think

528
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,930
what you see in the world of security, a lot of companies want to kind of

529
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:57,569
hide a lot of this information and they don't want to share it so they don't share.

530
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:58,400
It's not like

531
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,489
when you're talking to the police,

532
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,910
the police legally have to make all this stuff public. You know what I mean?

533
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,150
-- Well, in not all jurisdictions
-- but yeah,

534
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,239
well, but you know what I mean?

535
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,770
Like generally speaking it, it's very different whereas

536
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,479
companies and this is something where,

537
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:14,790
when you see things like the SEC in the United States,

538
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,270
the Securities and Exchange Commission

539
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:21,900
saying like, if you experience a breach, no matter how small you have to report it.

540
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,680
And some of that I think is going to

541
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:29,050
change some of this because now we have a situation where

542
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,520
organizations have to start reporting what's going on versus today,

543
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:36,410
they generally don't report things unless it's like a really big deal.

544
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,290
Well, like a simple example, I was talking with some people about cloud S

545
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,410
bomb and I'm like a lot of these companies really don't want to

546
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,780
do that because then they're just gonna get like weird scan reports saying,

547
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,609
hey, you use this version, it's out of date and like, no, we trust me,

548
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:48,300
we

549
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:48,579
know

550
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,489
we have a compensating control or whatever

551
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:54,489
or worse, the press will get on to it and then they're really screwed 100%

552
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,869
going back to the security thing.

553
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,060
Like I'm also kind of because there's been those

554
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:00,790
reports now of like all those like fake interview,

555
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,810
like deep faked interview videos with, you know,

556
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,939
you asked the interview person to turn their head to

557
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,640
the side so you can see if they're real or not

558
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:08,430
or you know,

559
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:11,890
that hacker news thread where people were like being solicited to essentially

560
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,310
go take an interview as this person's name.

561
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,660
Pretend you're them, we'll pay you 500 bucks to do it, blah, blah, blah.

562
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,489
And I assume that, that's the classic, like, show up,

563
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,739
collect the paycheck because if you collect a paycheck for a month or two,

564
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,699
spending 1000 bucks to scam a company

565
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,760
and look a lot of these companies,

566
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,420
it is very difficult to fire people in many instances.

567
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,290
If the company has such bad and weak internal processes that

568
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,530
it is so susceptible to this kind of fraudulent activity,

569
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:42,420
I feel like they're kind of up the creek regardless. It's like all the,

570
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,790
you know, it's like all these places that are like, oh, you know,

571
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,619
we don't really have this or this security and it's kind of like, well, cool,

572
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,829
the ransomware guys are gonna,

573
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:51,459
so, you know, they're gonna love you because that's the

574
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:51,839
thing like

575
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,869
it used to be like 20 years ago.

576
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,229
If you had bad security, you could kind of hide and not probably be attacked.

577
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:59,250
But now with ransomware and all this automated stuff,

578
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,410
you're gonna get hit eventually.

579
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,099
But it

580
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:03,810
doesn matter.

581
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,650
Look, look, here's, here's something I've been thinking about a lot.

582
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,689
There is, this is due to a discussion I had um very recently. But

583
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,089
so

584
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,489
if you look at the world of like automotive safety, we pick out, right?

585
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,609
Or even worker safety in factories,

586
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,180
there are a lot of rules and laws and process

587
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,959
that have to be followed and if you don't,

588
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:28,609
you pay fines and people can get hurt and die, right?

589
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:29,810
Like that's what happens.

590
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:33,229
Whereas you look at security and like, let's say secure programming.

591
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:36,719
If I write an application and I sell you an application and my application

592
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:39,479
is full of security flaws and I know it's full of security flaws.

593
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,869
What happens then? Nothing,

594
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:42,510
right?

595
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,939
There's no accountability,

596
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,979
there's no action you can take against me that says you have to

597
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:49,430
fix this or you sold me something that was known to be bad.

598
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,949
And I don't think it's ever gonna change

599
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:53,660
until software literally kills like millions of people,

600
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:58,229
-- which may never happen
-- even then to get the remedy takes so long and

601
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:01,060
is so onerous and so expensive to pursue in a court of law.

602
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,640
Yeah.

603
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:06,290
Well, but here's the thing when you have a situation where you have

604
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:11,660
some overseeing regulatory body like the, you know, the OSHA or whatever,

605
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,979
then you're outsourcing the cost and saying the taxpayers pay for it, right?

606
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:16,819
And it's not some entity like a company that

607
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,670
like a company is not going to buy a piece of

608
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,979
software for a million dollars and have it feel horribly and then

609
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:25,055
sue the seller and deal with that because it's gonna cost

610
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:27,584
easily more than a million dollars to pursue that

611
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:28,035
and

612
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:28,964
time and

613
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:30,665
you're not guaranteed to win.

614
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:32,435
I mean, you know, it's, it's to the point where,

615
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:34,525
what is it IBM is banned from doing business with the

616
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:38,005
new South Wales government because they've messed up so many times.

617
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:39,545
I heard that

618
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:40,574
and, and that's,

619
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,015
it's rare enough that it makes the news and that's the thing.

620
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:47,694
It's like to get an actual remedy against these companies is so difficult.

621
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,805
Like, oh man, just eat the law and move on

622
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,880
-- and,
-- and that happens a lot and, and here's the thing too.

623
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:57,560
So let's, let's tie this back to the original topic, right? Where you have

624
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,369
employees, let's say mo purposefully defrauding the company

625
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,339
and

626
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,880
there's a couple of pieces to this, we need to tie together.

627
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,400
There's the issue of someone is committing fraud against you, right?

628
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,949
Which there may be legal action.

629
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,319
Maybe, I, I don't know, it depends on the jurisdiction.

630
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:15,699
Like you're hiring people all over the freaking planet now.

631
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,699
It's very strange and I don't know how that all works.

632
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,479
You have the issue of measuring what people do

633
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,410
because

634
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,300
if you can't really say someone is or isn't doing their job,

635
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,829
how do you take discipline

636
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,349
action against them?

637
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,140
I'm, I'm gonna say this as a hypothetical,

638
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,599
but I know somebody that worked at a place where

639
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:33,510
their job was so ill defined that under Australian contract,

640
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,410
like employment law,

641
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,569
they could not be fired because their job was so poorly defined

642
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,290
that. Right? Like, and that's what gets me is like, and, and sometimes it's,

643
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:46,260
I don't want to say it's appropriate, but it's maybe necessary because like,

644
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,930
my role at the CS A is not defined,

645
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,719
like

646
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm the it guy who set it all up and sort of still manages it,

647
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,880
but I also do the Blockchain stuff and I also do

648
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,989
the GSD stuff and I do a bunch of other stuff.

649
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,239
But the difference there is,

650
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,449
I have a high trust relationship with the CEO that goes back now.

651
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:03,130
-- 25 years.
-- Right. Right. You are

652
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:07,869
-- different.
-- Our iso 9001 auditor looked at my spreadsheet of all our,

653
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:10,469
um, suppliers and was like, wow, you have like

654
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:10,630
a

655
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:12,685
sheet of all your supplies. I'm like, oh, yeah.

656
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,234
And I'm like, and you know,

657
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:16,844
there's like 20 fields of stuff about security and everything.

658
00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:18,185
And I'm like, and here's my favorite.

659
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:20,415
I like, here's the one about, have we backed up the data or not?

660
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:23,244
Does it need to be backed up? Is it a gap? And here's the one about their criticality?

661
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:24,864
And she's like, how do you find criticality?

662
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,555
And I'm like, how much would Jim yell at me?

663
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:29,224
She's like, what I'm like, it's how much would Jim Yell? I mean, she's like, I mean,

664
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:32,045
you have to write that down and explain it somewhere. I'm like, ok,

665
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,369
but that's the thing.

666
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,969
So that is not a sustainable way to do things,

667
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:37,839
especially in larger organizations that

668
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,699
you can't have somebody like me come to IBM and try and implement that system.

669
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,760
We, we literally are going through this right now because the,

670
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,500
the NISSDF which is 800 to 18, I think.

671
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,920
But the, the secure software development framework

672
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,449
and and obviously we sell to the government.

673
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:57,569
We have to follow this as well as we have a

674
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,630
product that's going to be used by people to meet this.

675
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,390
Right.

676
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,319
And

677
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,920
anyway, I was having a discussion with someone.

678
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,260
They're like, uh, do we know what we have to do? I said I know what we have to do.

679
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,910
It's all in my head and I'm like, that's not particularly useful to you or me,

680
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,890
but like,

681
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,979
dressed assured we're in pretty good shape and I know what we need to do.

682
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:19,250
I need to write this down now and it was just like, yeah, it's one of those things,

683
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,750
-- I mean, I, I get that
-- and that's,

684
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,819
and that's something really competent people tend to forget

685
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,790
is like we need to document what we're doing.

686
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,984
And again, that's I like ticketing systems because for example, I use it as like, oh,

687
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:28,795
I did this thing,

688
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:33,005
I need to add that to the doc like, so I, I just added a checklist for a thing

689
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:36,324
for making changes to the email footer where I actually documented

690
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:39,224
how to test it to make sure the footers are working.

691
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:39,645
Because so

692
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:40,535
anyway, anyway,

693
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:42,604
-- kind of tying all this one up. The thing
-- is

694
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:45,425
and, and then, but the, the problem then is

695
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,145
that you get these kind of like process heavy systems,

696
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:48,844
but

697
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,900
either people maybe don't understand and say, oh, it's stupid.

698
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,859
Like, why do I have to do this? And this piece of paperwork.

699
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,479
It's like, no, there's a good reason for it,

700
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:58,449
but they don't understand and then they try and bypass it and things go, you know.

701
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,500
-- But,
-- but look, that is

702
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:02,810
like the history of manufacturing

703
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,300
-- is filled with examples of that, of people taking shortcuts. Oh,
-- yeah.

704
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,180
People putting a rock on the emergency stop

705
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:08,410
button.

706
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,219
-- And
-- right, and, and

707
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:14,729
I worked in a paper mill in my summers while I was at university.

708
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,530
And

709
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,829
a a frightening amount of the training we had to take was like

710
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:25,969
this is here. So you don't die, like stop doing things against our rules.

711
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:30,329
Like that gate is locked for a reason, do not unlock the gate and prop it open.

712
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,849
And that was like everything. And I think

713
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:36,989
this all ties together this way we do security.

714
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,390
The way we're measuring work from home, like everything it is,

715
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,449
the industry is very mature and something we have to do is we can't just say,

716
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:47,290
I wish this was better.

717
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:49,300
We have to actually

718
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,609
make the effort to understand what's happening to document failure.

719
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,260
That's especially important because we suck at documenting failure,

720
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:03,189
document success. And basically you need to use like science, a scientific method

721
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,680
behind all of this. And that's what it really comes down to.

722
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:08,550
If you have employees working from home and you don't know what, what they do,

723
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,829
that's not their fault

724
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,839
well, or how they do it or

725
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:15,640
-- how much of it they're supposed to be doing.
-- That's right.

726
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:20,359
This is all like, if you honestly go read about manufacturing,

727
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,459
that is my best suggestion here as to understanding like,

728
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:27,239
what is coming into a system, what is the system doing?

729
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,520
What is coming out of the system?

730
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,380
The problem becomes though is when you have people

731
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,550
like me that do work where it's like,

732
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,890
well, I have like a, you know,

733
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,229
it's like 1/6 order effect on sales where it's like

734
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:38,535
I do a thing that does a thing that does the

735
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,574
thing that influences a person that does a thing that

736
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,685
does the thing that influences another person to finally make.

737
00:30:42,694 --> 00:30:45,464
-- But
-- Kurt, you have inputs and you have outputs.

738
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:48,145
-- But
-- the problem is I can't directly correlate them

739
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:50,744
-- because
-- you haven't written them down. No, no, no.

740
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:51,795
But what I'm saying is like,

741
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,665
how do we correlate the work?

742
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:56,824
Like, for example, OK, the problem is some things can be documented,

743
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,074
like when you remove a user,

744
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:01,885
you have to actually boot them out of slack otherwise their connection stays open.

745
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:05,305
And if they don't log out of their device, they're still there receiving messages

746
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,609
even if their accounts been deleted out of Google and using single sign on.

747
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:09,819
But, but that can

748
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:10,229
be

749
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:11,699
proves my point,

750
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:13,670
but that can be documented.

751
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,729
But something like,

752
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,699
OK, you know, Dave does like social media posts.

753
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,770
Well, how does that tie into sales directly?

754
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,150
Well, then it's up to Dave and sales to figure out what the inputs are,

755
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,540
what the expectations are and how you're going to measure the output of that.

756
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,790
Like, that's what it is. We do.

757
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,560
I don't know how to do that today in many

758
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:33,780
instances because it's just we're making this crap up.

759
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,660
It's not done in a scientific way.

760
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,859
And I guarantee people had these conversations about manufacturing 100 years ago.

761
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:41,979
Part of it is you just have to accept that right there,

762
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:43,439
there are people doing jobs that where

763
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,770
there isn't really a good measurable outcome or

764
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:48,900
correlated thing. And that's OK.

765
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,540
I disagree. I disagree.

766
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,819
I think we, we're going to end this now because we're way over time. But I think

767
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,010
it is

768
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,739
the cowardly way out to say we can't measure this job.

769
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,400
I, I firmly believe everything could be measured. I'm not,

770
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:03,030
oh,

771
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,239
I don't think everything. Well, I don't think everything can be measured. I think

772
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:11,260
-- I,
-- I, we're going to, we're going to agree to disagree on this point.

773
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,270
And

774
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:16,410
I think if you can't, I mean, it's the classic, I forget who said it.

775
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,150
I'll put it in the show notes.

776
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,800
But the classic mathematician, if you can't measure something,

777
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,829
you can't understand it.

778
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,390
And I think I, I firmly believe that everything can be measured.

779
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,270
Everything.

780
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,229
How happy am I? Your happiness is two chickens. That's what I'm going to say.

781
