Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,670
Kurt Siefried and my partner and hopefully not making things worse.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,869
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,590
I mean, I try not to make things categorically worse, but I,

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,579
I make no guarantees of that fact.

5
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:18,870
Well,

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,750
and I think the other thing is we're

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,860
open to correction when somebody points out that like

8
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:25,139
you did this thing, you probably thought you, we're doing the right thing, but

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:28,340
it resulted in this other negative outcome that were you even aware of.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:28,959
And it's like,

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,720
like those one hour shows we started with for, again, we apologize.

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,979
We did well in the audio quality was bad and, and lots of things.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,279
But so for anyone who doesn't know what K

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,159
just said back in the early days of the podcast and please,

15
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,759
please don't go back and look,

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,619
we, we, our shows were like an hour long.

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,939
Why, why did we do that because we didn't know any better.

18
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,950
But so in all seriousness at that point in time,

19
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:53,380
I would say virtually all podcasts were an hour long.

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,060
That's true. I think that's why we did it.

21
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,599
It was very, very common and then someone,

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,069
someone at one point I don't even remember who it was, was.

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,419
I, I was actually at an event with them and they were like,

24
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,190
I love your podcast but it's too long.

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,339
I was like, what do you mean? He's like,

26
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:07,839
my commute to work is 40 minutes

27
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,330
and I don't want to listen to part of a podcast on the way home. And I'm like, oh,

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,209
and then it also occurred to me like,

29
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,959
30 minutes does a nicer job. I think of focusing the mind.

30
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,489
I mean, I do this with meetings at work and stuff is

31
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,069
brevity. I always schedule 30 minute meetings or less

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,230
because I feel like if you know, you have 30 minutes, well,

33
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,089
I shouldn't say that no matter how long you schedule a meeting for,

34
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,440
you will fill that time,

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,430
-- whether you should or not. It's
-- like a plate of food.

36
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,150
That's a portion. Like,

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,089
no, like it's like a bag of chips unless it's like family size.

38
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm sorry, that's not three servings of chips.

39
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,120
That's a bag of chips and I'm eating it.

40
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:45,940
You know,

41
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:47,889
like those Pepsi my favorite now is where

42
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,980
you buy something and it's like 1.5 servings

43
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:53,930
if you read the serving guide in size. And I'm like, that's some BS like, come on.

44
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,940
I remember that

45
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:55,660
for sure.

46
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:58,400
Like, I totally get something that's two servings or three servings,

47
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,769
but you can't say it's like 1.6

48
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:05,449
-- clearly just gaming it to make it come out as like 100 calories. Right.
-- Right.

49
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,179
-- Exactly. That's exactly what,
-- and actually that's exactly the topic for today.

50
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,440
I don't, I wouldn't call it gaming it

51
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,020
well, but, you know,

52
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,789
trying to squish things for,

53
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,259
I suspect largely for the sake of squishing them.

54
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,000
Not because they actually need squishing.

55
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,600
Well, I want, I want to reframe it a little differently.

56
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,580
So there is a blog post,

57
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:26,210
a link to the hacker news discussion because there's

58
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,270
some interesting comments and then there's a blog post and

59
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:31,270
the blog post is titled How I Reduced the size

60
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:34,110
of my very first published Docker image by 40%.

61
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,119
A lesson in Docker

62
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:36,009
shell scripts.

63
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:36,910
And

64
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,009
this caught my attention immediately when I read it

65
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,190
because

66
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,500
when you talk about security,

67
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:46,110
one of the topics that comes up all the

68
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,479
time is something called a tax surface reduction.

69
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,580
The idea being

70
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:55,740
the less stuff you have like be it API N points or third party dependencies or,

71
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,740
or whatever or even your container size,

72
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,985
the less stuff you have, the more secure you'll be in theory, right?

73
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:02,375
I mean, no one's gonna argue that.

74
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,154
And ironically that's part of the reason for

75
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:05,925
containerizing stuff is so that the stuff is

76
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:10,095
in a container and not like you're not running a Python script on your local machine.

77
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:10,604
Yeah.

78
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,854
Yeah. For sure. For sure. Right. Right.

79
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:14,595
Which I do all the time and I probably shouldn't but

80
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,479
whatever, it's fine

81
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,479
and, well, I mean, I, I remember too, like, on that note

82
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,080
back in the good old days when we would, like,

83
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:26,160
have systems and we were system administrators, for example,

84
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:27,460
you would do, like,

85
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,710
1000 random things you didn't even keep track of to make something run.

86
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:32,679
And so trying to, like,

87
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,169
reproduce and install another computer would be impossible.

88
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,720
How about just trying to fix it? Well, yeah, that's true. Like,

89
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,205
like my favorite was always, you know, you'd reboot the system and like,

90
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:44,244
the service wouldn't come up.

91
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:45,404
And that's one of the arguments

92
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:48,014
and that's one of the arguments I always made for people are like,

93
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:48,845
how often do you reboot?

94
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,475
And I'm like, I reboot on a forced monthly schedule

95
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,445
to make sure things work because I would make tweaks to the system,

96
00:03:55,895 --> 00:04:00,365
-- but forget to put them in the configuration file.
-- I have a funny story about that. I

97
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,824
logged into my file server in the basement. Uh, I was over the weekend

98
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,794
and because, uh, what was it? Like? There's a new,

99
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,029
oh, I, I haven't, I'm, I'm running a bunch of Debbie and 11 and Debbie and 12 is out now.

100
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,070
And so I was thinking, oh, maybe I'll upgrade some of these systems to Debbie and 12.

101
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,669
Not that, I mean, le

102
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,480
still supported. So there's nothing wrong with it.

103
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:22,299
But I looked at my file server and the up time was 287 days and I'm, like, nope,

104
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:23,528
not touching this,

105
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:25,128
that

106
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,639
we're going to let the universe schedule my downtime on this one.

107
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:29,769
Yeah,

108
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:31,938
I know. It isn't going to reboot. Right.

109
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,949
-- There's almost certainly going to be something wrong or
-- worse. It will reboot.

110
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,079
But is everything working fine?

111
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:38,908
I'm not even

112
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:39,118
gonna

113
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:39,509
find out

114
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,799
and it's not like you have a test suite to make sure. Like

115
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,904
that's one reason I actually intentionally keep my plex server very simple.

116
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:47,825
And I don't have a lot of weird stuff on it because

117
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:50,214
like my kids need to be able to watch their shows.

118
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:53,984
I upgrade my plex server like probably once a week, I bet.

119
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:58,494
Um Anyway, OK. OK. So we were talking about attack surface reduction.

120
00:04:58,505 --> 00:04:58,984
So anyway,

121
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,434
I read this article by this person who wrote a

122
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:02,964
blog post and it's a very well written post.

123
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:04,385
Like I think they did a really nice job.

124
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:07,984
They broke it down into all their attempts and they talk heavily about what they did.

125
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,825
But fundamentally at the end of the day,

126
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,399
what they end up doing is they take a container,

127
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,200
-- an alpine image which is like
-- four megabytes or something.

128
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:18,519
This person needed to install some things in the container, which is normal, right?

129
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:20,950
Like almost no one runs just a container.

130
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,320
-- You always need other stuff in your base
-- image.

131
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,279
It's like the open BS D open BS D secure by default. What does it do? You can ssh into it.

132
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,390
And then what? And that's it.

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,679
Yeah. Right. Then you start installing stuff and it falls apart anyway.

134
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:32,519
So,

135
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,799
but what they end up doing is they're like, oh,

136
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:38,049
I want to make my container as small as possible, which is a cool thing to do.

137
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:39,299
I have no issues with this.

138
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:43,500
I think it's a good skill to have, but not necessarily a good skill to use.

139
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,519
And I think that's like a lot of skills

140
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,369
-- it
-- has value to a point.

141
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,779
And let's say there's it's like the old you can

142
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,920
underflow an integer back around to from negative to positive,

143
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:55,940
for example, right?

144
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,739
This is like a security underflow is what I would kind of use this as is my

145
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,739
very

146
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,940
clever description. But anyway,

147
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,339
they instead of using like alpine, they basically end up taking one container,

148
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,649
installing everything they need

149
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:14,779
and then copying it all into a scratch image.

150
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,380
Now in the container will the scratch image is literally an empty container.

151
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,390
You can start with a scratch image and then just copy

152
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,149
stuff in it like a lot of go applications do this.

153
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,260
I used to do this with V MS all the time,

154
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:27,239
right?

155
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,299
Like I would install a VM, do all this, install, install,

156
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:33,480
install and then like RM hyphen R fa whole

157
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,640
like all the man pages, all the everything

158
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,640
and think of this as the opposite though, right?

159
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:40,920
Where you start from nothing and you only copy in the things you absolutely need.

160
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,799
And so you can end up with a functional Linux system by doing this. Right.

161
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:44,519
No surprise.

162
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,410
Now,

163
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,149
-- here's
-- the,

164
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,380
it's

165
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,809
shocking how little you need to get a log and pro

166
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,140
is

167
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,760
-- amazing, in fact.
-- But the thing is we used to run computers off of like,

168
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,630
like single

169
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,950
-- digit megabyte storage devices.
-- A floppy disk. Exactly.

170
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,079
So, and, you know, that's the other thing to keep in mind,

171
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,390
right is you actually don't need a lot of stuff to stand

172
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,455
-- a computer up and get it on the internet to
-- run.

173
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:07,506
We

174
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,115
run in here. I'm making air codes

175
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:14,976
-- minimum to run TCP/IP stack and an SSH N A shell,
-- you don't even need SSH. But

176
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:16,865
-- anyway,
-- you do, if you want to remotely connect to it, no,

177
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,385
don't remote into your containers, don't

178
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,566
SSH in your containers,

179
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:19,996
you

180
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:22,756
whatever, whatever, stop it.

181
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:23,455
Ok.

182
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:27,575
And here's the thing that like really tripped me when I read this

183
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:28,981
is at the very end,

184
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:30,562
the person mentions

185
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:36,212
I ran Docker Scout on the image and it found like no vulnerabilities and I was like,

186
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:37,611
of course, it didn't.

187
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,622
You removed everything Docker Scout looks for.

188
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,062
And so this,

189
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:45,171
this especially amused me because Docker Scout uses

190
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,391
sift underneath sift is the S bomb scanner.

191
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:48,152
The company I work for Encor

192
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:49,022
created.

193
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,239
And so here's where I, I like this,

194
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,649
like instantly lit up my mind when I read this whole article and I got to the end,

195
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
I'm like, holy cow.

196
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,100
This is like you went too far and you're less secure now.

197
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:02,850
And so let me explain why this is. So

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,980
we exist in a universe now where an enormous amount

199
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:10,220
of our security is derived from having the ability to update

200
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,170
and having the ability to kind of inspect the

201
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,859
system and get an understanding for what's going on.

202
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:18,920
Now, when the vast majority of tools like SBO

203
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,350
tools, for example, inspect a system,

204
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:27,040
they look at things like the alpine database or the R PM database or the Python.

205
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:27,489
What it,

206
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,029
what is it the

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,459
Oh the pie project dot Tomel

208
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:31,649
is the new one, right? For like

209
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,020
understanding. Well, it's the the dot lock file but whatever, right?

210
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,340
-- Understanding what's installed.
-- Well, essentially,

211
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,419
I think I can simplify it even better

212
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,650
if you actually look at every single binary and every

213
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,549
single finer file and have a hash and identify it.

214
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,419
Yes, that's how we used to do things.

215
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:50,299
There's too many files and things now we can't do it that way.

216
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,460
And now like Sift will look for certain binaries in certain places.

217
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,469
Like for example, Busy Box is a good one, right?

218
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,539
Like lots of containers have just Busy Box in them

219
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:02,169
and there's no like

220
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,140
distro database or anything else to look at.

221
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,909
So Busy Box is one of those examples where

222
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,880
Sift will like inspect the binary and look for known

223
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:13,200
strings in the binary to be like, yes,

224
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,400
this is Busy Box and I can identify this version of Busy Box, right?

225
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:17,609
Makes sense. That's obvious.

226
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,299
But it doesn't do this for everything because you have kind of two problems.

227
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,020
-- The one you said where there's just too many binaries
-- and

228
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,440
too many people building them from scratch and getting weird.

229
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,210
-- Like, it would
-- also take a bazillion years to actually parse all this data.

230
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,619
-- Like that's the other half of
-- like how many

231
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,570
Linux distributions are there now that are widely used.

232
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,039
-- I think it's over 100 it's
-- a lot, a lot,

233
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,159
-- a
-- lot, right?

234
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,270
I mean, it's really just three but

235
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,719
like they're all based on each other.

236
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,900
But anyway, you get the point.

237
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,460
And so this the the reason this like lit me up

238
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,950
is because it's like, ok, yes,

239
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,640
Doctor Scout is reporting nothing because Doctor Scout can find

240
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,549
nothing because you've taken out everything Doctor Scout looks for.

241
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,969
And so now by your the the journey to the smallest container possible

242
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,440
is going to result in worse security because Doctor

243
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,190
Scout is always going to report zero vulnerabilities.

244
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:09,349
I mean, granted this thing is doing very little so it not like it's going to have a ton,

245
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,390
but you get the idea, right?

246
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,770
Like

247
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:16,419
you can no longer use modern tools to like inspect and maintain this container.

248
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:19,549
Well, this is exactly like back in the olden days where, you know,

249
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,659
Apache would say hi, I'm Apache version 1.1 0.2 or send mail, you know,

250
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,900
you could request hello version and it would say I'm send mail 3.6 0.9 or whatever.

251
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,469
And then you disable that because people are like, oh,

252
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,450
it's leaking information and Attackers will use that.

253
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,580
And I always argued that like,

254
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,549
well, or they just try all the attacks and see which one works.

255
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:42,640
They don't care what version it is. But the point is removing the version string

256
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,440
again,

257
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,710
made you less secure over time.

258
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,000
Because legitimate tools like n map and stuff

259
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,219
that could use a fingerprinting and say,

260
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:54,059
hey, look, you're running this old version of Apache, you should update it

261
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,239
don't work anymore.

262
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,442
So I remember this was always funny because this

263
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,603
would come up when I worked at elastic is

264
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:01,093
elastic search

265
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:04,083
was notorious for reporting it like literally in the,

266
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,372
in the string like the hello string or whatever

267
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:08,052
it

268
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:11,372
is. And that's exactly what it was for. And Cabana would do the same thing, right?

269
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:14,052
Where the Cabana server would be like, I'm Cabana, this version

270
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,653
and all of these like p tester types would freak out

271
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,906
like, oh my goodness, what are we doing? And it's like

272
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:24,666
if you can't figure out the version from like all the other features and,

273
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:28,625
and libraries included, you can just look at like you're an idiot.

274
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,666
This version string is meaningless

275
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:34,906
but more to the point Attackers don't care. They just try all the attacks.

276
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,065
And the first thing they putting is stand up a Webster put it online.

277
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,549
Oh, yeah. And you will still see front page exploits hitting it. And I'm like,

278
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:44,500
-- that's been gone for 20 years, hasn't it? Well, I
-- guess

279
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,849
now here's, but here's, here's where I want to bring this conversation.

280
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:48,669
Like, all the way

281
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,549
is

282
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:52,690
I feel like there's this, like, cargo,

283
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,700
cult security that has been pervasive for a long time Now

284
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,450
that focuses on this like minim

285
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:03,966
attitude but almost to the point of making certain things worse.

286
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:07,736
Like one of my favorite examples right now is the obsession with zero CV ES

287
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:10,695
where you keep people would be like, oh, I just scanned your container.

288
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:15,276
It is 10 CV ES in, in the red hat base image. And I'm like, who cares?

289
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:16,575
Red Hat said they're not fixing it.

290
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:20,015
What's fascinating to me is also that shows a lack of maturity.

291
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,012
-- Oh, yeah. Yeah,
-- in the security process.

292
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:22,671
But no, no, no,

293
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:24,971
a very subtle lack of maturity that I think a lot of people

294
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:29,421
don't think about which is binary thinking versus actual risk is a scale,

295
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:30,331
right?

296
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:33,331
Because they go, we have to have, we have to have zero CV S not,

297
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:36,041
we have to have an acceptable risk of CV S

298
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,341
and that's a subtle but very important distinction

299
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:42,052
because if your organization has that binary thinking,

300
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:43,770
eventually a

301
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,750
it's going to be more expensive in the long term than having subtle thinking

302
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,010
-- and it's going to break at some point, it
-- will break,

303
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,669
-- it'll break 100%
-- because log for J doesn't care, log for J is everywhere.

304
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,150
The better example always is

305
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,109
the cobra effect, right? Which is the

306
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:05,989
like the legendary story where what it, what it was the the British in India

307
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,890
decided they were going to pay people to bring them dead cobras.

308
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:12,473
And in theory, this sounds like a good idea right?

309
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:16,913
Where we have too many cobras, let's pay people to kill them and bring them to us.

310
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:20,862
Except the Indians being like the brilliant business people, they are,

311
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:22,543
they started breeding cobras.

312
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,312
And so now the problem was infinitely worse.

313
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:28,163
And then when the British were like, holy crap, they're breeding cobras.

314
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:28,763
This is nuts.

315
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,393
They were like, well, we're done here, like open the doors, let them out.

316
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:36,513
We're, we're ok. And then the problem was like 10 times worse when they were done.

317
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,645
But I think this is what make security such a mind

318
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:42,346
boggling pain in the butt is there are so many

319
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:45,395
things that feel like this is a good idea,

320
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:47,635
like complex passwords fall in this bucket.

321
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:51,835
But when you actually sit down and you like, put all the pieces together and,

322
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:55,236
and you look at it like correctly, which is very hard to do.

323
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,995
But you end up in these situations where it's

324
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:59,835
like holy cow doing this actually made it worse.

325
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:01,676
It didn't make it better at all.

326
00:14:01,796 --> 00:14:05,315
Well, and I think there again is a subtle thing is a lot of security

327
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:09,919
strategies and controls are effective up to a point and

328
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,208
then there's diminishing returns and to the point where it

329
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:13,968
can make things actually

330
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:14,609
us

331
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:19,068
worse for users so that they like drive around the fence. And the second thing is

332
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:21,638
security is always context dependent.

333
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:26,979
Like I just read about those attacks where you can like with physical access,

334
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:30,398
uh you and a Raspberry pi and a bunch of other shenanigans.

335
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:32,989
You can basically bypass windows, bit locker and

336
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:36,122
oh, you can extract the key. Yes, that was a very clever attack.

337
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:38,182
And my, my take on that is like, yes,

338
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:39,841
there are some people that have to worry about that.

339
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,781
I'm not one of them and people are like, what do you mean? I'm like

340
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:45,341
because they will just take me and my laptop and they will say Kurt,

341
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,202
I'm going to give you a nice choice here.

342
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,132
You can either unlock your laptop and tell us your

343
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:51,481
bit locker key or we can burn your house down.

344
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:55,971
-- Uh
-- It's the old XK CD comic, right? Like take this Wrench and hit them until they

345
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:59,202
-- tell you the password
-- and I will happily give them the bit lock.

346
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:00,854
Well, not happily, I will give them the bit lock key

347
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:02,424
rather than have my house burned down.

348
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,924
-- Well,
-- you don't know the bit locker key,

349
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:06,125
-- you know the password that unlocks the bit
-- locker key.

350
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,094
Well, actually I know where the bit locker key is printed out.

351
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:08,575
That's,

352
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:09,424
I have one

353
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,125
of those too

354
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:11,135
because I do

355
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:14,255
my computer. So, like, it craps. It's like Bit Locker

356
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:16,575
and it's like,

357
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:19,924
oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true too. Yeah, changing your hardware.

358
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:22,554
I ran into that when I upgraded video cards. And I was like, oh,

359
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:25,885
-- thank goodness, I have this printed out. Well,
-- it might be a different computer.

360
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:26,664
We don't know.

361
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:28,265
So

362
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,020
that's the thing though is there's like, so many things.

363
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,659
Oh, my perfect Canadian thing is those, you know, in Canada and, well,

364
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,140
you're in America in a cold part.

365
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,219
So you, if it's going to snow,

366
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,299
you typically raise your windshield wipers so that they don't get frozen

367
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,340
to the window and then when you scrape the ice off,

368
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:45,590
you damage your wiper blades.

369
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:49,385
And my favorite thing is people posting pictures of cars in,

370
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:52,205
like indoor heated arcades with their wipers up.

371
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,414
Yep. Yep. Right.

372
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:55,784
And I mean, maybe one could argue that it's like short, it's like,

373
00:15:55,794 --> 00:15:57,755
just do it every time you park your car in winter.

374
00:15:57,765 --> 00:15:58,614
So it's a habit

375
00:15:58,934 --> 00:15:59,994
and that's a good argument.

376
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:02,375
And there's not a lot of downside to it because, you know,

377
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:04,765
you sit in the car and you'll be like, oh, my windshield wipers up, get out,

378
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:06,335
put them down, go on your day.

379
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,090
But there is a lot of security where people are, like,

380
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:11,450
like the password rotation thing where n said it was a good idea

381
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:12,010
and it

382
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:16,460
kind of sort of maybe was back in the day a little bit, but not really.

383
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,929
And then it turns out to have been a really bad idea with, you know,

384
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,130
it turns out Attackers don't guess, passwords, they just go credential stuffing.

385
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,969
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Yeah.

386
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:28,369
Now, here's, I think the piece of that that becomes more difficult.

387
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,650
There are a lot of things we all do just because someone

388
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,609
said we should do it and we don't necessarily understand the why

389
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,833
-- this is, I mean security
-- or the how the mechanism.

390
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:40,343
Well, it's all part of the same, same thing, right?

391
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:43,583
And I think this is where security is extra weird

392
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:47,862
because we don't have a lot of like good resources where people

393
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:51,062
can go and understand why we might do a certain thing.

394
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:53,002
It's really hard to find this information.

395
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:58,643
Like a good example is so I want to use a small container base image, right? I agree.

396
00:16:58,653 --> 00:16:59,973
There's, it's a good idea.

397
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:03,502
You don't want a container image that's like gigabytes in size and it's completely

398
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:06,796
chocked full of crap, right? Small images. Good idea.

399
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:07,484
But

400
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:13,135
why like what does that actually accomplish and what are the actual advantages

401
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:18,175
other than these people like running around screaming zero CD ES which is nuts.

402
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:21,435
And now at the same time, like here's one of my favorite examples.

403
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:25,685
So at work, we use red hats base images for a bunch of stuff.

404
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,714
Red hats ba images are really big

405
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:30,076
and this has been like a perpetual problem Red Hat

406
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:32,076
has had is how do we shrink our base images?

407
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,040
-- And we'll say they've struggled to solve this problem.
-- Stupid question.

408
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,890
But why bother

409
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:38,569
because like, no offense.

410
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,170
But the kind of stuff people install on Red Hat tends to be chunky software.

411
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,410
It often is and, and the stuff we're using is pretty chunky too. So,

412
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,819
and again, this is part of that situation.

413
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:49,170
Like I'm going to say this, I'm gonna make this bet.

414
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,040
The average person using a Red hat container is not

415
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,290
at all like the average person using an alpine container.

416
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,810
Yes, I agree with that. But here's, here's,

417
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,979
that's the thing I always talk about is every now and then it works.

418
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:02,339
Someone's like, oh, we should switch to alpine and I'm like, I'm not going to say no,

419
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,819
but we have to understand that that comes with the large engineering burden.

420
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,050
And more importantly,

421
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,660
here's the thing people whine and complain about the findings in a redhead image.

422
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:12,660
But at the same time,

423
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,300
Red Hat has more security people and a lot of companies have people.

424
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:21,260
This is true. So there is, there is something in that where every time

425
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:23,780
there is a security, I mean, Kurt and I were part of this, we,

426
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,989
we have intimate knowledge of this process,

427
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,489
but every time there's a security vulnerability,

428
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:28,780
a

429
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:32,589
bunch of people are literally investigating it to

430
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,630
understand exactly how it affects red hats,

431
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,630
containers and operating systems and products.

432
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,420
Well, I mean,

433
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,109
this is why I feel comfortable using a lot of large cloud

434
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,250
providers for very complicated stuff that I just 100% all sorts of

435
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:46,979
source the risk to them

436
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,180
because yeah, they have a bigger security team than my organization

437
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,339
has people for sure, for sure.

438
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:54,800
And like, I don't want to, I don't have time to deal with this.

439
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,640
But now at the

440
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:56,060
same time

441
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,119
there's, there's this other side to that coin,

442
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:00,920
there are cloud,

443
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:01,900
there are companies.

444
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,079
Well, I won't say cloud companies,

445
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:10,300
I'll say there are companies that will say you are exporting your risk to

446
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,619
that don't have a security team at all.

447
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,680
0 100%. I've, I've dealt with them.

448
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:17,819
I've looked at them

449
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,849
and, you know, since we do things like I'm,

450
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,050
I was actually just looking at one vendor we use um I'll name them prompt.

451
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:26,099
Perfect. They optimize your A I prompt and feed it into the A I.

452
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:30,349
No privacy policy. No GDPR. No,

453
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:30,930
nothing.

454
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,469
-- Yeah,
-- it's probably like three dudes in a garage. I bet.

455
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,150
-- Like maybe two,
-- maybe two,

456
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,199
one

457
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:36,650
is

458
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,390
like,

459
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,030
so we'll just use it in a way that is air, quote safe, you know,

460
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:44,969
um to optimize prompts and then we, you know,

461
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:47,839
if it's sort of something you're doing at scale or with pi I, you know,

462
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:50,680
I'll probably because we're working on our A I policy,

463
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,839
the CS A and it's funny because it's going to be, I think,

464
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,079
a bit more complicated than usual because I've actually been

465
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:56,900
using this stuff and doing this stuff and there's,

466
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,969
there's a lot of subtlety and a lot of complicated stuff.

467
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:03,500
Like, does this thing record your data for training sets? Yes or no.

468
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,910
Um, or can it be configured or, you know, like

469
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,489
how does it cash stuff, blah, blah, blah, all sorts of complicated things.

470
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,069
And especially when you start layering them,

471
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,650
like if I have a Zapper that uses a proper, that uses an open A I Yeah.

472
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,069
-- Now I have three moving parts interacting with us.
-- That's

473
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:18,339
right.

474
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:18,900
That's right.

475
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:24,010
But the, but again, this is where security becomes this like weird behemoth

476
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,410
and, and I I compare it to

477
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,449
like it, it's the hydro, right? You cut off one head and two new heads grow.

478
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:33,959
And what I mean by that is it's quite common in the security

479
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:37,410
universe where you have like one obvious problem you're trying to address,

480
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,130
let's say large, like too much crap in my container base image. OK?

481
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,770
So we're gonna use a small image.

482
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,089
But now I have two new problems because now I've got like an image that

483
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,072
the typical security tools don't know what to do with

484
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:49,881
and

485
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:51,381
it's maintained by a very,

486
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:54,362
very small group of people that can't actually properly maintain it.

487
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,362
But then the third problem is I have no idea they can't

488
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:59,241
maintain it because I don't even know what to look for.

489
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,641
And so this is where it gets nuts.

490
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:02,911
Well, and this is so like,

491
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:06,202
and this is some of the back of the envelope sort of calculations I do is I'll look,

492
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:06,842
I'll look at a github

493
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,781
repo and be like, when was the last commit?

494
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,151
How many kind of old stale issues are there to just get a feel for

495
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:12,602
it?

496
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:15,703
And I and I wish there were tools that kind of collected

497
00:21:15,713 --> 00:21:19,024
all these metrics and globed them all together into a usable actual.

498
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:20,823
Like here's the outcome.

499
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,634
So here's the inputs which ones matter and don't because I actually,

500
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,874
there's a lot of software I use that is old and stale and

501
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:30,593
that's OK because it's old and stale, like it's just, it's complete.

502
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:32,114
-- So
-- here's one of my favorites, right?

503
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:37,073
Is it's becoming hip these days in the security tooling universe to try to

504
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:41,465
assign some sort of like goodness score to the open source you're using.

505
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:44,725
There's things like, I mean, we did a whole episode, an open SSF scorecard,

506
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:46,026
I'll dig it up and put it in the show notes,

507
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:49,826
but like needless to say we weren't super kind to it because fundamentally the the

508
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:53,566
point of the episode is basically like this seems clever but does it like does,

509
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:55,345
does any of this data matter?

510
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,615
And the answer is we don't know,

511
00:21:56,926 --> 00:22:02,426
we have no idea if a high score from the open SSF scorecard means more secure.

512
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:06,066
We have absolutely no idea. High score could mean less secure. We don't know now,

513
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,680
but here's the fun of it. Right.

514
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,180
So there's all these people trying to assign

515
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,989
like these goodness scores and things like that.

516
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:16,670
And at the end of the day, let's say you run the score tool against your project

517
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,599
and you see one of your dependencies scored to zero.

518
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,890
What are you going to do? The answer is nothing.

519
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:23,500
Yeah.

520
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,640
Well, and that's, and then that leads the second thing is,

521
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,739
is any of this actually actionable

522
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,290
and you know, replacing a two or three deep dependency is so much work that no,

523
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,430
you literally can't,

524
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,650
let's say if it's a first cause and this is part of the difficulty, right?

525
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,699
Where you have transitive dependencies being

526
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,939
I installed dependency, A dependency, A installed dependency B,

527
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,829
dependency B installed dependency C

528
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,729
let's say I have a scanning tool that says, hey,

529
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:49,739
dependency C has a score of negative 12 out of a

530
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,250
total score of a possible score of 0 to 10.

531
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,579
So it's obviously terrible. You should replace it,

532
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,219
but I can't replace dependency A

533
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:59,579
I I, how do, what do I do? Right?

534
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,959
-- The answer is you're going to do nothing
-- unless you're Google

535
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:04,459
size and you essentially fork it and bring it in house,

536
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:05,020
right?

537
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:06,420
No, that's, that's literally,

538
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:09,699
and there's like seven companies that can do that.

539
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:13,770
It's pretty tough for sure. And sorry. Speaking of, sorry, back to the Red Hat days.

540
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,579
The red hat box is still broken if you search for my email address

541
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,479
because it returns too many,

542
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:21,719
too many bugs.

543
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,469
The list of search results is too long for Bugzilla to display the next pre first,

544
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,199
last buttons on.

545
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:27,869
Oh, it's actually returning a web page now.

546
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,400
It's been running for a minute or 20,

547
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:33,449
it's only 2500 entries. That's not as many as I thought.

548
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:36,420
-- But then
-- we got to kind of start thinking about wrapping this one up a little bit.

549
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:37,839
Well, I think part of it is

550
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,969
because I do this a lot of the CS A where people are like, hey,

551
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,719
we should do security X and I'm like,

552
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:46,829
probably, maybe we should let me think about that for a minute and come back to you.

553
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:48,959
And then sort of my first thought is always, is like,

554
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:53,319
will this sort of immediately actually make things better and work followed by?

555
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:54,619
Ok. But like, what if we

556
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,069
do, like, can we do too much of this? Can it become a problem?

557
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,030
Yes,

558
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:03,510
and followed by like, or is there maybe a better or simpler control?

559
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,810
And so like an example I always go back to is, you know,

560
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:10,430
the CS A had to take payments for things like the CCS K exam

561
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,819
and right off the bat. I'm like, yeah, we're using like paypal IP N instant payment

562
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,119
notification. So like

563
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:21,229
you go to our website, you click pay, you get booted over to paypal, you deal with them

564
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,567
and then paypal tells us if you paid the amount or not.

565
00:24:24,348 --> 00:24:24,947
And I'm like,

566
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:27,718
because I, I just don't want their data, I don't want to deal with this.

567
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:29,297
That was how,

568
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,848
that was the correct way to secure our payment infrastructure was to

569
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:34,407
it to paypal.

570
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,287
And then you, you, if you did it yourself,

571
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:40,317
you have to be PC I compliant and there's like tons of stuff you have to do and it's,

572
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:43,187
you don't have to be PC I compliant to run a payment system.

573
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:44,858
No, I mean they check, they,

574
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:48,378
-- they do check on that like you have to put up a good show if you're
-- not

575
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,326
every major credit card breach happened at the PC I compliant vendor.

576
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:54,225
-- Look
-- PC I compliance

577
00:24:54,336 --> 00:24:58,965
-- is II I say this about sock two as well.
-- This is the best cargo cult example.

578
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:03,296
No, it's not a cargo cult. This is the I wash my hands after I use the toilet.

579
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:07,956
Like it is a very baseline minimum. It doesn't guarantee any security. It just,

580
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:13,495
it, it makes it. So you verify like the company accepting credit cards

581
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:14,926
will say like

582
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:15,755
they, they have,

583
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:18,394
they have a door on the house, right?

584
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:21,953
It could still be full of crackheads or something, but at least there is a door

585
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:26,343
and so it's, it's not necessarily saying you are secure.

586
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:31,014
It's just saying you meet this very low bar which a lot of places can't.

587
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:35,953
I mean, I'm just looking at this, the top five PC I compliance breaches. This one was

588
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,104
big.

589
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,244
This 40 million, 15 million.

590
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:40,534
Look,

591
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:42,673
I'm not gonna say it's perfect and I'm not gonna

592
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:46,161
say it's necessarily some like great solution to any problem.

593
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:48,881
Well, I always wonder like if we did not have PC I would,

594
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,802
things actually be measurably worse

595
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:56,291
for sure. Kurt, I remember back in the early two thousands,

596
00:25:56,432 --> 00:26:00,541
I worked for this ISP and they had a customer that was basically like, they,

597
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:02,702
they wanted to accept payments for

598
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:05,921
buying some. It was like figurines or something.

599
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:09,531
And this is like back in the early days of like internet shopping, right?

600
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,160
You built them a web form that you typed in all your information.

601
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,969
You like, pick the thing you wanted from the drop down

602
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,329
and we just store the credit card information in a SQL database. Like no encryption.

603
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:21,079
No nothing.

604
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:22,760
If someone broke into that database,

605
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,430
they would have had hundreds of credit card

606
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,449
numbers they could have just gone wild with.

607
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:31,209
And I guarantee without PC I compliance that would be rampant everywhere

608
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:34,280
and the problems would be magnitudes worse than they are today.

609
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,969
So you would think about how bad it is now

610
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,637
and how I bet it could be.

611
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:38,067
Well,

612
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:39,998
it absolutely was because like I dealt with an ISP

613
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:42,017
where they had a guy with three credit card terminals,

614
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:45,037
physically punching numbers into them, spitting out a little receipt.

615
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:45,718
And I'm like,

616
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,167
-- he's like, this is how we do our credit cards. And I'm like,
-- in

617
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:48,828
fact,

618
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:50,838
the ISP I worked for, we did the same thing.

619
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:53,728
We kept credit card numbers in a spreadsheet when people sent them to us.

620
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,358
And then the, the person at the front desk that was,

621
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:58,947
that was their job on the last day of the month was to

622
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:01,407
go to the credit card machine and type in all the numbers.

623
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:01,748
Yes,

624
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:03,358
I'm familiar with this.

625
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,329
So I, I guess what we're saying is things could be worse.

626
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:07,160
I mean, everything

627
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:12,069
-- slowly get better ish.
-- I mean, look, I think if you, ok,

628
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,969
here's how I'm going to end this because I feel like

629
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:16,209
as humans,

630
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,930
it's very easy to have doom and gloom

631
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:20,130
about everything and especially as security people,

632
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,869
it's easy to have doom and gloom about everything.

633
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,920
Where if you, in fact, I,

634
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:26,469
I got an argument about this with someone just the other day where they

635
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,540
were talking about how like everything is broken and nothing can ever be fixed.

636
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,380
And I'm like, do you bank online?

637
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,670
-- I was actually gonna go with like, have you experienced humanity?
-- But

638
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,369
here's

639
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:36,619
the

640
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:36,829
thing,

641
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:44,109
traffic, if you look at like every measurable data point of society in humans,

642
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,500
they're all fundamentally going up into the right

643
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,310
and it's easy to get hung up on the bad and the dumb and the terrible,

644
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,939
especially if you're a security nerd, which goodness knows we are.

645
00:27:55,949 --> 00:27:57,430
But at the end of the day,

646
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,640
things are better than they were a decade ago.

647
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,800
And I'm mostly confident

648
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,599
we'll see after the next election.

649
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,560
But I'm mostly confident

650
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,160
that 10 years from now it will be even better.

651
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,260
And like, yes, there are difficulties and there are challenges

652
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,920
but

653
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:21,079
this is just, this is how it works being like a squishy bag of meat that smells funny.

654
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:23,459
Like this is, this is humans, you know.

655
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:27,089
Well, just, you know, as bad as traffic is, it's, it works,

656
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,369
it does work. It does. I know

657
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,060
-- most
-- of the

658
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:31,989
world, I know

659
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:33,930
most of the world.

660
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,060
I,

661
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,130
I don't.

662
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:36,949
That's it. That's all I have to say.

663
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,619
Mhm. I'll let, I'll let you close this one out.

664
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,969
-- Then I
-- just, I, I keep coming back to when I'm doing things.

665
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:45,729
I, I try to sometimes look at like, why am I doing this?

666
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:48,819
What do I actually want it to accomplish? And does it do that?

667
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,119
That's a good point because I've also noticed a lot of people,

668
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:54,979
I'll, I'll notice a behavior security wise.

669
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:58,339
And I'm like, like, what are you trying to do? Like accomplish

670
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,869
and they're like

671
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:00,989
security.

672
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,260
I'm like, no, you gotta be more specific and, and you know,

673
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,780
and sometimes it is in line with what they

674
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,689
actually want to accomplish and other times I'm like,

675
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,170
how about we do this completely other thing, like,

676
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,579
just outsource this and they're like,

677
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:12,550
oh, yeah.

678
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,579
Yeah, that would fair.

679
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:18,270
That's fair. I would argue with that. I do think, like, security is not an end state.

680
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,619
No, it's like, it's like being healthy.

681
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,640
-- Yeah,
-- we forget that sometimes. Like, the

682
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,660
security, like, we're not the most important group in the company

683
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,619
and, like, security isn't a solution.

684
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:29,939
It

685
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,780
is just part of the journey.

686
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:35,099
Well, my favorite thing is like, uh a good example is nuclear weapon security.

687
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:38,479
Something the US takes very seriously and has for a long time, like for example,

688
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:40,180
permissive action links, which,

689
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,780
you know, we're gonna put codes on all the nukes so that

690
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:44,405
somebody can't go rogue with them. But can't,

691
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:45,214
we do want

692
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:47,724
people to be able to use them. So we'll set them all to zero.

693
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:48,385
So the P

694
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:53,204
code was 00000 for the longest time now. They actually have real numbers. But,

695
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:57,025
uh, like a great thing is look at like a convoy of, uh,

696
00:29:57,035 --> 00:30:01,125
of them moving up a missile on American highways and it is bonkers,

697
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:05,204
like there's helicopters, there's multiple vehicles and everything

698
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:06,244
and

699
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,180
like

700
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:10,219
this is, it's not like the,

701
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:13,260
like the US spends tens of billions of dollars a year on this.

702
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:15,890
Yeah, that's just how this works.

703
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,260
Like you want security, you gotta,

704
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,640
you gotta keep exercising and eating your vegetables

705
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,520
and security is the same way.

706
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,900
And also you can't just keep doing the same thing

707
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,140
either because the Attackers evolve and the systems evolve.

708
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,430
Like

709
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,930
two years ago, we didn't have to worry about A I security.

710
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:32,780
No, like, seriously, like two years ago, prompt injection wasn't even,

711
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,219
hadn't been coined as a term.

712
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:37,459
-- It was coined like, what, 18 months ago,
-- prompt injection is the best.

713
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:39,704
I love it anyway. All right, I'm cutting you off

714
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,824
it. We'll talk about prompt injection some other day because it's a marvelous,

715
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:45,494
ignore all previous instructions and do what I say.

716
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,944
No, I'm ending the podcast. That's what I'm doing. Thank you, Kurt.
