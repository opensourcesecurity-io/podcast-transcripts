Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,550
episode, the 41st Prime with myself,

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,159
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,579
So,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,040
-- gonna make me redo this intro.
-- No, I'm not.

5
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:20,750
So, it's episode 179 which anyone listening to,

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,629
I put the episode number in the title which I, I'm like, constantly every time I do it,

7
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:25,540
I think I need to stop.

8
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:25,870
But

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,829
anyway,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,309
so 179 is the 41st prime number.

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,599
That seems, I feel like it should be farther along,

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,509
I guess 100 and 79 and there's only 40 prime numbers before that.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,110
And I'm sure that counts the fake primes, which is what, 12 and three.

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:43,950
Well, think about it,

15
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:47,349
like you can immediately eliminate half the numbers because they're even.

16
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,590
That's true.

17
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:52,340
And then you can eliminate one more sixth of the numbers every third number.

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,790
Right? And there's a bit of overlap with the, the evens.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,819
Ok.

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,509
Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,590
And the thing is like in the 1st 100 prime numbers,

22
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:03,659
there's actually not that many prime numbers, like looking at this.

23
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:05,089
It goes, you know, well,

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,830
like here starting sort of towards the middle 31 37 41 43 47 53 5961.

25
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:14,690
So, like there's about two or maybe three prime numbers out of every 10,

26
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:15,819
that's not a lot.

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,970
-- Uh,
-- no, no, no, I, I agree.

28
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,900
And it's, uh, this is what,

29
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,080
this is a special prime too because it's a Sophie Germain prime.

30
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:25,709
And I believe the number,

31
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,660
the Sophie domain prime that gets us here is also

32
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,300
it, it, it's,

33
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:32,449
I forget what they call that where a Sophie

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,339
domain prime gets you to the prime you're on.

35
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,209
And then this one is also a Sophie domain prime,

36
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,569
which means if you take two times the number plus one.

37
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,040
So two times, what is it like 49 I think

38
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:48,000
89. So 89 times two plus one is 179 and 179 times two plus one is a number. That's also,

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,209
yeah.

40
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,000
There you go. I like

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,769
my kids laugh at me. I cannot do math in my head.

42
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,970
Like at all, you can give me a very simple math problem.

43
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,050
And basically, once you exit like the single digits, I'm lost.

44
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,010
It's embarrassing anyway,

45
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,889
right?

46
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:03,190
So, you know, it's not prime though, Kurt

47
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,930
9090 days isn't prime. That's right.

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,059
So

49
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,460
I will let you explain to our dear listeners what the

50
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,779
number 90 means and why we're going to talk about it.

51
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:14,880
So,

52
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:18,419
uh Google Project Zero has been doing a lot of good work

53
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:23,610
finding really bad security flaws and getting people to fix them.

54
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:24,910
Yeah, definitely.

55
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,830
And back in the beginning of this, I mean, and this goes back, I was going to say,

56
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,580
back in the olden days,

57
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:32,339
but I realize now the olden days according to this are like 2015

58
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,029
and I have, like,

59
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,630
I'm literally probably wearing a pair of jeans that I bought that year.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,789
Um,

61
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:39,789
I definitely have shoes older than that.

62
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:40,770
So

63
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,820
basically when they started project zero,

64
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,149
they didn't really give or force any deadlines.

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,529
And so like in true classic fashion,

66
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,020
they

67
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,220
had,

68
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:50,210
they had 90 days.

69
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:51,210
No,

70
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,610
no, no, no,

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,240
no. Originally it was just kind of a best effort thing. Right.

72
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,490
-- Right.
-- And so some of these vendors would take, you know,

73
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,619
six months

74
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:02,389
or, well, you remember back in the bad old days, right?

75
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,289
People would disclose vulnerability with a

76
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,130
timeline that indicated that the vendor had

77
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,869
it for like two or three or sometimes four or five years.

78
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,229
-- Yeah. Oh, I remember years. It was embarrassing and bad stuff
-- too.

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,820
Not like, like, oh, there's a cross site scripting vulnerability.

80
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,229
No, like, like you type in the letter seven

81
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,550
and it gives you root access,

82
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:19,380
right?

83
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,820
And these were the days also that like if you,

84
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,300
if the vendor said we need two years to fix this and you said

85
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,259
no way

86
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:27,679
they'd say, well, we're going to sue you if you say anything.

87
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,960
So you better not talk like, well, crap.

88
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,899
I don't think that ever actually happened, did it,

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,279
or at least not successfully. Although it

90
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:35,520
doesn't have

91
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,259
to

92
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:36,880
mess up your life.

93
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:37,490
Right.

94
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,610
I don't feel like I remember anything substantial but there could,

95
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:44,850
it wouldn't shock me if there were private matters as well because

96
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,270
obviously not everything that happens in a court of law becomes public.

97
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,889
There's ways to keep things secret. So I would,

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,699
I, I,

99
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,970
without question, there was intimidation.

100
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,850
Did anyone go to jail for it?

101
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,869
I don't think so, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't bet a coke on it either.

102
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,039
-- So
-- then Google came up with 90 days and we

103
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,089
-- go public with it and
-- everyone lost their mind.

104
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,610
It was literally the end.

105
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:11,610
It was just like when, you know, Dan Farmer came out with Satan, you know,

106
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,889
security analysis tool for networks,

107
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:16,363
which it's now like a required thing to do by

108
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,084
almost every security standard from

109
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:19,815
every government professional organization.

110
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:24,315
But back when Dan Farmer came up with Satan, I mean, I remember like, like son kind of

111
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,885
held on to him for a few days and then like, booted him out.

112
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:31,045
He, he basically was, he, he had literally caused the end of the world as we knew it,

113
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:31,750
you know,

114
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,480
turns out not really.

115
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:33,929
Yeah,

116
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,679
but

117
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:36,660
those were different days.

118
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,399
So, yeah.

119
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,609
So one thing Google Project Zero did basically when you release their patch,

120
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,519
they would release the information right away.

121
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,329
You know, again, this is one of those things where

122
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,679
we need, we need to clarify this.

123
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,670
You have 90 days, which means if you take 100 days to release an update,

124
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:57,940
then Google probably released the details 1010 days before you do.

125
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,160
And a long time ago, that was a huge deal today.

126
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:00,303
I

127
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:03,252
think most organizations can pull off 90 days.

128
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:03,502
I mean,

129
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,393
there's every now and then you'll hear stories about like

130
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:07,752
Microsoft asked for a two day extension or something and,

131
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:10,053
-- and there are
-- legitimately like some of the you

132
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:11,722
have intel hardware bugs.

133
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,183
It's like, yeah,

134
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:14,953
we're definitely going to need more than 90 days on this or some of the Linux,

135
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:15,872
oh, not Linux

136
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:18,583
stuff. But the uh like those g lipsy bugs,

137
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:19,363
you know,

138
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:22,653
they definitely needed more than 90 days because, you know, I remember

139
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,222
did all that awesome work and they're like,

140
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,963
and we have this cool solution that should be pretty flawless.

141
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:28,933
A red hat engineer who all all

142
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,295
anonymity basically went.

143
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,985
No, that, that will only work if we use like four gigabyte card pages.

144
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:37,075
And then you can have like three processes on a 32 bit system,

145
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:37,626
it

146
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:38,885
won't work as a solution.

147
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:43,816
So some vulnerabilities are such that legitimately, they take more 90 days right

148
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:44,846
now

149
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:48,526
at the same time, let's say you take two weeks to fix your issue,

150
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,976
then you would tell Google we're releasing our

151
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,846
update in two weeks and they'd say great.

152
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:55,656
And then as soon as you release your update with your details,

153
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:57,555
they would hit publish on their details.

154
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:03,899
And now their new policy is that they will publish their details at the 90 day mark.

155
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:04,989
Full stop,

156
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,869
whether there's an update out or there's not an update out.

157
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,459
The 90 day mark is when the details go public,

158
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:14,670
which I think is great because if you fix your vulnerability relatively quick,

159
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:18,910
quickly say 30 days or 60 days, you know, that gives you a month or two of leeway.

160
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:20,230
Well, sort of,

161
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:23,190
if you would have asked me about this a year ago,

162
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,309
I would have said this is a terrible idea

163
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:29,450
and I changed my mind in some strange ways for a variety of reasons just because

164
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,390
I've been actually dealing with some very similar

165
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,549
problems in the last six months or so.

166
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,489
But here's the, I guess here's how I would explain this.

167
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,859
So let's say I release version 1.1

168
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,220
and it fixes a terrible security issue that Google project zero reported to me

169
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,829
and I just say here's version 1.1 and that's it right

170
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,519
now, what people say over 1.1 came out. Uh No security issues. I don't care.

171
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:56,230
I'll wait for the one that has security issues, right?

172
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,609
Why are you publishing 1.1 and not telling people there's a security fix in it.

173
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:03,200
Why? Because Google is keeping it quiet for 90 days.

174
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,640
So version 1.1 was released. And now, let's say, in

175
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,130
30 days,

176
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,119
all the security information becomes public and now I say, oh,

177
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,040
there was a security issue in 1.1.

178
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:20,329
So the issue I, I used to have and I, I still sort of do, sort of not is basically

179
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:24,700
if someone saw 1.1 and they saw no security issues, are they going,

180
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,670
how do you again communicate that?

181
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,059
Ok. 1.1 actually did have security issues.

182
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,470
You actually need to update to that thing. Right.

183
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:38,309
And I think a couple of years ago, upgrading on a constant basis was uncommon.

184
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,845
I think it's becoming more common,

185
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:44,285
but there's still a lot of organizations that can't upgrade every

186
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:47,265
week or every month or every however often you're released.

187
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:51,095
Well, there's a lot of use cases where upgrades are, are actually restricted,

188
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:54,135
like medical devices, you got to certify this stuff or,

189
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:57,065
you know, I run an oil and gas plant. I'm not just gonna like,

190
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:59,484
do a, you know, a rolling update of Windows,

191
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:02,234
seven to Windows 10 on the control system and kind of hope for the best.

192
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:03,225
That's right. That's right.

193
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,390
I, I guess here's,

194
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,250
here's the way I look at it now just because I still struggle with this

195
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,940
in my mind on a constantly and I saw this from Google and I just,

196
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,589
I like, had flashbacks to everything I've been through over the last year.

197
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,470
And

198
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,040
so my kind of view on this is

199
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,190
when you release something,

200
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,850
even if it has security updates,

201
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,130
there are always going to be people who can't upgrade

202
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,609
in a timely manner and that's just that.

203
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:31,029
So this is why good security advisories are

204
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,390
really important because then they can review the security

205
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,409
advisory and say I'm not using this functionality or I'm not doing it in this way or,

206
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,880
hey, here's how I can just turn off that feature so I'm not vulnerable,

207
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,429
I'll do that instead.

208
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:46,068
-- Yeah,
-- or add some compensating controls or whatever.

209
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,479
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

210
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:47,828
That,

211
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,828
so we're in a situation where not everyone can upgrade. Right.

212
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:51,929
There's some people who do,

213
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,768
who like literally like you hit publish and five minutes

214
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,629
later they're running your new version and that's cool too

215
00:08:57,768 --> 00:09:01,408
for other reasons. I mean, maybe it has other problems but whatever,

216
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,138
there, there's that story

217
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:06,348
and I feel like how do people

218
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:09,749
receive and interpret this information? And I think the,

219
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,530
a couple of years ago,

220
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,820
the idea of people looking at a release,

221
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,409
looking at the security issues and then deciding whether they should upgrade or not

222
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,760
was a very point in time event.

223
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,400
But I think we are changing the way all of

224
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:26,270
this works because now there's so much more automation,

225
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,090
there's so much more microservice architecture magic

226
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:32,640
that I don't think it's as important

227
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:38,210
if you're not stuck in 1995 which some, some people are and I'm sorry.

228
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,320
-- Yeah,
-- the challenge is,

229
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,330
there's a lot of people running a lot of

230
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,210
software and it's not necessarily even old software,

231
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,539
10 or 20 or 30 years old, but it's software that's,

232
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:48,909
they don't have the source code for and they can't fix it.

233
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,570
So they're beholden to the vendor.

234
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,130
And it's typically the kind of software where you can't be like, oh, well,

235
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,250
we'll just stop using that, you know,

236
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,929
because it's like an accounting system or something or payroll

237
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:00,570
and, you know, you upgrade something else and it breaks,

238
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,299
you know,

239
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,299
and that's

240
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,630
in fairness.

241
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,340
You know, my one thought is, well, hopefully those vendors go out of business,

242
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,010
right?

243
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,419
Because for example, if you write software that runs on Red Hat,

244
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:12,000
Linux or Windows 10 or whatever,

245
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,419
it should basically run on those platforms, right. That's it. That's all I got.

246
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,500
You know, I understand like on ipad,

247
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:22,150
you know, my kids ipads, some of the apps they have, have died.

248
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:25,659
And it's really sad because there's this one Disney drawing app that was really nice

249
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,719
and it stopped working around I OS version 12.

250
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,419
I'm still bitter that I can no longer play.

251
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:36,450
What Mini Death Star it was called. There was, there was a game

252
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,309
that before Disney had bought Lucas Arts

253
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,919
that they paid like some third party publisher,

254
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,979
I think it was called Mini Dust Star or Tiny Dust Star it was called.

255
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,049
And anyway, I really enjoyed it.

256
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,119
It was kind of a silly game but I liked it and

257
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,210
then it disappeared and I can never get it back now.

258
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:52,609
So

259
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,799
I'm better.

260
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,700
Yeah. So, you know,

261
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:56,450
I mean,

262
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,349
the Enterprise world is a little different but

263
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,960
there's also like the normal people world of,

264
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,070
you know,

265
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,049
somebody has a piece of photo editing software that

266
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,150
they've learned and been using for 20 years.

267
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,059
Why, why should they have to, you know,

268
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:10,140
it's a,

269
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,549
it's a complicated problem because most of the real world we don't

270
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,039
make changes to devices that make them break or totally incompatible,

271
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:17,179
right?

272
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,330
Like there's, it's not like my car,

273
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,760
somebody's going to say, oh, this spare part

274
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,080
or, you know, this part of your car has some flaw in it.

275
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,039
So, here's a new one that fixes it and then my radio breaks.

276
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,320
Uh, that's true because every time I've ever gone in for recall work,

277
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:38,609
it has basically been the same as before I brought it in.

278
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,619
Yeah.

279
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,030
So, you know, and then that's something interesting with software is that most,

280
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,469
a lot of software is very brittle

281
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,700
in the, you know, you, you look at it funny and it falls over and

282
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,750
-- back. But
-- how does this relate to Google's 90 day policy change?

283
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,590
A lot of people can and don't want to upgrade because

284
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:59,559
if I don't upgrade, my system keeps working, if I upgrade, there is a

285
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,179
larger than zero chance it breaks.

286
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:02,820
Now,

287
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,859
offset by the security risk of there's a security risk

288
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,320
there's a bigger than zero chance it gets exploited,

289
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,820
but potentially that larger than zero number is so small, it might as well be zero.

290
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,219
But now if you're a person who never upgrades

291
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:20,280
Google's policy change effectively has no effect on you.

292
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:23,049
-- Well, exactly.
-- I mean, it doesn't matter in that case really.

293
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,349
This basically,

294
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:27,849
I think only affects people who lag slightly who might

295
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:31,299
say only take security upgrades that they need to care about

296
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:36,289
and they're probably already paying closer attention than most.

297
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,169
And I think this is just going to slightly change the way people need

298
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:44,960
to interact because before it was just uh I would check every

299
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:47,489
release to see if I need to care about something and now

300
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,010
I need to watch

301
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,000
it at different times, right?

302
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,809
Releases aren't necessarily the thing I need to look for.

303
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,650
And my one other complaint though, I must say that could make this very confusing

304
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:58,760
is so

305
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:03,409
you could have a situation where I report a security issue to

306
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,359
say Microsoft and then Google reports a security issue to Microsoft.

307
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:08,450
And

308
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:11,789
when are they going to publish details? Right? Are they going to just tell me,

309
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,979
please, let's just wait for 90 days because we have this other issue.

310
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,719
I'm like, oh, you have another issue, ha ha

311
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,479
you know what I mean? And so there's gonna be some complexity there.

312
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:23,059
Well, at scale though, every vendor always has a train of security flaws

313
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,630
and

314
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,219
like that's the thing, right? Like,

315
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,799
you know, if you have a, like

316
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,739
even a good and relatively small code based security product

317
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,500
typically has more than one flaw at a time

318
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,780
without question.

319
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,179
So I don't think that's a real problem. I think I, like,

320
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,340
I get the sense that what Google is trying to do here is to incentivize people.

321
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:48,109
You have 90 days and if you take less than 90 days,

322
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,099
your customers will hate you less and you will have done a better job and

323
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,760
people will be happier

324
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,799
and they're trying to incentivize that good,

325
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,159
correct behavior of fixing it quickly and efficiently and clean.

326
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:02,979
How does this incentivize that outside of the way they already handle things?

327
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,520
Well, for example, in the past, if I fixed it quickly at 30 days,

328
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,130
Google still released the information at 30 days and why, why is this now?

329
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,419
Buy me 60 days

330
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:13,169
to do what to

331
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,929
tell people. Look, this is a security release, you better install it right away.

332
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:20,809
Uh oh, before they release, say like a working exploit, I suppose.

333
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,469
Well, before Google releases uh details, right?

334
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:27,640
-- They, as far as I know Google project here doesn't release exploit code,
-- don't they?

335
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,409
I thought they did. I don't remember.

336
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,799
-- I'm pretty sure
-- they don't because the legality of that gets kind of

337
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:36,090
we'll say reproduction code, right?

338
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,750
Not weaponized, nobody should

339
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:39,260
weaponized exploits.

340
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:41,280
We can argue about that

341
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,650
-- security tools that
-- are like meta,

342
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:44,359
I love

343
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:44,520
metas

344
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:44,809
play

345
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,909
anyway,

346
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,169
that's just don't release weaponized exploits for things I have to work with.

347
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:49,679
Ok.

348
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,409
That I have to upgrade. Right.

349
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,969
That's my request. Everything else is fine.

350
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:54,299
The

351
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,880
thing I have to deal with you don't mess with that because they,

352
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:57,820
and I

353
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:58,059
bet.

354
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,900
But um no, so this way with the new project zero timeline,

355
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:05,739
if I release my security patch at 30 days and tell people, I basically can say, look,

356
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,690
you have 60 days to upgrade, there's a security flaw and you know, 60 days from now,

357
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,020
the details will become public

358
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:12,849
as a customer.

359
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,070
I would kind of prefer that because I have

360
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,309
now I don't have to immediately upgrade and panic.

361
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,090
Hang on. I'm gonna, I'm gonna break this apart into a couple of pieces.

362
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,830
Uh You are wrong and I'll explain to you why.

363
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:26,229
But additionally, Google said that they don't want people rushing patches.

364
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:29,630
And I, I've been through that too where someone, someone reports a security issue

365
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,849
and everyone was like, oh my goodness, security issue,

366
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,619
like let everyone light on fire and run around like crazy people.

367
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,020
And it's like holy cow, you know,

368
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:36,500
poster

369
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,179
child for that started with 12

370
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,700
G I think we ended up with five.

371
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:44,260
Uh I remember that. I think Redhead only did two and

372
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:46,039
they're hilarious for that. But

373
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,099
anyway,

374
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,320
that is a

375
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,250
bizarre and crazy story in its own right.

376
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,609
But yes, exactly where you don't want people rushing to release things,

377
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:56,479
but they have 90 days with Google.

378
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,909
So you don't have to rush,

379
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,700
you have 90 days,

380
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:03,010
you have 90 days either way with this or without it. So,

381
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,590
and plus up to a 14 day extension.

382
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,710
Right.

383
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,549
Which you probably need a really good reason for which my guess is if you

384
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:10,760
believe

385
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,059
the reason is Christmas.

386
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,510
Right. Exactly.

387
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,830
Or, you know.

388
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,979
-- Yeah, Christmas.
-- And

389
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:16,940
that's right.

390
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,260
Yes.

391
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,039
Yes.

392
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,140
Anyway, anyway,

393
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,770
but here's why you're wrong saying you should be able to

394
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,330
say this is a security update and in 60 days,

395
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,500
the details will come out.

396
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,700
Microsoft used to do that

397
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,780
and did it actually prevent anyone from reverse

398
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:34,260
engineering their patches and coming with exploits?

399
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:35,280
No,

400
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,900
but that takes a bit of time.

401
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:39,280
That's not, you know, the details being dropped 15 minutes

402
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:39,559
later.

403
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:43,609
I agree with you that it might delay exploit

404
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,070
by a week or more.

405
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:49,309
You're assuming that people care about these security flaws enough to try. And

406
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,070
that is true.

407
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:54,559
There are probably only a dozen applications that

408
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,780
people care enough to actually reverse engineer.

409
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,450
You know, basically all the things that people will pay bounties for,

410
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:03,659
like not the companies but third parties will pay boundaries for.

411
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,010
I would also say that

412
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,459
-- you are wrong because there's a lot of software now that auto updates
-- and there is,

413
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:10,368
and that's great.

414
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,250
But again, if you're auto updating,

415
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:15,260
then it, it, it's a moot point,

416
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,348
but this gives the fleet time to upgrade because it's not like, you know,

417
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,079
an auto update happens overnight. Like I'm guessing, even with the best of

418
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,358
uh systems, it takes, you know, 24 to 48 hours plus,

419
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:26,689
you know,

420
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,719
there's the case of like systems that are offline and then come back online.

421
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:30,750
You know, because they're turned off,

422
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,062
that's irrelevant to alerting Attackers is that there

423
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:36,593
is a security bug in this update.

424
00:17:36,743 --> 00:17:40,172
-- They just have to find it.
-- Well, the alternative too is you just ship the update.

425
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:42,292
Say you ship your version 1.1 you say there's no,

426
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,223
you don't talk about a security update.

427
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,142
You try and get it across the fleet, you know,

428
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:50,223
and then maybe you retroactively say it's a security flaw or a security update or,

429
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:54,426
or maybe you say release a 1.1 0.1 and say that's the security update.

430
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:59,526
I've done all of these things in the last year and at the beginning,

431
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,166
I had the attitude of we need to like first release.

432
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:04,696
We should publish the advisory

433
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,166
and eat some crow

434
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,215
because we should have done it all. At the same time when you have multiple version,

435
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:13,836
-- you know, crows best eaten when it's young and fresh.
-- Exactly.

436
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:14,576
Exactly.

437
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:17,605
But here's the thing after talking to many customers,

438
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:20,526
mostly customers and developers and

439
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:22,086
anyone I could find

440
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:27,239
it became apparent to me that this was hurting people because

441
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:30,609
they knew they were running bad versions

442
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:32,959
and there was literally nothing they could do

443
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,040
because we hadn't released the new version,

444
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,040
right? And they, they don't like being in that situation. And so

445
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,060
what, where I,

446
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:42,959
where I've ended up landing and I think is the

447
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:45,359
right thing to do here is you say nothing,

448
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,589
you say nothing until everything is released and ready to go.

449
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:50,469
And then

450
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,109
like, yeah,

451
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,410
like let's say I've got three versions and they

452
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,349
come out over the course of three weeks,

453
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,819
nothing is said the last one lands and then the advisory comes out and

454
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:05,349
part of this is treating advisories kind of separate from releases which I think is

455
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,849
what's going to happen with the way Google is treating, this is

456
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:13,979
releases and advisories have historically been bolted together and I think they

457
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:16,609
need to be separated in order for this to actually work.

458
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:17,979
And I think it's ok though

459
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:22,459
because I think it gives people an opportunity to better

460
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:25,510
control what's happening in terms of releasing all the software.

461
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,640
But additionally, I think for something like project zero,

462
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,660
part of the power in this is going to be

463
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,119
when you have say Debian in Red Hat. And so

464
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,810
all releasing software

465
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,390
and, and I have to say Muntu,

466
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,010
I forgot about them. But anyway, there's like a million distro, right?

467
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,459
And I remember it was very common for Debian to be first and then Muntu

468
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:48,910
might come next and then Red Hat come next and then Debian might re release again

469
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,609
because they screwed up the patch the first time and it's like that was messed up.

470
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:52,883
Yeah,

471
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:56,302
I remember crunching a bunch of numbers on that one time because somebody

472
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:59,292
was basically picking on red hats and you guys are too slow.

473
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:01,633
When you looked at the re releases, it was like, yeah,

474
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:04,912
we look good because like we were testing this stuff.

475
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:08,822
One of the specific goals of this is faster patch development. We can all agree.

476
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,942
That's the goal, but more importantly, thorough patch development.

477
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,662
So not just like how many times have people fixed

478
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:15,373
that

479
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:16,076
specific,

480
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:20,255
you know, aspect of that security flaw and the underlying flaw is left, right?

481
00:20:20,956 --> 00:20:21,265
And

482
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:25,355
number three, which and I mean, I keep coming back to this is that improved patch

483
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,985
adoption, right? Because

484
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:30,245
you know, if a patch falls in the forest and nobody installs it, does it

485
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:31,615
anybody hear it or care?

486
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,645
I'm skeptical the improved adoption is going to be a part of it.

487
00:20:34,696 --> 00:20:38,176
But I do think that in the open source ecosystem

488
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,689
giving multiple people time

489
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,050
to deal with this stuff, I think has the potential to be a game changer.

490
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,130
Now, the other part of it though is again,

491
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,880
if you release version 1.1 of library

492
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,050
X and I look at the, I don't see any security issues in it. I'm like, great.

493
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,270
I don't need to care about this release.

494
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,709
We'll just update the next time, you know, kind of still back in that position.

495
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,199
Whereas

496
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:02,369
obviously when there was

497
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,660
the nation in the Linux distro world

498
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:06,760
say, oh, hey, I, you know,

499
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,640
library X is coming out in two weeks and it has a security issue and here's a patch.

500
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,430
So it's,

501
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,819
I mean, it's complicated. I feel like

502
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,630
they're doing the right thing,

503
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,599
but I do think it's not

504
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:23,239
exactly easy to explain right now because I think there's a lot of nuance.

505
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:23,910
Well,

506
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,040
I would say the biggest thing for me is they're doing it relatively transparently.

507
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,479
So we know what the rules are.

508
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:30,420
That's, I mean, a huge step forwards

509
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,969
because like, literally there's a lot of security researchers out there where,

510
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,599
you know, they tell you something and it's kind of like, so like what,

511
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,569
like, what's the timeline of the rules or do you have rules? Like, do you care?

512
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:41,050
You know,

513
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,849
and that's one of the things they talk about here specifically is trying to

514
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,930
um blah, blah, blah, blah,

515
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,530
blah, blah.

516
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:54,790
Uh Well, anyways, and part of the blog posting, they talk about how

517
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,550
they're sort of trying to just standardize things a bit and kind of, you know,

518
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,579
-- some consistency, I guess maybe would be the word I want to use.
-- I, I mean, that

519
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:06,900
seems fair. It's, this is, this is a really hard problem. And

520
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,349
I think Google has done more specifically Google

521
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,910
project zero has done more in this space

522
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,670
than

523
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,140
probably anyone else to date with their 90 day policy.

524
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,829
And I mean, they were the, they were the demon at, at the beginning.

525
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,810
I remember I didn't even like the 90 day policy. I was like, this thing sucks,

526
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,550
but it was, I think it was important. And so

527
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,189
I don't know, I guess we will see where this goes next.

528
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:35,790
I'm very curious to see how this all shakes out and where we land.

529
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,500
-- I
-- mean, the good news is we're seeing a couple of other factors,

530
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:40,709
pushing

531
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,290
generally good behavior with respect to security for it.

532
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,739
So like automatic updates because

533
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,339
if I ship a piece of software and I only have to uh support the most recent version,

534
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,890
man, my life is a whole lot simpler.

535
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,060
Yeah.

536
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:54,689
Um

537
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:55,640
You know,

538
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,010
so there's a lot of other factors coming to

539
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,239
play now that I think will help security improve,

540
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,199
not because there's security issues but because

541
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,680
they just make everybody's life easier.

542
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:05,920
Like,

543
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,859
so

544
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:10,130
I think it's, I

545
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,260
think the reality is that we're moving to a

546
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,560
world where it's continuous integration and continuous development of software

547
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:19,339
and if your software randomly breaks when something changes and you

548
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:22,859
can't fix it and the vendor won't fix it then

549
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:27,099
-- um Yeah, you need to stop using that software.
-- I mean, that's completely fair

550
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,030
and I, I

551
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,020
don't think that I don't see that too often anymore.

552
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,089
Yeah, like I've been talking with my devs about this because, you know,

553
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:36,250
we're looking at changing how we do some stuff and basically, it boils down to

554
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:39,410
the further the delta of like what we use and

555
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,410
kind of what we deploy is from sort of upstream,

556
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,060
the bigger the cost gets and the cost isn't linear. It's

557
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,910
like, I believe it's more algorithmic because, you know,

558
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,790
instead of dealing with one change at a time,

559
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
you're dealing with five changes that all sort

560
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,869
of interlink and like really break things,

561
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,410
you know, versus

562
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,880
upgrading from 1.1 to 1.2 to 1.3 to 1.4 to 2.0 is a

563
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,910
lot different than going from 1.0 to 2.0 and hoping for the best.

564
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:05,229
Uh

565
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:06,880
Yeah,

566
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:07,500
yeah.

567
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:08,479
Well, let me put it this way.

568
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,719
There's a video out there of a guy who installs, what is it like Windows 1.0 or do

569
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:15,550
-- something and upgrades it all the way to like Windows 10.
-- That's a cool video.

570
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,790
You know, you can do that sequentially, you can't go from D OS to Windows 10.

571
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,689
Uh That wouldn't make sense necessarily.

572
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:27,400
Now, I will say I've jumped a surprising number of fedora versions

573
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,469
and some

574
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:30,300
vendors do a really amazing jobs

575
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:30,910
like that.

576
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:31,770
Amazingly,

577
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,020
my intent was to just wipe the disk and I think I went

578
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,729
like five Fedora versions once and it actually worked and I was like,

579
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:39,170
wow, that's amazing.

580
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:40,405
Well, and that's the thing.

581
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:43,405
Like there are some software vendors that do that where they literally, you know,

582
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,944
maintain ridiculous levels of backwards compatibility

583
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:48,405
-- updates,
-- which was definitely an accident though, right?

584
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:52,395
The fedora developers were not like we should maintain five versions

585
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,994
backwards. No, not at all.

586
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:56,005
This was just Josh did something really dumb

587
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:57,724
that no one's ever done before and it happened

588
00:24:58,055 --> 00:24:58,765
like that's all.

589
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,540
No, I, I hear you.

590
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,670
I look at it from the lens of, for example, the logistics world, right,

591
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,489
the logistics world has gone from,

592
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,189
I need to have a big warehouse with enough stuff

593
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,449
that I can ship it out and have it, you know, like arrive there eventually to,

594
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,030
you know,

595
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,939
literally like UPS has commercials that basically boil down to

596
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,989
let us be your warehouse just in time delivery.

597
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,619
It's awesome.

598
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:24,810
And when it works, man, it's efficient and it works great. And you think about

599
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:27,219
how much money people have tied up in stuff,

600
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:29,420
sitting in warehouses versus the people that don't,

601
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,359
that's a huge thing.

602
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,869
And I feel the same way kind of with software in that

603
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:35,969
the amount of money to have tied up

604
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,520
in supporting older versions or dealing with this.

605
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:39,260
You know,

606
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,369
the good vendors now, like

607
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,949
I haven't

608
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,510
really had

609
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,189
a Microsoft or Apple or even a major Linux vendor

610
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:50,310
update

611
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:52,079
really break anything

612
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,119
-- in a long time. Like you don't run
-- Linux enough.

613
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:57,119
Uh I run quite a few Linux

614
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:00,819
-- or we have a mix of sent off seven every time
-- I upgrade it.

615
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:03,189
I'm like, I wonder what's gonna break this time.

616
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:03,849
But I mean,

617
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,680
like I remember back in the day when I was running

618
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,609
fedora and there was this one version where they were DP

619
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,500
and around with Se Linux policies and like

620
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,199
it broke NTP and then it,

621
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,390
yeah, and then it broke and I,

622
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,250
I literally stopped upgrading Se Linux because it's like, I, you know,

623
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,550
this is becoming like

624
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,770
-- unusable.
-- You just turn it off, kids.

625
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,410
E Linux

626
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:20,819
off and

627
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,530
that's actually what I ended up doing.

628
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:23,589
Yeah,

629
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:24,449
I'm sorry.

630
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:26,209
No, actually in all seriousness,

631
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,640
I've been running it on my desktop now for more than a year

632
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,430
and it has not gotten in the way once I was impressed,

633
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,800
they do

634
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:33,199
the job.

635
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,020
So like, yeah, shout outs to us C Linux des, you guys, you're pretty awesome.

636
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:39,160
But I mean, that's in general,

637
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,810
the mature software vendors are becoming quite mature with respect to,

638
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:43,449
here's an update.

639
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:44,930
It's probably not going to host stuff.

640
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,400
Well, that, I mean, that's some of them, obviously my guess is this,

641
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,150
this project zero change is probably not targeted at Microsoft.

642
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,510
And

643
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,319
I, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I guess

644
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,140
I feel like there's more to this story than we understand and they ever understand,

645
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,150
which I'm sure is true.

646
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,270
It makes sense that, you know,

647
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,619
if I bust my butt to release my patch at 30 days and then Google drops immediately and I

648
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,750
don't have like under this new policy they can

649
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,420
with mutual agreement release earlier than the 90 days.

650
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,939
So, for example,

651
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:17,869
I could release my patch for 30 days and they release a 35 days or 40 days

652
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:19,939
instead of a 90 days. Right.

653
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:21,239
-- Yeah.
-- And I wonder

654
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,430
also if they had some issues where

655
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:28,910
an open source project might patch something in a public get

656
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,349
repo.

657
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,619
And then is that, is that public?

658
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,560
And now again, a couple of years ago I would have been like, yes,

659
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,500
that's 100% absolutely public.

660
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,250
And now I'm like,

661
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:42,030
you know what I mean? It really isn't. And if, if someone finds it on accident, like

662
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,979
you can ask him nicely and maybe there's some bad guys looking for it, but honestly,

663
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:49,130
it's really not that big of a deal.

664
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:50,719
So

665
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:54,589
monitoring that stuff with a INML the volume is just way, way too much.

666
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:55,709
Not necessarily.

667
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:58,979
I mean, look, man, if I was going to do something nefarious,

668
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:04,020
I would pick on a sensitive library and there's many like pick on G

669
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:04,880
lip C,

670
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,540
you could watch the g

671
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,250
lipsy and I, I think they do private bugs still.

672
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,880
I don't think they do everything in public. But

673
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,109
uh I'm sure there's something,

674
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,900
nothing's coming to my mind at the moment that I want to say the name of because

675
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,209
there's certain things I know that do this and I don't want to rat them out.

676
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:18,449
But

677
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,329
like

678
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,569
there's certain things you could watch

679
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:27,430
and you knew what you were looking for like an easy example actually. Is

680
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:28,729
there is,

681
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,310
oh,

682
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:34,130
crap. I don't even remember now. There, there's, there's a no Js library that

683
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,410
I use

684
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,819
that. I know who the security people are

685
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,630
and I watch for their commits.

686
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,020
I know when they commit something I need to

687
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,719
pay attention because stuff's coming down the pipe.

688
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:46,380
And so

689
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:48,380
it's like I'm clearly cheating

690
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:50,214
and granted I'm doing it for a little,

691
00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:50,714
you know,

692
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:53,755
to automate and do yourself.

693
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:57,114
Right. Well, yeah, basically I just follow their commits. Right. And

694
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:00,204
anyway,

695
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:01,655
-- not
-- exactly like some,

696
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:02,494
-- I'm
-- not

697
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:04,444
-- hacker,
-- I'm not elite hacker.

698
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:04,974
I use the

699
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:05,805
button.

700
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:07,525
That's right. Exactly.

701
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:09,604
But anyway, anyway,

702
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:11,805
I feel like this is a,

703
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:15,305
one thing I like about this is it's a change

704
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,020
and that's, that is enough. They're trying something new

705
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,680
and I like that.

706
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,079
Right. Because how many security vendors are trying new things upscale?

707
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,459
-- I mean,
-- and I think that's

708
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:29,790
that right there, I think is

709
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:31,969
potentially the most important thing of all.

710
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,119
And I know that this is an argument I have with people

711
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,939
constantly that sometimes change for the sake of change is bad.

712
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,680
But I especially feel like in the security industry

713
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:42,199
shaking things up every now and then is really good because I

714
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:45,020
-- think some of us get the thing
-- is you can't simulate this.

715
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,260
See, that's the biggest problem

716
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,420
with information security is you can't simulate most of this.

717
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:52,630
-- Uh,
-- right.

718
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,709
Especially when it comes to software fixes and updates and bug handling.

719
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:57,030
You can't run like

720
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,010
a B control tests without actually doing it.

721
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,500
-- It's just that simple.
-- Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

722
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,660
you're right. Absolutely. I agree. I agree.

723
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:12,339
All right. So we're, we're nearly out of time here. So I guess

724
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:13,449
I will.

725
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,430
I like it. I guess that, that is my, that is my brief description of all this is

726
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,660
I'm glad they're trying something new.

727
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:25,089
I'm, and they're even calling it an experiment which I, you know,

728
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:25,989
so they're not saying like,

729
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,300
this is the way we're doing it from now on and no questions.

730
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,540
I mean, it's an experiment. Let's see what we get out of it. I, I'm excited.

731
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,060
I can't wait to see what happens.

732
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,660
So, all right, man. Last word that we're, we're wrapping it up.

733
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,469
I find it sad that we have to have some

734
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:43,020
private companies holding the rest of the industry to account,

735
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,819
but it's better than nobody doing it.

736
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,640
Thank you,

737
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:45,939
Google

738
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:46,239
Project.

739
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:50,130
-- Right. Exactly. I was like, do you remember what it was like before?
-- Oh Yeah,

740
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:51,329
I do.

741
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:53,000
Mm

742
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,380
I'm not gonna go into that. I'm not

743
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:57,890
whatever,

744
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,650
whatever. That's right. That's right. Anyone right. Make security great again.
