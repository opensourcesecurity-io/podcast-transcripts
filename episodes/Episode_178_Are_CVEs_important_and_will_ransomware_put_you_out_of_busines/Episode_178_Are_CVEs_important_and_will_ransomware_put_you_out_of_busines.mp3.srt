Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 178 with myself,

1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,239
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,719
-- Josh Pressers.
-- Well, welcome to actually 2020 this episode. So

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,309
-- yay, for us, we made it, the world hasn't ended yet
-- or it has.

4
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:23,729
-- And this is a simulation could be,
-- I mean, either way, whatever, it's fine.

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,370
But if it's a simulation, that means there's no real consequences.

6
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:26,579
I'm ok

7
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:27,360
with that.

8
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:29,770
Like this is, this is obviously someone let their,

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,500
their demented little brother play with the simulation.

10
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:34,799
Nothing makes sense.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,610
-- Anyway.
-- Oh God. Like, can you imagine?

12
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:39,770
I mean, literally.

13
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,610
So it's, it's, we're recording this on Tuesday, January the seventh

14
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,500
and like literally the first

15
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,380
four days of the year. We just like,

16
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:49,180
like what?

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,380
-- Right.
-- Exactly. I feel like the day before was like, hold my beer

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,979
and it just got worse. It's

19
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:56,729
right.

20
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:57,459
Anyway,

21
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:57,669
I

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,659
did that linear extrapolation and we should all be dead by tomorrow.

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,139
Maybe, maybe this podcast will never be aired. Let's hope it does. But anyway, so

24
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,980
let's, let's talk about some friendlier things.

25
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:10,500
I've got,

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,180
I've got kind of two topics in mind and

27
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,989
I'll just spill the beans right away because I think

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,819
they're both really interesting and we'll do our best to

29
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,190
make sure we don't rat hole at either one.

30
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:17,480
But

31
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,349
I've noticed there's

32
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:23,169
a conversation happening on Twitter right now where people are basically saying,

33
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,930
do I need CV E I DS?

34
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,809
Like on my resume

35
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,750
to be?

36
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:31,480
No, I'm going to disagree with you there. It's,

37
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:33,760
there's a bunch of conversations going on

38
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,360
on Twitter that are an exact representation of

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,339
generally speaking. People don't know what CV is or what

40
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,569
for. So there's a bunch of conversations, like, do I need to get CV S?

41
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,589
Should I have gotten CV S? Do I have to publish them? Do I want them on my resume?

42
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,430
Do they matter?

43
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,660
Should we all burn them in a fire?

44
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,050
Is Kurt a bad person for having assigned 6000 of them? The answer

45
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:52,680
is yes,

46
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,529
but there's other reasons to. But

47
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:55,360
anyway,

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,139
that's

49
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:57,120
like,

50
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:58,319
no offense.

51
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,569
This is like watching people discuss

52
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,589
Blockchain and Cryptocurrency where it's like

53
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:03,142
you're all wrong.

54
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:07,313
But it's less funny because watching the Blockchain people argue is

55
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:10,382
one of the highlights of my week when I pull up

56
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:13,253
one of the various Blockchain forums and read the comments.

57
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:14,393
But anyway, so there's that.

58
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,113
And then the other topic

59
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:17,173
is

60
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:21,033
the telemarketing company that went out of business because of ransomware.

61
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,343
And I think there's,

62
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,332
ah, there's so much gold in this story. I, I can't even start.

63
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:26,352
So anyway, let's start with C

64
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:28,156
and you just rattled off

65
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,076
like 1000 things and let's,

66
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:32,315
let's keep it kind of narrow because I don't want to get in.

67
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:35,916
Here's the first question, what is CV? And the answer is most people don't know.

68
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:39,716
-- Look,
-- we have like 30 episodes talking about that point.

69
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:44,945
Let's assume if you're listening to us right now and you don't know what CV E is.

70
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:49,555
-- Search our back catalog and listen to one of the episodes.
-- It's like Blockchain.

71
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:51,095
There's the people that don't know what it is

72
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,330
and then there's the people that know a little bit about it,

73
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,789
but think and think they understand it.

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,110
So fundamentally

75
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:01,149
CV, common vulnerabilities and exposures, it's a barcode for

76
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,979
common vulnerabilities and exposures in software and as the future moves on there,

77
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,600
uh it's, they're looking at adding services

78
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,009
as well like cloud services,

79
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,309
but fundamentally that's it. It's a bar.

80
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,880
So like back in the day when there was like a new send mail vulnerability,

81
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,100
remember like eight little green men and whatnot, you know,

82
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,509
there's a new remote exploit and send mail about what, every two months

83
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,529
the point of something like CV is or when we're talking about the Linux kernel,

84
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,589
like the Linux kernel has thousands of security vulnerabilities because, well,

85
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,940
it's just got a giant code base going back 20 plus years now.

86
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:37,139
We can talk about these vulnerabilities and not be like, so the Apache HTP

87
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,880
cross site scripting resource splitting attack. OK. Which one?

88
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,300
There's like six of them spanning a couple of years. Well,

89
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:46,270
blah, blah, blah, no, just CV E dash a

90
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:50,899
four digit number which is the year in theory dash a four to

91
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,475
six or higher digit number, which is

92
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,565
the actual identifier. That's it. It's just a barcode. That's it. Folks,

93
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:56,975
a

94
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,634
vulnerability not have VA

95
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:03,285
CV has to represent a vulnerability otherwise it shouldn't exist.

96
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:05,445
It's like a barcode for a book, right? A barcode

97
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:08,125
for a book doesn't exist until there's a book to slap it on.

98
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:10,544
Or you can write a book without a barcode.

99
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,104
I'm sure I wrote many a comic book as a

100
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:16,363
youth that had no barcode and luckily never escaped.

101
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,483
You can get the CV. While the vulnerability is private,

102
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,600
you can get the CV, the moment it becomes public,

103
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,119
you can get the CV.

104
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,760
10 years later when you realize this, Linux commit,

105
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:29,839
fixed this horrible security flaw and nobody realized it was a security flaw,

106
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,359
whatever.

107
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:33,799
I'm gonna, I'm gonna put a stick in the ground and say, just

108
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,489
go listen to the github

109
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,519
episode

110
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:39,519
for all of those details because they do,

111
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:44,156
we, I guess, do a marvelous job of explaining it with github.

112
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:48,865
So here's the question though that I really want us to discuss

113
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:52,226
is do you think if you have discovered a CD E,

114
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,585
does that say anything

115
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:57,855
about your ability level in the world of security?

116
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,885
-- Again,
-- you're asking the wrong question. The question

117
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:00,246
simply is

118
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:04,911
does adding a CV to a vulnerability, add value in some way, shape or form.

119
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:09,441
For example, clearly describing the vulnerability adds value versus a

120
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:11,821
cross site scripting vulnerability in wordpress,

121
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,351
that's terrible.

122
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:18,272
But a cross site script of vulnerability in wordpress file food dot PHP line 172

123
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,562
that is adding vulnerability right there.

124
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,670
So does a cve add value to the vulnerability. And the answer is

125
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,820
sometimes, yeah, and sometimes quite a lot,

126
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:33,089
especially for the volume stuff like say Microsoft or Oracle

127
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,410
where Oracle comes up with 200 security flaws every quarter.

128
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,489
You are too meta.

129
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:37,644
I think that's

130
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:38,225
the

131
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:39,484
conception has

132
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:39,765
-- to be
-- me.

133
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:41,024
It

134
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,195
-- doesn't matter
-- because

135
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:44,954
we can talk about whatever we want

136
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:45,635
it.

137
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,755
No, no, I, I mean, so here's

138
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:52,304
where I wanted to kind of bring this and I have a feeling I'm going to be

139
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,440
digging you out of the meadow hall. This whole conversation, that's fine.

140
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,489
But is

141
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,519
so let's say I'm a new person

142
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:03,799
and I'm looking to get a job in the world of security and someone tells me, oh,

143
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:06,029
you need to go discover some CV E I DS.

144
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,290
You can put them on your resume

145
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,209
resume for certain types of hiring people.

146
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes. OK. There we go. Because here is what I kept thinking of is

147
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,459
if, if someone sent me a resume was like, oh, I discovered 1000 CV E si would feel like

148
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:26,890
no, you did. Right. You either discovered 1000 garbage CV ES

149
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:28,179
or

150
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,500
-- you somehow are lying or you gained something because nobody
-- does that.

151
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,739
Conversely. Now you have the data to actually look it up easily and check.

152
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,239
-- Well,
-- yes, I do. But most people don't.

153
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,079
And a lot of people, like you said, don't even know what CV E is.

154
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,989
And so there's probably a subset of people that would see.

155
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,480
Oh, you have all these CV ES, you must be really smart.

156
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:52,000
Whereas I have a suspicion if someone sent me a resume with CV ES on it,

157
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,799
I would grill them like none other.

158
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,549
And

159
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,880
just because they'd be like, all right.

160
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,850
So let's do this if, if you're going to brag about this, like,

161
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:02,440
I'm going to hold you to task and see what's going on

162
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,630
-- and
-- they would either fail miserably or pass with one

163
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,320
colors because there's not really going to be any.

164
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,609
Exactly.

165
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:11,970
And, and it's one of those things that, you know what it always reminds me of.

166
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,529
I,

167
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:16,130
I've interviewed like a gazillion application, security people.

168
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,660
And my favorite was always when someone

169
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,480
would start talking about buffer overflows.

170
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:20,209
And I would just say,

171
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,200
tell me about buffer overflows

172
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,609
and the conversation generally goes downhill from there

173
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,799
because I've only talked to a handful of people

174
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:29,390
and I would,

175
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,640
I would consider many of them my friends now because I really enjoyed their company.

176
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:32,950
But

177
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:36,040
there are very few people who actually could answer that question

178
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,359
without just getting themselves into more and more trouble.

179
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:39,864
Honestly say

180
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:43,364
I am not 100% confident I could properly

181
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:47,545
-- and clearly explain a buffer overflow.
-- Yeah, you're not on my list. So,

182
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:50,704
but, but see there's, there's the trick though is I'm,

183
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:52,845
I'm smart enough to know. I don't know that.

184
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,325
-- Exactly.
-- That, that's a start. At least

185
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,815
-- that
-- that's exactly it. And I feel like

186
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:03,799
this is the same story of someone saying, oh, you need CV E I DS on your resume.

187
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,299
It, it feels to me

188
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:06,209
like

189
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,140
if you think you need that,

190
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,140
you don't know enough, right?

191
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:12,579
You're, that's like Dunning Kruger territory,

192
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:16,529
it really does depend what kind of job and where you're hiring because there

193
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:19,095
are absolutely places that look at those metrics.

194
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,454
Yeah, I mean, there probably are. No, I've, I've worked for those places.

195
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:23,304
They literally,

196
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:27,665
that was like your resume of finding flaws was directly proportional to

197
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,734
you getting hired and how much you were going to get paid.

198
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:32,275
Because literally, I worked at two places,

199
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:35,164
isight partners and I defense where literally

200
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:38,325
coming up with exploit code for known vulnerabilities

201
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:39,974
and proving that they worked and whatnot.

202
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,719
You know, if you were able to do that for Microsoft products,

203
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,929
you were gonna make a lot more money than if you weren't able

204
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,650
to or to only do it for like the Linux kernel or something.

205
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,130
And we had some really scary smart guys who would, like,

206
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,390
basically Microsoft Tuesday would roll around,

207
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,599
they'd lock themselves in their lab for literally 24 hours

208
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,940
and then come out with like a

209
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,390
working exploit for the worst Microsoft vulnerability.

210
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,010
-- I believe
-- that,

211
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,719
-- you know, between Vin Diff and a bunch of other shenanigans.
-- Sure. Ok.

212
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,960
I mean, and, and that's fair, I guess in that regard,

213
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,929
I,

214
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,729
but how many of those people had, like,

215
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:15,950
discovered the issues because I will also say that actual finding

216
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,130
flaws and exploiting flaws are not the same skill set.

217
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,340
There's some overlap,

218
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:24,419
-- they're
-- similar enough that it's a good metric but more to the point part of

219
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:28,510
their job also was not on Microsoft Tuesday was finding new and original flaws.

220
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,770
Like, if you go through

221
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,489
Microsoft

222
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,119
security advisories you'll see eyesight part

223
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:37,106
and I defense get credit for a bunch of some really bad stuff.

224
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:38,296
Yeah. I mean, that's true.

225
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:42,536
I, I remember dealing with reports from those folks and they were, they were good.

226
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:44,036
I mean, that's like I know the Qac

227
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:45,515
folks when I see

228
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:48,986
that's one of those ones when I see a security report with Wallace's name on it.

229
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,385
-- Like I go read it because I know that one's the real deal.
-- Oh,

230
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:55,346
man, when, when I was still assigning CV S and doing that stuff on the distro list and,

231
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:59,461
you know, there'd be an email and I love calls, but I also hated the head's bad.

232
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:01,721
Habit of sending the emails out at like three o'clock on a Friday.

233
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,231
And I was just like, oh God,

234
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:04,682
I had plans this weekend.

235
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:07,861
-- That
-- was
-- fun. Not as bad as a phone call from Tavis Horman.

236
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:08,541
You

237
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:08,742
know,

238
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:11,642
I know, I love those like memes that are talking about, you know,

239
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:15,552
when Tavis asked on Twitter for a contact on Friday afternoon and it's like, oh,

240
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:16,841
we'll make more coffee.

241
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,242
That's all right. It's on.

242
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,859
No, I know, I know that feeling. Exactly

243
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:25,969
the thing is, and that's the problem. The R CV S this be all end, all show of your

244
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:28,619
competency and sophistication and qualification.

245
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:29,500
Well,

246
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:30,700
maybe,

247
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:35,190
-- maybe not, probably not, but sometimes, yes, but sometimes, mostly, no,
-- I,

248
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,080
-- I would lean towards no, in most instances for the
-- majority.

249
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,200
That would be correct. But

250
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,409
I would say

251
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,309
what two aspects of this would be.

252
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,530
It shows a willingness to play well with others, especially sometimes.

253
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,700
Let me put it this way. If somebody comes to me with a CV,

254
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,950
there's going to be a couple of things that I'm going to find interesting about it.

255
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,840
Number one, is it like an interesting CV?

256
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:59,520
Or is it like kind of, you know, just some very simple little flaw or is it like,

257
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,400
you know, I found this, like, really cool flaw and like,

258
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,890
openness a cellar to the LS kernel.

259
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:07,669
Uh Second thing would be, which CV numbering authority did they go through to get it?

260
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,219
Like, did they

261
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:11,419
find something in a third party product that's not covered and, you know,

262
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:11,909
went through mir

263
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,460
or did they,

264
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,859
for example, find a flaw in an oracle product and actually get,

265
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,380
managed to get oracle to assign a CV and fix it?

266
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,739
Because if they can do that,

267
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,539
that's actually pretty impressive,

268
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,130
you know, not to pick on oracle. But let's pick,

269
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:26,640
we can pick on them.

270
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:27,969
It'll never work for them.

271
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,280
Those are famous last words,

272
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,719
but I have a relatively sophisticated understanding of CV

273
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,130
and what these things mean. And like, I know how the CNAs behave

274
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,109
and that's

275
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,340
not your average bear.

276
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:47,190
No. And that's the other half of this I keep thinking of is

277
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,219
you and I have probably one of the most skewed views of

278
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:56,380
CV E on the planet because we were heavily involved and like,

279
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,200
we know everything buried in the yard.

280
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:00,299
Not only were you

281
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,010
involved? I'm on the bloody board.

282
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,520
That's

283
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:03,119
right.

284
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,200
People on the planet right there.

285
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:08,340
No offense. You probably should have been on the board.

286
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,510
I think there's 100% chance you are correct.

287
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,840
But there's a long string of funny history.

288
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:19,119
I will tell anyone who buys me a bunch of beers sometime, but it doesn't matter. And

289
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:20,989
in hindsight, I'm kind of glad I'm not.

290
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,789
But because then I'd be in your position where it's like, well, crap.

291
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,840
I'm stuck on this thing.

292
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:25,820
-- But anyway,
-- anyway.

293
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,679
Right. I'm,

294
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,349
yes.

295
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:29,359
Anyway,

296
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,219
anyway,

297
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,200
-- so
-- Exactly. And that's so on. The one hand, part of me almost wants to say that I am not

298
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,020
q

299
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:38,760
I'm overqualified to talk about this because it's like

300
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,710
asking Einstein about his view on atomic bombs.

301
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,859
He, he has such a subtle and nuanced view of it that

302
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,530
I don't understand that.

303
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,619
And, and that's fair actually.

304
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,729
And that's actually not something I had thought of in this context

305
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:56,320
is the fact that you can sometimes be over educated to a point

306
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:58,119
that I sound like such a snob here.

307
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,250
But you can be like, you can know too much to have actual conversations with,

308
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,690
with normal people.

309
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,130
And I think we're even more skewed because we

310
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,969
talk to each other all the freaking time.

311
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:08,500
So we're like,

312
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:13,080
-- everyone knows this
-- and half the time when I talk with people about Stevie stuff,

313
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,770
they're like, are you sure?

314
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:13,989
And I'm like,

315
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:17,174
yes, just trust me when I say that this is correct.

316
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,895
You know, it's like, you know, yeah,

317
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:22,205
it's like asking Einstein about the theory of relativity.

318
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,195
It's like, no, no, no. I said it's true. It's true.

319
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:25,775
You know what you just reminded me of.

320
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:31,284
So there is a speed running event that will be over by the time this,

321
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:33,724
this podcast is published, it's called a GDQ.

322
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:34,804
Awesome Games Done Quick.

323
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,025
And they do another event called Summer Games Done Quick

324
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:39,135
and actually went to summer games done quick last year,

325
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:40,044
which was amazing.

326
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:40,934
And I loved it. But anyway,

327
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,440
there was, this guy was running

328
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,780
the Fallout

329
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,070
Anthology or whatever. It's basically like five Fallout games. Right.

330
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,039
And he, he, he ran them all in like, two hours,

331
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,429
which is amazing because it would take a normal person probably, like,

332
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,030
20 hours to beat one of the games.

333
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,130
-- It would
-- take me two hours to learn the basics of the.

334
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:56,750
Exactly.

335
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,320
And there was this one point where he's talking about, he had like,

336
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,919
he had a little model made of, of cardboard and plastic cups.

337
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,380
He constructed to explain this glitch.

338
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,150
He was going to do where he like, he had to jump on top of a level and then like jump

339
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:14,034
off the side and fall under like he had to loop around and go under this, this elevator

340
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:17,375
to and then get sucked up into it and go to like this, this place.

341
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:19,835
And, you know, he's explaining all this while it's loading

342
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:20,715
and

343
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,684
it was a very detailed explanation.

344
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,784
And it was surprisingly easy to understand with the model he had.

345
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:29,965
And then at the end he goes, and this saves 40 seconds. It's like,

346
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,155
it just, it literally took this guy two minutes

347
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:36,234
or maybe even more than two minutes to explain the flaw.

348
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:37,114
And then

349
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,179
it saves 40 seconds in the game by doing this trick. And it's like,

350
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,159
that's what I feel like here. I think we,

351
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,190
I mean, I mean, I that's how you win these things. Yes.

352
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:47,940
But that's what I feel like when you're saying, you know,

353
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,299
like asking Einstein a question.

354
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:52,289
It's like sometimes when somebody knows too much,

355
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,760
it can be very difficult for them to explain.

356
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,419
And then it seems even dumber when they're done explaining because it's like, wait,

357
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,940
what, 40 seconds, like, come on.

358
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:00,219
You

359
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,090
know, it's just,

360
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:04,320
it was awesome though. And it was actually a really fun run.

361
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,650
If,

362
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:08,700
if anyone's interested in speed running all the videos will be on youtube from a GDQ.

363
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,919
And it is an awesome event. I'd love it. But anyway, anyway. All right. So

364
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,330
I think

365
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,750
-- I want to move on and I think you, you hit the
-- nail.

366
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,590
This hits a fundamental problem though in tech,

367
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:22,469
which is going to a very metal level.

368
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,679
How do tech interviews work? Right?

369
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,099
Typical programming interviews now seem to largely consist

370
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:30,419
of a bunch of like programming games that don't

371
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,229
to the real world

372
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,979
or they like quiz you on essentially four

373
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:37,960
year CS

374
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,469
degree knowledge

375
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,530
to see if you paid attention in class, I guess because they don't trust your GPA.

376
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:47,750
Like write me a sorting algorithm with only four bits of memory

377
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:51,070
and the computer catches fire every 17 seconds,

378
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,859
right? Like, huh?

379
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:53,539
Like whatever,

380
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:53,840
that's

381
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:54,090
easy,

382
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,070
whatever. And so

383
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:00,830
the CV E thing is kind of, it's just a very specific technical subset of that.

384
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,260
It's like

385
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,859
ask, oh a great example, we ask a developer to, for example,

386
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,729
explain the differences between XML and

387
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,280
JSON

388
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,599
or even worse, ask a developer to explain why

389
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,140
XML stream to serialize exist.

390
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,849
And if they're under the age of 40 they're not going to have a clue.

391
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,710
Right. Because computers are just real fast now. It doesn't matter.

392
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,010
And that's what I'm saying,

393
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:24,530
but

394
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:25,530
fundamentally

395
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:31,239
it doesn't really matter because most of it's mature enough that it just works.

396
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,960
And that's kind of how the security industry is in general.

397
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,260
Most of it is, you know,

398
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,119
you report a flaw to somebody and they generally try and fix it nowadays.

399
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,359
They don't try and shoot the messenger as much as they used to.

400
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,400
And then they generally ship that fix and more to the point we live

401
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,940
in a world now where you get your software online every like 17 minutes,

402
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,940
you don't get a CD in the mail every two years.

403
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,450
I mean, that's fair.

404
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,659
I, I think that's a really good point and I, I, like,

405
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:55,280
I think that's a great way to close this conversation, I think.

406
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:55,530
Yeah,

407
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:57,030
I agree 100 percent.

408
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,940
Again, if you're in an industry that, like, infosec, I would say,

409
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,320
get what really drives me nuts is all these guy anonymous.

410
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,569
But he basically says I have two CV reservations that never got finalized, blah,

411
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,290
blah, blah, blah, blah.

412
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:07,979
And I asked,

413
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:08,368
um,

414
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:09,030
you know,

415
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,199
well, like, why didn't they get finalized?

416
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,790
And he's basically like, well, you know,

417
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,510
I got them reserved and just never told Miter, like,

418
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,410
when they got fixed and stuff and it's kind of like, well, ok,

419
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,229
that's why they don't really exist in the database then.

420
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,709
Right.

421
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,469
I mean, because, you know, miters not gonna,

422
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:24,089
they don't have time to go hunt down every single CV, they,

423
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:25,608
that's not miter's fault either.

424
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:26,430
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

425
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,270
So,

426
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,260
you know, part of why CV is such a mess is like,

427
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,459
it would be the same thing as complaining.

428
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,449
Why are there so many spelling mistakes on Wikipedia?

429
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:39,099
Well, because a whole bunch of random people edited Wikipedia

430
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,780
and, you know,

431
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,040
I,

432
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,420
I remember reading the article for Edmonton and it said Edmonton

433
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,060
is dissected by the North Saskatchewan River and I'm like close,

434
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:48,625
like

435
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:53,064
we're only, it's, it's literally off by two air, right? B to D

436
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,635
or ad to B rather, you know, B

437
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:56,824
and I'm like,

438
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,185
you know, so I, I, and I was like, I stared at it and then I actually, like,

439
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:02,805
created an account and that was, I think one of the first edits I ever did, like,

440
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:04,334
I logged in and created an account and,

441
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:08,530
and corrected that one character and, you know, made me feel my brain less twitchy.

442
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,050
But at the same time, you know, like if I ever want to complain about Wikipedia, I

443
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,329
-- can't not fix things when I see them on Wikipedia.
-- That's true. That's true.

444
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:16,930
So,

445
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,459
you know, my take on CV is a lot of people complain about CV.

446
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:20,329
And then you ask them, well, like,

447
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,209
did you participate in the process and actually like, blah, blah, blah.

448
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:26,369
-- And they're like, no, it was really annoying
-- in defense

449
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,609
of Wikipedia. It is much easier to edit Wikipedia entries.

450
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,930
Not anymore, man, I've edited Wikipedia entries about factual things that again,

451
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,650
like the CV E page

452
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,050
that I'm, I think I'm an authority on

453
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,170
or like the, you know,

454
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,010
some other things where I'm involved in an authority and people have been like, no,

455
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,609
that's, we don't like, we don't believe you.

456
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,489
Your citation doesn't make sense. We're revoking your edit.

457
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,170
Wikipedia is, if you look at it now, it's become a really,

458
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,719
it's like the same thing with stack overflow, right?

459
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:55,170
You, you, you ask a really good question and somebody's like, uh no,

460
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,400
this is related to this other question that it totally isn't

461
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,839
and we're closing it as a duplicate and it's like, no, no, no,

462
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,459
this is something completely new and different.

463
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:04,010
-- Trust me on this one.
-- Yeah, I don't, I don't really pay attention to

464
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,729
ST

465
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,800
but fundamentally that's, you know, that's,

466
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,959
I would say the problem with CV is most people

467
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:12,260
don't know what CV is much like Fight Club.

468
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,400
We don't talk about it enough,

469
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,560
we talk about it all the time while normal people don't want

470
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:17,880
to hear about it and I don't blame them at all.

471
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,829
And I mean, normal people in the infosec industry,

472
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,849
I don't mean like normal people like truck drivers.

473
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:22,699
And, um,

474
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:26,599
yeah, I, again, a lot of these people I see complaining about CV,

475
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:29,680
when I asked them about kind of what, what, what happened, what was your experience?

476
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:30,260
It's kind of like,

477
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:34,270
well, that, that's kind of how that works. Like, sorry, you don't like it. But, yeah.

478
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,949
Yeah. Anyway. All right, let's move on ransomware.

479
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,060
So the story here

480
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:40,859
is,

481
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:43,400
there's a telemarketing company that went out of business shortly

482
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,359
before Christmas and they claim they got hit by ransomware.

483
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,900
They paid the ransom.

484
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,699
Their files didn't decrypt and they basically couldn't stay in business anymore.

485
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:52,699
And

486
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:56,560
I'm curious what your thoughts are on this one because I read that and I was like,

487
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:57,920
I don't know about this.

488
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,920
So going back a bit further, even,

489
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,479
uh there's an article here from CNET in 2017 that says basically

490
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,560
ransomware shuts down one in five small businesses after it hits.

491
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:08,109
Oh,

492
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,839
I hadn't read that but I,

493
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:13,520
-- I believe that and
-- I would absolutely believe that because think about this

494
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:19,430
just fundamentally how many companies can survive a catastrophic data loss event.

495
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:19,810
I

496
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:21,699
can't.

497
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,310
Yeah.

498
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,030
Um, but companies in general, my understanding is the number, you know,

499
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,699
it varies a lot but it's like 50% just are gone.

500
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,209
Sony made it

501
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,140
-- like
-- they didn't lose data.

502
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,020
They,

503
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,959
they, I'm

504
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,099
talking about data lost,

505
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,939
gone. Not like it leaked, but like,

506
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,369
like the building burnt down, the server got, you know,

507
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,510
somebody spilled Coca Cola into the server.

508
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,390
Ransomware, encrypted all your data, you know, whatever.

509
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,150
Um, so the reality is,

510
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:54,619
well, ransomware is one type of data loss event but there's others, like, you know,

511
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,520
hard drives fail,

512
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,219
like over the last 25 years, how many hard drives have you?

513
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:03,060
And I had failed, I mean, not many recently, but like in the, you know, 1st 5,

514
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:05,589
10 years of my tech career I lost probably a good half dozen drives in that.

515
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,910
I lose a lot.

516
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:10,910
-- I mean, I haven't in a while.
-- You're right. Smack them with hammers.

517
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,069
-- No,
-- just, I, well, I,

518
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:17,300
I basically, I'm notorious for buying cheap drives and powering them off.

519
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,290
Yeah. And then you power them off and they never power back

520
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,729
-- on.
-- But now granted, I mean, they're still like 10 years old.

521
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,579
It's not like I'm running these things for a year and then they die

522
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,979
like they are well past their expected lifetime when they die on me.

523
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,089
-- So,
-- I mean, that's a perfect example of why small businesses suffer data loss.

524
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,859
They, they run a bunch of hardware.

525
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:33,739
But

526
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,420
I mean, you,

527
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:36,185
if you want to run a hard drive for 1020 years,

528
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,954
there are hard drives out there that will do that and they cost a bit more.

529
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,025
Not much more. I don't,

530
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:41,265
but

531
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,665
I actually for a while was buying those, uh, what was it? Western Digital Red Nas

532
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:46,114
Drives.

533
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,655
And man, I mean, I went from like Seagate,

534
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:52,125
I experienced something like a 30% failure rate across a dozen drives.

535
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:53,604
So I was, I'm like,

536
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,574
you know, never buying Seagate again.

537
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,614
I went to Western Digital and I mean,

538
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,515
I think the worst I ever got was like two smart airs on one drive,

539
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:03,604
you know, and I had like almost 20 of these.

540
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:04,334
Um,

541
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:07,500
but back to this, I mean, the reality is, well,

542
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,329
Ransomware is one event that can cause data loss.

543
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,530
But fundamentally, like most small businesses are literally

544
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:19,630
-- a week of unpaid invoices away from insolvency.
-- Uh That's probably fair actually.

545
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,050
And I know I have a friend who worked at, uh,

546
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,430
he was like the head of it for a smallish company.

547
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:26,900
And I remember,

548
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,199
like he joked to me one time where his CEO showed up and basically said, you know,

549
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:30,839
what's our,

550
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,630
like, what's our plan? If we have catastrophic data loss? We find new jobs.

551
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,250
The guys like, oh ha ha. Really? He's like, no, that, that's actually it, like,

552
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,000
you don't want to pay for a proper backup. So that's pretty much the way it goes.

553
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,430
Yeah, like I recently made a policy if I don't do local backups anymore at home here,

554
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:48,099
I

555
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:48,699
only do cloud

556
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:49,219
backups.

557
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,790
House burns down.

558
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:52,829
Yeah, I know. I know.

559
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,310
I mean,

560
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,390
I remember working in a data center like a million

561
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,800
years ago where every week the bin would arrive on Monday

562
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,869
and you take the old tapes out and you put the new

563
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,650
tapes in and then they carted off on Thursday every week,

564
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,260
man, those were, those were dark days.

565
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:10,630
-- I mean,
-- well, the other thing too is this company that went out, somebody mentioned,

566
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,229
I found this quite humorous is that,

567
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,510
yeah, they might have, well, you were mentioning, for example, like,

568
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,599
did they use the key correctly or did they get the right key or, you know, whatever.

569
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:22,500
So assuming, let's assume for a moment they got encrypted by ransomware. A

570
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:27,869
got ransomware, A's key and used ransomware A's key correctly.

571
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,739
They, I mean, because this ransomware isn't like, it's not all of it is high quality.

572
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,329
Some of it actually is from what I've read surprisingly high quality software

573
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:38,250
but not all of it is.

574
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,880
But assuming for a moment it's decent

575
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,930
quality software that actually decrypted properly.

576
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,270
Somebody pointed out that that might not have been their first ransomware.

577
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,030
I mean, it's

578
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,859
-- sometimes it
-- could be, it could be where ransomware a encrypts everything,

579
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:54,329
then ransomware B shows up and re encrypts everything

580
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:57,750
and you might, you only know about B you decrypt B and you're like, oh crap,

581
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,770
there's still a here and my, my deadline has expired.

582
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,859
So I'm sol

583
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,750
which maybe, I mean, I think the odds of that are probably low.

584
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,660
I,

585
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,989
I have a strong suspicion.

586
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,880
This was a telemarketing firm in the midwest of the United States.

587
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,670
We're not going to be talking about

588
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:19,239
super tech savvy it, people in general here,

589
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,920
if I was going to guess,

590
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:24,599
well, and it's not like they had the kind of money that may spent

591
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,770
fixing their,

592
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:28,239
my suspicion

593
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,800
is they either got the key and couldn't figure out how to use it

594
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,760
or they decrypted it and the data was still in such a state.

595
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,920
They couldn't actually deal with

596
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:37,285
it and, and I bet you're right.

597
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:40,905
-- They were basically,
-- well, how many places, how do I put this nicely?

598
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:43,665
How many places would take more than a week to recover

599
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:46,265
if you just killed power to all the servers or let,

600
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,425
no, no, no, let's back up.

601
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:48,944
Not even killed power to the servers.

602
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,925
You shut down every single piece of

603
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:54,135
hardware gracefully turned everything off and said,

604
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:55,915
OK, bring it all back up online and make it work.

605
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:57,040
Uh

606
00:24:57,989 --> 00:24:58,839
Right. Exactly.

607
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,430
It's gonna depend obviously. But so I remember

608
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:07,119
when my first job out of college, we had a fairly large data center.

609
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,040
It was like half the floor of the building we were in.

610
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,199
And

611
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:17,180
I remember one time we lost power where it was out for a day

612
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,310
and obviously UPS kicks in. We didn't have a generator.

613
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,189
The UPS could make it, I think six hours though because it was a big Ups.

614
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,170
And I remember in our four, they were like, we gotta shut it down.

615
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,170
We got to start turning stuff off. We don't have a choice here.

616
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,410
And we,

617
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,599
I think we left the website up because we could run basically the web

618
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:38,410
server and the router for probably a day on the remaining power we had.

619
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,099
And yeah, I remember that day when we started things back up.

620
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,920
There was that, well, the next day it was,

621
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:47,439
there was an enormous number of machines

622
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,030
that

623
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:49,260
-- didn't come back
-- online

624
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:50,380
-- services
-- and

625
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:50,640
it

626
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,449
was messed up.

627
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:53,410
I remember there's,

628
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,099
there's a stack overflow question where I've actually

629
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:56,959
been uploaded quite a lot where they talk about

630
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,229
rebooting Linux kernel.

631
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:01,560
Uh Well, Linux system or whatever, and my response was,

632
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:05,439
I actually forced myself to reboot, not just for kernel updates, but in general,

633
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:06,099
once a month

634
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:06,250
I

635
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:06,569
have

636
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:07,359
servers.

637
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:08,030
I,

638
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:10,339
that I know they would come back up and I

639
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:11,699
don't mean just the physical hardware but I mean,

640
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:12,719
the services and everything

641
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:16,270
and also that way I could do it in a controlled environment, you know, I would like,

642
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,260
and literally, it would happen about once or twice a year.

643
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,189
I would reboot and something would go wonky and I'd fix it.

644
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,959
But I'm doing that like

645
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:26,359
on my schedule on a Saturday morning when I'm relaxed, not

646
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:28,510
in a panic situation at three in the morning.

647
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:29,770
Um

648
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,969
And the reality is like,

649
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:35,089
how many places practice turning off all their systems and bringing them back up.

650
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:36,260
Does that

651
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,469
apart from Netflix with their chaos Gorilla?

652
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,579
Uh Right. Right. But they're also very cloud based.

653
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:46,380
Yeah, that doesn't, that doesn't really count. No, I hear you. So, I guess

654
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,780
I don't, I don't want to drag this one on too long.

655
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,699
But it, it, it seems to me like, so the other,

656
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:54,930
the other half of this conversation now is there's all these people that are saying,

657
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:56,239
oh, my goodness, if you're a small business,

658
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,329
you need like these amazingly robust backups to

659
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,579
make sure you don't go out of business.

660
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,459
And then that got me thinking as well.

661
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,280
I mean, honestly,

662
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,890
if you're in a position where ransomware could put you out of business,

663
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,060
you're probably not in a position to number one even know this happened.

664
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,400
But then number two, like

665
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,790
what are backups? Right? You're not,

666
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:18,170
I feel like this is such a catch 22 for everyone. I don't think there's a way out of it.

667
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,589
Well, the problem is,

668
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,670
is that this is one of those things where your return on money isn't linear.

669
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,150
For example, my Windows 10 machine I spend, you know,

670
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,219
what is it like 100 bucks a year on back blaze?

671
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,599
And I think the files are all pretty much backed up. Back blaze.

672
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,660
Doesn't back up my program files, which I would have liked.

673
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,760
But whatever I can probably recover that machine in the data I want on it.

674
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,640
Same thing with, you know, my macs and icloud, I get,

675
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,260
you know, my photos, my passwords, all that stuff's backed up.

676
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,660
Is it all fully, fully backed up? Well, last time I did a machine restore,

677
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:46,925
I think. So.

678
00:27:47,194 --> 00:27:48,555
I didn't notice anything missing.

679
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:50,285
You got a new phone

680
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:53,614
and you kept messaging me about all the crap that was broken

681
00:27:53,895 --> 00:27:54,484
because I had to

682
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:54,885
log

683
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:58,685
in or I had to, like, you know, poke it with a sharp stick or whatever. Yeah, exactly.

684
00:27:59,364 --> 00:28:01,084
And it's, you know, it's this ongoing thing.

685
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:04,954
So, is there something probably missing from my phone still if I had to bet money?

686
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:06,324
Yeah. But nothing major. Right.

687
00:28:06,714 --> 00:28:07,244
That's fair.

688
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:08,165
And so

689
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:11,885
people don't have time and money for that when they're running a small business.

690
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,310
-- I mean, I would agree completely. Your
-- backup solution for email,

691
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,650
use Gmail or

692
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:17,979
Outlook.

693
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,810
I agree

694
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:22,660
-- completely.
-- You know, same thing with password backups.

695
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,380
No, you just pay last pass or one password or somebody like that.

696
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:30,219
No. Exactly. I think, I think expecting a small business to have

697
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,060
anything resembling

698
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,500
decent. It

699
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,030
is ridiculous. Right. They're not in the IT business.

700
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,280
Oh, what I love is we've figured this out a long time ago for money.

701
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,810
You keep your money in the bank and the bank is in the US. It's FDIC insured

702
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,400
up to, what is it? 250 grand per

703
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,540
even the

704
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,910
bank isn't fully expected to keep it safe. Like they

705
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,550
will probably keep it safe.

706
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,189
But, you know, just in case the federal government will insure it.

707
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:59,290
Well, and funny enough, I would say most banks, most large banks are now it,

708
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,910
companies that also handle money.

709
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,819
Right. They're not money, companies that handle it.

710
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,270
But anyway, no, I, I feel like

711
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,270
if I was a small business owner,

712
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,750
I don't think there's even anything I could reasonably do here.

713
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,920
There is actually a great

714
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,619
example of this.

715
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,010
I've noticed all the new sort of, um,

716
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,900
I don't want to say the hipster run businesses but all the new sort of micro business.

717
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,550
Well, not micro business, but like the new businesses with one location run by,

718
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,390
you know, 2 to 6 kind of younger people under the age of 40. Basically,

719
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,660
all they are generally based on, for example,

720
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,760
is they have a point of sale system that's usually an Android

721
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,069
-- tablet or an apple tablet
-- running square or something

722
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,579
running square running,

723
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:40,459
you know, another application.

724
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,900
They usually have a website which has like, for example,

725
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,579
you click on the product type in your email address

726
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:46,069
and as soon as it comes back in stock,

727
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:46,959
it'll send you an email,

728
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,229
things like that

729
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,869
and they basically don't

730
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,589
have any it to be held to ransomware.

731
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,510
And what little it they do have is like tablets,

732
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,979
I mean, and that's fair.

733
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:57,739
And that,

734
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:00,410
-- that's the solution right there for small business.
-- Right.

735
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,500
You're absolutely right. Get the server out of your closet and just

736
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,699
sass it all

737
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,219
it all mobile devices, not computers.

738
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:10,979
That's probably fair too because once you have computers,

739
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:12,500
-- you start saving things
-- like,

740
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,300
well, not even that but, like, let's face it,

741
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:17,810
I look at my phone and the security stuff,

742
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,540
Apple and even Google are doing for their

743
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,099
phones compared to what's happening on the desktop.

744
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,170
-- That's very true.
-- Right.

745
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:29,150
Like Apple, face, ID, Apple, you know, um, they just, you know, how many,

746
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,020
how many computer,

747
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,709
how many desktop or laptop computers have a fingerprint scanner.

748
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,979
Uh, most of them do now. But I, I understand what you're saying.

749
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:39,329
Well, yeah, actually, you know, Apple actually do.

750
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,510
Yeah, because that's one of the reasons I got the uh, the laptop,

751
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,050
I don't have to keep ping in my password now.

752
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,489
I can just

753
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,579
strip my thumb on it.

754
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,390
But I mean, fundamentally,

755
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,719
I hate to say this, it kind of drives me nuts because I do love computers

756
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,430
and I kind of hate the walled garden that is, you know, most mo mobile devices.

757
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:54,510
But fundamentally

758
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:57,260
if I was running even a large business,

759
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,250
I wouldn't let people

760
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:02,089
use anything but a tablet or a mobile device effectively.

761
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:03,709
And, um, actually we should put this in the show notes,

762
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:06,520
but Laura Shin just did a really good episode on SIM swapping.

763
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,140
She got SIM swapped a few weeks ago.

764
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,650
And the reason was this phone company allowed

765
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:12,930
like people, you know, working at like the phone

766
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,089
kiosk or little mini store at the malls

767
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:15,939
to

768
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,729
essentially have a computer to access some critical

769
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:20,209
stuff and they got fished with a link,

770
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:20,689
blah, blah, blah

771
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,949
and they've moved that now to being tablet

772
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,069
only because the carrier has much more control

773
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,510
-- over the tablet and the security of the tablet than they do over a
-- PC.

774
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,489
That's probably fair.

775
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,920
I mean, I, I,

776
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,439
yeah, that makes sense to me.

777
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:35,670
So I, I hate to say it, but I think the solution is what all the kids are doing, which is

778
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:38,569
-- in the cloud on a mobile device.
-- That's probably fair.

779
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:41,520
I hadn't really thought of it in that way, but II, I do think you're right.

780
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,719
I like it.

781
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:43,900
I dig it.

782
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:46,479
You know what? It's the only problem is

783
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:49,439
you basically have to conform to somebody else's workflow.

784
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,260
I mean,

785
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,760
we kind of have that now.

786
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,099
I mean, if you're running software, even if you build it yourself,

787
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,400
you're not using the most efficient and ideal workflow, right?

788
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,310
You're kind of stuck at, at

789
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,459
the mercy of be it your developers or someone else's developers.

790
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:08,459
I mean,

791
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,890
yeah. Anyway,

792
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,729
cool. All right. No, that makes sense. I like it. All right.

793
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:13,880
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna call it
