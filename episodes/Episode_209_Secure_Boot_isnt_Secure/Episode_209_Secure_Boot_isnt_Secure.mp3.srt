Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:10,550
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,390
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,560
How you doing? Uh,

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,680
better my thumbs mostly.

5
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:18,430
Well, it's not healed but it's healing and it's not in pain, which is pretty awesome.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,700
And, and now that you're old it'll take seven years.

7
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,030
There's still a mark on my knee from, like, two years ago.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,030
Yeah. Nothing ever heals anymore.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,569
Like I just, I accept that when I get hurt, I'm hurt forever now.

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,509
Yeah. Well, kind of like my computer.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,869
I upgraded the boss of my kids' gaming machine last year

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,819
and it was a whole process because, like,

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,869
to get from version F 12 to F 50 there's like a very specific

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,310
set of steps you have to do otherwise you're going to break it.

15
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,490
And so I got to F 50

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,700
which is great because that means in theory I can run

17
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:52,770
like a Ryzen nine something CPU on like the $70 motherboard.

18
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:53,630
Right. Right.

19
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:57,250
The fun part was, you know, how you hit delete to get into the bio settings.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,009
I mean, it depends what the computer,

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,610
but in general you hit delete or F two or F whatever.

22
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,020
Anyway,

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,700
that stopped working.

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,660
Which, you know, whatever. Right.

25
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:09,169
Like, ok, I can get into the bios, whatever the machine still boosts it works. Right.

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,419
I can run games. Did they change the key?

27
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,500
No. So, anyways, I'm like,

28
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,860
who cares? Right. Machine boots is fine.

29
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:21,220
But I wanted to run Docker and can't run darker without hyper or whatever.

30
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,290
Uh, the, the, what is it? Secure virtual machine? SVM.

31
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,709
Last I checked if you want to turn SVM on. You do that? Where the bio?

32
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:31,544
So I'm kind of like, huh? Well,

33
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:34,525
luckily there's like a new bios from like a month ago.

34
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,035
So it's been like eight months with no bio

35
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:36,235
up

36
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:38,724
and then a new one comes out a month ago.

37
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:42,644
Upgrade that and boom, it starts the delete key works again. I can

38
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:43,805
upgrade it

39
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:44,334
without

40
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:44,635
being

41
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:44,944
within

42
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:49,154
-- windows. So you ran their little tool, right?
-- Yeah, I ran their scary little tool.

43
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:52,775
That's like, and now I'm upgrading your bios. Don't turn the computer off.

44
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:54,004
I'm like, nope, not gonna.

45
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:56,480
So, anyways. Yeah. And it works

46
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,900
-- nice
-- well, and

47
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,000
EFI Bios

48
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,029
is a little more forgiving

49
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,470
than the old,

50
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:06,110
old, I don't even know what the old bios was called, but

51
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:07,150
it's

52
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,550
EFI is definitely

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,649
-- harder to break.
-- One thing I noticed that was interesting.

54
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,380
I, I just, I literally got a new machine yesterday and in the boot screen it's like

55
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,440
USB Dis

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,500
you

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:18,800
boo

58
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:19,399
disk

59
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,630
drive,

60
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:20,910
you

61
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:21,779
drive.

62
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,660
Like,

63
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,009
I, I'll be honest, I've been a Mac user for about 67 years now.

64
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,889
With the exception of one gaming PC

65
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,309
never really paid attention. Apparently this u

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,029
is

67
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,259
all over the place now.

68
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:35,929
Yes.

69
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,000
And

70
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:41,839
it works a lot different than we're used to, which is kind of cool.

71
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,190
And, and I would view it as more of a, an operating system than a bio.

72
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:48,479
It's got a graphical user interface.

73
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,789
-- Yeah, I, I have a mouse, like
-- my new motherboard

74
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:52,949
has a bios

75
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,160
where you go in

76
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,259
and it's got a motherboard explorer and I'm like, what's that?

77
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,800
And you click on it and it shows you a

78
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:02,220
graphical image of your motherboard and it tells you which slots

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,949
-- and connectors are in use.
-- Mine has little spinning fans

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,550
with like for the fans that spin, it's, it's completely used

81
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:14,246
this but I chuckle every time I look at it.

82
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:15,376
-- Well, like
-- I was like, wait,

83
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:18,886
you know what's in this fan is plugged into this fan header.

84
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:20,055
Why wouldn't it?

85
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,746
Well, but, or like, for example,

86
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:25,675
it knows that the USB ports on the front are hooked up again.

87
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:28,455
-- Why wouldn't it know that?
-- Well, I know.

88
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:31,576
But dude, like I'm old and like, I'm used to computers where it's like you plug,

89
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:32,996
you put it together and it's like it

90
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,022
doesn't work and then you start shuffling stuff around

91
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,542
and like by the seventh or eighth attempt you

92
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:37,861
get some good boots and then you're just,

93
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,082
like, never touch it again.

94
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:41,401
-- Yeah,
-- it's a little different than it used to be for

95
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:42,001
sure.

96
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:45,082
I mean, clearly there's an operating system in there because it also,

97
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,171
this new computer has a, a

98
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:51,962
USB port on the back labeled flash update and so apparent, like I,

99
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:56,992
I stuck a USB drive in there with the flash, uh, the image of the bios update on there

100
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,860
and from within the bios it's like, oh, look,

101
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:02,610
there's a USB drive with the new thing on.

102
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:03,360
That's neat.

103
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,779
Well, but there's also a switch on the back that says bios

104
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:10,360
update. And I'm like, do I just plug this thing in and hold that switch down?

105
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,520
Like that scares me because I'm like,

106
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,358
bios updates. Scary computer. Brick computer go away. No, no work anymore. Yeah.

107
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:19,790
It's, it's nothing like it used to be, man. Yeah,

108
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:22,264
I paid for the product replacement plan on the

109
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,093
monitor in case I drop it or something stupid.

110
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:26,644
But I didn't on the computer because I'm like, ah, computers, whatever. Right.

111
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:28,813
-- They never break.
-- Are they going to cover the bio

112
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:31,834
-- if you, if you
-- break it, if I break it? I don't know.

113
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:36,003
I don't want to find out the main thing. I get the IP P on the monitors.

114
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:39,164
Like, if there's a dead pixel, otherwise it's the manufacturer's warranty,

115
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:41,273
which is like, unless it's on fire

116
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,044
too bad.

117
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:44,243
Well, and this has become my

118
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:48,380
kind of strategy. I have for televisions in my house is

119
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,760
-- Costco has a warranty program.
-- Remember when you refuse to shop at Costco?

120
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,820
And I was like, you should shop there because they're awesome.

121
00:04:56,059 --> 00:05:00,510
Yeah. But you're still a bit more zealous about it than I prefer.

122
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,209
But the point is

123
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,619
they have a five year warranty program and I realized that all of the TV si bought,

124
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,915
I'm on probably my third or flat screen now and they all last three years.

125
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,755
So Costco has a five year warranty where for like,

126
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:18,545
I think 30 bucks because I always buy the cheap tvs for like, 30 bucks.

127
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:19,614
I get a five year warranty.

128
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,454
And I'm like, well, this is a no freaking brainer right here. Right.

129
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:24,765
Like, I'm going to get a free TV in three years.

130
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,325
Well, when you, when you think about a TV,

131
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,954
if you pay a dollar a day advertised over three years, that's $1000 TV.

132
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:31,714
They're basically disposable at this point.

133
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:33,195
-- Yeah,
-- I pay way less than that.

134
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,100
I'm a cheap skate and I don't care.

135
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,149
-- And
-- so even 50 cents a day.

136
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,290
But the point is like, when I was a kid, my parents bought some Sony TV.

137
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:44,739
-- And it was a big deal.
-- I remember the TV repair man coming to our house,

138
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,829
like a person

139
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,769
opened the TV

140
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,799
-- and worked on it with tools. Like,
-- at

141
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,290
this point I'm like, uh, monitors, acting, sketchy.

142
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,170
-- Yeah. Buy a new one.
-- Well, let's face it I have a warranty on this TV. If it breaks.

143
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:03,049
Do you think anyone's going to ask for anything?

144
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,760
-- No, they're just going to give me a new TV.
-- Well, and that's what I love.

145
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,720
Like, the place I buy from has a product replacement plan where they're like,

146
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:13,019
essentially, it also guarantees if your thing breaks and they can't replace, like,

147
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,190
say the motherboard with the comparable thing.

148
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,290
They're just like, ah, whatever,

149
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,910
we'll give you a newer motherboard with a newer CPU and like

150
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,709
newer RA M and like all that stuff because quite frankly,

151
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,239
I mean, you know, you do the math on these things.

152
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,119
Like, how often do computers

153
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:26,855
actually physically feel short of pouring pop in there?

154
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:28,595
Right. It's pretty rare. Anyway,

155
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:32,445
we're at Holy, we're going to talk about boot hole today.

156
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:33,285
What's that?

157
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,964
It's a hole in my boot actually. See, you know what's funny?

158
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,475
Yeah, it's like five CV S or something.

159
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,970
So, I,

160
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,390
I did some Google searching on the term boot hole

161
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,130
and,

162
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:45,660
uh,

163
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,190
-- did you use Google Safe Search?
-- I

164
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,519
do not ever have that turned on, but I did not get any non

165
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:55,290
safeer work results, at least in what I looked at, but like, in all seriousness,

166
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,089
fixing actual footwear,

167
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:00,440
what made up a surprising number of the search results.

168
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:01,730
So, I would say

169
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,119
in

170
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,859
terms of what were you thinking of? I don't want to know,

171
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,410
but

172
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:07,070
in terms of,

173
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,709
in terms of naming things,

174
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,809
this is, I think an exceptionally

175
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,519
poorly chosen name

176
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,790
because if I'm getting footwear, when I search for your security flaw,

177
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,420
I'm getting downtown shoe repair.

178
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:20,910
Sherwood Park, shoe repair master. Sorry.

179
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,899
Oh, Mr Safety Shoes, which is honestly a great place to buy safety shoes.

180
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,519
You can't go wrong with safety shoes.

181
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,679
II,

182
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,230
I have owned several extremely high quality pairs of

183
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,369
them in my life and they are worth every penny

184
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:35,966
gumb boots are CS A approved blah, blah, not cloud security lines,

185
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:39,355
but actually Canadian Standard Association approved and they are like,

186
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:40,735
they're felt lined.

187
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:44,605
They're acid proof like they are the nicest gumb boots I've ever owned.

188
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,665
But anyway, anyway,

189
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:48,455
so I thought it would be worth talking about

190
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:51,876
boot hole for two important reasons is number one,

191
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:55,855
I have an enormous amount of knowledge about secure boot

192
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,085
because when secure

193
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,552
boot was making its way into Linux,

194
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:03,842
I was more involved than I wanted to be in a lot of ways.

195
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:07,372
And that was, uh, Matthew Garrett did a ton of the work way back in the day

196
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:11,391
and now what Peter Jones does most of it for like fedora and friends.

197
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:14,231
So it's, it's definitely a wild ride. But then also

198
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,071
this security flaw

199
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,832
is dumb

200
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,601
and I want to talk about why that is,

201
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:23,261
I'll be honest. Have we seen many security flaws that are not dumb?

202
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,420
No, like really

203
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,299
like this whole Twitter thing. Everyone was like Twitter Nation State. No.

204
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,440
Turns out a bored 17 year old in Florida.

205
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:32,380
Good for him.

206
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,760
Let me, ok, let me kind of rephrase this because I think there,

207
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,539
there have been security flaws that

208
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,739
are interesting and could matter.

209
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,929
But this particular security flaw,

210
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,260
I would argue is probably not really a security flaw

211
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,059
in most sense of the word.

212
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,679
And there's some important reasons for that because of how

213
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,390
secure boot has to work and it's hilarious and sad.

214
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:55,159
So, ok, first, so here's the thing. So like my understanding of bios

215
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,469
in general is

216
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,250
I need to go talk to the hard drive just enough to get some operating system.

217
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,979
Because for example, like I was showing my son, I took a USB drive installed free

218
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:07,190
Os on it and then put the, the bios flashing utility and bios

219
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,049
image on it.

220
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:11,000
And I was showing my son this like last year when I was going through

221
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,710
that whole update process on his gaming PC and like it blew his mind because,

222
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:18,510
well, in fairness, he's nine years old, he's never seen a non gooey computer.

223
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,809
So, you know, it's funny you say that I've been running Linux for so long.

224
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,590
Like my kids think that's normal.

225
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:30,469
They, they, those poor kids, they have no idea what, what like normal people do.

226
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,070
Oh,

227
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,849
to be normal again

228
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,200
again.

229
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,840
-- Well,
-- when

230
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:35,859
I

231
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:38,229
-- was seven, whatever,
-- I refuse to believe that

232
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,280
anyway. Ok, so, so please explain. So first of all, is boot

233
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,559
hole a vulnerability or multiple vulnerable.

234
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,380
So, well, there's

235
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,320
all right.

236
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,429
Let's do this.

237
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,710
-- I want to start with secure boot and how it works.
-- Secure boots. Simple. Right.

238
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,909
Because if I boot the computer securely,

239
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,890
I will never be in an insecure state and I will be always secure

240
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,419
nonsense. All right.

241
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:02,539
So,

242
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:05,169
what we'll do is let's explain secure boot

243
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,539
and then we'll steer ourselves into oncoming traffic.

244
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,210
Ok? Because that's, that's what we should do.

245
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,679
So I'm going to start with the disclaimer

246
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,630
of that.

247
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm like 90% sure of everything I'm going to talk about,

248
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,400
but I might get some things wrong.

249
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,559
And if I do, you're welcome to shame me publicly and please do

250
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:22,059
well, in fairness,

251
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,219
the people who apparently wrote all these boot loaders were also wrong.

252
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,039
They're, they're not wrong. They actually so, ok,

253
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,260
this is where I want to start

254
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,119
is secure boot isn't about security is the first thing we have to set down.

255
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:40,140
So here's how this works. You have obviously your, your UV Bios

256
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:47,570
has keys embedded in it by the manufacturer. So the idea is we will only boot

257
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:51,510
things that have been signed by someone we trust, right?

258
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:52,809
Because I mean, that's,

259
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:54,609
that's standard. Ok.

260
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,659
So the way this was done though is basically,

261
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:01,760
it was decided that Microsoft was going to be the keeper of the keys.

262
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,640
And this was the

263
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:08,190
sort of not nice Microsoft, I would say they were on their,

264
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,500
their recovery plan at this point.

265
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,219
So most of us were like, I don't know about that.

266
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:16,099
No, I remember those days where it's like, oh, they're gonna kill Linux. Great.

267
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,690
Well, but, and, yeah,

268
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,070
so here's what

269
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:19,320
I,

270
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,409
I think they did it just so people couldn't say that.

271
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,330
But, and, and here's the thing running AC A is really hard, like, really, really,

272
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,049
really hard.

273
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,630
-- No,
-- no, no. Running AC, a

274
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,609
properly

275
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,619
running AC A is

276
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:31,969
easy.

277
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,390
And

278
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:35,770
yes, that's true. I could start AC A tonight

279
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:36,690
and

280
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:37,840
it would make us all.

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,609
So Microsoft is kind of in charge of this. And so the way it works is there's two

282
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,630
keys,

283
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,150
there's the key for windows

284
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:51,200
and then there's the key for everything else.

285
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:52,169
And

286
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,489
you can imagine

287
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,809
why they did this, right? Because obviously, let's say you have a,

288
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:02,380
a surface pro maybe or I don't even know if surface does this, but

289
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,159
you could have a device that you could only put one key on if you wanted and

290
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:09,630
then say you could only boot windows and there's no way to boot the other stuff.

291
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,690
My current motherboard basically will only boot windows 10

292
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,159
in theory it can boot other things. But from my quick look at the

293
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,380
docks on that

294
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:24,900
you can, you can probably just turn it off too where you can shut off.

295
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,169
But anyway, ok.

296
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:28,479
No, I'm not gonna let you do this to us. You're not, we're not doing it.

297
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:29,549
We're not doing it. I'm keeping us on

298
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:29,820
track,

299
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,330
keep

300
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,049
us on track

301
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:32,250
it.

302
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,460
So, so

303
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,330
what we're going to do now is you've got the second key

304
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,270
and the way it works is you have to submit code to

305
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,109
Microsoft and basically say here is the code I want to boot.

306
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,190
Will you please sign it?

307
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,590
So when you say the code to boot,

308
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,109
-- you mean like the bootloader or the whole
-- thing or the binary?

309
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,150
Basically this is the,

310
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:50,184
the UV

311
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:54,815
-- bio starts.
-- OK. So this is like the low level bootloader. Yeah. Right. OK.

312
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:57,614
-- It's not like the whole Os or anything.
-- No, it's not the Os.

313
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,984
It would be, it'd be like Grub but,

314
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:01,265
but, but,

315
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:02,015
but

316
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:04,034
Microsoft won't sign GP L code

317
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:09,075
-- and guess what license grub has?
-- That seems like a bit of a challenge.

318
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:13,885
No, no, because GP L three specifically accounts for this instance

319
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:16,169
where you have to release the keys.

320
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,219
Yeah. What was that called? The Netflix or something?

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,070
Uh

322
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,070
No, the, the tivo

323
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:24,979
is tivo still a thing.

324
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:25,929
I don't know.

325
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,570
We'll look it up later.

326
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:29,729
So anyway, so what are we going to do?

327
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,109
So what we did in the Linux world is we created this, this boot utility called Shim.

328
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,650
And all Shim is designed to do

329
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,369
is get a signature from Microsoft and then load Grub,

330
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:42,400
right.

331
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:43,489
-- That's literally,
-- it's

332
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:43,700
like

333
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,219
a

334
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:46,219
Exactly.

335
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,159
Exactly.

336
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,710
So,

337
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,940
but it's a little more complicated than that because obviously

338
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,940
you can't just have shim

339
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,159
loading, unsigned, whatever.

340
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,349
I'm guessing Microsoft would be onto that

341
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,599
-- if that was the case.
-- They, they probably wouldn't sign your stuff.

342
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:02,609
They'd say don't, don't do this. We don't like it.

343
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:03,039
So, anyway,

344
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:08,229
so what happens is basically shim is signed by Microsoft and then inside of shim

345
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,609
is another key

346
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,710
that

347
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:13,479
is everything else is signed with things like the

348
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:16,909
kernel and grub and even kernel device drivers.

349
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,969
And so what happens is basically

350
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,219
EFI

351
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,090
boots, shim

352
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,309
shim loads the new key

353
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,820
and then it checks Grub.

354
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,219
-- So it's transitive trust.
-- Right. Yeah, basically. Right. Right.

355
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:31,119
Loads. Grub. Grub

356
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:34,609
does its magic. Grub makes sure the kernel is correct.

357
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:38,710
-- Grub boots the kernel and then we're off to the races. Ok?
-- And stupid question.

358
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:43,099
But just to be clear, this really only matters on actual hardware like

359
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,020
-- or whatever, like who cares?
-- I think they have like fake secure boot on the limbs now.

360
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:53,059
But it, it, yeah, whatever. I mean, the idea here is the intent was

361
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:54,549
you couldn't

362
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,669
-- run unsigned
-- code,

363
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,630
you couldn't subvert the boot process

364
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,289
and, and like for example, the bios is signed. So the bios

365
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:06,109
can't be backdoor in theory, which

366
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,510
there's some stories

367
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:11,489
don't Google Intel management engine CV,

368
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,239
whatever,

369
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,150
everything's fine.

370
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,599
So, but here's the thing, right? So here's the thing.

371
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,070
So you have this

372
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,419
chain of trust in your boot kind of system, right?

373
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,929
So you end up

374
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,390
going from the kernel to running the Init RD,

375
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:32,419
which is basically where like a kit lives and all the things that you need to, like,

376
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,950
you know, pull the system up by its bootstraps.

377
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,989
-- As we used to say,
-- this is the one where you went in, it equals B A bash. And then, like, I

378
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,929
remember somebody was like, this computer is secure and I'm like,

379
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,030
in it equals B bash.

380
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,359
That's right. That's right. But make sure you sink before you reboot.

381
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,809
Right. Anyway,

382
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,719
so,

383
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:52,549
anyway, anyway,

384
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,539
so the thing is though, so you can have a trusted boot chain.

385
00:15:58,299 --> 00:15:58,309
A

386
00:15:58,539 --> 00:15:59,280
IRD

387
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,710
is generally unsigned because the

388
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,909
IRD is generated on the fly.

389
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:08,000
Like, like it depends on what your system is because the,

390
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:08,679
the

391
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:12,320
I don't even, is it when you update grub, I guess, or the kernel or whatever,

392
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,880
whenever you update these things on a lyric system,

393
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,880
what happens is it'll look at your system and be like, all right,

394
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,650
here's the hardware.

395
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:18,320
I see.

396
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,530
Let's throw some device drivers in here, like, you know,

397
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:23,270
let's shake it up and then we're gonna turn it into

398
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,979
an RD and that's how we're going to boot the system.

399
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:28,929
And so that can't be signed because obviously,

400
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,780
if you have the key to sign things on your local system, you basically invalidate

401
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,960
the entire concept of all this.

402
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:37,520
Here's where

403
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,690
it gets kind of funny, right? Because if I'm an attacker,

404
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:45,020
all I have to do is mess with in NRD and I'm basically home free. Right.

405
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:48,460
And IRD is rarely encrypted because a

406
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,309
IRD

407
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,130
is where you would give a password, for example, to decrypt your disk.

408
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:53,760
And

409
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:55,340
Ird by definition

410
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:58,409
has an enormous amount of control. And if I'm an attacker,

411
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,580
that's what I'm going to go after. Right.

412
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:02,650
Like I get that init

413
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,250
RD is sort of Diam Aly created.

414
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,979
But wouldn't it generally be the same across similar, say,

415
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:10,810
laptops or servers or systems?

416
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,569
-- I mean, it, it kind of, it could be or is it
-- just that there's enough

417
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,969
weird stuff out there that who cares? Right.

418
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:20,108
-- Like, well,
-- to keep it small, they only put what they need in it.

419
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,400
So like if you're running an intel CPU,

420
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,150
it's going to look a lot different than if you're running an AMD CPU.

421
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:30,469
-- The
-- flash storage on my current motherboard for the Bios is 256 megabytes.

422
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,550
And I'm like, that's bigger than my first six computers,

423
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,900
right? No, like really?

424
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:36,569
That's,

425
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,329
-- I was trying to explain to my son why this blew my mind.
-- Go

426
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:40,420
take up a lot of space.

427
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,910
So anyway, anyway, OK, here's where we're going to turn ourselves into traffic now.

428
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,300
OK.

429
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,060
So

430
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,380
Moot hole

431
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,540
is fundamentally

432
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,020
a security flaw

433
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:54,290
in Grub where you can cause a buffer overflow

434
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,900
and then make Grub execute arbitrary code.

435
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,369
You mean Grub or Grub two because everything says Grub, whatever,

436
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,790
they're all the same Grub two

437
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:07,469
when I say Grub, I mean Grub two. OK. That's true. Of from now until I'm dead.

438
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:10,880
-- No one says Grub
-- two. That's like me and IP config or if

439
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,150
config on Linux.

440
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,380
That's right. That's right. So anyway,

441
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,630
the idea is

442
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,925
if you have the ability to access a system

443
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:22,114
and you can modify the grub configuration file,

444
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:25,744
you could basically introduce a buffer overflow flaw

445
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,275
and then make grub execute whatever code you want.

446
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:34,234
Oh, so basically it turns from I have roots and I can edit this file to.

447
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,119
Well,

448
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,410
now I've subverted the boot process and I control the vertical and the horizontal.

449
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,560
-- But
-- you already have that with a KRD,

450
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,800
-- right?
-- But,

451
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,189
but it

452
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,709
-- doesn't
-- give you anything

453
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,380
new

454
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,930
-- but you have it on reboot.
-- Yeah, you'll have it on reboot.

455
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:53,310
If you monkey with a KRD, as soon as you reboot, you're home free again.

456
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:56,910
And so here's the thing, right? Like this is cool research

457
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,859
and I think there's value in it.

458
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,079
I'm not going to say there isn't,

459
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,290
but I'm saying from the practicality standpoint of an attack,

460
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:06,829
this has no practical impact that doesn't already exist

461
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:09,319
to an attacker with local access to the system.

462
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,930
Well, local privileged access like because to be clear, like I'm just reading this,

463
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,780
if you can edit Grub config, that's bad.

464
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,079
If you

465
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:19,385
edit Grub config

466
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,964
you can, you can insert a new init RD.

467
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:26,084
-- That's
-- like saying you have access to the bathroom

468
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:31,314
off of my bedroom. Yeah. No, that's bad. Like yeah, like

469
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,324
you know, here's the thing, right.

470
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:37,765
You already have access to that because of an nrd my complaint here

471
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:42,165
is that just given the way the current Linux boot systems are architected,

472
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,979
this doesn't give you anything you didn't already have.

473
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,260
-- Yeah.
-- As I understand it.

474
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,479
That sounds, I mean, it would be one more place you'd have to look and hunt,

475
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,780
but in general.

476
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,140
Yeah. No. Yeah. Like

477
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,739
you've got root level access to the system

478
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:58,619
-- reproducibly after boot.
-- Yeah.

479
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,640
Right. Right. Right.

480
00:19:59,650 --> 00:19:59,819
And,

481
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:02,650
and then now the researchers also found like

482
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,719
a crap load of other plausible security flaws

483
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,280
in, in various stages of the boot.

484
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:12,010
-- And so, like I get that, that's cool. That, that's a great thing.
-- Well, again,

485
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:18,119
we should have good quality code, not one to a whole pile of energy overflows

486
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,380
because,

487
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,380
and, and, but here's the thing too is the grub

488
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,979
configuration file has historically been treated as a trusted resource.

489
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,400
And so it doesn't get the level of

490
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:30,670
exactly,

491
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:31,900
it's your crow

492
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,300
config file. Like,

493
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,699
yeah, I mean, I would agree with that.

494
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:39,530
-- I feel like this is one of those situations
-- it's owned by route.

495
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,619
Like if your personal file owned only by route

496
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:45,180
that if you muck up your system stops booting.

497
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,619
-- Yeah,
-- if you're going to attack it,

498
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:53,400
you've got local access to the system and if someone has local access to your system,

499
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,109
there's so much wrong that can happen at that point that it's, it's not even funny.

500
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,599
And like this is a place actually where things like chromebooks, for example,

501
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,209
do some clever things because chromebooks are,

502
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,150
are heavily protected basically from start to finish

503
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,479
in terms of what they boot and how they work.

504
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,260
So,

505
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:10,969
and, and like,

506
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:14,359
look that was always kind of the intent of secure boot

507
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:17,000
is that you would have a way to go from the fi

508
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,290
buy

509
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:18,660
all the way

510
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:21,380
to running, let's say a web browser

511
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,270
and you can, you can trace back the signatures all the way

512
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,290
to the bios, right? And obviously,

513
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:29,180
that's not how it worked out and,

514
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:32,380
and this isn't exactly the right kind of technology to do this.

515
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,910
So, so now here's,

516
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,780
here's the rest of the story. OK?

517
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:39,750
So Microsoft has obviously acknowledged this is a problem.

518
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,099
It's only a problem for the secondary key.

519
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,459
And so what they have to do now

520
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,780
is they have a choice.

521
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:46,939
They can

522
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:51,310
basically push out like an update that there's a black list

523
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,000
in the

524
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:52,989
bios

525
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,010
that says do not boot these things,

526
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,689
right? Is that why I have 256 megabytes of storage on my motherboard?

527
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,729
Well, here's that.

528
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,209
No, no, here's where it gets good.

529
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,390
I don't remember the number,

530
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,540
but it's something like it can hold a couple 100 entries max,

531
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,569
right? And you can imagine

532
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:15,010
how many versions of Shim and Grub two

533
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,905
have signatures out there in the wild.

534
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:21,425
I bet the number is in the thousands

535
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:24,055
so they literally can't blacklist.

536
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:30,864
-- Everything that actually needs to be blacklisted.
-- Grub two was released in 1995.

537
00:22:31,135 --> 00:22:35,005
Yeah, but it, it just started getting signed maybe five years ago, maybe.

538
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:37,645
OK. True. But still that's a

539
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:38,655
lot.

540
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:41,515
You don't have to invalidate like every single grub you basically

541
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:43,834
it's only shim remember Shim is all that gets signed.

542
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,449
So you'd have to invalidate every version of sh I ever released

543
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:50,400
and well every signed version because you have to remember too,

544
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,579
like Red Hat builds and signs, Shim,

545
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:54,890
the Dora builds and sign Shim

546
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,339
Tu builds and signed Shim, right? So like literally every Linux

547
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:01,260
distribution has their own variant of Shim

548
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,469
that is different even though it could be the

549
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,579
same version when you run two things through.

550
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:06,280
You know what I mean?

551
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,000
-- Debian
-- and ubuntu, right? Like

552
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,880
-- they're totally different except they're totally kind
-- of,

553
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,709
-- but it doesn't matter because if you build,
-- oh yeah, you'll be off by one bite, at

554
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,260
-- least with
-- dates and stuff, right? Like it.

555
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,869
Yes,

556
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:20,109
it will never be the same.

557
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:24,880
And so so there are my guess Microsoft actually knows because they've signed

558
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,719
all of these and I'm sure they have a very impressive audit trail.

559
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:31,469
But my suspicion is there are more signed versions of Shim

560
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,469
in the wild. Then there is space in the blacklist table

561
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,979
-- for the
-- bias.

562
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:39,589
Well, I mean, you know, like with web browsers,

563
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,989
all those revocation protocols worked so well that whenever there's a major

564
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,750
incident, we push out a browser update.

565
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,599
Right.

566
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,140
-- Well, and, and here is my suspicion, totally
-- valid technology.

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,589
Is anyone who looks at this, who knows what's going on?

568
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,089
They're going to come to the same conclusion we just discussed where

569
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:03,109
this functionally doesn't really change the threat profile of a system.

570
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,150
So if I was Microsoft, I wouldn't do squat here.

571
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,109
If, if people really whine and complain,

572
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,660
I would maybe like, symbolically blacklist a couple shin versions.

573
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,030
-- But
-- you could quasi

574
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,599
argue

575
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:18,319
that like a super sophisticated attacker might use this. But like,

576
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:19,839
so what?

577
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,219
Don't.

578
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:23,270
Exactly. Exactly. So who cares? Don't

579
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:23,869
an

580
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:27,479
RD? Yeah, exactly. So like it just doesn't matter.

581
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,239
So

582
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,310
I like to be blunt. Like

583
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,189
I remember when I got my first mac and I learned

584
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,979
about the whole open boot firmware thing and it was like,

585
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:36,369
what was it?

586
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,739
Windows or it's command key R when you boot it and it, like

587
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,739
there's no way to secure it.

588
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,300
But I'm used to like PC Bios where in theory you can attach an A MIN password.

589
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,930
Oh, I see what you're saying.

590
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:49,680
You h command.

591
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,479
Are you

592
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,449
game over?

593
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,199
Well, OK. So actually funny you say that

594
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,969
we have a bunch of corporate macs

595
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,670
in at

596
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,599
elastic

597
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:02,069
and there's this management software called Jam

598
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,569
J AM F

599
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:06,729
that we use and that apples like Apple and Jam

600
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:09,010
do stuff together. So it's kind of magic.

601
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,930
But basically what happens is So, II,

602
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,369
I have a Mac I use for testing.

603
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:14,439
And

604
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:15,319
II,

605
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,520
I had to, I forget what I did. I broke something, I break things all the time. Right.

606
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,189
Like, it's just,

607
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,349
this is what I do. I break computers.

608
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,750
-- So I did the command our thing and
-- we've, they somehow locked it down.

609
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,030
Well, well, ok, so, like, I don't know,

610
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,500
every couple of months I have to wipe this thing.

611
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,369
I do the control arm magic to wipe it

612
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:32,709
and it basically

613
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,989
auto puts on, like, all the elastic stuff automatically. Like, I can't not do it.

614
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,520
I, I even, I was like, ah, this might get in my way. Can I turn this off?

615
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,020
Like, nope, it's there and there's nothing I can do about it.

616
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,619
Yeah. Yeah. And, like, whatever, I'll live with it. But, yeah. Yeah.

617
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,790
So there's like some magic going on there between Apple and Jam

618
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:50,880
and, and Alaska

619
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,079
obviously that

620
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:52,989
well, but that's the thing.

621
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,170
I mean, Apple's Apple, there's all kinds of magic and whatever. Right?

622
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,530
Like, it's not the windows in Linux world. Linux world, you know, it's the wild west.

623
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,859
It's like you walk into the saloon. It's like,

624
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,890
you know, I want

625
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:05,079
a

626
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,920
-- Sasa a camel and 17 tacos
-- and you might not even get there because

627
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,040
you might open the door and just someone shoots you and you're like,

628
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,089
oh, well, I'm dead now.

629
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,869
-- So that was neat.
-- Or open the door and it's like, it's magic. Oh, man.

630
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,910
I love it so much.

631
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,229
Yeah,

632
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,430
I do enjoy Linux. Like, you know what?

633
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:25,390
I especially enjoy, I enjoy Linux on the Raspberry Pi stuff

634
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,910
because it's just

635
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:31,500
physically, it's such a wonderfully small but full featured computer,

636
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,550
you know, and actually the new P

637
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:38,719
-- fours you can now boot directly off of USB, which is very cool,
-- even better. The new P

638
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,430
fours you can get with eight gigs of ra M.

639
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,020
Yeah,

640
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:44,859
it blows my mind because you can buy like proper machines that started aching

641
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:45,310
around.

642
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:50,069
Right? Actually, I have a pie four in my basement is my file server now

643
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:54,180
because my old file server was dying. And I'm like, well, this is 100 bucks.

644
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:55,349
I might as well just get this

645
00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:55,800
well.

646
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,349
And you know what I was like, oh, sometimes I have to interact with my pie four and

647
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,359
I should get a screen for it. You know what?

648
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:06,959
The cheapest option was a $45 Canadian touch screen that like bolts onto it.

649
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:08,439
Yeah, I've got some of that. I have

650
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:08,670
a

651
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,119
couple of those actually in the house and I love it. They're awesome.

652
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,430
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's cool.

653
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:14,160
Yeah.

654
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,760
So secure boot, like, well, to me,

655
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,099
the whole secure boot thing keeps coming back to like if I control

656
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:23,430
this like chain of events from like the start of the universe,

657
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,189
the big bang

658
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,209
to now

659
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,449
I will be secure.

660
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,939
Really? That's what secure

661
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,619
boot was kind of, if you want to listen to the security side of it,

662
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,400
that's what it was about.

663
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,510
-- Right. I mean, that's the idea but the reality is,
-- who cares?

664
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,390
Well,

665
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,189
I mean, somebody's gonna pop your PHP out.

666
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,609
Let's reframe this correctly because

667
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,569
that was never the intent.

668
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:46,170
I think the intent of this was always about like the tablet ecosystem.

669
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:50,910
-- I thought it was more dod back in the day.
-- No, no, no, no dod uses TP MS.

670
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,869
Dod doesn't use it.

671
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,349
Secure boot is stupid. It doesn't work in that way.

672
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,280
So the thing because and also TPM have clocks built into them.

673
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:00,099
There's no way to have a clock.

674
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:02,040
So like one of the challenges could be, let's say you,

675
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,709
let's say you have a binary that's signed and it has a

676
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:08,479
date that like the key dies just set the system clock back.

677
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:13,130
The keyboard doesn't know right TPM have clocks. This is why they have clocks.

678
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,359
But anyway, anyway, so the thing was, I don't, it was never really about security.

679
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:20,920
It was about controlling hardware for things like tablet

680
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:22,005
and laptops.

681
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:24,925
That's what this technology has always been about.

682
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:30,474
And I mean, this was, this is why the open source universe found it so distasteful.

683
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:35,194
Well, I remember also trying to get it working was like, oh God, I just,

684
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:38,444
I ended up literally disabling uafl on every computer

685
00:28:38,454 --> 00:28:41,234
I ever had up until these last two windows,

686
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:42,064
10 gaming machines.

687
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:45,125
No it did. I turned mine on everything broke.

688
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:45,505
Yeah.

689
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:45,864
Yeah. Yeah.

690
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:47,165
Oh yeah, I remember.

691
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,130
But ok,

692
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,209
so here's the other half of this now and this

693
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:52,089
is where we're going to give a little history lesson.

694
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,589
It's kind of the wrap up is

695
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,729
when secure boot came out was also around the Windows eight timeframe.

696
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:00,260
And this was also when,

697
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,589
if you remember like remember when Steam was

698
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,910
basically creating their own Linux operating system,

699
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,510
this is all together at the same,

700
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,219
same big pot is the fear was Microsoft was gonna finally say, give me my ball,

701
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:16,750
I'm going home and they were gonna lock everyone

702
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,589
out of everything and everything was going to be signed

703
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,040
and things like Steam were gonna be doomed and

704
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,430
you work to build a boot Linux on your computer

705
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:25,630
and like, it was,

706
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,119
it's funny to talk about this now,

707
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,300
but like this was a legitimate and serious concern back in that time.

708
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:36,660
-- But
-- I mean, dude, the Halloween memos from Microsoft 20 years ago were like,

709
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,839
you know, Linux is a cancer blah, blah, blah. And now they're like,

710
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:44,699
they're like, like literally, I open up the Microsoft store and I type in ssh

711
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,640
and it's like

712
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,430
you should install ubuntu right on your Windows machine.

713
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,339
And, and yeah, they own, they bought github

714
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:52,800
and,

715
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,829
and the best part is you go to Microsoft

716
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,119
maker code to like write your little arcade game

717
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,339
which my son was doing for part of a summer camp and it's got to push the github

718
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:00,989
button.

719
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:04,670
Oh, that's neat. That, that must be new. I didn't see that last time. I ran it.

720
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,780
Yeah, it's got to push this to github button.

721
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,030
So I'm, of course, I clicked it and it's like you don't have a github

722
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:09,869
account. And I'm like,

723
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:10,199
so

724
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,589
you're 13 now,

725
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,229
click,

726
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:13,560
get in on that,

727
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:14,619
man.

728
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:15,750
My son has a github

729
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,520
account. So,

730
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,170
how

731
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:19,569
old are you? Oh,

732
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,380
I got you. I

733
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:20,890
got you.

734
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:26,204
It's like steam today. I'm like setting up steam. I'm like Felix. You're 13. Just

735
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:26,604
go

736
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:26,935
with it.

737
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,324
That's right. That's right.

738
00:30:28,464 --> 00:30:31,084
-- Anyway, anyway, but yeah,
-- I mean, yeah, no,

739
00:30:31,094 --> 00:30:34,045
like Microsoft clearly understands now that like

740
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:38,755
there's these infinitely large pies. If we play with open source,

741
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:42,344
I just bought a New Windows 10 machine yesterday. Like,

742
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:44,814
and I like it because I've got, I've got a

743
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:49,525
better Linux experience on this thing so far than I've ever had with Linux.

744
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,839
Oh, whatever. That's a lie. It's, it's better than your Mac. I'll give you that.

745
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:54,640
But it's

746
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,359
the sound works. It's not better than Linux

747
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,880
and it's better than Linux.

748
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,640
And the like,

749
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:00,170
no

750
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:00,479
sound

751
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,219
works better

752
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:01,420
than

753
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:02,680
-- the
-- video drivers.

754
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:03,680
That too. No.

755
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,479
So actually in all seriousness,

756
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,439
I had this discussion with my son the other day she was talking about, oh,

757
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,550
like if I bought a, build a computer, I want to put an nvidia card in.

758
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,640
What would you put in and I said

759
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,530
I'd buy a D's hardware and the reason isn't even

760
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,920
because it's better or cheaper or anything like that,

761
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,790
you get drivers.

762
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,020
Right. It works on Linux

763
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,520
and even if I wasn't going to use Linux with it, like I want to support that.

764
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,979
So I would still give them my money.

765
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,579
Ok. So, anyway, anyway, it is time to end this and I guess

766
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,260
here is what I will say about boot hole and I think

767
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,099
this is what I say about a lot of security issues is,

768
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:40,119
-- yeah, who cares
-- pretty much? Yeah, that's all.

769
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,420
Well,

770
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,920
more to the point who's actually booting an operating

771
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,839
system on hardware that they then use natively?

772
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:47,900
I do every day on my laptop.

773
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:48,719
Ok.

774
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,680
But I'm talking about people who, like, care about boot hole

775
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:55,199
probably. Right. Like, aren't you using VMWARE or something?

776
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,400
Well, in that, I mean, that's a funny thing. Right.

777
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,170
Because if you actually care about security you're going to run t,

778
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:03,076
if you don't really care about security, you're stuck with secure boot.

779
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:03,855
Well, like,

780
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:06,755
literally the only server I have and have had for

781
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:09,406
the last five or six years is a Raspberry pi,

782
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:11,005
everything else is in the cloud.

783
00:32:11,215 --> 00:32:13,706
-- It's not my problem.
-- Right. Yeah. No, I agree.

784
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:16,855
I think it's a changing environment, but now at the same time, at the same time,

785
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:17,975
I don't want to bash

786
00:32:18,255 --> 00:32:22,255
the researchers who did this work because this is cool work it's a great find

787
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:27,472
and I think from a, a purely scientific perspective, this was awesome.

788
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:31,791
Well done guys. But I think from a practicality standpoint, did it deserve a name?

789
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:36,511
-- Probably not. I think that's true
-- of pretty much 95% of security flaws now.

790
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:36,991
Yeah.

791
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:37,911
Yeah, a lot of them.

792
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:38,911
Right. So, anyway,

793
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:40,472
anyway, that's, that's my story.

794
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:43,312
We're at a time and I guess, uh, yeah, whatever I got wrong.

795
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:45,391
Let me know because I'm sure I got plenty wrong.

796
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,359
I bet you nobody actually cares.

797
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,030
No, there's a couple of people I have in mind that I'm like terrified.

798
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,729
They're going to listen to this

799
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,030
episode

800
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,319
and,

801
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:55,699
and they're going to send me an email and be like, dude, you're an idiot.

802
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:59,900
-- I'm going to reply with, yeah, I know.
-- Please reply on Twitter publicly use hashtag

803
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,219
Os S

804
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:01,589
-- pod. Yeah.
-- Right.

805
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:06,140
That's right. That's right. Reply publicly shame me for all to see.

806
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,510
I'm ok with that in all seriousness, I can totally take it.

807
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,180
So don't feel bad if you make fun of me on Twitter.

808
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:13,160
Well, but in fairness,

809
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,550
like the my understanding of secure boot is the number

810
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,939
of people that actually understand secure boot is like seven.

811
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,760
It's less than 100 I bet.

812
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,680
And like three of them work at Microsoft,

813
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:24,829
a lot of them are at Microsoft and I think Matthew

814
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,900
Garrett and Peter Jones are probably the only other two.

815
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,479
Like

816
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,680
so anyway. Anyway.

817
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:34,089
