Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,399
Kurt Siefried and getting one day older every day with the rest of us, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:15,260
I do age

3
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:19,110
at the time of t equals one second per second.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,629
-- Maybe
-- you should try going faster.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,139
That is

6
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:23,459
true.

7
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,739
I remember, I, I think I read this on Reddit or something one time

8
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:28,139
about how

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,849
building a time machine that goes forward in time is quite easy to do actually.

10
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:33,340
And

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,549
so I remember,

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,709
I, I think it was my, when my kids were young,

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,229
it was very dad joke of let's build the time machine and they're like, oh,

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,970
how exciting.

15
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:41,639
And I'm like, yes,

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,400
our time machine will go forward in time at a rate of one second per second.

17
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:45,459
It

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,430
is a cardboard box

19
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,069
and then they were less impressed.

20
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:49,740
Yeah.

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,729
So the topic this week is everybody is getting older and especially open source.

22
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,709
People are getting older.

23
00:00:56,099 --> 00:01:01,459
Yes, there's a news story that was, I think it, it showed up to me

24
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,470
on,

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,819
but it's called what the Graying of Open Source. It's on the register

26
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,250
and, and SJVN wrote it. Who's like a, a

27
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:14,849
ironically, a gray beard news journalist at this point.

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,029
Well, who else is going to do it?

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,290
I don't know. That's a good question. See, that's part of the challenge, right?

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,790
Is like

31
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:24,779
when it comes to being a domain specific knowledge expert, statistically,

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,709
it's going to be the older people,

33
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:27,792
I

34
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:28,822
guess.

35
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,042
-- I, so here's the thing,
-- statistically I'm saying,

36
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:32,983
statistically obviously there's outliers.

37
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,352
You have young chess grandmasters who know everything there

38
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,703
is to know about opening theory or statistically,

39
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,383
if you want somebody to have a lot of knowledge,

40
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:40,922
well,

41
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:46,422
to get that knowledge requires a really brutal combination of time and effort.

42
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:50,902
I don't think that's the point of this discussion or, or story though. So let me read

43
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:51,623
this

44
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,865
in particular. I'm just going to read the opening

45
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,515
from, from the story.

46
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,596
It says a youth and open source panel was

47
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:00,676
held at the United Nation open source program office

48
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:00,816
OS

49
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:02,185
O for good conference.

50
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:04,146
Now, the, the UN

51
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,545
proceedings

52
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,115
are all.

53
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:11,606
There is a video of it. I had it open and I watched it. I'll see if I can find it.

54
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,485
I'll put it in the show notes. But anyway, so the

55
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,615
opo for good conference in the UN building in Manhattan,

56
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,779
there is only one little problem with it to quote ruth

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,250
IKEA,

58
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,589
I'm sorry for probably mispronouncing your last name. A

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,449
young Nigerian open source project manager.

60
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,059
We need more young people here because I see a lot of old people here

61
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,139
like

62
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,710
that.

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,210
I'm staring at an old person.

64
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:40,929
I am also staring at myself and you. So two old people in my window. But look, yes.

65
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,289
And,

66
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,369
and so this is something I have done more thinking

67
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,539
about since reading this story than is probably healthy.

68
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:51,820
And there have been a bunch of threads on Mastodon. I've looked at

69
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:52,686
mhm.

70
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:57,805
Toma De Pierre had a really good comment where he basically pointed out that look,

71
00:02:57,815 --> 00:03:00,865
you know, a lot of young people don't have time or money

72
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:05,876
to work on something like open source. It's a very privileged thing to get to do

73
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,085
well to,

74
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:10,555
to basically be a for most of the world to basically be able to

75
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,352
do any activity that doesn't directly put food in your mouth is a luxury

76
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:19,611
and, and not only that but an activity that requires a computer and internet and a

77
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:22,121
little bit of knowledge about programming and

78
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:26,841
things like that. Like that's already the the bar to entry now is quite high.

79
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,022
Well, and I think there's more pieces to this than even that.

80
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:32,932
You, you can say we need more young people in open

81
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:33,722
source. But

82
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:34,470
I

83
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,309
don't

84
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,979
know if that's the right thing to say

85
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,600
like, what is the problem? Right?

86
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,210
You can say the problem is there aren't enough young people in open source

87
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,429
and

88
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,149
maybe there isn't, let's say there isn't, let's say that's an issue.

89
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,940
So now we have to think about why is that is it because the old people won't leave?

90
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,490
Is it because young people don't care?

91
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,630
Is it because young people don't have the resources to do this?

92
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,330
They're, they're like millions of guesses.

93
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:04,274
We were talking about this and I invented the word invite

94
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:05,125
ability

95
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:09,585
and looking at some open source projects, they are very inviting like they are,

96
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:13,214
you know, hey, um here's how you can participate in their read me.

97
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:16,934
Like they literally say, like you can go do this or that or whatever or

98
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:18,015
curl is a great example.

99
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,934
Like every time there's a new committer, he celebrates it on Mastodon.

100
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:22,575
Yes. Right. Yes.

101
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:23,375
So I think I,

102
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:28,174
I think the problem is there's probably about 50 to 100 factors in total here

103
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:29,135
that are all,

104
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:32,575
some of them are tightly coupled and some of them are not coupled at all

105
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,859
or,

106
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:35,880
and like essentially some of them correlate but are

107
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,309
not causative and some of them are highly causative,

108
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,709
right?

109
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,179
And so like to throw a technical one,

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,390
a lot of software has been written

111
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,399
a lot of very complicated software. A lot of it's been enhanced and grown

112
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,640
and it's, it's not easy anymore.

113
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:54,600
Like we've, we've written all the easy software kind of

114
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,929
also not fun.

115
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:02,279
So this is something I was thinking about actually is let's pick

116
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,079
on XZ just because it's top of mind for many people,

117
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,799
right?

118
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,890
If I was a new person looking to do something I found interesting I

119
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:15,950
have a suspicion I would not land on something like the XZ project.

120
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:20,190
I think that's a great example because there are literally a handful of

121
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,670
people in the world that are probably very excited about compression algorithms.

122
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,390
Like there are competitions and there are,

123
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,190
there's actually a pretty solid movement here

124
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,739
and it's from within that community that,

125
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:30,519
well,

126
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,769
that's basically your pool of possible

127
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,480
applicants because it is highly specialized.

128
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:39,040
Here's where I think what you bring up is

129
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,869
is I think exactly it.

130
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,399
I'm a new person.

131
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:43,720
I'm doing

132
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,260
compression algorithm research.

133
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:53,709
Do I want to go and dig around in someone else's 30 year old C code

134
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,510
and try to maintain it?

135
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:58,959
Or would I rather do my own thing? Except

136
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,950
if I try to do my own thing,

137
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,489
no one's gonna use it because they never heard of me and there's already this other

138
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,929
library and they're gonna yell at me and tell me I shouldn't be doing it.

139
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,339
-- Yeah,
-- you're doing it wrong. It's a bad library. You blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

140
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:10,779
Right.

141
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:14,149
-- Right.
-- And I have a suspicion. Part of this story

142
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,589
is that if I'm a like when you and I were getting into open source, it was all brand new,

143
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,390
everything was new. Every, it was Greenfield

144
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,670
everywhere we talk about getting young people involved in open source.

145
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,850
But what we really mean in many of these

146
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:39,260
conversations is we want young people to take over maintenance

147
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,540
of this thing

148
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,225
that is probably poorly written

149
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,554
and badly documented and hard to work with

150
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:52,665
because we're worried that the current person working

151
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:55,595
on it who is overworked and underpaid and

152
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:57,674
everything

153
00:06:57,804 --> 00:06:58,304
like

154
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,894
because they might stop someday.

155
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,274
And you know what this feels like to me,

156
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,380
there is a concept in enterprise software called Sustaining Engineering

157
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,109
where you have a piece of enterprise software and you

158
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:14,730
have a bunch of developers working on the next version,

159
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,359
but you have companies paying you quite a lot

160
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,480
of money often to maintain a certain version,

161
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,000
right?

162
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,720
And so you hire a sustaining engineering group whose only job

163
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,657
is keeping the old version alive

164
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:34,046
and nobody wants that job. Like if you hire someone into your se group,

165
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:39,596
they're there to hopefully move into the development group, generally speaking,

166
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:39,897
right?

167
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:43,596
Like it is not fun, it's usually terrible work.

168
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:48,736
And the only way anyone is going to do it is if you pay them often a lot of money,

169
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,516
the on ramp to coming into a lot of

170
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:55,313
things. Now, a lot of technology is quite steep.

171
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:56,713
And as a young person,

172
00:07:56,723 --> 00:08:01,723
do you want to go on a steep on ramp to something that is maybe not dead but is a dead end.

173
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:04,614
Like pearl, like pearls, not dead, it'll never die just like

174
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:07,194
coal, just like FORTRAN, they'll always be around,

175
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,053
but they're kind of dead ends in the

176
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:11,574
sense of like they're not growing significantly.

177
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:15,514
-- Ok? I have another way to think about this.
-- Well, but my point is

178
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:16,531
I want to get on a steep,

179
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,460
on ramp to something that is a dead end or something that's new and interesting.

180
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,691
-- Well,
-- everyone wants new and interesting. Like, that's just human condition.

181
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,200
How many of us have 700 unfinished projects in our workshop areas

182
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:30,490
because we started it and then we decided to start

183
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:33,210
something new because it was more shiny and interesting.

184
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,830
Right. Like it's, it's human nature. It's very, it's very common to do that.

185
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,910
Now when we were young,

186
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,710
when open source was young,

187
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,150
a lot of the efforts going on were to create a functional computer,

188
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:46,030
right?

189
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,330
Linux didn't work very well.

190
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,840
We needed encryption libraries, we needed compression libraries,

191
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:54,809
we needed graphics libraries.

192
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,169
I think the interest in a lot of these tools was to just get a functional computer.

193
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,075
We're past the point of needing functions, computers.

194
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:07,304
It was because like some of the open source I participated in was scratching my

195
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:10,554
itch of like I needed this to work or I needed this to function.

196
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:11,594
So literally

197
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,044
to have a working computer,

198
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:14,674
it had to be done. Now it's

199
00:09:14,974 --> 00:09:16,114
well, it's good enough, right?

200
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:18,705
So here's the other piece of this.

201
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:21,835
I think that isn't, was not discussed anywhere I've seen

202
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,275
and I ignoring the

203
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:29,354
young people don't have it. It's like the Maslow hierarchy of needs, right?

204
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:31,244
Like open source is way at the top. Yeah.

205
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:32,114
Now

206
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,169
there are a lot of things going on in the world of tech and humans, right?

207
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,719
Like one of my favorite examples

208
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,659
is if you look at the world of like Twitch streaming and video games,

209
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:45,229
the mods people are creating

210
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:50,580
the, the hacks they're making around video games. Like I, I have a great example.

211
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:50,760
There,

212
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,239
there's two things that I've been playing that have consumed the entirety

213
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,030
of my video game experience for probably the last three months.

214
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,460
What is called a super metroid Zelda Randomizer.

215
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:04,299
And the second is a super metroid map randomizer.

216
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,849
What people have done

217
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:10,250
is these, these random folks, they are not old people mind you that have done this.

218
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,869
They have taken these old video games

219
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,679
and they have hacked them up

220
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:18,190
and they've created like there, there's, there's websites I will put, I, no,

221
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,349
I'm not putting links to the websites.

222
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,010
I don't want them to get taken down by Nintendo,

223
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,609
but

224
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:22,750
look it up,

225
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:23,754
figure it out.

226
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:24,383
But

227
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:26,164
like the thing is you basically, I,

228
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:30,934
I say I want to play this game that has these

229
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:33,213
rules and you can click all kinds of buttons that are

230
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:35,193
like these are the tricks I'm capable of doing in the

231
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:38,093
game because you watch like the really good players do these things

232
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:41,504
like wall climb versus no wall climb or jump, sorry, wall jump,

233
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:45,643
wall jump. Yeah, I wish I can do that. You should do the crap these other people can do.

234
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,093
It's amazing. But anyway. Right.

235
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:47,643
And I can

236
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:51,297
set it up to my skill level because I'm bad and I, I just like playing it.

237
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:53,658
Like, I'm not playing in tournaments or anything like that.

238
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:55,778
But the point is there is a ton

239
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,937
of interesting innovation happening from young people.

240
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,497
It's just not happening

241
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:04,338
-- in the open source world. I think. I
-- think it's more diffuse because you're right.

242
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:06,418
Like, I'm just looking at this Hearts of Iron four.

243
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,728
Guess how many mod packs there are on the Steam Store? I bet. Hundreds. No.

244
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:11,578
Keep going.

245
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:12,357
Oh, really?

246
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:14,742
2691 entries.

247
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:15,932
-- Yeah,
-- that's amazing.

248
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,702
Like I knew it was a lot,

249
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:22,341
-- but
-- that is open source for a lot of young people now is stuff like this.

250
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,622
And so I think the, the,

251
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:26,622
the, the funny thing

252
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:28,942
that I also think about this story

253
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:31,781
is my guess is the real reason

254
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:35,062
people are concerned about open source needing fresh blood

255
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:36,642
is because

256
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:42,916
-- a lot of companies rely on that free open source.
-- Oh, absolutely.

257
00:11:42,955 --> 00:11:45,736
And, and that's another thing is back 20 years ago

258
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:48,466
when you were in the open source world, you were dealing with

259
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:49,596
people, right?

260
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:50,556
Because companies,

261
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:53,835
so few companies were using this that you could literally count them on one hand.

262
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,955
Scary. And only hippies used open

263
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:56,705
source like,

264
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:58,536
and a lot of the companies using it were

265
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:01,786
using Red Hat because like to get it working was

266
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,609
no, like even getting red

267
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,919
installed. Which had a good installer

268
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,090
was right. Like you laugh, I laugh and then we cry a little bit and have like a flash

269
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,299
bang,

270
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,169
you know, to Kickstarter

271
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,289
-- or sorry. Kickstart.
-- I can't see my disc controller for some reason.

272
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:20,909
Or like, why, why, what, why are my cylinder count? What?

273
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,200
That's not my cylinder count?

274
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,500
Oh, I know. Right.

275
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,239
Nowadays, like

276
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,000
we, we're seeing this where, you know, it,

277
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,840
it's a person but they're seeing things like

278
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,260
this is like a critical bug for Microsoft teams and we

279
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,260
need you to fix FFM PEG to do this thing.

280
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,599
And then my favorite thing was on the hacker news discussion

281
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:37,960
where basically some people were tearing into FFM peg saying,

282
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:38,330
look,

283
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,479
you made a breaking change to a default which

284
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:42,380
then broke teams that's kind of your fault.

285
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,570
And the response was like,

286
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:44,700
hang on a minute

287
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,059
like FFM Peg wrote this open source thing.

288
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,179
They changed the default behavior which is not ideal, but hey,

289
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,090
they get to do that. It's their right.

290
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:52,719
And

291
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,940
you know, and Microsoft's consuming it, they could have tweaked it to

292
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,719
not do that.

293
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,840
Like I literally just wrote the create users rewrote

294
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,229
the create user script for a thing I use

295
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,510
because I don't like the one they have because

296
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,080
it's interactive and I want to be automated.

297
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,570
I'm not going to go upstream and complain and be like blah, blah, blah,

298
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,250
it doesn't do what I want.

299
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,179
No, I'm just gonna fix it.

300
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,640
And so like they literally Microsoft was like you

301
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,330
need to fit like and it was already fixed.

302
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,960
They just had to literally add one flag

303
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:16,320
and then Microsoft just

304
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,692
left the conversation and never like no, thank you.

305
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:21,052
Well, kind of a thank you but not genuine.

306
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:23,533
And like no, they could have bought a support contract.

307
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:27,502
They could have given them money. I think Microsoft maybe has a few dollars extra.

308
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:31,932
-- Not poor little Microsoft. Yeah,
-- they basically came in yelled it's broken, fix it.

309
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:35,393
Oh, it's already fixed. OK. We'll consume that fix. Thank you. Bye. And it's like,

310
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,382
well, that was nice of that.

311
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:40,935
-- I'm sure that's part of the story.
-- Well, but as a young person, I think

312
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:44,356
we grew up with open source that was people,

313
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:46,406
young people are growing up with open source

314
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,556
that is being strip mined by corporations.

315
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:51,666
-- There is a lot of that. And the other thing is
-- back in the day

316
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:55,026
when a company used open source, you didn't see it

317
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:56,426
as directly.

318
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,270
Oh, they would never admit it.

319
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,549
Yeah, like they kind of like in super fine white print on white paper,

320
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,280
they'd have like may contain traces of open source.

321
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,530
You know, you can, you can,

322
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,609
you can write this mailing address to get like a CD with the stuff on it.

323
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:15,039
But nowadays like if a cloud provider provides a Mongo DB as a service, well,

324
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,419
clearly they're providing

325
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,200
Mongo DB as a service and poor Mongo DB is like, well,

326
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,429
we would like to be able to pay the rent and eat.

327
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,359
So now we're going to change our license to be whatever it was.

328
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,450
And I think that's the other part of it is open

329
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,929
source is no longer what it was 20 years ago,

330
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,580
especially with the consumption of it.

331
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,770
Like, companies are openly consumed

332
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:36,435
-- and selling it now as a service.
-- Sure. Sure. Right.

333
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:37,645
Well, and, and so that's the point.

334
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:41,135
Right is, I think there are without question,

335
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:45,835
thousands of open source projects that have died that existed,

336
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:48,635
we'll say 3040 years ago in the open source world.

337
00:14:48,645 --> 00:14:50,296
Just because for whatever reason

338
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:52,796
-- they didn't work out.
-- What

339
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:53,695
-- do
-- you mean by die?

340
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:54,526
Like there's

341
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:57,461
like they're gone or they're still there,

342
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:01,031
the open source never goes away but like no one is working on it.

343
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:01,992
Right. We'll say

344
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:04,192
abandoned projects. Let's call them

345
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:08,271
that probably don't build anymore because you need to use like Red Hat Linux

346
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:09,351
three

347
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:13,421
with a custom config on arm or on spark arm.

348
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,661
-- We didn't even have that back then. But anyway.
-- Right.

349
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,169
And now

350
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,270
I think there's a lot more attention because of the things you're

351
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,020
talking about where you've got all these large companies using open source,

352
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,789
open source is critical infrastructure.

353
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,130
And I think the reality is that

354
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,760
if you want

355
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:32,770
to keep this stuff maintained and going,

356
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:35,659
you have to give people a reason to do it

357
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,679
beyond you should do it because we need you to do it,

358
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,849
please, please do this work for free some young person because we need it.

359
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,619
This is an example of

360
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,729
if you need someone to do it,

361
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,090
pay them money to do it.

362
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,080
Like that is one of that is probably the only

363
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,530
solution at this point for a lot of this stuff,

364
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:55,690
right?

365
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,400
Like PC RE two, we talked about that a little while ago

366
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,440
where

367
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:02,989
the, the maintainer was like, I don't, I can't do this anymore.

368
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,119
And what now?

369
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:04,809
Right.

370
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:07,039
So anyway, but at the same time,

371
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,609
I think this is an example of young people have things they work on,

372
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:13,979
young people have things they want to do just because they're

373
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:17,169
not working on the things we think they should work on,

374
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:18,570
makes it wrong.

375
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,929
I just had a thought, I think there's another

376
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,210
aspect of this that you and I are ignoring because we're old, which is

377
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:29,229
open source, used to be infrastructural type software.

378
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,510
And now

379
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,719
because we have all that mostly sorted out,

380
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,739
like getting a web server nowadays is easy.

381
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:38,169
Like you just download one of the good ones. There's lots,

382
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,429
the same thing with mail servers, same thing with

383
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,390
whatever. There's so many options now.

384
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,549
And now

385
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,229
a lot of like younger people can work on building

386
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,109
like they build things that are like an end point.

387
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:50,859
Like what,

388
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,270
what traditionally would have been a command line utility except

389
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,260
it's a website that does this really cool thing.

390
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,900
And that's why I think part of that too is,

391
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:01,020
but you can't consume that as an open source component

392
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,599
easily in the traditional way, right?

393
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:06,439
Whereas if you traditionally release the open source,

394
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,660
I would then bundle that into my dependency chain or whatever and have a thing that,

395
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,969
you know, converts PDF to html or vice versa, whatever.

396
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:14,579
But if it's a website,

397
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,750
I can maybe consume it as an API but then I'm dependent on

398
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,479
you running that for it to be available for it to continue working.

399
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:25,098
-- Whereas if
-- I don't think we're talking about the same things, if I'm a normal person,

400
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:28,900
what kind of website am I going to build that

401
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,239
is scratching my itch for other people to use?

402
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,569
I don't think there's very many,

403
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,599
there's a lot of them on hacker news and quite a few of them that I use

404
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,170
like a great one. Jason

405
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,589
editor

406
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:42,439
online.com. It is a wonderful little Jason editor online

407
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,459
and it went from being

408
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,339
it's, but it's got a really nice comparing.

409
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,709
It's got some really nice features and it's just, you know, it's,

410
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,229
it's just super convenient,

411
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,069
right?

412
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,199
Like I wrote that ridiculous. Like what is it RFC 933 three.com.

413
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,910
And you go there and it spits out the RFC 33 date.

414
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:01,010
Like

415
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:01,770
that's it.

416
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,300
Yeah,

417
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,650
it's just a handy little thing because I literally it was

418
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,810
easier to do that than to have like a Java library,

419
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,930
do it or javascript library do it rather,

420
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,930
I think it was called that. Um

421
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,420
But anyways, the point is like

422
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:18,640
the way people build and release their open sources change

423
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,310
because now they can do it as a website.

424
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,130
Whereas you and I

425
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:25,089
Josh, 20 years ago, if you wanted to build something as a web service,

426
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:26,959
the answer is you couldn't.

427
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:30,579
No, it was just really hard because you had to get a, a Colo

428
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:31,979
machine somewhere

429
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,599
and you had to run your own web server.

430
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:38,670
And now for like three bucks a month, you can run, uh, VPs somewhere

431
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,560
that can actually handle quite a bit of load.

432
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes. Right. Like, yes.

433
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,770
Yeah. So, I think maybe that's part of what's changed too is the, the,

434
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,010
the way people do open source has changed and it's not as,

435
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:55,949
it's not consumable in the traditional sense as a software library.

436
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,810
It's a service or an API or

437
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:00,719
like I've literally seen people chaining together websites

438
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,359
like they would in the past chain together a shell command with pipe

439
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,180
and effectively getting the same thing.

440
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,109
But obviously, you know, you're a lot more reliant on that website still working.

441
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,420
Versus, you know, if you have a shell command installed locally, it's,

442
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,199
it's not going to go away or break one day.

443
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:16,979
Well, it might break one day. But, you know,

444
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,699
and I think that's part of it is that the world has changed, like

445
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,099
it it has.

446
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,219
So, I think maybe the right discussion here

447
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:30,900
isn't about the graying of open source.

448
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,260
It's about,

449
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:38,900
why don't we see more of the organizations relying on open sources,

450
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,800
core infrastructure.

451
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,380
And this is true of corporations and governments and lots of other groups.

452
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,689
Why aren't we seeing them stepping up to the plate

453
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,660
to properly fund and maintain open source?

454
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,300
-- I know the answer to that. Well,
-- we all do.

455
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,400
-- It's because they don't have to.
-- I know.

456
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:55,819
Right.

457
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,699
Why should I pay you if you'll do it for free

458
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,979
-- or
-- more to the point? Why would I care if it works well enough?

459
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,739
Like, remember when we used to think, oh,

460
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,829
companies won't like data breaches because their share price will

461
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,510
go down and they'll suffer for it turns out no,

462
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:12,050
I mean, what was it AT&T just lost call records on, let me check my notes.

463
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,619
Oh, everybody. Right. Or Ticketmaster, I got my email from Ticketmaster.

464
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:18,719
I'm pretty sure everybody in North America has gotten that email.

465
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,689
I don't think I have a Ticketmaster account. So

466
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:24,209
I'm, I'm still waiting for an email though.

467
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,689
Yeah. But I mean, like,

468
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,849
you know, you want to go to a show, you have to deal with Ticketmaster at some point.

469
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,650
I probably have an account.

470
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,250
Yeah,

471
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,250
absolutely.

472
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,479
Here's my, I, I,

473
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,060
how do we make open source

474
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,550
more inviting? And I think the answer is open source.

475
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,339
Like, I think part of the challenge is people are doing open source,

476
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:48,260
just not in the way the companies want them to,

477
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,380
which is like you pointed out doing like the sustaining engineering

478
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,979
on old infrastructure code that like some big company is relying upon

479
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:57,755
and that's too bad because I see a lot of young

480
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:00,895
people building a lot of interesting and creative services and,

481
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:01,515
and look, I,

482
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:05,814
I wanna stress at this point and all of the data that exists

483
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:10,775
shows young people are getting screwed over by society at every possible turn.

484
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:16,415
Be it wages or inflation or prices or homeownership education?

485
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,790
You think our Children are going to own homes? That's so cute.

486
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:23,359
Well, no, that's just one of the ways they're getting screwed over.

487
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:26,310
Like they've got it rough. Right. They have it.

488
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,239
But harder than most of us old people can possibly understand.

489
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,800
We will never understand because it's not affecting us.

490
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,020
And so

491
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:35,655
while young people are doing many things,

492
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:41,255
I also recognize it is not without struggles and trials and tribulations.

493
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:41,795
Like

494
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:45,175
-- they've got a lot to deal with. Can
-- I quote my child?

495
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:49,125
So my, my one son was playing the game of life with the neighbor's kid

496
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:50,925
and I heard her say

497
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:54,974
I'm just gonna have a cat and find Children by the side of the road and feels like,

498
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:55,974
yeah, me too.

499
00:21:56,564 --> 00:22:01,935
Like my son Felix is he wants to own maybe one or two cats like that is his life goal for

500
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,300
like,

501
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:04,290
yeah,

502
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:09,319
that sucks. Like people, young people should be filled with optimism

503
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,239
and a sense of purpose.

504
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,069
And the thing I love is veterinarians in North America are getting more and

505
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,670
more expensive because all the private equity

506
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,819
groups are buying the vets and dentists

507
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:22,280
because, like, where else are they going to park their money and get a return on it?

508
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,729
That's true, I suppose.

509
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:24,359
Right.

510
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,270
And like I looked at that pet insurance

511
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,569
thing with that 56 page contract that doesn't cover

512
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,050
anything other than the cat getting in a

513
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,609
fight and getting like accidental teeth damage somehow.

514
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:32,880
Yeah.

515
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,260
But like

516
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:35,199
it's just, it's,

517
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:35,729
yeah.

518
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:41,099
No, it's, I think it's a lot of this is boiling down to corporations want free effort.

519
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,800
Like the, obviously,

520
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,160
I mean, to the point of some of them, you know,

521
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,829
the infamous tales of certain large employers in the US that have, like,

522
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:52,000
here's how to get food stamps on the bulletin boards in the

523
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,859
back of their store because they don't pay a living wage.

524
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,479
Exactly. Completely insane.

525
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,469
Like, why would their, it,

526
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,920
people pay some open source person to do something that they

527
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,619
kind of get for free.

528
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,329
And I think to quote, I guess Thomas de,

529
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,790
to some degree, it's, that doesn't sound like a me problem.

530
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,579
That sounds like a you problem. Yes.

531
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:12,430
And look, I think that's the correct answer here. I think

532
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:15,709
this is one of those things where if you let the

533
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:19,280
status quo be the status quo nothing is going to change.

534
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,939
And open the where we are at today

535
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,869
with open source is absolutely that

536
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,579
we are existing

537
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:27,589
at a state of perpetual status quo that I

538
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,439
don't think is beneficial to the open source developers.

539
00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:31,469
-- The
-- hm

540
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:35,280
I would say I have noticed certain patterns which is open source

541
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:39,910
people like literally killing themselves to try and sustain these things.

542
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,359
Like

543
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:41,589
I remember

544
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,640
and we asked for XML hash doss

545
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,609
hash dos

546
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:48,239
and the guy was like, yeah, I don't have time to work on this for a few months.

547
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,459
Like, and we're like, I'm like, I respect that like,

548
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,530
because

549
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:54,780
we're not paying you like, what am I supposed to like, I can't make demands.

550
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,829
And so we did it because we needed that thing solved quickly

551
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,229
and it wasn't nearly as bad as we thought it would be.

552
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,979
That is the pushback

553
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,959
that it, it is funny because I remember back in the day

554
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,560
when we wanted to make someone go away in open source is kind of the fu get out of here.

555
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:14,239
We'd say patch is welcome, right? That was the,

556
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,319
that was the,

557
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,550
oh, bless your soul, right? Of open source.

558
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:21,839
Like just learn how our code works and how we submit code and the

559
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:25,160
culture of our code and the style of our code and do it perfectly.

560
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:26,359
I'm OK with that.

561
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,239
I'm OK with that as being the answer of if you are an open source maintainer,

562
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:35,719
you can say like if you want this fixed, you're going to fix it because I'm not.

563
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,067
Can I give you a quick analogy if a group of kids

564
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:40,387
are playing baseball and another kid comes up to them and says,

565
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:43,907
can I play, they get to play baseball or they, they can go away.

566
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:47,027
That's how it works with Children and baseball and other games. And I think,

567
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:51,307
yeah, I think it's not that we need to be meaner, but we need to be firmer and say,

568
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:51,787
look here,

569
00:24:51,797 --> 00:24:54,427
like one thing I'm trying to use more is the contributor covenant and I'm saying,

570
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:56,517
look, here are the rules that we are going to play by.

571
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:57,368
We're going to be

572
00:24:57,517 --> 00:25:00,108
like, nice to each other. We are not going to be mean to each other.

573
00:25:00,118 --> 00:25:03,667
We're gonna behave like reasonable human beings or else you can leave and by,

574
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:04,197
you can leave.

575
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,027
I mean, I'm gonna boot you.

576
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:08,176
Here's I think what I want to end this on

577
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,735
and I'm going to

578
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:10,855
park

579
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:15,536
the story with the young. If you watch Streamers on Twitch,

580
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,625
I've actually never watched Twitch.

581
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:21,776
I've actually, I just realized I've never been to Twitch. Is it Twitch dot What is it?

582
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:22,706
-- Twitch
-- dot TV.

583
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:24,836
Amazon owns it ironically.

584
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:27,066
But anyway, you watch the Streamers and so funny enough, I,

585
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:29,595
I watch Streamers play the Randomizer.

586
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:33,735
I also play, it's just, they're really good at it. So it, it reminds me of how like

587
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:34,336
people,

588
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:36,913
they might play a sport themselves but then

589
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:38,604
they'll still watch the professionals do it.

590
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:41,803
It's 100% that, because it's like I suck at this and I'm like,

591
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:44,884
I wish I could do the things these people do and I can't.

592
00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:45,473
But anyway,

593
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:48,473
you watch these streamers and when they have someone

594
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:51,864
in their Twitch chat that's misbehaving in some way,

595
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:53,933
they just ban them. Like

596
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:56,894
they'll, they'll time them out, they'll ban them like whatever.

597
00:25:56,904 --> 00:26:00,114
Like there is no discussion, right? They're just like b

598
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,703
hammer comes out, I'm done with this crap.

599
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:03,644
They figure

600
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,791
it out. Open source has not figured that out.

601
00:26:06,802 --> 00:26:11,472
Like we don't get out the band hammer, we don't discourage behaviors.

602
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:12,761
And the thing is like

603
00:26:13,212 --> 00:26:15,592
when you look at these Twitch Chats,

604
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,702
generally speaking,

605
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:20,092
the people in them are,

606
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:21,031
we'll say

607
00:26:21,421 --> 00:26:24,151
polite and, and interesting and nice.

608
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:27,182
Then one person shows up like that one toxic person.

609
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,671
And I think it's like the Nazi Bar story, right?

610
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:33,699
Where like these, these streamers, they don't deal with it like boom, you're done.

611
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,660
And I think

612
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,880
i it works right. I feel like it works. They figured it out,

613
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:39,369
I think.

614
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,520
Well,

615
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,050
I remember we had this discussion about the open source license definition of

616
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,500
open source licenses where number five says

617
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,319
no discrimination against persons or groups,

618
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,739
the license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

619
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,099
And my take on that was that, yeah, like the license can't say you know, no,

620
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:57,979
no people with a skin tone of darker than whatever bear paint sample.

621
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:00,520
No people named Kurt may use my project.

622
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,150
But on the flip side,

623
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,300
that doesn't mean I can't ban them from my

624
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,290
github or my mailing list. And like, I

625
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,479
don't have to let them into my house to listen

626
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:10,250
to their ideas about how I should rewrite this.

627
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,739
And I've seen that happen. Right.

628
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,290
We've, we've both seen that happen where somebody says, like,

629
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,339
I think you should fix the project by doing this.

630
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:20,199
And they're like, yeah, for like the 17th time now, we, we,

631
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:21,939
we looked at that a lot like five years ago

632
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:24,270
and here's the 10 reasons why that won't work.

633
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:24,859
And

634
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,729
I really think,

635
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:30,180
I don't want to say the open source projects needs to be more discriminatory,

636
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,349
but I think like your Twitch thing,

637
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,010
they need to be a lot firmer with

638
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,619
what are the expectations and enforcement of those expectations

639
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:43,229
and not like, oh, let's give them a 3rd, 4th, 5th chance. It's like, no,

640
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,089
there's enough nice reasonable people out there that do want to participate,

641
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,810
but they're probably avoiding a lot of this now because they did participate.

642
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,810
They saw a gross person come in and knock at the boot and they're like,

643
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,849
because I, I've seen, that's why I'm not,

644
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,170
that's why I will have nothing ever in my life to do with

645
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,810
the Open BS D project because they have some horrifically toxic people that,

646
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:02,939
like, threatened me.

647
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:06,869
And I'm guessing that there are people that read those email threads and went, oh,

648
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,729
-- look,
-- here's, here's how I'll end it. It's not about open source needs young people.

649
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,829
I think it's, the situation is open source needs to learn from the young people. Like

650
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:21,322
-- that's a lot, they know
-- there's a lot more kindness with young people. Nowadays,

651
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:24,902
we expect them to come play by our rules.

652
00:28:25,353 --> 00:28:27,942
We should go play by theirs because I think their rules

653
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:30,512
are better and they figured a lot of this stuff out,

654
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:34,863
younger people are definitely a lot kinder like

655
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:37,272
the fact that school bullying is a thing

656
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:39,983
like that is not tolerated anymore like it was 23

657
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:40,715
years ago.

658
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:40,855
Oh

659
00:28:41,005 --> 00:28:42,276
my goodness, thank goodness.

660
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:42,816
Yeah.

661
00:28:43,046 --> 00:28:46,235
So I guess, yeah, let's be nicer like the younger people.

662
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:46,735
No,

663
00:28:46,745 --> 00:28:49,316
like statistically look at like you look at like giving rates to

664
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:52,316
charity and stuff by like a percentage of income and everything.

665
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:53,186
Yeah,

666
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:54,196
old people

667
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:56,056
are like be like the youth.

668
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:57,836
I wish I was youth anyway.

669
00:28:57,995 --> 00:28:58,316
