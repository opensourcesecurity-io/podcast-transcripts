Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 138 with myself,

1
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,680
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:16,500
-- Josh Pressers.
-- I can feel the spring in the air. Kurt. It's, it's coming.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,370
Yeah, it was actually above zero. It hit plus eight yesterday.

4
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:21,290
And I assume you're talking about

5
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,329
Celsius

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,129
-- and not the lovable Fahrenheit scale we use in the United States
-- 46

7
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:27,989
Â°F.

8
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:29,459
That's solid man.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,100
Yeah, I think that's,

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,299
that, that's pretty good.

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,139
That's warmer than it's been where I live and you live way north of me.

12
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:37,020
So,

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,880
yeah. No, it was beautiful yesterday.

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,139
Nice. That's awesome, man.

15
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:44,259
-- Unlike the world of security, which is beautiful.
-- Right.

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,159
Well, and what I love is the world of security is bad enough.

17
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:51,220
But then when you get sort of, I, I guess I hate to, I hesitate to say normal people,

18
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,569
but when you get sort of normal people interfacing with it,

19
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:57,330
it, it tends to just go to excuse of expression, good,

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,950
tends to go to hell in a hand basket, you know, good intentions at all.

21
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,159
And I, I think this first story is a, is a really great example of that.

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,959
And what is the first story?

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,120
Apparently the Japanese police arrested some Japanese girl

24
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,769
for spreading

25
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,529
malicious code.

26
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,480
Said malicious code is a well known,

27
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:21,580
uh javascript snippet that basically loops a pop up

28
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:23,099
and won't let you close the pop up.

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,169
Yeah,

30
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:25,029
like,

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,660
and I get it, those are super annoying and I,

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:27,800
I,

33
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:30,629
yeah,

34
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,589
I have all sorts of things to prevent that crap on my computer, but

35
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,500
they actually arrested her.

36
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,319
I mean, but it's kind of one of those things like, where's that line between,

37
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,459
you know,

38
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,330
me hosting and spreading malicious code and it just being like an annoying ha ha.

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,339
You know,

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,050
so

41
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,500
I, you know what I love about this story. Do you remember

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,660
the inception of the Rick roll?

43
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:50,650
Yes,

44
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,129
it is. This right.

45
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:55,800
It was, there was a website called Internet is Serious business.com

46
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:58,870
and you'd go to it and it would start playing

47
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,410
the,

48
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,699
the Rick roll video in the background and then have

49
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,449
just constant pop ups that you couldn't get rid of.

50
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,089
And the web browsers actually didn't have a way

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,490
to make them go away and you could never close the tab.

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,410
The only the way out was to kill the whole web browser.

53
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,589
It was, do we even have tabs back then?

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,789
I don't even tabs might not have even been a thing. I don't remember.

55
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,419
No, I literally would have multiple browsers open,

56
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,869
-- right?
-- I remember those days, man, or remember the X 10 pop under ads. It's

57
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,149
so, anyway, anyway, I don't want to,

58
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,699
-- I want ads were
-- literally the

59
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,429
worst.

60
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,949
They were great.

61
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:32,449
I

62
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:35,559
remember, I close my browser and there'd be like, 45 X

63
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,080
or you

64
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:37,550
wondering,

65
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,630
-- like, I'm from,
-- well, I just remember, like,

66
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,559
why is my computer performance sucking?

67
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,669
Right. And you open up

68
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,130
whatever your command explorer and you're like, what, like,

69
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,960
I didn't open up 50 browser windows.

70
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:51,210
It was beautiful. It was beautiful. I loved it. I loved it.

71
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,330
Ah, the good old days, right? Like everything was better then.

72
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,149
Anyway, here is my thought on this is we talked in the last show about how

73
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,979
regulation and kind of government intervention is one of the

74
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,449
few ways people are going to actually start to care

75
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,559
and then

76
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:12,419
-- the government does this
-- well,

77
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,979
so I think there's an important distinction to be made between

78
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,630
the regulators that is the people making policy and then the people

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,699
enforcing policy because part of the problem is right now,

80
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,899
they don't have good policy to enforce.

81
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,300
It is very true.

82
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,850
You know. So they're kind of winging it. They're doing the best they can.

83
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,960
And it's like, well, let me put it this way.

84
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:33,080
Somebody goes outside your house at three in the morning every day and,

85
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,619
and starts screaming for an hour.

86
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,440
Is that illegal? Should it be illegal? I mean, it's

87
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,860
disturbing the peace.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,070
There are noise ordinances, at least in my town

89
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,449
and yeah, you can't do that. Ok.

90
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,399
So what if they just stand outside your house and they play a kazoo

91
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,479
-- for an hour?
-- It would defend how loud it is.

92
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,119
The, the noise ordinance is quite specific about the decibel level and, and look

93
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,929
if, if a crazy person wants to stand at my house and play a kazoo,

94
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,559
I can call the police and it's conceivable, the police can't do anything about it.

95
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,160
But kind of, there's two ways I'd look at this

96
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,259
is

97
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,570
I, you can ignore them or like maybe spray them with your hose.

98
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,130
Well, then that's assault

99
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,029
-- or battery
-- rather. What if it's an accident? I accidentally sprayed them.

100
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,209
Well, see, and part of the thing though is the cops can issue a lawful order.

101
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,489
Like, please move along, sir.

102
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,950
And then if they don't do that, then boom, you're resisting.

103
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,230
That's

104
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,519
fair.

105
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,570
That's probably fair.

106
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,619
You know.

107
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,670
But anyway, we're talking about playing kazoos and the reality is that a young girl

108
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,250
pulled a prank, let's face it.

109
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,579
It's basically a prank and she got in trouble for it and I have

110
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:41,149
a feeling this is half the police not having a freaking clue what they're doing

111
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,350
and half she probably ticked off the wrong person by

112
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,850
doing this because that's usually how pranks go wrong.

113
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:47,279
Right.

114
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:47,920
Yeah.

115
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:48,320
Well,

116
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,529
it's like those what Nigerian call scammers that phoned the

117
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,049
former head of the CIA and he actually was like,

118
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,579
or was it the former head of the FBI or something right there.

119
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:56,720
It's in the news right now.

120
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,500
And so he actually called a bunch of his

121
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,869
buddies and they investigated and arrested these people,

122
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,079
which, ok, great. So if we can do that, why can't we do that to all of these scammers?

123
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,010
Uh because we're not like former heads of the FBI,

124
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,209
it's not cost effective, right? Like, you know, I hate to say it.

125
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,410
So, um this reminds me. So I was in San Francisco for Rs A

126
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,589
and I, I think I agree with a lot of people that,

127
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,630
you know, San Francisco is,

128
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,480
I, I don't know what's going on there.

129
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:25,190
But uh so Friday night, we were walking down um Folsom Street

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,540
and within the space of two blocks,

131
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,980
we saw three people smoking crack cocaine on the street

132
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,850
-- and
-- that does not surprise me

133
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,339
and the cops were out and around.

134
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:38,839
It's not like there were no cops around and, and I was thinking like, if I was a cop,

135
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,459
what would I do?

136
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,660
Arrest these people for possession or whatever?

137
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,250
-- And, and then
-- what you do almost nothing.

138
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,769
Yeah.

139
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,690
Well, and I was thinking like,

140
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,769
what could I do that would have any meaningful benefit or change?

141
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,700
And I don't think there is

142
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,250
anything really

143
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,149
-- that the police could do in this situation.
-- No, there's nothing the police can do.

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,679
And this is,

145
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,209
I think this is related to this particular story

146
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,609
about Japan as well as just security in general,

147
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:04,489
it's a fact that

148
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,839
any time there's any sort of anything going on,

149
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,649
there's always many layers, right?

150
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,920
There's like the fundamentals that cause the problem to begin with.

151
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,359
And then there's the stuff we see.

152
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,130
And obviously, in terms of like we'll pick on San Francisco.

153
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,600
San Francisco has a well known homeless problem

154
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,480
and the cost of everything there is ridiculous and is out of control.

155
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:27,029
And so obviously there are lots of people that for

156
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,649
whatever reason stay there and they have no way out.

157
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,649
And so they end up generally engaging in

158
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,820
some sort of illegal activities and of course,

159
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:34,839
you could arrest them all.

160
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,329
But what's going to happen? Right. They don't,

161
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,600
you're gonna arrest them and they're eventually going to get back out

162
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:40,529
and just do the same thing over and over and over again.

163
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,350
Right.

164
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,089
And it's one of those things where

165
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,700
San Francisco is a city.

166
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,910
I know they always talk about, oh, we need to fix this, we need to fix this.

167
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,339
But I mean, let's face it fundamentally. They've done Jack Swat.

168
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,880
-- Right. And I can't wait for the tweets about all the work they're doing.
-- Well.

169
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,059
It's, it's tough too because you have a lot of it looks like mental illness issues

170
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,160
then propagating as homelessness and illegal activity

171
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,829
and drug abuse at which point,

172
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:03,359
you know,

173
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,359
then

174
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,160
the thing that always gets me is when you look at that

175
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:08,600
type of problem

176
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,649
getting these people, not even getting them out of it,

177
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,010
but getting them just stabilized, getting them sheltered and fed

178
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:17,269
is incredibly difficult.

179
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,690
Right. And, and I'm going to compare this to security

180
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,450
is

181
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,329
fundamentally if the people in charge don't care, nothing changes.

182
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,910
And that's, it's the same problem in both directions.

183
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,239
This assumes the problem can actually be fixed for a reasonable amount

184
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,450
of effort and money and I'm not sure it can be.

185
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,549
And that's like some of these security problems. It's possible,

186
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,929
you know, like for example, this, that that latest have I been P

187
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:44,200
thing where it was like 790 million email addresses.

188
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,790
And it's like, but why are we pretending that email addresses are somehow private?

189
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:48,809
Uh

190
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:51,470
There was other personal data in that dump by thing.

191
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,869
But yeah, I hear you

192
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:54,589
but a lot of people are like,

193
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,980
I should have control over my email address and it should only go

194
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:00,480
to the people I want like I had to do a GDPR takedown of

195
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:06,359
somebody, you know, for the DWF who um accepted the CV terms of use,

196
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,570
which specifically state what the CV terms of use were and explicitly stated,

197
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,859
you will end up, you know,

198
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:13,640
I will put this email artifact into this get repo

199
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,320
publicly so that we have a record of it.

200
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:18,640
And this person two years later was like, oh, I want my email address to be public,

201
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:19,540
please remove this.

202
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,160
So I had to.

203
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,399
And it's,

204
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:23,809
you know,

205
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,480
it's just weird to me that we pretend that

206
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,209
something like your legal name is somehow generally private.

207
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,200
It's like, I'm sorry, but it really isn't. And I'm not saying that

208
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,330
we shouldn't treat this data carefully and, you know, treat it sensitively.

209
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,669
But the reality is your personal data is out there.

210
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,890
And I think we need to now look at ways like for example,

211
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,760
these companies that allow people to get a mortgage

212
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,049
by, you know, stealing your identity.

213
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,859
Well, the problem isn't that they stole your identity. The problem is that the bank

214
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,799
has such weak security controls that anybody with your name

215
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,960
and date of birth can go get a mortgage.

216
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,200
And I think that's where we come back to some regulation.

217
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,479
You know, if regulators were to say that, like look,

218
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,640
the bank has to fully eat the cost of this and has to make it right.

219
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,520
-- I'm guessing that the security controls would improve
-- quickly.

220
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,270
Well, they, they do though, I mean, there is, this is actually a problem.

221
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,989
Well, I shouldn't speak for obviously Canada, but in the United States,

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,030
we had this issue where people would have incorrect things on their credit scores,

223
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,929
for example and say this isn't me,

224
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,719
you need to take it off and the credit companies were like we don't

225
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:24,270
want to and eventually the government said you have to do this right?

226
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,270
That's not ok.

227
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,919
You can't be basically marking someone as having bad credit when

228
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,630
there's things they didn't do and they can prove it wasn't them

229
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,989
right. And it's like the same deal with getting a mortgage, man. Like that's fraud.

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,309
If somebody gets a mortgage

231
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,349
in your name,

232
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,349
you're not responsible for their mortgage because you didn't do it.

233
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,570
It's the bank's problem for.

234
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,080
You still need to deal with it and you still need to deal with the outfall of it.

235
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,530
You need to, you know, go to law enforcement,

236
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,690
that's just life current. I mean, that's true of anything.

237
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,549
You're, if somebody does something to you,

238
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,429
you're going to have to clean up the mess because you're responsible for you.

239
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,570
And I mean, that does suck. I'm not saying it's right.

240
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,669
It's just the way it is and it's always going to be.

241
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,619
Well, what I'm saying is, for example, imagine the bank had to pay you out of pocket,

242
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,049
say your working rate times the number of hours you spent on it.

243
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:09,789
Right. I'm just saying, right. Things like that.

244
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,520
I suspect would make the banks be a lot, take a lot more, you know,

245
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,869
interest in being secure.

246
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:16,919
I, I don't disagree with you at all and,

247
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,049
-- you
-- know, I don't think it's ever going to happen but

248
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:19,469
it,

249
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,520
I don't think it will because I think that's when you start getting

250
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,520
into those situations where your incentives get kind of spun around backwards.

251
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,549
It's, you know, the old story of the Cobras in India Yes.

252
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,409
Yeah. People started raising them.

253
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,770
-- You
-- could conceivably depending upon the kind of reward have people, you know,

254
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,409
purposely defrauding banks to get their, their compensation.

255
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,919
If you can game a system, people will game it.

256
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,330
Well, if you can game a system to gain value.

257
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,169
Absolutely. People will game it.

258
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:47,650
That's what people do.

259
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,020
That's fundamentally

260
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,369
how humans work.

261
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:54,969
-- God bless humans.
-- Right. And that's how we got to the top of the food chain.

262
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,650
-- Uh,
-- sure. Yeah, that's, that's probably fair. So, anyway, uh, poor girl in Japan

263
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,049
got in trouble.

264
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:04,090
Is it, is it ok to get in trouble for your pranks?

265
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,289
And I think

266
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,090
I, I would like to say no, because young people do a lot of dumb stuff.

267
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:10,229
But at the same time, like,

268
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:13,809
sometimes you'd uns screwed up and I think she's unscrewed up

269
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,229
and that sucks and I hope it works out for her.

270
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:16,969
But it's, I,

271
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,890
I don't know if there's ever going to be

272
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,299
a good answer to things like this just because,

273
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,020
-- well,
-- the good news is the justice system in general has the concept of men's rea,

274
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,619
you know, intent.

275
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:29,030
Right. And hopefully that's taken into account.

276
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,450
-- Uh,
-- yes, that is. Well, do they in Japan though?

277
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,780
I don't, I don't know how the Japanese legal system works.

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,010
Uh,

279
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,960
they have something like a 98% conviction rate because they really

280
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:39,059
only take stuff to trial if they know they're going to,

281
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,109
ah, gotcha.

282
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,059
And that's fair.

283
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,099
She could conceivably just get in some trouble with

284
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:45,299
the police and then get let go eventually.

285
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:47,659
Which is hopefully that's what happens because

286
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:48,700
it's,

287
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,099
you know, I, I was young, I got into trouble.

288
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,599
It's ok to get your wrist slapped every now and then.

289
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:57,070
But I don't like ruining someone's life for a trivial,

290
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,510
I guess. Silly thing. And this is definitely a trivial, silly thing.

291
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,340
Well, especially

292
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:05,270
how do I put this nicely. Young people are stupid because they don't,

293
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,260
they haven't fully experienced and understand the

294
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,369
world and the brain is still developing.

295
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,950
Dude, adults are stupid too.

296
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,119
That was actually my next point is that

297
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,869
just because your brain is done developing at the

298
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,190
age of like 20 whatever doesn't mean you still

299
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,349
have any idea of how the world works because

300
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,820
for, well,

301
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,950
let me put it this way who here has driven in traffic in the

302
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,239
last 24 hours and witnessed at least one moving violation from another person.

303
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:29,320
-- I have not driven in the last 24 hours. Ok.
-- So,

304
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,570
but you know what I'm saying? Right?

305
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,559
Like if you, if you drive your car to the store,

306
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,280
you're going to witness somebody else doing.

307
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,440
-- Lord knows what actually
-- you,

308
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,020
you say this and the police for whatever reason has started

309
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,039
pulling people over like crazy in front of my house,

310
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,359
which makes me really happy because I live in kind of a busy street.

311
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,510
And so it pleases me that they're fine.

312
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,510
You know, I'm always complaining about the speeding and,

313
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,500
and anytime I see a police officer, I'm like, people drive too fast on my street.

314
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,349
You got to deal with that.

315
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,869
And it's, it's glorious but it's like constant,

316
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,109
there's constant flashing lights in front of my house now and it amuses me to no end.

317
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:58,489
Yeah.

318
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,270
No, I remember this one cop used to, uh, just,

319
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,469
he would go around the block park facing the main road, pull somebody over,

320
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,309
drive around the block and do it again and he

321
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,070
would just do that for like eight hours every day.

322
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,950
Right? And it wasn't even like it was, yeah,

323
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,010
like, well,

324
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,809
because people are just so oblivious to cop cars that you could just park

325
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,250
there and wait for people to come down the street and do something stupid.

326
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,539
Pull them over. So

327
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,489
well, speaking of doing sort of stupid, oblivious things that,

328
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,489
that end up being very painful according to Twitter,

329
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,219
a bank, uh,

330
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:29,750
accidentally published a private N PM package to the public N PM registry, which,

331
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,210
you know, ok, I, I totally get how that could happen.

332
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,989
Um, but apparently it took him three years to notice

333
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:36,400
that they did this

334
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,809
and then they, uh here we go,

335
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,400
a major international bank accidentally published a private package

336
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,099
of their own to the public N PM registry.

337
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:43,979
Took three years to notice and then sent D MC

338
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,679
a takedown notices to Amazon and cloud Flare for hosting,

339
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,539
quote stolen code unquote.

340
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,700
Now, I have to pay a lawyer to explain this to them.

341
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,570
-- Yeah,
-- I like that. That was amusing to me.

342
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,559
Uh,

343
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,669
now I, I will say

344
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,109
I am hopeful

345
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,190
that

346
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:06,820
the N PM group will be able to recoup the legal fees from the bank.

347
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:08,450
-- I don't
-- think they went to the N PM group

348
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,130
because no offense if they're dumb enough to do this,

349
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,400
they're probably dumb enough to be like, oh,

350
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,609
it's hosted at Amazon and through cloud flare.

351
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,789
Let's go blame them.

352
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,750
I thought, I thought that that tweet was from someone who works at N PM.

353
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,229
Ah, ok. I wasn't.

354
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,270
-- Yeah. And N PM is like a company.
-- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

355
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:23,859
Yes.

356
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,210
Yeah.

357
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:25,840
-- Ok. I stand corrected.
-- Sorry. I,

358
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,390
I guess so. Here is II,

359
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,309
-- I have sadly been involved in things similar to this in the past.
-- Oh, I've, I've seen

360
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:35,900
similar shenanigans. Yep.

361
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:40,590
-- It,
-- it, unfortunately, what happens is there's a lot of institutions that, like,

362
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:43,440
I'll pick on banks here because they're an easy one

363
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:44,289
where

364
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,719
there's something that went wrong and somehow somebody alerted them

365
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:50,979
of this source code and it wouldn't shock me if they

366
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:53,659
were getting some sort of like pen test done or some

367
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:58,489
sort of review of sensitive code or something they have internally

368
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,900
and somebody showed up and it was like, oh, your source code is here

369
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,000
and it

370
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,000
is quite likely not unlike the Japanese story.

371
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,599
We just had where the recipient misunderstood, what was going on,

372
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,419
assumed there was malicious intent

373
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:14,900
and, and basically called up the lawyers and was, like, go

374
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,760
-- and now you look like an
-- idiot.

375
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,289
These always remind me of like a large animal being stung by like a,

376
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:23,820
like some sort of large fly or insect.

377
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:24,460
Right.

378
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:27,070
And you see them get stung by it and then a few seconds later, like,

379
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,539
they process the pain signal

380
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,909
-- and just flip
-- out, right? Who's closest to me. Exactly.

381
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:34,039
Who did that?

382
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:36,000
You know? Yes.

383
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,359
Yeah. So I

384
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:38,250
see.

385
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,299
And this and I get it because this is frustrating because, you know,

386
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:44,239
when it comes to the A IC and I hate that I, I prefer the CIA try, you know,

387
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,869
confidentiality, integrity and availability.

388
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,429
You know, the classic three measures of sort of security,

389
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,260
you can always recover from availability,

390
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,979
you can stand it back up and get it working again

391
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,460
and you can always recover from integrity.

392
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:59,200
You know, you can restore from backups or otherwise un muck the data,

393
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:04,539
but you can't really like 100% confidently ever recover from confidentiality.

394
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:08,299
-- It's the old saying, man, information wants to be free.
-- Exactly.

395
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,989
And, and II I love using that whenever I can just because

396
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,179
it's so for, for you, you young. And

397
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,409
a

398
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,820
long time ago,

399
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:19,460
there was a very vibrant hacker culture will say.

400
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,539
And one of the I guess hip slogans was information wants to be free and of course,

401
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:28,299
it was what it really means at the end of the day, it's very profound actually is that

402
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:32,539
once information gets out, you can never bring it back. And this is,

403
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,940
you look at some of the data leaks that have happened for like, you know, CIA or,

404
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,210
or the NSA or who,

405
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,955
you know, the Snowden leaks, the Manning leaks, whatever.

406
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:46,085
Once they publish that stuff, it's, it's over, you can't, you can't take it back.

407
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:48,085
Right. And this has been true forever.

408
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:48,864
-- Well,
-- and it's,

409
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,294
it's more true now because the ability to store

410
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,164
and publish data is just so much easier.

411
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:56,715
Right. Right. And Google Man. Right. With Google, you can find anything.

412
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,630
And so, I mean, fundamentally, what,

413
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,469
what this bank is going to have to end up doing at the end of the day

414
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:04,699
is they could send takedown notices, they could get their stuff removed.

415
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,660
But it,

416
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:09,489
it's there and people are going to be able to find it if they want to.

417
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,170
And it's probably mirrored on 7 billion websites. Like it's you lost,

418
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,194
you know,

419
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:19,915
I've had fantasies if I had enough compute power of like downloading

420
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:24,515
all of github to look for credentials or to look for,

421
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:28,604
you know, pi I personally identifiable information to see who's accidentally,

422
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,954
you know, shoving that stuff out there.

423
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:32,755
Right. But part of the problem is then, then what would I do?

424
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,219
You know?

425
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:35,459
Right.

426
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,459
And, and the good news is there are some automated projects working on this,

427
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:39,599
like looking for pass.

428
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:42,229
Like there's one that actually looks for entropy and

429
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,180
based on the amount of entropy in that string,

430
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,780
you know, says, oh, we think you posted a password

431
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,540
to your G

432
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:48,109
repo,

433
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,729
you know, and they send you a warning email and they're like,

434
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,839
we're totally not scammers and this is legit and

435
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,510
like go click over here to read about us.

436
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:54,569
And you know,

437
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:58,060
they kept flagging on my one repo because I was publishing emails to it and emails

438
00:17:58,069 --> 00:17:59,790
have the message ID header that looks like

439
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,239
a password because it's like a random string.

440
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,199
So, you know, good on them for actually detecting this crap, right?

441
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:04,890
And crawling github

442
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,489
and trying to do the right thing.

443
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,119
Um But again, it's, you know,

444
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,520
it's one of those classic like boiling the ocean problems of like,

445
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,420
I have to find all the problems that I have to inform everybody.

446
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:14,510
And then worst

447
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,250
in about what 99% of the cases I have to educate them

448
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:20,109
if you say to somebody, you know, hey,

449
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,170
it looks like you publish something you shouldn't have to, your,

450
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,609
to your github or whatever, they're not going to understand, right?

451
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:28,469
-- They're going to have to be educated what that means. Uh
-- So actually I'm gonna,

452
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,699
I'm gonna pull an audible on you here and talk

453
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,420
about something that I don't know if you heard about,

454
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,510
but there was a tweet, I'll dig it out.

455
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,400
But basically there was a study done where, where this, it was a university,

456
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,939
hired a bunch of freelance developers and basically

457
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,949
said we want you to write this login system

458
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,380
and like out of 50 or something like four

459
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,810
implemented password hashing. And then, right, like most of them didn't do it.

460
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,260
And of course, there's a bunch of outrage on Twitter and everyone's like, oh,

461
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,000
look how dumb these people are and everything.

462
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,119
But the reality is

463
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,199
why would a developer know this. And so what I did actually

464
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,020
was, I,

465
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,920
I did a search and I said, how do I hash a password into, into Google saying like,

466
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,920
if I was a developer and I didn't know this,

467
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:08,939
what would I do?

468
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,640
And the answer is nothing like everything I found was freaking terrible.

469
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,420
The, even, even when there was advice,

470
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,119
it was not good advice, it wasn't very actionable.

471
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,800
It would say things like, oh, you should hash your password.

472
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,920
Well, what the, you know, wtf man

473
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:24,209
and

474
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,890
I feel like

475
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,270
saying we have to educate people. Well, that's,

476
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,599
-- that doesn't work. Right.
-- I just googled, how do I safely store a password?

477
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:37,430
And it's all aimed at the client side, not the server side,

478
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,670
we store a password on a server

479
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,949
and how do I safely store a password on a server?

480
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:45,550
Oh, dear.

481
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:47,339
Yeah.

482
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,229
Right. It, seriously. Exactly. Exactly.

483
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:53,060
The searches are awful and, and everything is,

484
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:55,680
is horrible for advice here and this is

485
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,959
the, the, the obvious answer is don't use something like Google or

486
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:03,619
zero or pick a service that can manage user, you know,

487
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,160
-- authentication for
-- you not to plug my own thing.

488
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,910
But, so the Blockchain project I'm working on,

489
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,400
we looked at how do we securely do

490
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,170
accounts and account management and passwords and emails?

491
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,900
You can't

492
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,369
and no, no, no even better. So, so the answer is we don't,

493
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,699
you don't need a user name or password to

494
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:21,040
service,

495
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,469
you know, and it's

496
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,719
so, yeah, so if all of a sudden this, this whole huge attack surface and,

497
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,790
and big pile of technology and, and

498
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,640
everything is just the answer is simply we don't,

499
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,310
we business engineered our way out of it

500
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:38,280
and see, and that's part of which is exactly.

501
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,099
And that's part of what I'm,

502
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:42,119
I'm beginning to realize is there are so many technology problems

503
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,160
that

504
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,699
they, well, they can sort of be fixed or they, they can generally be dealt with.

505
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:50,859
But man, if you can change your business process slightly or majorly,

506
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,619
you, you can make certain technology problems just disappear.

507
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,439
Right. Right.

508
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:55,719
And,

509
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:59,969
and user names and passwords are such an easy example because it's super hard to do.

510
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:00,260
Right.

511
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:04,520
And if you look at places like Microsoft or Google or Facebook or linkedin or whoever

512
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,910
the reality is,

513
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,199
they have enormous teams that are

514
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:11,439
doing essentially constant monitoring on what's happening

515
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,280
-- to that data
-- even worse than that.

516
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,469
When you have accounts, you know, have to do account recovery.

517
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,760
So, how do you allow somebody to securely recover their account in a way?

518
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,630
That means I, because I know your name and birthday can't just go gank your account.

519
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:27,270
-- Right. Exactly. Exactly. It's, it's, it's a mess. It's a complete mess.
-- So,

520
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,069
no, it's good time to be alive as a security person. So, I guess,

521
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:34,449
which leads us to sort of, the last thing uh

522
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,329
is a notepad plus plus.

523
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,449
-- Yeah,
-- they're not signing their executables on windows.

524
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:40,520
-- So
-- those of you that don't know,

525
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,859
Notepad plus plus is it's a really awesome text editor, especially on Windows.

526
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:48,050
Like it's, it's literally about the third thing I install on a windows

527
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,569
back when I had windows.

528
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,560
You know, I've never run it before. I probably did

529
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,030
just a very nice text editor and it's free.

530
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,650
You know,

531
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,579
I

532
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,979
honestly, I can't remember the last time I used Windows like for fields, the I'll,

533
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:06,359
I'll play some games on it here and there, but generally speaking, I, I never use it.

534
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:06,930
It's,

535
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,339
it hurts, it hurts when I touch. It.

536
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:12,500
-- Probably
-- haven't used Windows in about five years.

537
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,770
And it's funny because I'm actually going to be building

538
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,109
a gaming PC for my son here come spring break.

539
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,530
And so I will actually need a copy of Notepad Plus plus so

540
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,949
that I have a decent text editor because Notepad dot Exe is not,

541
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:26,859
well, didn't actually Microsoft open or no, that was Calc dot Exe that they open

542
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,329
sourced.

543
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:27,780
Yeah, Cal

544
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,060
dot Exe, I love it. Now I can pop CAL

545
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:30,430
on

546
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,300
window on Linux.

547
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:35,750
But so yeah, so Notepad plus plus, apparently the deal is he wasn't signing his code,

548
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,589
which let's face it.

549
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,750
If you're an open source developer,

550
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,449
you're not going to go spend the money on a code signing certificate because

551
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:41,949
that, that stuff ain't cheap

552
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:46,030
and he was gifted a three, a free three year certificate.

553
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,920
So he started signing his releases like, cool, you know, thank you.

554
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,810
And now

555
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,859
the problem isn't so much the cost.

556
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:57,099
The problem is that Notepad plus plus isn't like a legal entity.

557
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,420
So he can't get a certificate

558
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,040
that says Notepad plus plus,

559
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,689
I, I guess he would have to get one that says his name or something.

560
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,250
-- Of course,
-- that is my understanding

561
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:08,489
and, and the certificates aren't that expensive.

562
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,040
It's what, like 300 bucks or something.

563
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:10,630
It's, yeah,

564
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,670
but still like asking somebody to not only donate their time and effort but like,

565
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,869
oh by the way, you know,

566
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,689
go drop 300 bucks on this thing that honestly

567
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:20,670
it doesn't really have much value.

568
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:24,829
Uh it, it does, I think today because if you

569
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:28,719
look at the ecosystems of, we'll say Mac and Windows,

570
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:30,589
it's not quite the same in the Linux

571
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:33,479
world just because of how the infrastructure works. But

572
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,520
in Mac and Linux, if you don't have a signed binary.

573
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:39,079
It's kind of a pain in the neck to install. Now.

574
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:40,660
It's not like the good old days where you

575
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,239
could just double click anything and it just ran,

576
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,719
-- which is good. Right. We don't want that to be the case.
-- Well, I agree.

577
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,959
So it's funny because again, for the project I'm working on, we,

578
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,829
I actually just got us the CS A set up with Google and Android

579
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:55,979
so that we can do code signing when we start releasing a binary.

580
00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:57,199
Hopefully this summer

581
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,459
because quite,

582
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:02,609
and it's, and it's honestly the security aspect, I want to do security,

583
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,670
but it's more about the ease of use.

584
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:08,380
-- Right. Right. Well, and you can, you can be in the app store and stuff then.
-- Right.

585
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,010
Well, exactly.

586
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,239
And,

587
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,579
and that's the thing I think Notepad plus plus is it's one

588
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:14,449
of those classic situations where it's a good enough piece of software.

589
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:16,050
I will jump through a hoop to install it.

590
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,300
And by and large,

591
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,130
the people that use Notepad plus plus are a little bit technically savvy.

592
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,349
Right. They know enough.

593
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:22,709
Some

594
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:23,959
of them are, I mean,

595
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:27,130
the, the story I'll tell here is, and I, I,

596
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,089
I'm pretty sure I told this in the past on the show is

597
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,479
my dad bought, buys a printer,

598
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:35,459
a Canon printer and he types in Canon printer drivers

599
00:24:35,469 --> 00:24:38,369
into Google and he ended up on a scam site that

600
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:41,369
and thank goodness, he calls me and I just said, just turn your computer off,

601
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,589
like literally pull the plug.

602
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,030
I'll come over later tonight

603
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,910
and fix it.

604
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:49,130
-- Burn it down.
-- Madagascar has closed its borders.

605
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,089
I mean, for real, man, that's exactly what happened. And

606
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,250
it's the same deal where there's going to be people who someone says, oh,

607
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,189
notepad plus, plus,

608
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:59,329
you should install it and they're going to type in notepad plus plus, you know,

609
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:00,750
who knows how they're going to spell it

610
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,630
and they're going to end up on a scam site. And they're now granted

611
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,000
there's no reason that couldn't happen

612
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,199
otherwise.

613
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:08,729
But now

614
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,089
if they say,

615
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,069
hey, uh, it's popping up this thing saying this, this is an unsigned executable.

616
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,770
What do I do? Friend who knows what's going on?

617
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,400
It's like, oh, yeah, they don't sign it. It's fine.

618
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:21,089
Right. Whereas previously that wouldn't have happened now, at the same time

619
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,680
I feel like

620
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,369
I'm sensitive to their plight

621
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:26,859
and I'm not going to knock notepad Plus plus because

622
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,290
this kind of stuff sucks and getting certificates sucks.

623
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,890
Well, and using them is not usually as

624
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,010
fun.

625
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,599
Yeah.

626
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,089
Well, and you got to store them securely and there's, there's so much wrong

627
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,650
with that ecosystem. I kind of get it.

628
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:42,520
But at the same time I don't,

629
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,540
I don't have an answer.

630
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:45,939
I, I think

631
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:48,209
it's too hard to do and it sucks.

632
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:52,239
They're not doing it, which is like, damned if you do, damned if you don't. Right.

633
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,099
That's pretty much what we have here.

634
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,849
No, it's, I mean, the reality is we need this end to end signing.

635
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,599
So we need like the packages to be signed.

636
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,030
But, yeah, asking somebody to do this on their own time, on their own dime

637
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,939
and if it was just a dime, sure. But it's like a couple 100 bucks,

638
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,000
you know, that's,

639
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,420
I mean, there's a lot of open source developers all over the world where, you know,

640
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,619
in some cases, 300 bucks is a lot of money for them.

641
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:13,969
So

642
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,780
totally

643
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,459
and unquestionably,

644
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,160
I don't know what the

645
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:18,380
answer

646
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,729
-- is.
-- Well, I'll pick on this podcast, man, like

647
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:22,489
we,

648
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,660
we pay for this podcast out of our pockets.

649
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:30,069
Like if you told me to spend $300 be like, no, I'm not spending $300.

650
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,579
I spend enough of my freaking money on this thing. Like, no,

651
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:33,890
you know,

652
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:34,130
to

653
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:39,540
-- every episode
-- and it's the same deal. And so I, I don't know if there is a good answer

654
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,140
to this problem.

655
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,780
I feel like this is some people will argue

656
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,949
this is where the Linux distributions got it right?

657
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,469
Because they kind of have their own build

658
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:49,349
infrastructure and they sign things on their own.

659
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,150
And while that's true,

660
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:56,750
the Windows ecosystem is probably several 1000

661
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,150
magnitudes larger than the Linux ecosystem.

662
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,619
So it's just not a practical expectation to have there.

663
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:07,099
And so I, I feel like if I was in notepad plus plus position,

664
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,290
I would do the same thing.

665
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:10,369
Well, here's more to the point if somebody,

666
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,849
if some company actually thinks Notepad Plus plus is worthwhile, they can easily

667
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,209
throw a couple 100 bucks and get the guy a signing certificate

668
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,010
or, you know, this company could read, gift him another certificate.

669
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:22,680
And the fact that

670
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:23,890
this hasn't happened

671
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,630
yet, you know, it's like, so

672
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,079
I, you know, we, we shut, I, well,

673
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,079
I shut down the, the distributed Weakness filing project last week.

674
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:35,260
You noticed because, well, you're sort of involved in it and we talk a lot.

675
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,599
But like, because you told me,

676
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,119
yeah, and like six people on Twitter kind of noticed.

677
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,000
And then

678
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:44,760
the Jenkins guy

679
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,949
because I told him, you know,

680
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:48,640
you're gonna have to do your get commit straight to might or not through me anymore.

681
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:53,089
And that's it. Nobody really seems to care my text or my tweet about that, um,

682
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,319
that printer

683
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,800
or the photocopier deposition thing got way more traction on Twitter than,

684
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,250
you know.

685
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,479
Oh,

686
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:00,670
man, that was,

687
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,920
that was hilarious. I must say,

688
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,599
well, we'll put a link in the show notes but it was basically

689
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,640
what it was is

690
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,959
no, I'm not gonna explain what happened. I'll just set up the premise.

691
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:13,680
So there's basically, there's obviously in court cases, they,

692
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:15,099
they log who says what?

693
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:15,439
Right

694
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:16,619
as part of the

695
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:19,400
process, I guess it was a deposition, right?

696
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,640
And anyway, there's these people who reenact it and this one is solid.

697
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,790
Freaking gold. That's all I'll say. So, go, go to the Sea

698
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:29,979
Notes, hit it up and you will not regret watching the video.

699
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,430
But, uh yeah, I mean, literally nobody seems to care that the DWF is being shut down.

700
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,969
So I guess there's my answer,

701
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:37,609
you know, and I feel like no pa

702
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,050
plus plus would be a lot of people would be sad if it got shut down and stop,

703
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,579
you know, developing

704
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,369
it. It, it's not going to get shut down.

705
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,040
It's like you said, it's, it's,

706
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,579
there's hoops to jump through and it's probably

707
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:51,800
compelling enough that people will jump through the hoops

708
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,060
and you could probably argue DWF was a similar situation where there were too

709
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,640
many hoops to jump through and people weren't willing to do it right.

710
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,680
For better or worse.

711
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,699
Well, part of the reason, well, to be fair, one of the reasons I,

712
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:04,660
I intentionally put some of those hoops in the play

713
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,589
so that I didn't have to spend an hour on each assignment.

714
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,839
Sure. Right. Totally, man. I totally get it.

715
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,680
I, I agree with you 100%.

716
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,859
And so

717
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,760
it is, I mean, this is a topic for another day, I think because we're,

718
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,770
we're basically out of time.

719
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,829
But fundamentally,

720
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,770
if you look at what is the market willing to pay for a

721
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,060
good or an item and we think about security in that context,

722
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:27,459
like,

723
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:29,020
as much as people don't want to hear this and

724
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,849
you're probably going to throw your shoe at your computer.

725
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,234
Uh, the market is basically spoken. We have the security the markets will pay for.

726
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:35,964
And that's

727
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:37,844
right. That's the way it is.

728
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,944
And so if we want something else, like,

729
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:42,035
it's not going to come from the market because

730
00:29:42,045 --> 00:29:45,244
they clearly don't care in almost every situation.

731
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:49,484
Well, part of it is, the market also can't care because I, I can't really,

732
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:51,045
I'll pick on Amazon a little bit.

733
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:51,875
I can't,

734
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:54,650
I don't want to say Amazon has a monopoly but at the same time,

735
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,250
where am I going to go to buy stuff that is as painless as Amazon

736
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,560
because I, I've actually tried to go and buy stuff from, not on Amazon, like,

737
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,400
and I'm like, big people like Walmart.

738
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:08,209
Right. I was, I was trying to buy some T shirts for my kids from Walmart

739
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:11,750
and the process was so painful. I actually gave up and went to the store.

740
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,170
That's terrible. Yeah.

741
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,439
Actually, you know what?

742
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:19,469
I bought some, uh, I needed some I CS, I'm building a task spot where it's, you.

743
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:19,930
Basically,

744
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:21,739
I'm going to build a Raspberry pie that plugs

745
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,839
into a Nintendo and Nes like an actual console

746
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,060
and then can, like, play the games and it's fun to do it.

747
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:29,739
It's something to do with kids. Right. So, anyway,

748
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:31,390
-- for speed runs
-- or,

749
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,670
uh, well, yeah. Right.

750
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,119
That kind of stuff where you can download,

751
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,810
there's something called task videos and you can download like,

752
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:39,109
basically like the button presses and then

753
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,410
program the Raspberry Pi to press the button

754
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,040
and

755
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,189
obviously they're really cool. Again.

756
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:45,069
Look at the show notes.

757
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:49,310
So it basically, ok, so it plays the game for you kind of running a recorded loop.

758
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:49,510
It's like

759
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:49,709
super

760
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,839
-- human way because it
-- can, it's basically a player, you're building a player,

761
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:53,569
piano for your video.

762
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,290
-- Right.
-- Exactly. That's exactly correct.

763
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,310
And it can obviously do superhuman things where you can press buttons, you know,

764
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,920
like 60 times a second, which no human could possibly do.

765
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:02,810
But anyway, anyway,

766
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,599
I needed some, some I CS to do this

767
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,000
because like, there were some chips I needed and I was,

768
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,000
I was looking around and they're,

769
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,010
they're kind of obscure now because they're just an older

770
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,250
chip that used to be used with the Nintendo and I

771
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,660
wanted the exact same chip in the Nintendo just to know

772
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,160
it would work the way I want it to work.

773
00:31:17,449 --> 00:31:19,630
And anyway, yeah, like I had to buy them off ebay

774
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,119
and I'm like, this sucks.

775
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,560
If it wasn't $5 for this stupid thing,

776
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:26,910
I would have totally not dealt with it because it was just, it was painful.

777
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,760
Anyway, anyway, I,

778
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:31,869
I think that is a great topic for another day that was just talking about like the,

779
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,119
how the market and security are integrated as well as something that I know

780
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,229
we talked about in the past it's just like the science of security where

781
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:42,579
it's, it's not just voodoo, like it's market driven voodoo.

782
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:44,790
Well, and the market is broken. Let's be real.

783
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,640
-- The market is broken.
-- Yes, it is.

784
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:50,520
Or is it? I don't know, maybe it's not whatever, it

785
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,680
doesn't matter if it's broke or not. It is what it is.

786
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:54,959
I'm calling this one because we could probably talk,

787
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:57,250
we could spend another hour talking and nobody wants that.

788
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,689
