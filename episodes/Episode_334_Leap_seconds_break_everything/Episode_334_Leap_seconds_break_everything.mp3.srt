Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:09,289
Seyfort and

2
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:10,649
hang on one second,

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:13,229
my partner in punctuality, Josh Pressers.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,829
All that's really clever because we're gonna talk about leap seconds.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,889
But before we do

6
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:21,469
my Google Wi Fi finally died,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,530
-- like, physically or emotionally
-- dead dead.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,290
Well, it died emotionally a long time ago, I think.

9
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:30,010
Well, no, no, no, because I've, I've like, I've had router hardware that like,

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,850
physically died.

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,569
Like the, the chip obviously is like, you touch it and it's like,

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,119
oh, like I burnt my finger

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,209
and then I've had routers that just needed

14
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,330
too much emotional support and they just could not go on with life.

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,970
It, it was dropping a lot of packets.

16
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,450
And so it was,

17
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:49,159
I forget what day it was. But anyway, I, I needed a replacement.

18
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:52,900
So I went to Costco and just bought the middle priced

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,540
TP link, whatever. I don't even know the brand. What model it is, doesn't matter.

20
00:00:57,919 --> 00:00:58,860
And I install it.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,540
And the first thing was like, holy crap. This is fast.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,569
And then I was talking to a friend and he

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,900
basically pointed out your Google wifi was 10 years old,

24
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,500
you're experiencing 10 years of network improvements.

25
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:11,940
And I'm like, oh,

26
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:13,300
I guess I am.

27
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:14,370
-- Well,
-- it's, it's actually,

28
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:18,779
it's funny yesterday we were downloading a game to my son's laptop on Steam and the,

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,529
uh, you know, the download went faster, faster, faster and then peaked at about 15.

30
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,830
And I'm like, that's like, is my wi fi messed up. No, it's just

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,209
the, uh, the SSD on his laptop. Is that slow?

32
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:29,180
There

33
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,519
you go.

34
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:29,930
It's,

35
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,650
although that slow is like 100 and some megabits

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,110
per second sustained for a couple of gigabytes.

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,239
Where in hindsight, I'm like, that's actually not that bad for, you know,

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,650
a mid-tier laptop.

39
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,790
But, uh, it's, it's funny to me now that my Wi Fi is still faster than my son's like,

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,769
laptop hard drive.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,290
Yeah. And I will say I have Wi Fi six now and I have one computer that can do Wi Fi six.

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,260
Holy crap. It's fast.

43
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,699
That's actually I'm,

44
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm looking forward to Wi Fi six because I will

45
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,459
get rid of the physical wires in my house.

46
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,099
I think you could. The latency is about the same as my Ethernet. Like we're talking a

47
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,089
couple percent difference

48
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:12,610
-- and the speed is nearly a gigabit over Wi Fi. Like, it is crazy
-- fast.

49
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:16,410
It's never the speed I care about because as long as I can get 50 to 100 megabits,

50
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,649
you can do everything

51
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:18,729
right. It's fine.

52
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:20,130
You know, for once in a while. Yeah.

53
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,529
Having Gigabit is really nice but by and large 50 to 100 megabits is fine.

54
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:25,929
But the problem is if you get jitter

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,470
or, you know, drops or, you know, like

56
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,089
you,

57
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,080
I call it digital banjo,

58
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:31,410
you know,

59
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:35,500
when the people's audio on a video call just starts getting all twangy and weird.

60
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:37,169
Right. Like digital banjo

61
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,710
and, and that's unacceptable. Like I need

62
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,339
-- what?
-- Yeah.

63
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,589
Right. Right. So, anyway,

64
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,470
I have

65
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,630
new wireless hardware now and because I needed it right away,

66
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,110
I did no research and I just assumed Costco, would it lead me wrong?

67
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:52,720
And they did,

68
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:56,039
they have that one year. We just don't care. Here's your money back.

69
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,429
So they generally don't sell garbage and if they

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,910
do you just return and get your money.

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah. I mean, I have to use a terrible app to configure it

72
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,380
and that makes me sad. But whatever I can live with it.

73
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,679
Do you not remember the Google wifi app that then got replaced by the Google Home app?

74
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,360
No, I agree. And I love now when I test my wire, my Wi Fi speed, you know what?

75
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:20,029
-- It tells me why my Wi Fi speed is. It's good. It doesn't give me a number anymore.
-- Wow.

76
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,149
-- What a great number.
-- There's no more number

77
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,009
anyway,

78
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:23,759
whatever,

79
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,940
whatever it doesn't matter. I have internet. That's all that matters.

80
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:29,619
Life is good.

81
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,460
Right. So, we should talk about leap seconds instead

82
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,220
first. Of all. I wanted to actually take a step back. What's a second?

83
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:37,029
No,

84
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,710
-- no,
-- seriously. What's the second? Because

85
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,940
-- it's how like a cesium atom vibrates like a bazillion times or whatever.
-- Exactly.

86
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:44,770
But the,

87
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,580
the previous, the traditional definition was 1

88
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,619
86,004 100th of a day

89
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,149
of a solar day.

90
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:57,440
And this is, and this is the problem where things get tricky because

91
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,289
vibrations of a caesium atom are like absolute

92
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,190
like that is just a physical constant.

93
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,380
Like it's like saying 10 atoms of iron, well, either it's 10 atoms of iron or it's not,

94
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,410
the problem is saying one solar day

95
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,910
that's not at all constant,

96
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:13,679
not even a little bit.

97
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,059
Um And I was reading about this and I

98
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,089
knew that gravity of other celestial bodies affects us.

99
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,799
What I didn't realize is, for example, humidity temperature,

100
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:25,029
there's a whole bunch of factors that affect

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,700
essentially where water is in the atmosphere.

102
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,040
And so obviously, there's more water in the atmosphere, there's more mass

103
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,890
to the periphery,

104
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,869
I guess would be the word of the earth and it slows down the rotation up a tiny,

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,440
tiny bit.

106
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,480
Whereas if it's, you know, all sort of closer like, well, you know,

107
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:45,760
cons conservation of rotational momentum when you bring your arms in,

108
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,019
when you're spinning and you spin faster.

109
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:47,339
Right.

110
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:48,950
Right.

111
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,059
And so I think this is kind of where things started to go sideways.

112
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,540
-- Right is we went from now,
-- if, if you really want to cook your brain.

113
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:59,790
Remember that Japanese earthquake that caused the Fukushima disaster?

114
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,390
That earthquake shortened the earth day by 1.8 microseconds.

115
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,279
Yeah, exactly.

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,290
So, there's all sorts of events like,

117
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,470
let's be real. If, if the, if the uh polar,

118
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,890
both poles uh ice caps melt that's gonna really

119
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,450
redistribute water on the planet to some degree.

120
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:18,709
Um,

121
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,149
-- mostly because of the heat but whatever.
-- So, anyway, all right, that's enough.

122
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,459
We know what a second is cesium

123
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:27,160
-- atom, right? Measuring other stuff
-- is dumb. That's what it is now.

124
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:31,350
So, but the problem is now we're measuring it in an absolute terms and it's divorced

125
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,350
from the earth rotating around the sun and we still

126
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,070
need the earth rotating around the sun to sort of reflect

127
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:39,369
reality, I guess, would be the word

128
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:40,029
like

129
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:40,410
that.

130
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,149
I mean, it's,

131
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,570
the drift is not going to happen anytime soon and it's not going to affect most of us

132
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,790
that much.

133
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,510
But, you know,

134
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,589
somebody pointed out like if you are taking a GPS signal and it's off by half a second,

135
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,070
that's basically like from here to the moon.

136
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,350
Not, probably not that far, but it's, it's a long ways.

137
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,829
Speed of light in a half a second is

138
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,850
you're gonna be off distance.

139
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:05,899
And, and I did read fun fact, if we didn't have any leap seconds

140
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,890
in 80,000 years, I think the, what we'd be off by a couple of hours, it was,

141
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,309
and the earth's rotation is slowing, right?

142
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,769
We've got the moon orbiting around us causing tidal drake.

143
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,850
Um So back when the dinosaurs were around, it was like, what a 20 hour day give or take.

144
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:22,369
And

145
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,970
so anyway,

146
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,600
so the problem is ok. So we kind of have to keep

147
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:30,799
the seconds and the time in sync with the earth kind of going around the

148
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,570
sun and so on and so forth. Um

149
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,149
Because there are people for which this matters.

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
You know, if you're operating a satellite constellation,

151
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,799
those satellites move pretty damn far in a second.

152
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,230
Right. Well, and we should clarify the importance of having two distinct

153
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:50,049
computing systems, having the exact same time to a very small margin of error.

154
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,220
Right. That's what we're shooting for here.

155
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:55,079
This isn't like if my computer and Kurt's computer

156
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,790
are off by 10 seconds from each other, it really doesn't matter.

157
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,179
But if you're doing high frequency trading on the stock market

158
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,390
-- that
-- probably
-- matters like you're gone.

159
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:05,200
Right. Anyway. All right,

160
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,559
-- we have to remember. This is a security podcast.
-- Yeah.

161
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,670
So for some people it doesn't matter.

162
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:08,970
So,

163
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,220
so what's interesting is traditionally we've done leap seconds and

164
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,130
leap seconds are a pain in the ass because,

165
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,809
and I didn't realize this, they, they can't really predict them that far in advance.

166
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,959
That's right.

167
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,359
It's completely bananas because like AAA group of scientists is like, well,

168
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,720
we need a leap second now.

169
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,350
So we're gonna add one. It's like, wait, what, like, that's how that works. Yeah.

170
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,549
And they try to give six months warning but it's not like a leap year where, you know,

171
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,559
we, we have a calendar going out a few millennia and we know

172
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,279
when those are. That's right.

173
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,929
Although it's funny because people, you know,

174
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,829
mess it up because it's every four years, not every 100 years, but it is every

175
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:42,570
1,002,000

176
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,079
because it's not exactly a quarter, like it's a little tiny bit more.

177
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,890
So you do a leap second.

178
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:50,510
And of course,

179
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,109
somebody wrote software that assumed there were 60 seconds in a minute

180
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,989
and or worse

181
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,269
that time only ever moves forwards,

182
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,899
which typically it does in my experience

183
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,299
and so time sometimes moves backwards.

184
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,350
And for example, back in what was it?

185
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,320
4017, you know,

186
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,799
cloud flare RR DNS software kind of went and tipped

187
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:11,679
over because time is not supposed to go backwards.

188
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,880
They calculate an offset and,

189
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,140
and it literally was one character change adding instead of equals equals,

190
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:17,809
it was less than, or equal to.

191
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,209
So essentially making

192
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,410
the point is this, this isn't some hypothetical like, oh, what if it happens?

193
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,130
Will something bad happen?

194
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,220
Well, nothing terrible will happen but stuff will break.

195
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,220
Well, I mean, how do you define? Terrible?

196
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,609
Like if, if Microsoft's cloud goes down, that's pretty bad.

197
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,169
Well, but it's not like a nuclear reactor is gonna go kaboom.

198
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:43,049
But for example, you know, if enough high frequency trading systems poop out

199
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,219
that we could have a bad couple of months, economically speaking.

200
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,429
Well, and didn't, a couple of years ago,

201
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:51,039
Azure, like, just completely went down because of the,

202
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:51,530
that

203
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,309
was, um, yeah, Microsoft with,

204
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:58,664
I chuckled that because I wasn't using it and it was funny,

205
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:01,755
but I'm sure for any of the customers and for the poor people working there,

206
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:04,494
-- it was a
-- bad day. It was a certificate issue where

207
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:08,164
it was a 300 the certificate was good for one year and, well,

208
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,515
except that year there was an extra day.

209
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,599
Ah, that's what it was.

210
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,719
So,

211
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,250
and, and that again, that speaks to things like LS and crypto.

212
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:16,109
Let's just keep re

213
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:19,280
rolling these certificates every 30 60 90 days, like, constantly so that

214
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,599
-- it just doesn't ever become a problem.
-- Right.

215
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,460
Well, and that's how it works now.

216
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:25,840
I mean, that wasn't exactly how it worked.

217
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,679
I still run across a lot of sites that

218
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,570
obviously spent a lot of money on their certificates.

219
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,200
It's kind of weird.

220
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,210
Why do they do that?

221
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,229
And, and, ok,

222
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,849
I want to add this little bit in

223
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:37,890
because obviously this is not particularly security oriented,

224
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,760
but there are security themes in time.

225
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,239
And I think things like certificates are very important.

226
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:45,380
Like, if you've ever had your clock off by several hours,

227
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,570
it's very common for TLS, connections not to work

228
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,809
because TLS, like you check the times, when was this signed?

229
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,489
When did this key come out? When did the other, what time does a computer think it is?

230
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,640
And so things get weird,

231
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,859
especially in the security universe when time isn't quite correct.

232
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,549
And a leap second is a marvelous denial of service attack,

233
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,780
which is actually the reason we're talking about it because

234
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:10,489
what was it

235
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,580
basically said?

236
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,500
-- Can we stop doing leap seconds because it messes up
-- our stuff.

237
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,179
It messes up everybody's stuff and, and,

238
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,659
and here's the thing when you think about it,

239
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,789
if you're writing code that deals with time and you almost certainly are.

240
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:26,799
Maybe a leap second affects you. Maybe it doesn't. But if it does affect you,

241
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,659
number one, you're going to find out the hard way.

242
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,479
And number two, if you're gonna engineer against it,

243
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:34,000
it's hard because you don't like a lot of test cases and stuff.

244
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,000
Right. It's, it's tricky.

245
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,239
Yes. So there is a really clever solution to avoiding this cost.

246
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,640
Well, we should first say what, what is the current way? Leap seconds work?

247
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,409
They literally, you, you, if you're watching a digital clock,

248
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,799
it would be the equivalent of like 1259 59

249
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,599
1259 60.

250
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,710
That's right.

251
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:53,299
Uh

252
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,250
What comes after 11 o'clock

253
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,940
in my brain? I was saying zero, but I'm like zero is not right. Like what?

254
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,609
That's right. That's right. But yes, you have a,

255
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:08,239
a usually you go 59 to 0. And when there is a leap like you have 5960 0.

256
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,099
So there's literally a second,

257
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,039
no one was expecting

258
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:14,140
that it added to time stamps.

259
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:15,609
And you can imagine a

260
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,890
lot of software falls apart because

261
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:18,869
it is a

262
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:19,549
very

263
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:20,340
uncommon event.

264
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:21,010
Just a simple,

265
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,830
like how many times have you looked through a log file using a red jacks?

266
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,979
That's essentially good for 00 to 59.

267
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,724
Yeah. All right. Right. Because that's how time works. Usually most of the time,

268
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:36,625
the time. That's a good one. So the one of the alternatives is to do a leap

269
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:37,195
smear.

270
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:37,724
Yes.

271
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:40,364
-- And this is what Google does, which is quite
-- clever.

272
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,515
And what a leap smear is, is you basically say, OK, we're going to

273
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:48,400
smear that leap second over a period of, I think it's

274
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,000
tens. It's about like 10 or 17 or something hours.

275
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,640
And so basically you just extend every second by,

276
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,479
it's, it's the Superman attack.

277
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:00,619
You know, I only steal a penny from each transaction, but I do it a million times a day.

278
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,799
And that's exactly what this is.

279
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:06,119
You, you, you add or steal a tiny, tiny amount of time from each second for like,

280
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,200
say 10 hours.

281
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,140
Well, basically nobody's going to notice unless they're operating satellites.

282
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,030
Well, and the really cool part about this is if there's, there's a link

283
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,260
I'll put in the show notes where the Google folks talk about this,

284
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,869
the amount of time they add to each second

285
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,739
still falls within the accepted margin of error from, like, the NPNTP consortium,

286
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,460
whoever, like, big time is in the world controlling all of this.

287
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,429
Yeah.

288
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,049
And that's, that's exactly right because, I mean, we've all had the, well,

289
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,780
I've had the case of, you know, where I turn my computer on RUN NTP.

290
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,809
And it's like, nope, it doesn't work and it's like why it's because it's,

291
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:41,450
the clock is off by an hour and it's like, that's too much of a jump.

292
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:43,909
And then, yeah, within the NTP spec itself,

293
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,150
you can't just suddenly jump like half a second or a

294
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,979
second because obviously something went kind of wrong at that point.

295
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,200
And you should probably have a human investigate.

296
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:51,669
I,

297
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,969
I like leap smears because basically it says

298
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,229
we've got this problem which if we force everybody to engineer for it,

299
00:12:59,429 --> 00:12:59,890
that's

300
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,390
literally millions of people, years of work

301
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:07,239
-- to properly engineer for it.
-- You say that?

302
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,640
But I bet you programming for a leap second

303
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,239
is easier than creating the code to produce the leap

304
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,830
smear.

305
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:17,440
But the thing is you only have to do the leap

306
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,659
-- smear once in the NTP world. And then
-- just,

307
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,979
-- what do you mean once in the NTP
-- world, your NTP servers do the leap

308
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,219
smear and your

309
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:25,984
just consume the NTP time.

310
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:27,315
I see what you're saying.

311
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:29,344
Oh, so you're saying just at some point in the future,

312
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,945
they magically pick up the missing second.

313
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:35,114
Well, for example, what if time dot Near stock up starts doing leap,

314
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:35,755
uh leap

315
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:36,375
smears

316
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:38,075
doesn't care.

317
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:41,674
This is the classic sort of cloud argument of we can make

318
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:44,635
1000 customers do it or we can just have one big entity,

319
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:45,705
do it and kind of resell it.

320
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:46,474
Or in this case,

321
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:48,354
NTP services are typically free.

322
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,049
See you, there's a couple of vendors of time equipment that you know,

323
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:55,859
take a GPS signal, you know, from an aerial on the roof of your data center.

324
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,130
And like you have a little box in your um in your data center.

325
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,739
So you effectively have a stratum kind of 1.5 time server.

326
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,919
Let me, let me explain this back to you because I think I get what you're saying,

327
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:06,929
but I want to make sure.

328
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,900
So you're saying all of the, we'll say time clients

329
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,070
just have no concept of

330
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:13,229
a

331
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:19,530
and you have the time server which understands there is a leap second coming.

332
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:26,159
And instead of having 1259 59 or 1259 60 they just slowly smear it out.

333
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:26,969
And then obviously,

334
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:31,530
when the clients update their time sometime after the leap second occurs,

335
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,650
they're gonna basically jump a second in the future,

336
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,270
but a second in the future is like no

337
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,590
big deal because that happens all the time anyway.

338
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,030
-- Right.
-- Yeah.

339
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,330
Well,

340
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,159
or more to the point if they're getting updates during the leap

341
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,969
smear because like your NTP client doesn't like it connects on a,

342
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:50,390
-- on a, on a more than once a day to the time server
-- when the smear is happening.

343
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,909
If you time it right,

344
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:58,469
the, the time the NTP server is going to report back is basically going to still be

345
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:03,739
the time the time we'll put that in quotes until the leap second occurs. And then

346
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,400
it's the correct second after that moment.

347
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:10,510
And the thing is if a client is checking during the smear, it kind of slowly upgrades

348
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,260
and if it's not checking during the

349
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,869
smear time, like it doesn't, it only checks once a day.

350
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,859
It's hard coded, for example, it's just for the sake of argument then.

351
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:21,590
Well, yeah, you're drifting one second over a day is not totally un.

352
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:23,604
Right. Right. Exactly.

353
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:28,065
And this solves the leap backwards problem and that's a big part of it too.

354
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:28,844
That's true.

355
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:31,604
I think that leap backwards thing because if you tell most programmers, hey,

356
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,784
you gotta make sure time can also go backwards a second once in a while.

357
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:35,965
They're gonna look at you with like,

358
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:39,094
oh man, that sounds brutal to account. It's such OK.

359
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,244
So, and this is now you claim you have a third option

360
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:44,835
and before I, I want to set the,

361
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,739
this has not been very security oriented at all.

362
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:50,030
I think the, the discussion of corner cases,

363
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,640
especially in the context of like the security universe makes sense.

364
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,520
But I first want to hear your secret. Third option.

365
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,219
-- You won't tell me about
-- why do we need leap

366
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:56,650
seconds.

367
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,859
-- We just went, we just spent like five minutes
-- talking what I'm

368
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,570
saying because of the

369
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:03,140
sort itself. So it's simple. We get Elon Musk to throw an asteroid at the earth.

370
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:03,919
It

371
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,099
up and

372
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:04,270
slow

373
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:04,479
down.

374
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,200
And there's

375
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:05,520
a second

376
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:05,729
part,

377
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,510
there's a second part to this. And this is the clever part.

378
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:14,140
We colonize Mars because a solar day on Mars is one day and 37 minutes.

379
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:17,679
And so everybody either gets an extra 37 minutes in bed

380
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,719
in the morning or a 37 minute nap in the afternoon.

381
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,989
Thus, we will have a schism in society of the snoozers versus the nappers.

382
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,729
-- But hear me out because everybody's well rested. I don't think it'll
-- matter.

383
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:31,289
I'm glad no one can see me right now.

384
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:31,780
Oh,

385
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:35,619
-- come on. You got to admit this is a good plan
-- anyway. All right.

386
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,950
-- So I, I want to now use the rest of our remaining
-- time

387
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,719
point of this is the leap smear is the best and really only solution we have other than

388
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:45,580
messing with the clocks.

389
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:47,320
I

390
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,260
feel dumber after listening to that.

391
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,710
So anyway,

392
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,909
I feel dumber for having said it.

393
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:54,719
I

394
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,809
think the more interesting discussion is part of it.

395
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,820
I think time is very interesting and it's its own unique challenges.

396
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,640
But I'm most interested in the,

397
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:06,640
you claim it's not a corner case because it affects everyone,

398
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,479
but it is a corner case in the context of it's hard to test for,

399
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,560
it's not particularly reliable.

400
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,239
So you can't

401
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,839
know it's coming and account for that.

402
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,890
And I think, especially like in the security world,

403
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,589
most security bugs are the unexpected.

404
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:23,209
Right?

405
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,890
And I think this clearly falls within that category and it,

406
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,300
it makes you think about like,

407
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:31,170
how do you plan for the unexpected? You know what I mean?

408
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,890
So, uh on a related

409
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,790
problem is time zones,

410
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,079
time zones can change with very short notice.

411
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,569
I remember there was um, a change to the Argentinian.

412
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,630
They are Brazil.

413
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,550
Some South American company basically decided with like a couple of

414
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,089
weeks notice to change when daylight savings was going to happen.

415
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:48,949
And everybody's like,

416
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,680
just that's such a pain because now we got, I, I remember Red Hat, remember they,

417
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:56,439
we did like basically an emergency critical time zone update,

418
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,619
you know, because I was like, why is this time zone update, you know,

419
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,900
marked as basically critical?

420
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,900
And it's like, because all the computers in this country

421
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,900
are gonna be off by an hour if they don't update it, you know,

422
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,209
Red hat was really good about time zone updates because I,

423
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,910
so I used to live in Indiana.

424
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,900
-- It
-- breaks so much

425
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,760
stuff. Right.

426
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,180
Well, I,

427
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:18,020
so I lived in Indiana back when Indiana didn't observe daylight savings time.

428
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,060
And then Indiana started observing daylight savings time

429
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:22,910
and put itself on the eastern time zone,

430
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:26,199
-- we thought it was a good idea at the time,
-- so be in sync with Eastern,

431
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,719
right?

432
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:30,050
I thought it was a good idea. And then we started following daylight savings.

433
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,050
I like this is the dumbest idea in the whole world. That's another story.

434
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:36,219
And that this was also before we had like a lot of shared calendars.

435
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:40,250
So you can imagine the chaos that ensued trying to schedule meetings and all.

436
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,060
And anyway, Microsoft

437
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:44,819
was very bad about updating their time zone.

438
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,979
And so I remember we switched to time zones and everyone was like, oh,

439
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,890
you just have to change your time zone to Eastern Standard Time now.

440
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:55,890
And like that was the solution. That was the Microsoft solution.

441
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,479
-- But
-- that's not your time zone.

442
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,290
I know,

443
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,729
I know it's not.

444
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:00,030
And,

445
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,959
and this is one of those weird corner cases where

446
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:04,489
for the vast majority of people it didn't matter.

447
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,959
But like if I was looking at computer logs

448
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,040
and I set my time zone to Eastern,

449
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,030
but my time zone really has to be like Indiana because before this certain day

450
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:16,819
there is no daylight savings and after this certain day there is daylight savings.

451
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:17,859
So, you know what I mean?

452
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:18,459
Again,

453
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:21,750
it's that weird corner case situation that really doesn't affect

454
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,890
-- very many people
-- just every computer admin in Indiana.

455
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:26,109
-- Yeah.
-- Right. But,

456
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,680
but it is something like when you are in a field that you have to care about, like,

457
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:34,959
exactly when something happened, like, for example, doing security forensics,

458
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:36,640
it makes a huge difference.

459
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,810
-- Well,
-- what about all the people doing science

460
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,400
in labs,

461
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,939
recording their

462
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:46,800
lab things going on? Obviously, I'm not a very scientific person.

463
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,569
Um,

464
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,290
but to me, the bigger argument and the bigger problem is, is

465
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,130
how should we solve these problems?

466
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,930
And the traditional way we solve these problems is like, well, it's your problem.

467
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:56,849
You go solve it.

468
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:57,560
But

469
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,000
people like Google and Facebook have kind of looked at this and gone.

470
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,479
Yeah,

471
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:04,920
like kind of getting all the NTP servers to do a leap smear

472
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,140
is obviously just getting the political buy in from that is like,

473
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,270
I don't even want to think about it.

474
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,780
But if every major NTP server on the planet does this, then the,

475
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,369
the pro basically just goes away for almost everybody who's not some like

476
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,390
I'm not gonna say corner case because like operating

477
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,760
satellites and hyper concentrating is actually pretty common.

478
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,199
And I'm sure there's some more cases where even being out by

479
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:27,500
a few milliseconds can be problematic for the vast majority of us.

480
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,959
It doesn't freaking matter, right?

481
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:29,199
And,

482
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:33,560
and look when you are one of those kind of corner cases where you're worried about,

483
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:36,050
you know, microseconds or nanoseconds,

484
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,449
you can account for a leap second

485
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,599
and deal with it

486
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,319
as you would expect.

487
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:47,180
But for the vast majority of non high frequency trading situations,

488
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:48,569
I don't think it really matters.

489
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,329
Like, from my perspective on my computers,

490
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:54,219
-- I don't care if my computer's off by five minutes, it really doesn't affect me
-- again.

491
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:55,930
This goes back to the security thing of like,

492
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:58,949
do we kind of force everybody to take them?

493
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,569
Well, a great example is when, um, there's a new potential for default,

494
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,000
like a great example being remember when Red

495
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,449
hat and everybody ship stuff with Telnet turned on

496
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:11,920
and then we started introducing open SSH and how long or not

497
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,560
even Open Ssh back then it was just ssh before you know,

498
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,790
the license went crazy and we got open SSH.

499
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,150
So

500
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,839
there was a period of time where we had both Telnet and SSH

501
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:24,770
and clearly SSH is the better solution on a whole pile of things.

502
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,640
But it took how many years

503
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:28,930
for some of these vendors to turn off telnet

504
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,469
and how many arguments and how much persuading,

505
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,920
you know,

506
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,069
it's ridiculous where it should have just like at

507
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,670
some point they finally pulled the band aid.

508
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,229
But for over those years,

509
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:39,920
there were

510
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,180
hundreds of thousands of people who went into etc id.com and you know,

511
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:48,060
added a pound sign and restarted IED and went on with their day.

512
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:48,380
But

513
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,060
that's like one or two minutes of my time and it's something I can mess up.

514
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:52,949
And it's again, this speaks to the, you know,

515
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:56,689
do we make a million people spend an hour fixing it

516
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,420
or do we make a small team of people do a whole bunch of painful, hard work

517
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:00,959
and

518
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:02,194
it's fixed for everybody.

519
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,555
Well, not only that the magic of NTP is

520
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:08,474
like, no one's paying for it, no one's, you know what I mean?

521
00:22:08,484 --> 00:22:10,635
It's not like one of those services.

522
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:11,635
You could be like vendor,

523
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:14,724
I'm going to write you a big fat check and I want you to solve this problem for me.

524
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:14,994
Well, I,

525
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:16,194
I was actually kind of wondering about

526
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,535
that because there are NTP appliance vendors,

527
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,344
like again with the GPS signal and stuff

528
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:21,234
and

529
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:25,214
you know, do they maybe add a smear mode where you're basically just like,

530
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:26,954
I don't want my data center to have to deal with this.

531
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:28,954
So like I want to click that button and just have it work.

532
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:29,989
I mean,

533
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,430
it'd be cool if they did,

534
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:35,150
-- but I bet they don't.
-- Well, that actually sounds like one of the few

535
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:38,469
useful features that you could be. Like we have this feature that like

536
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:40,839
we made, we made leap seconds go away.

537
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:45,160
Don't ask, but it'll be fine, you know, and as a server admin, I'd be like,

538
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,020
I don't have to deal with leap seconds ever again.

539
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,229
-- Yeah, I'll buy your product.
-- Yeah. II, I can understand that.

540
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,869
-- I
-- feel like this leap smear thing is going to be a,

541
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,920
there's gonna be people who just dig their feet in and scream,

542
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:56,939
of course.

543
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:58,979
And then in five or 10 years it's gonna happen

544
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,550
because especially with IOT stuff and a whole bunch of other stuff like

545
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,719
it probably won't fail, fail. But,

546
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,369
ah, man, I just, it's one of those things where

547
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,780
I would rather programmers not have to deal with it because

548
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:15,339
-- the majority of them aren't that good at it.
-- I, I, I agree. I agree completely.

549
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:16,189
I mean, I,

550
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,339
and we have to put the, you know, what is it, the, the page of myths.

551
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:22,619
-- Programmers believe about time in the show notes because,
-- oh,

552
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,839
yeah,

553
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:23,739
that's really good.

554
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,670
There's a whole pile of stuff where even I was like, what?

555
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,449
No time's not supposed to do that.

556
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:32,489
Like, there's always a Tuesday after a Monday it turns out there's,

557
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:35,069
that's usually true but not always true.

558
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:38,569
It, it has happened a couple of times because what was, was, wait, when did

559
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:40,569
there was the island nation

560
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,609
in

561
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,380
the Pacific that skipped, did they skip from Sunday to Tuesday?

562
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,229
Is that what they did?

563
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:50,439
Yeah, they skipped a day to move over the Dateline to be more in sync with their US

564
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,109
economic counterparts.

565
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,119
Exactly.

566
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,420
Yeah.

567
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,709
There's some funny videos on youtube where people, like,

568
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,869
scrolled their apple calendar back to, like, the year 8, 200 or something

569
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:00,744
and it just starts freaking out.

570
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:05,584
But, yeah, like, back in the early days of calendars they had to just, like,

571
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:09,704
didn't they skip, like, half a year once because it was so messed up?

572
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:09,915
Yeah.

573
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:13,265
The Gregorian calendar and stuff got out of sync and, like, it was basically,

574
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:16,055
like July and snowing, but not because of global warming.

575
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:18,344
Right.

576
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,025
I don't think snow in July is ever going to be a problem again.

577
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:26,469
Have you, have you paid attention to any of the temperature graphs?

578
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,369
Oh, I know. I know.

579
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,030
But it's just,

580
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,869
we're going to get more like we had the rainiest June on record basically here.

581
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:32,589
Yeah.

582
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,239
It was actually, it was funny, We were really wet in June and now we're like,

583
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,430
ridiculously dry.

584
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,380
It's so weird.

585
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,540
-- Anyway,
-- so like, I think this is a great example of the leap second was a solution.

586
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,069
And, and you got to remember this is going back to the 19 seventies,

587
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,040
right? Like it's not, you know, this is, this isn't something like that, you know.

588
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,180
Oh, why were those people so dumb? And why did they do this?

589
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:55,670
Well, it's because they lived in caves and they painted with their fingers.

590
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,400
It was the 19 seventies. And how else would you solve it in the 19 seventies? Right?

591
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,290
There was no big concept of like NTP servers and everything, right?

592
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,030
-- Well,
-- well, not just that, look, there's,

593
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,140
this is also an interesting problem because you

594
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,390
have to understand in the context of progress

595
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,589
before the seventies, before atomic clocks and before redefining

596
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,270
the length of a second,

597
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,160
none of this made sense

598
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,560
and, and it was close enough whatever.

599
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:23,050
And now you have all of this incredibly

600
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,880
sensitive equipment you need incredibly accurate time.

601
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,479
And of course, the scientists are like, oh, we'll just add a second, right.

602
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:30,099
That works.

603
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:35,150
And in the context of highly specialized equipment run by highly

604
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,359
specialized people and there's like 10 of them on the planet.

605
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,199
Adding a second isn't a big deal because you can account for that.

606
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:46,969
But now we have literally billions of devices on the planet

607
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,150
that have highly accurate time sources, which has never existed before.

608
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,760
And now you look at something like a leap second and it's like, well,

609
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,839
-- this is a dumb idea
-- and worse is not just a

610
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:01,094
leap second forwards but a leap second backwards because again,

611
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:03,824
time is not supposed to stop or go backwards.

612
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:04,545
Like that's just

613
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:06,915
if, if a programmer makes that assumption,

614
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:10,064
I am not gonna blame them for mishandling a leap second because that is

615
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:13,185
-- like, that's a totally reasonable assumption.
-- That's right. And,

616
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:14,324
and I think

617
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:19,224
this is one of the funny stories of security is a lot of the security we created

618
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:23,885
was for a small number of people who were very knowledgeable in the, in the,

619
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:27,765
the space focusing on a very small number of devices.

620
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,579
And now everyone has a ridiculously accurate time source in

621
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:35,329
their pocket that can also take pictures and play music.

622
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,989
Like

623
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,410
if,

624
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:40,250
if you would have told people in the seventies this was going to happen,

625
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,109
they would have been like,

626
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,989
no, there's no way like absolutely not.

627
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,199
And that's kind of where we're at.

628
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:48,290
And so I think this is like, this is part of the story of security.

629
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,329
Same thing with time.

630
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,290
It is time pun intended

631
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,420
to like, really look at some like, why are we doing this doesn't make sense?

632
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,660
Is there something better we can do that is less disruptive

633
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,390
and we rarely do that in security.

634
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:04,040
And I'm glad people are doing it with time.

635
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:08,020
I think the problem is if the world changes at, like, 5 to 10% per year,

636
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,079
people don't

637
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,839
notice and that they don't pay attention to it.

638
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,000
But then you think back over 10 or 20 years and it's like what just happened,

639
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,449
right, like, straight up

640
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,750
when I think back to,

641
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:22,589
like,

642
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,099
well, you know, talking with my Children about screen time and it's kind of like,

643
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,469
well, it wasn't a problem for me because we didn't have screens. Like, we just,

644
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,420
we just didn't have screens or internet, like, it didn't exist.

645
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,920
You know what my favorite is, is when you explain to kids that, like,

646
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:44,000
when you wanted to watch a TV show, you had to go to the TV at a certain time,

647
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,560
like, be sitting there,

648
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:45,709
go

649
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,170
to the bathroom

650
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:47,310
staring at it

651
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,589
and, and you'd show up a few minutes early.

652
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,560
So you had to watch whatever crap was on before your show

653
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,339
and they're like, what they like, they don't even understand what that means.

654
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,040
-- It's hilarious the
-- other day.

655
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,160
So, we were basically, I motioned to Felix to make the, this motion.

656
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,099
Ok, Josh can see it on the video, right? So, what, what am I telling you to do?

657
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:09,359
You're spinning your hand? Is it? Hurry up? I mean, is this some Canadian signal?

658
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:13,449
-- I'm in a car, I'm in a car making this motion at
-- you rolling a window down a big car.

659
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,849
Right. Exactly. And my son had no,

660
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,510
I had to explain to my son. I'm like, because, like, why would he know? Exactly.

661
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,989
He's never seen one because I wanted him to, you know, sh goodbye at my mother and,

662
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,410
and I'm like, and I, and Felix is like, I'm like, Felix,

663
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,670
roll your hand roll and he's like, what?

664
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,650
And he's like, kind of shake his hand. I'm like, no, no.

665
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,719
Like you're rolling down a window and he, like, looks at me and I'm like, oh, yeah,

666
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:33,380
you, you have no idea what I'm saying.

667
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,030
Do you? They've never done that or, or now

668
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,989
I love it when old people are like, oh, kids today don't know how to use a rotary phone.

669
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,349
And I'm like, thank goodness they don't, those things were terrible.

670
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:47,739
I know. Right. Actually, it's funny too because my kids are always like, I, I,

671
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,689
when they got their cell phones

672
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,780
and now let's clarify when you say cell phones. Do you mean smartphones?

673
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:53,229
Yeah,

674
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,750
of course.

675
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,339
I mean, they,

676
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,699
they got their SIM cards, they got actual phone numbers, right?

677
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,660
Because this was during the pandemic and we're like, everything's a mess.

678
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,359
We want to get you guys some phones now.

679
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:04,430
That way, just if like, everything goes sideways,

680
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:08,900
we have some communications and all this stuff and we go into the, the store,

681
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,579
we were like, we need to add two lines to the, the plane and like,

682
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:12,510
what area code do you want?

683
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,459
Do you want the same one you have? And I'm like,

684
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:16,369
can they pick any area code?

685
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:20,760
And the lady was like, yeah, like do 12 and the kids were like, why, why do we want that?

686
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,439
I'm like, because it's the best area code and my kids were like,

687
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,959
I don't get it. Why, why is 212 so good?

688
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,239
-- Right.
-- It's the shortest,

689
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:28,670
right?

690
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,599
And I was like, I, I then I do explain a rotary phone to them,

691
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:34,339
explain how you used it to dial and why 212

692
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,800
was such an important area code with a rotary phone.

693
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:39,760
And they're like, we don't care, dad, we'll just take the same area code you have.

694
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,890
But I'm like, no, I failed as a parent.

695
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,760
Well, I was just, I was buying some Zoom phones for the CS A and it's like

696
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:48,969
just unlimited calling within the US. And Canada is the bare minimum feature set.

697
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:49,640
They'll sell you

698
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:53,119
like, and I remember when that was a big deal to add that onto your phone

699
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:53,900
and not

700
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,119
cheap. I mean, anyway, no, I'm not. We're not turning this into

701
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,000
talking about old phones. But,

702
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,415
well, this is a perfect example of like where the phone companies, you know,

703
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:06,435
used to make a lot of money on local calls or billing long distance and realized

704
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:07,685
at some point, like,

705
00:30:07,694 --> 00:30:11,255
especially once they move to a packet network instead of a stream based network.

706
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:12,505
Here's the ugly secret.

707
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,915
Do you know what the number one cost and hassle for most phone companies is,

708
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:20,545
is billing to the point where actually most of it's outsourced to random company.

709
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:22,104
Like there's this Israeli company that does

710
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:24,974
phone billing for a lot of major telecoms

711
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:28,685
because phone billing is apparently such a nightmare that they just outsource it.

712
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:29,314
I believe that.

713
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:31,510
And that's a perfect example here of like

714
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,250
the phone companies instead of fixing it themselves.

715
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,099
They were just like, hey, these smart guys over in Europe or Israel or this,

716
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:41,219
I'm sure there must be a company in America doing it.

717
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,849
Boom, done.

718
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:44,250
Pay them to do it

719
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,400
and they probably handle leap seconds. Whereas

720
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,890
I'm guessing if you build by the minute or bill by

721
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,560
the second most phone companies would not handle leap seconds.

722
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:54,520
So the way that's generally done,

723
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,380
I wonder, I, I bet a lot of them don't actually,

724
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,859
I bet I would not be surprised at all if

725
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:02,339
calls that end on the leap second don't get billed.

726
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:03,209
Well, no, no, no.

727
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:07,290
But here's the problem if you have a call start and a call duration in seconds,

728
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,930
that call

729
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,880
-- start and duration no longer match up with the call, end time.
-- It's close enough.

730
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,359
It won't matter. I, I bet the software's not that smart

731
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,479
anyway, we're running out of time. All right. So I guess

732
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:21,520
my, my, my close on this is just

733
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,400
corner cases, amuse me. And

734
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,650
it is an interesting thought experiment to discuss a weird corner case

735
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,170
in the context of like, what would I do in this environment?

736
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,430
And I think in the case of time, it's obvious that you want to make the problem,

737
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:41,420
just go away for normal people because it creates a mess for them.

738
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,650
And, and I think that makes sense in this context.

739
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,520
And I also get why economically speaking,

740
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,229
I can tilt at windmills and try and get the NTP consortium

741
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,199
to do the right thing which is to do leap smears.

742
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,119
But in the meantime,

743
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,260
I'm probably going to have to fix my own software and that's

744
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,609
just kind of how a lot of this ends up working.

745
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,469
Do we? Do we know? Is there a leap second coming up?

746
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:58,209
I have no

747
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,680
idea.

748
00:31:58,829 --> 00:31:59,319
I don't know either.

749
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,979
But if you look at the Wikipedia page,

750
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:03,560
like they're a reasonably regular occurrence.

751
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,130
-- Well, they,
-- they come and go right, like sometimes there's long spans without them.

752
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,619
It's very strange. So,

753
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,819
anyway, anyway, we'll see.

754
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,750
