Hello and welcome to episode 61 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,470
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,189
Josh Bresser. What's New Kurt?

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,030
Uh, just enjoying my mini staycation at home.

4
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,469
All right. Your vacation ruined by the hurricane.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,079
Yes. Luckily before we left.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,290
That, that's true. And, and

7
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:28,409
yeah, I could see bad things happening if you were stranded somewhere right now.

8
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,090
-- That's fun, man.
-- Cannibalism

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,060
-- being a definite possible outcome.
-- That's

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,720
-- right.
-- That's right.

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:34,810
Oh,

12
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,290
go big or go home.

13
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:38,450
Right.

14
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:40,470
Anyway.

15
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:42,540
Oh, man. So,

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,270
so what's, what's the topic this week?

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,790
Well, I think this week we're going to look at New Meets Old,

18
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:52,869
like when I go and meet my kids' friends or

19
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:53,990
something better.

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,950
Uh, yeah, that would be applicable here too.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:56,700
One

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,159
started dabbing and I

23
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:58,400
hate

24
00:00:58,529 --> 00:00:58,549
it.

25
00:00:58,819 --> 00:00:58,840
I

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,599
don't know why I hate

27
00:00:59,729 --> 00:00:59,810
it.

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,959
-- I just do
-- because it's new and different and it's our job

29
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:04,199
and its

30
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:04,620
point

31
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,139
and there's nothing I can actually find technically wrong with it. It's not like,

32
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:11,910
you know, needle drugs or playing Russian roulette.

33
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,870
It's just

34
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:16,720
-- fundamentally
-- annoying. So, I have a great story for you is

35
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,430
some time ago. My son got into this

36
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,160
cartoon called Slug Terror,

37
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,669
which if you've never seen it would be worth your time watching an episode.

38
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:28,690
And

39
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,050
I remember I watched this with him and thought

40
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,569
this is the single dumbest cartoon anyone has ever made, like, ever in history.

41
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,089
And I'm comfortable saying that today still because it probably is.

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,220
But then I got to watching a couple of episodes with him

43
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,459
and I'm sitting there thinking this is completely ridiculous and dumb.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,129
And then I thought,

45
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,610
I bet this is what my parents thought about all of the cartoons I watched when

46
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,300
I was a kid. Like

47
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,059
the circle is complete.

48
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:53,959
Sorry, I'm just

49
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,250
reading the

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,089
Wikipedia.

51
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,010
It's completely ridiculous for real.

52
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,660
And if you watch it, I guarantee you, it's much worse

53
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,620
when you watch

54
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,750
it.

55
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,459
It's, of course it is.

56
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,959
Ok. Yeah.

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,230
Yeah. No. And,

58
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:07,699
and,

59
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,630
and honestly I suspect the dabbing thing is like a lot of

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,779
what we're doing in the cloud to some of the older,

61
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,160
you know, folks in the management of

62
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:15,339
man.

63
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,270
It totally is.

64
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:19,110
Well, actually that's like I, I just heard a blog post that I published,

65
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:19,860
I think today.

66
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:23,710
I don't know when I wrote it a while back and I, I scheduled it. But anyway, uh,

67
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:30,720
I, I compare a lot of security to a BF skinner in his work with pigeons

68
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,880
which, which for those of you who don't know, I'll give you kind of,

69
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,949
the crash course is,

70
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,899
uh, BF Skinner was a,

71
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:36,570
what was it? Uh

72
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,279
uh So

73
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,809
psychological researcher, I don't know, I don't know what you call it exactly.

74
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,089
But basically he did, he did studies on the behavior of people and animals.

75
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,360
And what he did was he, he,

76
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,589
there's a famous experiment that we often hear

77
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,250
of the word skinner box kicked around.

78
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:55,270
And basically he put pi pigeons in a box and food was delivered at random

79
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:58,059
and the pigeons would do things like, for example,

80
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,550
I think one would spin around and then food would appear.

81
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:03,529
And so the pigeon naturally assumed spinning around made the food appear

82
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,759
and it would spin around and around and around.

83
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,949
And then eventually the food would randomly appear,

84
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,360
even though the spinning around had nothing to do with it.

85
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:15,860
It, the pigeon kind of built its own. I, I guess, you know, fake religion around this.

86
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,759
Well, it, it built a mental model of the world to explain how it works.

87
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,800
-- Yeah, actually that, that. Right. Exactly.
-- Exactly. So it just turned out to be

88
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,080
completely, well, it wasn't technically wrong because,

89
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:30,520
you know, if you spend long enough and food is randomly delivered that works.

90
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:33,490
-- But it's just the causality thing.
-- Right. Right. Right.

91
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,369
And, and anyway,

92
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,720
and then I compare that to a lot of

93
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,190
the security we do today because in all seriousness,

94
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,619
we don't know why we do a lot of what we do.

95
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:43,039
And my favorite example of this is nist

96
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,360
and their password guidance where there's things like,

97
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:45,440
you know,

98
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:49,240
passwords must be 12 million characters and they have to have like three letter

99
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,809
A's and you must use special characters in lowercase and uppercase and this,

100
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,399
that and this,

101
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,529
and when you think about it, it's like, oh, sure, that makes sense.

102
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,550
But it doesn't at all.

103
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:02,770
It's actually that advice is probably worse than not having

104
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,770
any sort of standards for your internal password policies.

105
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,130
The guy that came up with that actually came out and like,

106
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,979
publicly apologized a few weeks ago.

107
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,240
Remember? And I will never

108
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,649
said I'm sorry, it turns out I was wrong. This is a terrible idea

109
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:16,940
and literally to the best of my knowledge,

110
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,369
I don't think this has made a single iota of difference in the industry.

111
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,130
No, it, it, well, I, I think it has,

112
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,359
it's made it significantly worse without question.

113
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:27,320
I mean,

114
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,970
so, I mean, I haven't seen a single password prompt.

115
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,619
That's like, oh, we've simplified things because,

116
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,579
or, you know, anything that's changed.

117
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:37,260
And, well, and you were saying you were talking to some people who are like,

118
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,399
-- pretty adamant about it being
-- right.

119
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,170
I was, I was at a meet up talking to some friends and

120
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,540
it was one of those situations where I mentioned, oh, hey,

121
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,179
did you guys hear about the new password guide?

122
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,040
And they're like, what about it? And I explained the story and they said,

123
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,079
well, that's not true. You know, the password guidance is important

124
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,359
and I'm thinking

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,760
I will never convince these people that they are wrong.

126
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:02,769
And rather than try, I'm just going to nod my head and smile because it, it's,

127
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:06,399
it's a losing battle. But I, I think here's, here's a question I have though.

128
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,000
And this is, this is kind of the topic for the day is

129
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,200
there are always soldiers from the last war

130
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,480
that don't know what to do

131
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,059
once the war ends. And I think with the disruption we see in things like cloud,

132
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,390
the last war is over

133
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:26,070
-- and the new one has,
-- I don't think they even know it's over,

134
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,790
let alone that there's a new one coming

135
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,910
and a lot of them might not

136
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,350
seriously. I, I know ones that haven't. I, I know people in the tech industry

137
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,149
who've never used a cloud service. And by that, I don't mean like set up a fancy

138
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,350
service like Netflix, I mean, like used Gmail

139
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:46,959
or use like a document, like a sharing thing like G Drive,

140
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:50,609
let alone like infrastructure or platform or software as a service.

141
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:51,010
You know,

142
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,589
that does not surprise me. And in fact, I had a friend over a while back

143
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,649
that was saying, oh, my coworkers all want to use uh Google Drive and I don't like it.

144
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:04,769
And I said Google Drive has changed my life for the better.

145
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,089
I, I do not know how I functioned without this thing.

146
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,350
And it. I think about that every day.

147
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:13,350
I mean, do you remember emailing documents around back and forth to each other?

148
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,549
Change tracking enabled in more than two people.

149
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,670
Um, it changed tracking if you're lucky.

150
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,029
I mean, it was horrible. Oh, my goodness.

151
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,989
No, I actually love that the local school system went to,

152
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:27,309
uh, Google Apps, uh,

153
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,630
some years ago. And so I think, I think in grade three they start really using it

154
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,970
and that's how they submit homework.

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,890
I,

156
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,709
yes, I, I see that too.

157
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,809
My, my kids started using Google Drive in grade three for homework and

158
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:45,160
it's, it's marvelous. And actually that's one of the funny things too is

159
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,690
like every kid has the same password

160
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,440
and, and

161
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:49,364
none of them have.

162
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,244
You, you can guess all the logins and stuff and they're basically just, they said,

163
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:57,265
you know, don't, don't do anything you should do. And that, that works.

164
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,725
And part of me, like, as a security person

165
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:03,565
is, is I'm like, I want to jump out of my skin and yell at them.

166
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:04,684
And the other part of me is like,

167
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:05,799
who cares?

168
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,339
Third

169
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,010
grade. I mean,

170
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,359
here's the thing, how do you get an eight year old to remember?

171
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:10,679
Like a really good password?

172
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:15,420
-- Uh,
-- you know what I do actually. So my kids hate me, but they have various web services

173
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,119
and

174
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,519
I use, uh, uh,

175
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,790
my password manager to set everything up and then I set a very difficult password and

176
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:25,000
I read it on a sticky note and hand it to them and they're like,

177
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,399
oh, not another password like

178
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,035
this.

179
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:30,165
I'm like, look, this is what you're gonna get for me if you want my help.

180
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:33,975
This is what happens if you don't want my help, do it on your own.

181
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:37,445
No, I, I do plan to give my kids last Pass. If nothing else, it just makes it.

182
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,975
So actually I was, I was looking at Last Pass the other day and they,

183
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,434
they're looking into creating something called Last Pass

184
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,454
Family or for like 50 bucks a year,

185
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,165
you're gonna be able to kind of do some sinking.

186
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:47,924
And I was thinking

187
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,019
even though I know last Pass has some security issues from the, you know,

188
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,339
tinfoil hat perspective,

189
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,950
I, I think the ease of having that with my Children would far outweigh

190
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:58,269
you can

191
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
do this with their corporate edition.

192
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:00,609
I

193
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,380
don't have that.

194
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:01,720
Right.

195
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:05,359
Um, well, so you can do with corporate, well, it's like most things in life, right?

196
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:08,149
Like families, if you think about it are kind of like a mini, mini

197
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,959
corporation. But you have like your CEO or typically a CEO pair who like rule by fiat

198
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:18,309
and then you have underlings who are basically at the whim of the CEO

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,459
and that's a family, right?

200
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:22,700
Um,

201
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,440
so, yeah, I mean, it, I, that's one like, like I, I look at, um,

202
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,000
like Apple with their family set up for things and you know what it, it makes sense.

203
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,280
My one fear being though is like when my Children sort of

204
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,369
leave and have to get their own accounts when they're 18,

205
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,440
like, are they gonna have to rebuy all their software? Like, how does that work?

206
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:38,780
Right.

207
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,169
Because a lot of these things let you share software and share logins and share,

208
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,359
you know, resources, right.

209
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,179
However, what I've done with my kids actually is

210
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,580
they have email aliases for what will eventually be

211
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,659
their Google accounts because obviously I, I have apps for my domain

212
00:08:56,169 --> 00:09:00,940
and so I just keep signing them up using an email alias. It really just points to me

213
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,539
and then someday I will create legitimate

214
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:06,539
accounts for those aliases and then they will

215
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,690
-- basically inherit all of their stuff.
-- Well, see, I already did that with my kids.

216
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,549
They already have their Google accounts primarily so

217
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,979
that they each have their own calendar.

218
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,510
Ah, that's actually really clever.

219
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,760
Yeah, because part of it is, I mean,

220
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,789
let's face it right in the modern world you're going to have to learn how to use

221
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:26,109
Gmail outlook or whatever version of calendaring software you use

222
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,510
-- because that's how the modern world works.
-- I mean,

223
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,979
I don't know how I could survive with my kids in stuff

224
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:34,109
without a shared calendar.

225
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,590
Yeah.

226
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,669
No, like their grandmother, you know, like, I mean, it's,

227
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,049
yeah.

228
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:40,349
No, it's the only way it works, you know, how else do you know,

229
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:43,070
what everybody's doing or where they need to be or when they're going.

230
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,090
Yeah, totally.

231
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,270
So, yeah, I know. But, um,

232
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:51,080
yeah, no, it's this Old meets New or New meets old, I mean,

233
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,820
yeah, the password thing is a great example because in my mind, uh, well,

234
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,960
for one thing, yes, the,

235
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,419
to me the whole premise of passwords is flawed, right. Passwords are just a bad idea.

236
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,940
You know, ideally you have some sort of two factor authentication.

237
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,739
Didn't Richard Stallman? Tell us that a long time ago.

238
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,210
Yeah.

239
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,250
Um,

240
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,500
more to the point too, you know, and,

241
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,429
and then also just this sort of blindly asking for a password, every single login

242
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,000
I think is also wrong to a degree.

243
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,070
And part of it too to remember is something you and I forget

244
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,440
people use public computers, like at the library or

245
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,619
hotels.

246
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,299
Well, but here's the thing,

247
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,309
uh, they, why,

248
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,830
why shouldn't a website like Facebook

249
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,840
be set up in some way that you can

250
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,099
use it from a public machine

251
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:39,859
-- and really minimize the risk because for example,
-- it has to be done and

252
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,380
it, so actually I have

253
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:48,059
two very funny stories about this is, well, not, not very funny necessarily, but

254
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,539
so firstly is

255
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:51,700
I was just in a hotel this weekend

256
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,919
and

257
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,739
I walked past the business center which had two windows computers in it

258
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:00,590
and people were using them and I just wanted to, like,

259
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,989
open the door and scream what's wrong with you people?

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,679
I didn't, I didn't, I almost did but I didn't.

261
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,299
But then I was also, well on my, you know,

262
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:12,539
whirlwind tour of the south to watch an eclipse.

263
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:13,659
I

264
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:15,460
was at a hotel

265
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,500
and it was, it was a pretty dodgy hotel.

266
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:17,650
There,

267
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,659
there's only dodgy hotels in certain parts of the

268
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:21,419
country and I was in one of those places

269
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,640
and there were these people sitting there and they were part of some group

270
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,429
and I don't, it was a, a sports team of some sort, I forget what it was.

271
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,390
And they were using the computer in the hotel.

272
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,669
And I realized that like,

273
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,390
these were two fairly old people

274
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:42,030
working with some sort of sports group and clearly not from,

275
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,280
you know, the hoity

276
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:43,919
toity area.

277
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:47,349
And I, I got to thinking, I'm like, I bet these people don't own a computer,

278
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,710
they can carry around with them.

279
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,729
Right. And in that case, like, absolutely, I think it is totally expected.

280
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,229
You're going to see someone like that

281
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,200
using a public computer,

282
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,119
which of course, then means you are correct that the,

283
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,820
instead of me opening the door and yelling inside, what's wrong with you people?

284
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:08,190
The right answer is how do we make this stuff work? So let, let's say the computer is p

285
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,940
two ways from Sunday.

286
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,799
How do you make it safe?

287
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,840
-- You don't give them a windows machine, you just buy a bunch of chromebooks.
-- Well, Ok.

288
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:17,359
So,

289
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,039
ignoring that answer, I, you're right.

290
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:23,239
I'm gonna totally agree with you and I think that would be the easy answer.

291
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,099
However, let's just assume

292
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,789
there's a computer that's like, completely pumped

293
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,219
-- right in the lobby, whatever.
-- Who cares?

294
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,260
Hopefully they don't do any online banking with it.

295
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:35,799
Well, well, we have to care today, I think.

296
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,619
No.

297
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,929
Well, ok, when I say we care, I mean, in the sense of you and I don't have to care,

298
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,489
but hopefully somebody like Facebook sets it up so that

299
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,849
Google is a great example, right? I have um,

300
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:50,619
you know, my uh Google two factor authentication set up with the, you know,

301
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,900
application specific password for like my email client or whatever.

302
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,719
And basically Google doesn't care until I like go to a different country.

303
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,659
And then it's like, hey, are, are you sure you're,

304
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,940
you can you please enter your real password again?

305
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:03,739
Yeah.

306
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,979
You know, or on my workstation every like, I don't know, 30 or 60 days.

307
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:11,719
It's like, uh you're trying to like delete or create a user or do something, you know,

308
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:12,710
administrative.

309
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:15,869
Uh I'm gonna need that two factor authentication plugged in, please.

310
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:17,619
You know.

311
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,640
And so for example, I mean,

312
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:23,289
well, yeah, I wouldn't want somebody like reading my email, but, you know,

313
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,020
it's nice to know that when I try to

314
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,340
take an administrative action with my Google account,

315
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,669
typically it's like I got to plug in my UB key and you know, push the little

316
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,890
I was gonna say button, but it's not really a button. Is it

317
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,669
a surface?

318
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,400
I

319
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:35,729
know what

320
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:35,890
it

321
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,940
is. But I, I,

322
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,880
my kids like, do you want, do you want me to rewind this or fast forward this?

323
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,429
And I'm like, that literally makes no,

324
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:43,830
like the fast forward part makes sense,

325
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,989
but the rewind part makes absolutely no sense.

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,119
-- On youtube videos.
-- It doesn't matter because that's just the word that's used.

327
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,159
It's kind of like the, the save icon as a floppy disk.

328
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:57,340
My Children have never seen and probably never will see a floppy disk,

329
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:01,640
-- right? It's just like how it
-- is. Oh, my kids saw USB keys for the first time.

330
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:02,530
How would they not?

331
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:05,559
I realize they never seen a USB key. Why would they, they have Wi Fi

332
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,570
uh

333
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,590
my, my kids need them.

334
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,590
So they, they, they carry them around, which is funny because they,

335
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:12,830
the school say you need them.

336
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,900
But everything they do is in Google Drive.

337
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,619
So,

338
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,789
so my suspicion is that's kind of a rule held over from

339
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,630
the days of your and no one's fixed it because they're like,

340
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,429
oh, they might need a USB drive someday.

341
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,080
It's like they

342
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:24,750
probably

343
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,929
-- hand to have, that's for sure.
-- But yeah, they are.

344
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,359
But

345
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:28,580
um,

346
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,450
yeah, no, this whole thing is just, um, I would say, you know,

347
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,580
ideally you give them chromebooks and, and, and on the service provider side,

348
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,039
like say Facebook or Google,

349
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:42,049
you know, you do things like, oh, they're trying to take an administrative action,

350
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:42,440
like,

351
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:43,590
um,

352
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,960
well, like, pretty much every site I interact with.

353
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,320
You know, if I want to go update my billing information, it's like, no, you're,

354
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,830
you're gonna have to put your password in

355
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,159
again.

356
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,880
And, and in fact, I was just, I was just doing some stuff on github the other day

357
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,590
and

358
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,950
I was amazed that, like, I did some things

359
00:14:58,369 --> 00:14:59,859
and they made me enter my password

360
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,549
and then I, like, took a break for just a few minutes and,

361
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,500
and they made me enter it again and I thought that's really cool.

362
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,150
Actually,

363
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:07,109
I like that

364
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,119
and I think that works well because quite frankly

365
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,390
we don't,

366
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,500
you know, typically we don't do those things,

367
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,700
especially as end users. Right.

368
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,130
Like an administrator might be doing that all day long

369
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,989
and, you know, might have to re enter the password a bunch and, ok.

370
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,099
Well, too bad use last pass, I guess.

371
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:24,200
Um,

372
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,159
but it's, it's not so painful and annoying that it

373
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:28,700
becomes a real problem.

374
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:30,229
Yeah. Well. Right.

375
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:34,700
And I, I think about that too sometimes is the number of times I mess with, like,

376
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,500
my settings or account preferences in something like Facebook or Google or github

377
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,270
is

378
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:41,090
once a year.

379
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:42,315
You what?

380
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:43,565
I'm moving in a few weeks.

381
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,885
So I have to update my mailing and physical address with like,

382
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,794
well, actually I really only have to update it with Amazon.

383
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,484
That's the only one that really matters.

384
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,724
-- The important one
-- because I want my stuff.

385
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:53,854
Yeah.

386
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:56,955
But you still need your bank and your credit card and all that. It's

387
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:58,445
-- a
-- electronic now.

388
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:02,724
-- Uh, Amazon is electronic.
-- Not the stuff I buy from them.

389
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:05,094
Right. I understand what you're saying. I suppose.

390
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,765
Like I want my packages.

391
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:09,005
That's true. That's true.

392
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,979
And I realize now because they don't go through the post system,

393
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:15,650
they go through the Amazon delivery guy in his minivan with his little smartphone,

394
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:16,299
you know, they

395
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,299
my change of address card won't matter. But um,

396
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,539
yeah, I mean, it's, and, and that's always been a problem, right?

397
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:26,359
Is how do we make security good but also not like super duper annoying.

398
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,030
Well,

399
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,219
it's been super duper annoying and the thing I

400
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:33,169
always say is if it is usability versus security,

401
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,380
security will lose every time.

402
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,299
And

403
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,059
I think honestly that's kind of where we are today

404
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,460
is usability. Kept winning.

405
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:44,900
-- And I think if you look at some things, I think it should have it
-- should

406
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:45,770
because

407
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,719
what's the point of having a door with so many locks that you can't get in and out of?

408
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,919
There's no point at all.

409
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,880
And I think if you look at kind of some of the

410
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,479
things like Facebook and Google and friends are doing or have done,

411
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:57,479
they,

412
00:16:57,869 --> 00:17:00,440
I think have embraced that concept of it

413
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,190
has to be usable like usability Trump security.

414
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,239
So, how do we add security to our usability? Not, how do we make security usable?

415
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:07,598
Right.

416
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,469
Yeah.

417
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,969
Well, and part of it too is though, is that they actually,

418
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:14,098
from what I've read of Facebook and Google and Yahoo, for example,

419
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,709
they're actually data driven and they kind of know,

420
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,530
kind of how bad it can get.

421
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,550
Um, you know, the back when he was at Google, what's the guy's name?

422
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,858
There was the, uh, chief security guy for Google and then he left after he

423
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:25,839
stamos

424
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,108
stamos

425
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,459
was at Yahoo for a couple of months

426
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,790
and they gave a,

427
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,459
yeah, he gave a good, you know, a good talk at a, I remember an event basically saying,

428
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:34,739
you know,

429
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,680
like, you know,

430
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:40,449
when you or I have our Facebook account hacked or our bank account hacked even

431
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,069
it's really inconvenient.

432
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,859
But, you know, we'll be ok in a day or two or a week or whatever. Right.

433
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,890
But that happens to somebody in a third world country

434
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,829
and that might be like everything they own

435
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:52,329
their storefront

436
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,719
and, and like, they literally are going to die of starvation now,

437
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,709
you know, we'd like to prevent that,

438
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,170
you know.

439
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,349
So,

440
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,449
yeah, I mean, long term, I'm assuming we'll see a lot more biometrics.

441
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,810
I mean, we've already seen those things like smile to pay in China.

442
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:08,500
I do

443
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:09,930
not know about this.

444
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,349
Do you

445
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,660
think? I

446
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:15,140
assume I can figure it out? Smile to pay. Right.

447
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,359
Yeah.

448
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,040
That's what it says. Um,

449
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:23,719
-- yeah. Oh, it's Alibaba launching it. So they're kind of big.
-- They are big.

450
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,439
Yeah. And they're launching it at KFC in China.

451
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,310
You

452
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:27,540
know what

453
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,660
part of it is though?

454
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,439
And this is actually a place where I think, kind of, kind of having that,

455
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:35,469
that market driven security is impressive is

456
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:37,770
if Alibaba does this, it's going to be fraud,

457
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:39,390
it will not be 100%.

458
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,290
But they,

459
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,729
they probably have a pretty good idea of what their rate of fraud is going to be.

460
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,170
And I, we

461
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,199
-- have
-- pictures of all the people committing the fraud.

462
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,969
Uh, well, ignoring that. Right. Ignoring that.

463
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,579
And you're, you're right. But ignoring that

464
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,209
if the amount of money they're making in profit exceeds

465
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,180
the amount of money they're spending to combat fraud.

466
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,000
Like this is a no brainer, right. Credit cards are exactly the same.

467
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,140
-- Like
-- they're perfect example because like the merchant, you know, the,

468
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,300
the visa certainly doesn't take the hit.

469
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,989
They just pass it on in fees to the merchant

470
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,619
and the merchant certainly isn't going to take the hit.

471
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,170
So they just

472
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:12,969
pass it on in their prices

473
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,369
and consumers.

474
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,630
I mean, I, I

475
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,069
can't imagine living without, without credit cards,

476
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,089
especially with respect to online purchases.

477
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:25,239
I don't think you could live without a credit card.

478
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,810
Uh, you could do, you could set up wire transfers and stuff, but like just, oh, man,

479
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:29,219
it would be

480
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,810
the thing. I love about buying stuff with a credit card.

481
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:34,930
Um Well, great example, being like, I booked a trip,

482
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,920
you know, it got canceled because while Hurricane Harvey just, you know,

483
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,890
clobbered uh Houston Airport

484
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,859
and I phoned the company. It was one of the online big companies.

485
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,750
I won't name it because it's a bit shameful. But

486
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:51,010
the guy is like, oh yeah, why do you want, why do you want to cancel? I'm like

487
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,890
the FAA closed the airport for like four days

488
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,760
and it's not opening till Thursday at the soonest.

489
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,219
He's like,

490
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,099
oh, yeah, I've heard about this. I'm like,

491
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,150
ok.

492
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,199
Ok, sure. Maybe he doesn't watch a lot of news.

493
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:06,540
I, I'm not gonna judge, maybe he's not in America. I don't know. Right.

494
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,209
Um, and he's like, oh, I don't see that your flight's canceled yet. I'm like, yeah.

495
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:14,449
No, it's been canceled, like United said it was canceled because there's,

496
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:15,650
there's no more airport,

497
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,130
they'll cancel it 15 minutes before it's supposed to take up.

498
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:18,890
The

499
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,089
-- airport has been closed.
-- The

500
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,609
best part is he's like, well,

501
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:24,290
I have to go ask my help desk for permission to speak to the airline.

502
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,969
I'm like, what

503
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,609
I'm like, he's like we have to call the airline to cancel.

504
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:31,270
I'm like, yeah, and he's like, and I have to get permission to speak to the airline

505
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,739
-- and
-- this is like a travel agent site.

506
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:38,390
Yeah, it's, it's one of the parts Expedia,

507
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:40,609
you know,

508
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,739
and so he, he,

509
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,640
I'm on hold for 1015 minutes and he gets permission to talk to the airline.

510
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,599
So then we're on hold for 30 minutes and he's like, oh, good luck.

511
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,800
You know, the airline just canceled it because I was on the phone with them.

512
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,900
I'm like, no kidding.

513
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,939
That's what their website shows.

514
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:54,579
And so, you know, I finally got it canceled and I got a full refund.

515
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,020
But I was thinking like, thank goodness,

516
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,540
I paid for this on a credit card because

517
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,859
if Expedia wasn't willing to fully refund my flight,

518
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:03,209
my next step would have been to call Visa

519
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,449
and be like Visa.

520
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,199
You know,

521
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:07,469
uh,

522
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,640
I paid for airline tickets that are not

523
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,280
going to be forthcoming because no more airports.

524
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:15,869
-- Can I have my money back, please? Right. Right.
-- Actually,

525
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:19,739
I remember I had something similar happened to me once was

526
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,869
I bought a gift for my wife.

527
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,869
It was a gift card that at some local spot

528
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,319
and I get my, my Visa bill is Visa as well.

529
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,739
In fact, I get the visa bill and they charge me twice

530
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,099
and I, I called them up.

531
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:34,890
I said, hey, you guys charge me twice and they're like, our computer says we didn't.

532
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,310
I said

533
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:35,880
ok,

534
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:36,599
and then

535
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,719
I hung up, I called Visa, I'm like, they charged me twice. Like, yeah, we see it.

536
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:40,189
You're good.

537
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,000
And like that was it, that was the end of it.

538
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,400
They got,

539
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,439
they got they fixed it all and I suspect the

540
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:47,839
merchant probably got in some trouble in some way.

541
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,099
Well, that would be one of those, uh, a charge back.

542
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,079
And, yeah, that, that affects their rate long term if they get enough of those.

543
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:56,920
But if they go above a certain threshold, they,

544
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,699
they definitely do because visa doesn't want to deal with merchants like that.

545
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,000
Yep. Yep.

546
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:04,099
You know, and the thing is to remember, right? Is these guys have data, right?

547
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:07,469
Like Amazon knows that Kurt Siefried has only returned a grand total of,

548
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,719
I believe two packages.

549
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:12,329
Have I ever something? I don't think I've ever returned something to Amazon.

550
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:13,640
I got too much work.

551
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,400
Well, no, it's not with Amazon. You know what you do,

552
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,349
you go to the website and you basically go to your order history and you say,

553
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,739
like I got the wrong thing and there's a couple of generic options.

554
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,040
Like I got

555
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,699
the wrong thing

556
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,630
unless Amazon sends them into my house and they actually, like,

557
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,599
just take the thing away from me, from my hands without me doing anything.

558
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:34,150
-- No,
-- they don't. You have to put it in a box and put tape on the box. Right.

559
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,859
Well, but you should still have that box and tape because you just opened it.

560
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:39,739
But anyways they, they,

561
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,040
they just give you a website thing and it prints out a

562
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,859
mailing label and then you just drop it in the mail.

563
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,949
That's too much work. I don't want to put tape in a box.

564
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:47,189
Ok.

565
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,569
But, uh,

566
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:52,099
yeah, I mean, that's the beauty. Right. It's like Amazon knows that. Like,

567
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:56,050
I'm only gonna return something if there's a legitimate reason for it,

568
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,229
you know, I

569
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,150
kick you out. If you return to,

570
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:03,079
there's articles about that about people who have

571
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,180
had to legitimately return a lot of stuff.

572
00:23:05,189 --> 00:23:07,140
And Amazon's like, well, we're just

573
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,900
not going to do business with you anymore.

574
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:10,880
And II I get that

575
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,390
it's,

576
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:15,209
you know, and I mean,

577
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:19,310
some jurisdictions have laws that protect customers more and some

578
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,489
don't have laws to protect customers with respect to this.

579
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:21,770
But

580
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,349
fundamentally, I mean,

581
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:27,060
if the merchant knows who you are and they know that you're a pain then yeah,

582
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:28,900
they're probably going to stop doing business with you.

583
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:32,189
So, you know, and that's another example of this whole clow thing, right? Like,

584
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:33,569
yeah, it terrifies me.

585
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,810
I really don't want to one day have Google decide to

586
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:38,030
shut me down or Amazon decide to shut me down or,

587
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,670
or whoever.

588
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,500
Right. Because,

589
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:42,699
uh, well, like cloud flare is a great example, right? Cloud flare

590
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,439
generally doesn't want to censor or shut people down because quite frankly,

591
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:48,540
you kind of have to host with cloud flare now,

592
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,099
especially if you get denial of service,

593
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,579
right. They're the only affordable people.

594
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,670
Um

595
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,079
So if they decide to kick you off their platform,

596
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,380
you're kind of up the creek without a paddle

597
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:03,270
you know, if, if, if I somehow offend the Apple Gods,

598
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,260
uh,

599
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,140
-- I don't have a plan B, is there
-- more than one? I don't know

600
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:10,819
anyway.

601
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:11,930
But,

602
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,579
but, you know, it's in the same vein of, like,

603
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:16,920
pissing off the electric company locally which people have and can do, you know,

604
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,339
by not paying their bills long enough

605
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:20,819
or pissing someone off.

606
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:23,699
Like, if you don't pay your bill, they're going to turn your service off.

607
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,060
That's just like the expectation of humidity.

608
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,369
But they, well, and, and they generally don't make mistakes, but there is the case.

609
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,010
Remember I sent you that link where this lady moved into a condo locally

610
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,219
plugged in her address and didn't want to take.

611
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:38,369
So she ended up plugging in just the building address.

612
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,280
Remember? And then

613
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:42,099
they had her mailing address, correct?

614
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:43,829
Like with her suite number, but they took the,

615
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,810
the building address and so her first month's bill was

616
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:49,150
like $11,000 because it was electricity for the whole building.

617
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,439
See, that's,

618
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,040
well, and then they didn't want to fix it.

619
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,699
And then the best part is they refused to correct it.

620
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:58,099
They're like, you know, go talk to your building guys about a rebate and, uh, well,

621
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:00,910
we'll, we'll sort it out moving forward, but we're not giving you a refund.

622
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,199
They are notorious for that

623
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:03,719
in

624
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,390
various industries. In fact, I, I have a friend one time who

625
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,270
I, I don't know why he did this he should have known better,

626
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,500
but he set up bill pay where the water

627
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,119
company took the funds out of his checking account.

628
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:22,439
And they, instead of taking out like $40 for water, they took out $400 for water.

629
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,800
And he's like, uh, refund me. They said, oh, we'll just credit your account.

630
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,119
He's like no refund me.

631
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,130
And yeah, he ended up arguing with them for a really long time because they, my,

632
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,489
my suspicion is

633
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,729
in order to issue a proper refund,

634
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,890
they probably have to do a whole bunch of hoop jumping.

635
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,469
And so these people try to avoid that at all costs

636
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:42,329
and, and, and not that it's right necessarily.

637
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:45,770
-- But yeah, it, it, it is a pain however now, oh,
-- there's been horror stories with,

638
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,180
you know,

639
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,349
various companies like Verizon and Comcast, you know, uh,

640
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,709
overbilling old people who, like, live on fixed incomes.

641
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,839
That's a whole another topic I think because those people are,

642
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,560
they, they are truly horrible in many ways,

643
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,280
but

644
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,650
to be clear, we're calling the companies horrible.

645
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,339
Not the old people living on fixed incomes.

646
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,780
I'm sure

647
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,520
we don't know that they could be terrible people. We have no idea.

648
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:13,930
-- I'm not willing to, to say they are,
-- we

649
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,170
-- have proof
-- that Verizon and

650
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,760
complex are pretty terrible people.

651
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,500
So, anyway, anyway, let's bring this back to the top again here,

652
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,079
which really was all about security and the fact that

653
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,430
a lot of the security things we do, we have no data. We don't know what works.

654
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:31,189
We don't know what doesn't work. We, we, we, we, we're living in a giant skinner box.

655
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,550
-- Right.
-- It used to work but the world has changed. So

656
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,469
I don't think it ever worked, man. I think we thought it worked because,

657
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:40,354
because it made us feel good or it looked like

658
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:42,594
we were doing something important because let's face it,

659
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:43,875
passwords. Right.

660
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:45,505
Having the password dictionary with all the

661
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,805
common words that people try to brute force

662
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,935
and not allowing like a password of password or God or what is it?

663
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,555
God. Sex, love money.

664
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:56,084
-- Whatever the, you know, from the movie hackers,
-- right. Whatever, those are wrong.

665
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:56,994
Anyway, it's a movie.

666
00:26:57,755 --> 00:26:58,614
But, um,

667
00:26:59,055 --> 00:26:59,824
so I, I, you know,

668
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:02,895
I think it sort of made a little bit of sense but then we took it way too far,

669
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,829
you know, it's like zero tolerance policies, right? Like it kind of makes sense.

670
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,599
So, hey, let's just,

671
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,770
let's go with a zero tolerance policy on this.

672
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:09,930
You know,

673
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:11,680
you have to have a password of like 72

674
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:13,810
characters or longer change it every three weeks,

675
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,229
you know, and it has all these absurd requirements. But

676
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:16,760
here's the thing.

677
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,290
-- Now,
-- none of this was ever grounded in research.

678
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,890
It was just crap we made up because we thought it sounded neat.

679
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,729
Right.

680
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:28,380
-- Well, it definitely dealt with people choosing the word password as their,
-- there

681
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:28,699
was

682
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,020
no

683
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,650
research that's not research even. That's an anecdote, man.

684
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,609
I mean, for real, all of this password advice was plucked out of the air for, like,

685
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:39,469
seriously.

686
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,030
Think about that.

687
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,439
What are you looking at something else to prove me wrong?

688
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,010
Well, it's just, I know I've seen a little bit of research on this

689
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:49,920
just

690
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,560
now, but back then

691
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,500
there was nothing I'm willing to.

692
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,160
I think it was more, it was,

693
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,010
yeah, it was anecdotal in the sense of like, oh,

694
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,140
these people choose password as password and then, you know,

695
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,780
somebody breaks in by guessing password as their password.

696
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,239
So let's ban that word.

697
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,199
And, you know, and then taken to its logical extreme,

698
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:07,839
we end up with modern password policies that are terrible

699
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,459
and more to the point though. A lot of this doesn't matter because,

700
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,579
you know, for example, the majority of people, well,

701
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:15,160
not the majority but a lot of people, you know,

702
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,780
their primary computer now is kind of a smartphone, you know, it,

703
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,400
it's pretty physically secure and lives in their pocket,

704
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:21,540
you know,

705
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:25,619
and a lot of them now have biometric sensor to get into them

706
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,569
debatably worse.

707
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:33,359
Although when their password is 1234, the,

708
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:36,099
the fingerprint scanner magnitudes better.

709
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:36,780
Yeah.

710
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,270
Well, I love that actually, if you try and enter 1234 as a password for your iphone,

711
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,199
it will specifically warn you about that.

712
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:47,489
Does it actually? So my, my kids got, uh, ATM cards, sometime back

713
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,030
and there were a bunch of passwords.

714
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:56,550
I, I didn't test this but the bank guy said, like you can't use 1234 or 4567. Like

715
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:57,369
it, there's,

716
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,050
there's a whole bunch of combinations that won't let you use.

717
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:01,540
Which is,

718
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:02,349
I,

719
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,589
it makes sense. I mean,

720
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,430
I get

721
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:09,069
-- it
-- right. Well, it makes sense in the sense of, wow, we know how broken this is.

722
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,030
So instead of fixing it, we'll just try and

723
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,619
I'm not really fix it.

724
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:13,819
Just

725
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:14,239
kind of,

726
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,709
I mean,

727
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:21,920
uh simple use voice recognition, use a keyboard so you can have a real password.

728
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:22,709
Uh do

729
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:22,989
it like

730
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:24,130
where they have,

731
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:25,319
uh,

732
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:29,589
so in Japan they have ATM S with a thermal camera to read the blood veins in your hand.

733
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,010
Ok.

734
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,290
The advantage being that you don't have to touch anything as well.

735
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,109
-- I don't
-- want to touch an ATM like that.

736
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,300
-- Can you imagine the disease you're going to pick up?
-- That's the

737
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:39,010
-- point you don't have to because it's a camera,
-- right?

738
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:39,420
So you

739
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:39,680
just

740
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,150
hold your

741
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:40,510
hand up.

742
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:41,699
Well, in

743
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,930
Japan is a clean place. Like I would touch an ATM in Japan.

744
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:48,530
But like in the US man, I know I've, I've seen these things.

745
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,849
They, they look disgusting.

746
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,650
-- So,
-- no, I mean, but, but the thing is that, you know, to remember we're asking people,

747
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,890
it's like, oh, I want magical security but only with a four digit pin number.

748
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,900
You know what though. Here's the thing.

749
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:06,310
If, if it wasn't secured, the banks wouldn't be doing it because the banks, like,

750
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,160
it's actually real money

751
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,500
when something goes wrong in a bank, they lose real money.

752
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,119
Not necessarily.

753
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,780
Now it's for example, in Britain there, that,

754
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,640
that was the reason Chip and Pin took off in Britain so heavily back in the day

755
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,319
is because it passed the liability on to the customer.

756
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,040
Because when their accounts and stuff got cleaned out, the bank would say, look,

757
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,000
you have Chip and Pin not our fault.

758
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,260
You must have told somebody the PIN number

759
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,800
and given them your chip card.

760
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:39,479
And I, I, I've heard stories that there have been some fraud

761
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,579
committed with this stuff, but I, I don't know

762
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:43,939
for sure how,

763
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:47,709
-- how rampant that was or if it
-- really is the one in Indonesia

764
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:51,650
with several million dollars withdrawn in like what a 24 hour period.

765
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:52,420
Ok.

766
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:57,030
But if you have something like that, that's obviously like organized fraud, right?

767
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,619
Versus

768
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,459
the way it was working in the US

769
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:02,729
where you had people constantly stealing credit cards.

770
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:04,729
-- I
-- mean,

771
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:08,900
that was out of control. In fact, the gas stations still have freaking skimmers

772
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:10,640
-- because
-- oh, you know what's intriguing.

773
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,839
Speaking of which, so you know how you guys just got Chip and Signature.

774
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:15,719
-- Don't
-- remind me, I hate Chip.

775
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,160
I was uh my local liquor store

776
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:22,119
has a sign up saying that they will not accept Chip and signature only chip and pin.

777
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,640
I could,

778
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:24,790
I

779
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,680
-- quite frankly, right. You can just steal the card and use it.
-- Right.

780
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:30,390
Well, you know, it still ticks me off is like I want a pin.

781
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,920
I have asked my bank for a pin and they will not give me a pin. Just come on guys.

782
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,719
Like I don't want to sign my signature.

783
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:38,170
Yeah, but they'd have to like, you know, upgrade every single merchant.

784
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,819
-- No,
-- they don't. They all work, man.

785
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:46,140
Here's the thing is so, no, no, I've done this. I had a card, I, I got a card with a pin.

786
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,920
I, I had one at one point because I,

787
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,729
I managed to trick my bank into giving it to me when I was going to Europe.

788
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:51,380
And anyway,

789
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,880
uh I that card is now it expired and I got rid of it. But,

790
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,569
but I had a chip and pin in the US

791
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,890
and basically what happens is when I go in some of

792
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,540
them you swipe and then it was swipe a signature.

793
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,300
Some of them I put the chip in and it would ask me for a signature.

794
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,359
But the vast majority of places I was

795
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,979
-- swiping is still an option
-- in some places. Yes, it's terrible.

796
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:14,640
-- And then in some places
-- because

797
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,339
I can't swipe my card.

798
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:19,380
II, I intentionally disabled one of my cars to see what would happen.

799
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:21,410
And so the chip didn't work.

800
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,040
So I tried swiping and it's like no, your card is basically set up to only

801
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,010
if, if there's a choice between,

802
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,680
if there, if chip is supported on the terminal,

803
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,910
then it must be chip, it can't be swiped.

804
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,250
So the guy at Home Depot actually brought out the big,

805
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:35,900
the

806
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:36,839
old mechanical,

807
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:37,520
they,

808
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:38,569
they,

809
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:41,239
well, it's Home Depot man, they once squirreled away in the,

810
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,890
in the self checkout ladies kiosk thing.

811
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,829
And because, you know, at some point they will take your money no matter what,

812
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,030
like it could be the end of the world.

813
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,130
There's no electricity,

814
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,219
you know, the, the zombies are out and we can still chunk your credit card.

815
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,630
That's crazy, man.

816
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:56,479
Wow.

817
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,939
I'm, I'm anyway, anyway, but in the US,

818
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:01,530
the vast majority of places would accept my chip and pin

819
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,619
like it, it just works.

820
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,670
Most of those terminals are set up for chip and pin.

821
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:07,439
-- We just
-- don't

822
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:09,969
-- have
-- it. Well, the pin only verifies locally against the chip, right?

823
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:13,959
It's not, you know, it's not super rocket science, but I mean, you do need a, well,

824
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,790
a reasonably not retarded terminal.

825
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,060
I mean,

826
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:17,469
I, I've actually,

827
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:19,780
I don't think I've seen a terminal in Canada

828
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,939
that doesn't have chip in probably 10 years.

829
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,650
Uh Does it, does it do anything locally on card?

830
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,869
Because my, my pi I had to change it at one point and I don't think the, did the bank,

831
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,170
I actually,

832
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,869
I actually did swipe my debit card last

833
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,670
week because I was returning something to Home Depot

834
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:41,359
and to credit my debit card. They're just like, oh, just swipe it.

835
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,609
And that's the first time in like, 10 years I've swiped my debit card

836
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,349
otherwise I've never swiped it and I don't know where or why. I would.

837
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,459
Crazy man.

838
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,609
Crazy.

839
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,130
Anyway,

840
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:56,969
anyway,

841
00:33:56,979 --> 00:34:01,660
we're talking about economics and security and the fact that we don't have any.

842
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,479
So we just keep making crap up.

843
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:06,260
Well, I guess one of the questions is how do we bring these people back into the,

844
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:06,569
you know,

845
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:09,478
it kind of reminds me of all these people that dealt with buggies and wagons.

846
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:12,789
Now, it's like, no, we got these cool model T Fords.

847
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:17,529
Ok. So, you know what I've thought about this a lot and the only answer I can come to is

848
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:19,197
it's not our problem.

849
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:20,039
Right.

850
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,929
It is up to them to fit into society

851
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,790
and if they don't want to, that's great.

852
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,020
I think the one downfall is there's still a fair number of leaders

853
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,978
who are soldiers from the last

854
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,600
I was at Costco buying a removable hard drive

855
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,458
and this poor guy was trying to answer. This lady wanted to buy a copy of office

856
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,379
and he's like,

857
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,340
uh huh, I, like I get what you're saying, but we, we don't sell that.

858
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,300
We, you know, you can buy a one year subscription to office 365.

859
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,628
But like, you can't actually buy the thing

860
00:34:56,998 --> 00:34:58,069
on like,

861
00:34:58,398 --> 00:35:01,489
it's not like the old times where you bought a CD or DVD and then you, like,

862
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,089
had that copy of software forever.

863
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,858
Plus whatever updates. It's like, no, it's like

864
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:05,739
you're gonna pay.

865
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:06,418
What is, I think it's, uh,

866
00:35:06,428 --> 00:35:10,509
in Canada it's like 99 bucks Canadian per year for five user license,

867
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:11,128
like

868
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:12,708
whatever storage.

869
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:14,079
Uh,

870
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:15,898
and that's it. You pay that yearly,

871
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:21,050
right? You don't buy it, you just pay a yearly rental fee basically. Right.

872
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:25,050
And this lady just could not handle this concept and she wasn't old or anything.

873
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,979
She was like in her probably early forties, mid forties

874
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,810
just could not handle this concept. Like she wanted to buy it on CD or DVD.

875
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,399
And the guy's like, I just know, like, I

876
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,139
can't do that like Microsoft

877
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,129
to the best of my knowledge, Microsoft doesn't sell that anymore.

878
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,929
It's a subscription.

879
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:43,399
Oh, man.

880
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:45,370
Just, just for the record,

881
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:50,129
we could buy a vintage credit card machine for like 25 bucks on ebay.

882
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:54,439
That could be our new theme song. It's just raking them back and forth very quickly.

883
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:54,989
Right.

884
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,159
Hey, I wonder if they have different tones and

885
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,689
-- noise,
-- you know, they do, I'm sure.

886
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,290
And you could probably also put different mediums in it to change the, the sound

887
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:07,699
right here is a future card. We could make music with old credit card

888
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,510
machine.

889
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:08,939
I

890
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,409
know what their

891
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:09,709
name

892
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:11,570
March.

893
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,929
-- Uh,
-- anyway, anyway, so we were talking about

894
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,010
kind of what do we do with these people who maybe

895
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:21,530
don't have the right mindset for today.

896
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:24,669
-- And
-- more importantly, a lot of them don't want to have the right mind.

897
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,550
You see that, that's just the point is

898
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,370
there's, I, I wrote, I wrote an article on my blog,

899
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:33,699
like a million years ago and I think I called it the third group.

900
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,570
And

901
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,899
what it really was about is this came up in

902
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:39,689
a discussion I had with uh actually an old guy

903
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:41,560
who was in my fraternity in college like a million

904
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,500
years ago because he was taking out some leadership roles.

905
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,389
He was asking me questions.

906
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:44,600
But you know,

907
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,560
how do we deal with this and that and this and what about these people and that people?

908
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,320
And it brought back a bunch of memories and we,

909
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,060
we really had a good discussion about this,

910
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,540
but we kind of put everyone in and there's always gonna be three groups.

911
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,060
You've got the group of people who like are gung ho and they want to do it right?

912
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,360
Like they're there and they're the people who are willing to do everything.

913
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,620
If you let them right,

914
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:07,699
then you have the group of people who are essentially like, uh if you ask for my help,

915
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,379
I will help you.

916
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:11,209
But whatever, I'm happy to sit in the corner too, if need be right.

917
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,320
And then there's the people who aren't going to do anything,

918
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,699
even if you ask them for help.

919
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,260
OK.

920
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,969
But here's the thing, the first group, the people who are like,

921
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:20,260
all about getting things done and wanting to do stuff,

922
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,949
they obsess over that third group,

923
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,929
they will spend more time

924
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:28,300
arguing and trying to deal with those, that third group than they do.

925
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,719
Like doing good things.

926
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:30,419
Right.

927
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,750
And I kind of feel like we're in that position here where you've got,

928
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:37,419
you've got the people who understand where the world is going and how it's changing

929
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:38,260
and let's face it.

930
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,689
This is like the whole start up culture is very much in this, this place.

931
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,429
And then you've got people who like,

932
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,270
if you tell them what to do and how it works,

933
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,669
they're going to figure it out and they understand and they know what's going on.

934
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:52,060
And then you have the people who are kind of like those, the stodgy old people,

935
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,219
you know, the soldiers from the last wars we keep saying

936
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,209
and

937
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:56,520
I think it,

938
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,449
if you,

939
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:00,580
if you worry about them and you try to argue with

940
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,139
them or convince them or deal with them in any way,

941
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,260
you are wasting your time, right?

942
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,729
They aren't gonna change the best you can hope

943
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:10,350
for is they accidentally wander into the second group.

944
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:13,370
But the reality is most of them will never change.

945
00:38:13,379 --> 00:38:16,820
And so really, I think ignoring them is the only reasonable, well,

946
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,100
it's the only economic option.

947
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,459
Right.

948
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,510
Well, I, I guess you're right because, I mean, there's still people that, you know,

949
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,629
insist on buying flip phones.

950
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,899
Can you

951
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:26,850
still?

952
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:28,550
Well, it's like checks. Right.

953
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,530
My bank wants, like, it's about a dollar,

954
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,409
it's somewhere between one and $2 to just print me checks.

955
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,679
Like 50 checks. It's over $50.

956
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,290
Except if you're over the age of,

957
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,520
I think it's like 65 you can get the checks at a reasonable price.

958
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,719
The bank, like banks clearly want to get rid of these stupid little pieces of paper.

959
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:48,610
-- I hate
-- checks. You know? What's funny is I remember I was at a store one time.

960
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,250
This was, this is like a couple of weeks ago

961
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,850
and this person started writing a check in front of me and I wanted to just like,

962
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,750
take my credit card.

963
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,260
I'd be like, I will pay for this. Just leave

964
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,520
like, oh my goodness, it was, it was like, and the thing is,

965
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,179
it took them literally less than one minute,

966
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:05,469
but it felt like it was the most horrible experience of

967
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,360
my life waiting for that person to write a check.

968
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,580
And I'm like, oh my goodness. What is like, who does that?

969
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,149
Yeah. Well, and I mean, it's, you know, until things happen.

970
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:15,270
Like,

971
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,780
I remember about a decade ago we had a postal strike and

972
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,570
a whole bunch of old people signed up for online banking.

973
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,469
You know, I was

974
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:22,129
talking to my bank.

975
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:22,570
It,

976
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,439
you know, and I was like, I'm curious, you know, like,

977
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,580
what are the, you know, did this postal strike have any effect, you know,

978
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,919
on bills or whatever?

979
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:33,679
Um, but, yeah, I mean, that's, that, that's the thing. Right.

980
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:36,080
Some of these people, like, I know, I'm kind of the same way.

981
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,520
I still insist on, like, laptops.

982
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,260
Right. To me, a laptop is a computer. I,

983
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,550
I, you know,

984
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,840
at some point I might have to admit that I might get a pair

985
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,969
of VR head glasses or like a tablet or something that will replace my.

986
00:39:49,979 --> 00:39:51,879
I, I do a lot on my tablet.

987
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,129
Actually, you know, what kills me is I really want to go chromebook 100%.

988
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:57,320
But you know what, you know, the reason I can't

989
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,469
is because of this podcast right here because I,

990
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:03,370
I need a real computer to record and edit this thing.

991
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:08,820
I know I've done a bunch of research. There are no good options today.

992
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,629
And actually the other thing I keep thinking, I'm like,

993
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:16,399
I bet I could write a web interface to edit audio and then I wouldn't need to

994
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,459
keep a computer anyway anyway.

995
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,020
Well, you know. No, no, no.

996
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,209
You see you're thinking about it if you were smart, you know,

997
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,850
write some MLRA I

998
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:26,899
to mix the podcast and get rid of all the extraneous noise.

999
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,449
So basically you'd have one or more people just connect to the website.

1000
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:34,120
Yap at it and then magic and comes a podcast,

1001
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:38,949
my podcast editing, you know, honestly, I've got it down pretty good at this point.

1002
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,060
But anyway, anyway,

1003
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,100
so, ok,

1004
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,649
so here's the thing you just made me realize when you're talking

1005
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:47,199
about old people signing up for online banking during a postal strike is

1006
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:48,709
they only did that

1007
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,209
because they now had an economic incentive.

1008
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:51,719
They

1009
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,739
wanted their money.

1010
00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:53,479
Right.

1011
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:56,479
And, and I'm using the word economic, not necessarily meaning just money,

1012
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,419
but like time is part of that economic incentive, right?

1013
00:40:59,429 --> 00:40:59,620
And,

1014
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:02,439
and these old people were probably super nervous about paying their

1015
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:05,100
bills or knowing how much money they have or whatever,

1016
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,300
like, did the check clear

1017
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,360
that,

1018
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,159
that going through the pain of learning how online banking works

1019
00:41:10,169 --> 00:41:12,669
outweighed the pain of waiting for the postal strike to end.

1020
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,229
And this is the same thing of a lot of these, like,

1021
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,669
like old security people we're talking about is

1022
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,479
they have no incentive to change.

1023
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,239
Right.

1024
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:22,919
And if they get fired one day

1025
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,000
they might

1026
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:25,719
learn the new skills they need.

1027
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,760
It might be a bit like

1028
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:27,639
-- that
-- might
-- be.

1029
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:31,959
-- But, but
-- quite frankly if you're 40 or 50 years old in tech looking for a new job,

1030
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,780
that's not a lot of fun anymore.

1031
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,550
Yeah, I, I think about that a lot is,

1032
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:40,570
it's

1033
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:43,330
III I, it's a young person's world,

1034
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,310
I think in a lot of ways and part of me understands why just because, you know, I,

1035
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,750
I remember being young and working like crazy hours and stuff.

1036
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,510
Like that. It's,

1037
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,050
yeah,

1038
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,370
it's, it's tough.

1039
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:58,129
But I guess again, it, it's all about the economics of it. Right. Is,

1040
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:00,590
if you are older

1041
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,310
and you're unwilling to keep your skill set updated,

1042
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,489
why would anyone look at you? Seriously?

1043
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:08,389
-- Right.
-- Well, that's a big thing I've run into is a lot of people

1044
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,350
who have been in the industry forever and ever and ever,

1045
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,350
but have no certifications to kind of show what they know,

1046
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,290
right? And, or they have certifications from 1020 years ago, like an M,

1047
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,149
like, I, I have an M CS E from the NT four days

1048
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,439
and that literally

1049
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:26,070
no, of course, not useless,

1050
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:27,840
right? It's,

1051
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,919
it's beyond you.

1052
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,649
OK?

1053
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,659
So here's,

1054
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:31,100
here's the

1055
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:31,370
thing,

1056
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,979
I'm gonna stop you here and,

1057
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:37,139
and I don't want to have this discussion and here's why is because

1058
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,760
it's, it's the name of this podcast is the open source security podcast, right? And

1059
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,020
here's the thing with the way open source works today and you have github and you,

1060
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,379
like, anyone can have a blog.

1061
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:50,639
I mean, I remember when running a blog was like real work and now,

1062
00:42:50,649 --> 00:42:54,580
like I went to blogger.com and click, give me a blog and I, I have one, right?

1063
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,699
It's not hard.

1064
00:42:56,149 --> 00:43:00,929
And, and here's the thing is certifications I think can have value to show

1065
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:01,770
that

1066
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:06,229
you're young and you're serious about a certain industry or, or something, right?

1067
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,429
Even if you're old, it can have value as well,

1068
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,820
but I think in, in

1069
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,530
a nice alternative

1070
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,739
to some of these certifications can be just

1071
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,810
right,

1072
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,500
write, code, write a blog,

1073
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:19,850
you know, get involved.

1074
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,860
Stack overflow has already done that right.

1075
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,709
With stack overflow,

1076
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,219
they can already turn your answers and stuff into a resume anyway.

1077
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,209
But here's the thing, right is like, I, I've hired tons of security people.

1078
00:43:29,229 --> 00:43:31,850
Do you know how many I've looked at their certifications?

1079
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,040
Zero of them.

1080
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,439
Do you know how many I've searched Google to

1081
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:35,969
see what they've done in the open source world,

1082
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:36,780
all of them.

1083
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,020
And that's what you do with everybody, you mean?

1084
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,500
-- I
-- agree. Right. Exactly.

1085
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:40,669
And,

1086
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:43,199
and so I think the advantage of certifications

1087
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:45,239
is they'll probably get you past the recruiter.

1088
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,159
But if you're working for someone who thinks certifications

1089
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,389
are more important than contributing to open source,

1090
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,750
like,

1091
00:43:51,149 --> 00:43:52,649
you've got a problem, you know?

1092
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:53,389
Well,

1093
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:56,139
something to remember though is there's a lot of entry level jobs where

1094
00:43:56,149 --> 00:43:58,649
they use that as a filter because otherwise you get people who can't write

1095
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,939
and, and I'm ok with that.

1096
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,110
But I think also, so here's the other part of my answer now is like you and I

1097
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:06,320
are old,

1098
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:11,540
ok for this industry, unquestionably, like I'd like to think I'm not, but I know I am,

1099
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,750
I am a grandpa

1100
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:13,659
in tech

1101
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,969
but here's the thing.

1102
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,260
We know a lot of people because we're old. Right.

1103
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:24,300
So, if we want new jobs, we're gonna tell the people we know we're looking for jobs.

1104
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,919
And so now you've got, you can skip past a recruiter.

1105
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:29,840
So I think the certifications are significantly less important

1106
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,739
in that regard for someone in our position.

1107
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,219
Right.

1108
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,879
So, I think if you're,

1109
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,860
if you have that network, yes, if you don't have that network though, you're

1110
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,429
-- up.
-- But here's again,

1111
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,020
if you're old and you have no network and you

1112
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,030
have nothing in public to show for what you've done.

1113
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:45,129
Like, you've done something wrong with you.

1114
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:48,399
It's funny that you mentioned that, but I mean, we just had the whole oracle sls

1115
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,340
thing come up in the last 48 hours. That's right. No more solar.

1116
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,110
And I mean, I, I, that's brutal because I kind of wonder, like,

1117
00:44:55,354 --> 00:44:59,324
obviously, ok, first of all, disclaimer Solaris

1118
00:44:59,544 --> 00:45:02,064
engineering wise. Beautiful, amazing. Right. So,

1119
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:03,054
yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1120
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:05,725
-- It's pain in the butt and it doesn't have like half the software
-- you want

1121
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:08,774
-- is a pain in the butt. It
-- works really well.

1122
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:11,034
You know, it's engineered beautifully and I,

1123
00:45:11,064 --> 00:45:13,235
I really feel bad for some of these people because, you know,

1124
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:16,945
there's probably a ton of people that are really smart code and really useful,

1125
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:17,854
clever code.

1126
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,889
And yeah, can they prove it? Can they, you know, how do they,

1127
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,550
yeah.

1128
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,350
You know,

1129
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:28,459
how do they find a new, you know, job based on their previous work?

1130
00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:30,520
You know, that they may or may not be able to show off?

1131
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:31,050
And,

1132
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,159
and that is one of the challenges to close source man is you

1133
00:45:34,169 --> 00:45:38,040
can be trapped behind a wall and nobody knows what you've done.

1134
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:41,360
However, I must say, I think we've reached a point where, I mean,

1135
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,739
even Microsoft is super open source friendly.

1136
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,729
I think if you're working for a company that's all closed source, like,

1137
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,239
get out because you're in a bad place. Right.

1138
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,399
Well, here's the reality.

1139
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:54,780
If they claim to be closed source, they're lying because it's like, uh,

1140
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,419
what was it that drone maker, the HJ I or whatever it's called,

1141
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:01,939
the one that got the department of Defense warning. Anyway,

1142
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,229
uh There's, you know,

1143
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:06,530
there's all those accusations of them having GP L code in their software, of course,

1144
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,610
people found it and now they've been trying to obfuscate the code and they've,

1145
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,770
you know, released updates that, like are hard to decipher and blah, blah, blah,

1146
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,090
you know, so the reality is, I mean, ii I, there,

1147
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,409
there are probably a handful of people on this planet who

1148
00:46:21,419 --> 00:46:23,729
don't use or touch open source code but they're like,

1149
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,550
you know, so restricted and limited.

1150
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,000
Um, it doesn't really matter, right?

1151
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,080
Like, you know, like the guys who wrote the uh, software for the,

1152
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,209
uh for the space shuttle, for example,

1153
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:38,389
uh is that, is that publicly released? I feel like that's been open sourced.

1154
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,560
Oh, the software itself happens

1155
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:41,199
worst,

1156
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:41,820
I think.

1157
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:43,750
Well, I mean, but in the sense of that a piece

1158
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:46,610
of software that probably doesn't, like, have like open J

1159
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:47,159
PEG or

1160
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:47,729
JJ,

1161
00:46:48,729 --> 00:46:48,750
the

1162
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,030
first part of it too. Right.

1163
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,129
Is so yes,

1164
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:54,090
if you wrote the space shuttle software and let's say it's not released and,

1165
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,790
and I think it's the Apollo software that was released.

1166
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,909
Anyway, let's say it's not released

1167
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,030
if you have on your resume that you worked on the space shuttle software.

1168
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,550
Like, I think that you're ok. Right. Like that's, that's all right.

1169
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:06,169
If you have on your resume, like

1170
00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:07,790
I worked on these Solaris,

1171
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,030
you know, file systems, blah, blah, blah,

1172
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,780
something that was completely closed and nobody knows about it.

1173
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,639
But even then

1174
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,639
there's a certain amount of gravitas and

1175
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,810
in many circles that if you were like a Solaris developer,

1176
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,040
you obviously have a certain amount of skill.

1177
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:21,439
Right?

1178
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:22,169
Yeah.

1179
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,399
And so I,

1180
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:28,159
I guess that's kind of the challenge now is bringing it all back to where we started is

1181
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:32,020
we, we kind of what are our economic incentives that drive what we do?

1182
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:35,850
And this is true of, of all the developers, young and old in,

1183
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,100
in the industry is why are we making the decisions we're making?

1184
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,260
And we, we don't have good answers for a lot of it.

1185
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,300
And I think that's a huge problem and in fact,

1186
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,820
that's something I've started now on this.

1187
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,300
What will probably be a never ending series of blog posts talking about

1188
00:47:49,479 --> 00:47:53,219
like economic incentives behind security and how we can start to

1189
00:47:53,229 --> 00:47:55,979
measure what we do and to do things that actually make sense

1190
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,889
because I, I think, I look, I'm, I'm gonna say it is.

1191
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,870
I think the business has gotten sick of us and I think

1192
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,260
we've run out of a lot of goodwill in terms of security.

1193
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:07,979
Right. And if we can't start showing our value, we're going to be

1194
00:48:08,245 --> 00:48:08,695
the door.

1195
00:48:08,814 --> 00:48:12,395
Well, I mean, if you look at how a lot of start ups are doing security, the answer is,

1196
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:12,665
yeah.

1197
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:14,205
And more to the point I,

1198
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:16,875
I took a security economics course and they point out quite simply,

1199
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:18,074
especially for start ups.

1200
00:48:18,264 --> 00:48:22,635
There are so many real threats that can and will kill you in the next six weeks,

1201
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:24,754
let alone six months, let alone six years.

1202
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:27,784
This possible, maybe of a security breach,

1203
00:48:27,794 --> 00:48:31,304
causing damage and possibly enough damage to bring you down.

1204
00:48:31,705 --> 00:48:33,745
Yeah. It's a possibility. But

1205
00:48:33,925 --> 00:48:36,425
there's like real risks of, like, you know,

1206
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:39,000
there's like rabid raccoons under your desk.

1207
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,489
Let's worry about those first and then worry about, you know, someday,

1208
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,540
maybe possibilities.

1209
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:46,340
-- No, I,
-- I agree completely. And, and I think it goes even beyond that is

1210
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,560
you, let's say you're a start up,

1211
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,600
you probably have hundreds or thousands of legitimate risks

1212
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:53,520
and some of the risks

1213
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:55,169
are going to be,

1214
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,639
you know,

1215
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:59,669
wounding to the point of it will destroy your organization and some of them will be.

1216
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:03,010
Yes, that's annoying. But it's minor and we can still survive if that happens.

1217
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:07,929
And I see security very similarly where there are certain security things, we can do

1218
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:08,590
that

1219
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:10,899
by definition for the security thing to matter.

1220
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:12,500
You'd have to be somewhat successful.

1221
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:14,719
Uh, what do you mean someone successful?

1222
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,169
Well, if you have no customers, you have no money

1223
00:49:17,669 --> 00:49:18,500
if you get a breach,

1224
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:19,429
right? Like,

1225
00:49:20,229 --> 00:49:22,790
you know, it's like if somebody breaches a start up and it's like, oh,

1226
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,239
we got like 100 accounts

1227
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:28,520
that literally is like, who cares?

1228
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:29,159
You know,

1229
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:32,379
and somebody breaches you and they get like 200 million accounts. Ok?

1230
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:34,000
Now, now we're talking

1231
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,659
and the number of start ups that have the 200 million user problem is

1232
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,189
-- quite, quite small,
-- right? And, and you, you, you can grow into a lot of that.

1233
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,429
But I think even as you grow into it, you need to constantly be asking the question

1234
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:48,750
if I do this.

1235
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:50,870
Like, what does it matter? Right.

1236
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:55,889
And, and I think you can look at a lot of things and say a great example is passwords.

1237
00:49:56,229 --> 00:49:56,810
How many,

1238
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,129
how many of these start ups have either insane password

1239
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:01,929
policies for their employees or for the users using them

1240
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:04,209
and they, if they turn them off tomorrow,

1241
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:07,419
it would literally make zero difference for their bottom line.

1242
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:07,879
And in fact,

1243
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:10,129
it might make it go up a little bit because now people don't

1244
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:13,010
have to deal with the pain and suffering of their crappy password system.

1245
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,459
Well, I mean, even more simply,

1246
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:18,939
I prefer to deal with online services that allow me to log in by Google or Twitter.

1247
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:20,610
Oh, man, I agree. I get, so

1248
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:23,820
-- I don't want to make more
-- account. I get so annoyed when I can't use Google.

1249
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:24,649
It's,

1250
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,520
oh, what has happened to us? We, we used to be security people. Kurt.

1251
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,219
Now we're, now we're like heretics. Right.

1252
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,550
Martin Luther Nailing our treatises to the church door.

1253
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:37,570
Well, unfortunately, we don't have anything

1254
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:38,870
to say. That's helpful.

1255
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:39,159
I

1256
00:50:39,399 --> 00:50:41,479
know we complain a lot though. So we get that.

1257
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:42,080
Oh,

1258
00:50:42,399 --> 00:50:44,379
I know. I know. All right. I, I

1259
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,879
-- think we should call it. You got anything else to close with?
-- I hope everybody

1260
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,250
enjoys their kids going back to school because I know I, I

1261
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,350
can't wait.

1262
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:58,360
Those teachers, every teacher is grossly underpaid.

1263
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:03,159
-- That's all I have to say. Like,
-- can you imagine dealing with 30 kids?

1264
00:51:03,169 --> 00:51:07,239
I would, I would have been fired on the third day if I was a teacher.

1265
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,540
I guarantee it, I, I couldn't do it.

1266
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:10,770
I couldn't do it

1267
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:12,679
anyway. Anyway.

1268
00:51:13,149 --> 00:51:14,810
All right. Thanks everybody.

1269
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,580
