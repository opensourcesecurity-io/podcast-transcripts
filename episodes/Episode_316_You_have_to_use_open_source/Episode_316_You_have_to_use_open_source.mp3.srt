00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,500
Emojis one give up.

1
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,510
-- I used to care. I don't anymore. Emojis one.
-- Hello and welcome to the open source.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,140
It's not that we lost. It's just that the, the world moved on from us.

3
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:17,420
-- Like rock didn't lose to bronze. It's just bronze is better.
-- I guess

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,430
-- emojis are better. That's the
-- answer. Mitchell and Webb. Anyways,

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,899
-- emojis are
-- better.

6
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:23,659
There's something

7
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:24,579
whatever.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,500
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

9
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,709
Kurt Siefried and my partner in probably not a crime.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,270
-- Josh Pressers, whatever.
-- You can't prove that.

11
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:39,950
Exactly.

12
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,209
And that's kind of the point of today's episode.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,520
Also, I'm leaving,

14
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:47,009
I'm leaving your first attempt in your first attempt is staying because it was,

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,930
it's too funny.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,889
OK. Fair. Anyway. Anyway,

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,209
what are we talking about? Ok.

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,759
So we're talking about the Note I PC thing where basically one

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,049
of the devs got a bit touchy about the Russian invasion of Ukraine

20
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:04,190
and put it in a code update that as I understand it does a go IP

21
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:05,000
check

22
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,110
like, I guess some external database

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,690
and if you're in Russia or, and I always butcher the pronunciation of this beer.

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,269
Belarus

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,069
is what we call it here, which means it's probably wrong.

26
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,510
Basically,

27
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,540
I think,

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,139
was it,

29
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,660
it originally displayed a warning and then on the second part it wi it tried

30
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:24,750
to arm our f your hard drive or was it the other way around?

31
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,029
I have no idea.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,830
I just know everyone's losing their minds because it's actually deleting data.

33
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,610
Yeah, I think that was the

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,889
anyways, whatever. And again, it's kind of like,

35
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:37,989
yeah, that's,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,110
that's what happens if you just pull down random

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,750
code from the internet and run it without checks.

38
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:48,550
-- Like that is a real possibility.
-- I mean, look, I think there's a general perception

39
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:53,620
that downloading anything from any of the major language package,

40
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:57,580
registries is a relatively safe operation.

41
00:01:58,809 --> 00:01:59,269
Ok.

42
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:04,099
-- Would you say that putting a CD in your system is a safe operation?
-- What's a CD?

43
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,540
Ok. Well, exactly. So

44
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,160
maybe a USB drive.

45
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,580
-- Remember Sony BMG? No,
-- I, I agree.

46
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:16,770
And that was completely ridiculous and they got sued and lost.

47
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:19,070
No, no, they didn't lose.

48
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,330
No, this is one of those situations where they technically lost.

49
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,669
But who cares because I'm going to read it to you. So,

50
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:25,559
the Texas,

51
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,619
the Texas lawsuit didn't matter. It literally didn't matter.

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,699
Class action suits were filed against Sony BMG in

53
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,220
New York and California on December 30th 2005.

54
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:37,139
The New York Times reported that Sony BMG had reached a tentative

55
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:40,770
settlement of the lawsuits proposing two ways of compensating consumers who had,

56
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,820
who have purchased the affected recordings

57
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,649
according to the proposed settlement,

58
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,059
those who purchase next CP CD will be paid $7.50

59
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:50,210
per purchased recording and given the

60
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,850
to download a free album or able to download

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,149
three additional albums for a limited list of recordings.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,050
If they give up their cash incentive district, Judge Naomi Rice

63
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:02,100
Buchwald entered an order tentatively approving the settlement on January 6th,

64
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,610
2006.

65
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:04,089
Now, here's my favorite part.

66
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,899
The settlement was designed to compensate those whose

67
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,070
computers were infected but not otherwise damaged.

68
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,119
Those who have damages that are not addressed in this class action are

69
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,130
able to opt out of the settlement and pursue their own litigation.

70
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,289
How exciting

71
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,759
that's like saying, oh, Kirk got a speeding ticket lost. Yeah.

72
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,800
And I paid it online when I got home,

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,539
like, you know, like for you and me to get $100 speeding ticket is

74
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:26,960
who cares

75
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:31,229
for Sony to get, you know, some settlement but $7.50

76
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,440
per affected customer, who cares?

77
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,419
-- I mean,
-- yeah, but don't forget the lawyers made a fortune.

78
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:37,570
Yeah.

79
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:38,550
Well,

80
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,539
and you, you have to sue them yourself if you want to claim damages,

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,220
-- like you
-- can

82
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:48,460
-- take them
-- to like small claims court in the United States.

83
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,429
I mean, because I think less than $1000 maybe you go to small claims court,

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,559
they probably wouldn't even show up.

85
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,740
You'd win automatically.

86
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,139
Yeah. So if you have less than $1000 in damages. Who really cares?

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,289
-- I mean, just eat it and move on.
-- Maybe

88
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,940
like

89
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,389
so here's the thing

90
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,149
and, and here's the thought experiment.

91
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,940
Let's put it bluntly,

92
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:10,059
let's ignore all the contract issues and let's just cut to the heart of the chase.

93
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,630
Open source developer is something you strongly disagree

94
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,169
with that you think is malicious and nasty.

95
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:15,860
So you opt to sue them.

96
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,059
Number one, you have to prove damages. Ok?

97
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,548
-- Let's assume that you can
-- prove, oh,

98
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,619
no one's no one's gonna sue an open source developer.

99
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,700
-- No way.
-- Ok.

100
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,109
And I'll tell and do you know why they're never

101
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:27,299
going to sue them because they don't have any money?

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,660
Yes, I was about to say there's, they're judgment proof

103
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,019
because I mean, if, if,

104
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,070
if you can prove that you've lost

105
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,950
more than $100,000 somehow,

106
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,510
like if you've lost between 10 and $100,000

107
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,149
it might be worth suing them theoretically.

108
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,540
But until you get to $100,000 it's not really worth even thinking about.

109
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:45,549
But here's the problem.

110
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:48,630
You now have the $100,000 of losses plus the

111
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,640
probably 50 to $100,000 or more of lawyers fees.

112
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:53,179
At least you sue the open

113
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,649
source developer, you win. And I guarantee you

114
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:57,820
almost no open source developer has a

115
00:04:57,829 --> 00:04:59,839
quarter million dollars in assets lying around.

116
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,450
Probably not.

117
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:01,970
I mean,

118
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,029
I I'm honestly less interested in that aspect of this

119
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:08,450
and that would only be one affected person suing them.

120
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:09,980
There are multiple, usually

121
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,929
like 100 times a quarter million is a big number that

122
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,589
let's put it this way.

123
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,700
If an open source developer has those kind of assets,

124
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,549
they're probably on a beach somewhere.

125
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,980
Well, and they're not gonna,

126
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:27,350
they're not gonna purposely hijack their, their library because they have assets.

127
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:30,859
They know they're gonna lose them all in the event. This goes sideways.

128
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,380
So this whole thing is beyond,

129
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:36,334
-- in my opinion because no, no,
-- I don't think it is.

130
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:41,464
I think you're thinking about it in the wrong way. I think here's what I'm seeing,

131
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:42,644
talked about. There.

132
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:43,154
There is,

133
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:48,035
I think the legal aspect of this is interesting from an academic perspective,

134
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:51,785
but I don't think it's a realistic conversation topic at all.

135
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,339
What I'm seeing people say is OK.

136
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,720
-- So it was colors Js and then it was, I forget what the other package even was.
-- Baker Js.

137
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,690
This is the other one

138
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:00,920
F

139
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:01,649
or Js.

140
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,220
And now it's this thing, like, why does this keep happening?

141
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,500
And it's always been a thing, has it though?

142
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:07,750
Yeah.

143
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,019
Over the, it happens about once or twice a year,

144
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:15,619
-- people get all kerfuffle up but
-- we're like on three a year and it's March.

145
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:16,207
OK.

146
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:17,106
The shareware days,

147
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:20,117
how many different shareware had like a virus put in if you didn't,

148
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:20,826
you know,

149
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:24,587
pay for it or some kind of copyright protection that did something malicious.

150
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,627
I'm not aware of

151
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:31,217
very many of those that actually did something malicious. Not

152
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,236
awfully willful malice. Remember that's the key.

153
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:39,307
It's one thing when something dumb happens, it's another thing when you will

154
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:43,813
-- cause damage.
-- And, well, the Sony BMGC DS

155
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:49,973
-- and
-- I agree that was willful malice. And Sony went to court and lost. Right.

156
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:52,394
Like there. That is an open and shut case.

157
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:55,463
This one, if it went to court would be open and shut.

158
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:57,364
It's, it's not important though.

159
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:00,373
I think the real question for people is there's going

160
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,973
to be people who say is my open source software safe

161
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:03,790
to be running.

162
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:07,591
In my opinion at this point is just that question doesn't matter because it won.

163
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,510
But I think for our purposes,

164
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,321
this is a legitimate question. Like why does this keep happening?

165
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,460
So here's the thing,

166
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:17,321
I think part of the problem is people are forgetting the law of large numbers here.

167
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,161
There we go to put it bluntly if you take a billion people.

168
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:22,770
Yeah, somebody's gonna stub their toe today.

169
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:26,721
-- Why do people keep stubbing their toes?
-- How many node packages exist?

170
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,470
Yeah, there's over a million

171
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,140
million. I think it's 2 million now.

172
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,540
I bet it's way more than that.

173
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,829
I think it's about last.

174
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,100
Oh no,

175
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:35,320
I remember when they announced 1 million and

176
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,899
I think currently somewhere between two and three,

177
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,940
my suspicion is it's way higher than that.

178
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,820
And so yes,

179
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,410
that is the key is there are so many node packages.

180
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,619
And I think node also given the way their ecosystem works.

181
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,140
Node encourages very small packages

182
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:54,361
and very small packages and lots of dependency chains.

183
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:58,911
And so what that means, very small packages also mean very small development teams.

184
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:04,161
-- Usually one person, one person can do this
-- actually, usually less than one person

185
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:05,272
if we're a

186
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,252
fraction of one person

187
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,261
-- that's
-- fair.

188
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,111
And in many cases,

189
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,242
a lot of these are borderline abandon wear with one

190
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:14,022
person who's maybe got like 10 or 20 or 100.

191
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,574
I literally took over a fedora package at one point because I needed to

192
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:21,384
change about four lines of code in it to get it to work again.

193
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:22,033
We've all

194
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:22,764
been there.

195
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:25,903
I was not maintaining this thing properly, like I got it working and then I,

196
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:28,433
-- you know, I just ignored it.
-- I

197
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:32,164
just had that happen to me maybe three months ago or someone emailed me and was like,

198
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:33,823
hey, are you still maintaining this package?

199
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:34,354
It's like

200
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:38,903
I haven't committed anything for this package in 10 years,

201
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:44,205
years. What do you think? I mean, I'm clearly not. But right.

202
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:47,684
And so this, I think is the important point

203
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:50,315
about everything we're seeing in open source.

204
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:53,224
I think you can easily make the argument that larger

205
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:56,945
projects can potentially have more structure and security and,

206
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,825
and no one's going to argue with that point.

207
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:02,825
But I think the important part is when we look at, especially the node ecosystem.

208
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,169
There are

209
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,750
an infinite number of points of failure

210
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,919
in nearly any project.

211
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:12,369
And so someone will say, oh, but some important project depended on this one.

212
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,359
Everything depends on everything in the node world.

213
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:19,590
It's common to have hundreds to thousands of dependencies.

214
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:23,809
Well, and let's go on a quick tangent for a moment. But let's say for the moment

215
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,369
that I changed my code so that nobody in country X can run it.

216
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:31,130
Like I don't do something like, you know, actively

217
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,539
damaging to their computer. I just say like,

218
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,109
you know, if you're part of this IP block don't run.

219
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,330
OK? And you can argue that's malicious but whatever, let's ignore that for a moment.

220
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,919
Now, here's the thing. So what are people in that country going to do?

221
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,989
Well, they can basically

222
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,539
ignore the license fork,

223
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:51,320
the code and kind of grab it and take it themselves and start using it, right?

224
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:55,239
And here's the thing from my perspective as a developer,

225
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,979
that's my everyday. That's normal. That's what's going on.

226
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:00,900
People are grabbing my stuff and giving me nothing in return.

227
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:01,780
-- Yeah, I mean,
-- that's how

228
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,309
sources works though, right?

229
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:07,200
And that's why so often these, you know, successful programs like

230
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,969
NSA, for example, great example, this guy,

231
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:12,719
French guy Renaud poured his heart and soul into this piece of software and it is,

232
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,520
it was one of the best security scanners

233
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,159
and a ton of companies made a ton of money

234
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:19,669
off of it and he got exactly nothing in return.

235
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,330
And so he went, well, saw this and he basically stopped kind of working on it.

236
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,200
Open source wise, commercial and, and took it commercial

237
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,650
so he could, like, eat food.

238
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:31,309
Yes. And I, I support his decision to do that 100%.

239
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,510
I mean, it really sucked because it was a great tool.

240
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,450
And now it's, you know, the, the, the plugins and libraries where um you,

241
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:39,559
it was anyway, Tanba owns it.

242
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,030
Now.

243
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,390
It was nice when it was open source.

244
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,039
It was less nice when it was closed source or not closed, whatever.

245
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,679
But the point is from

246
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:49,520
99.9% of developers viewpoints.

247
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,440
I wrote this thing, I released it to the world and

248
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,770
well, I got exactly nothing in return and that's normal.

249
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,950
And so for their perspective, when those people are like, oh you know, if people,

250
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,419
if you do something stupid with your code,

251
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:03,510
people will get angry at you and like fork it or whatever.

252
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,989
And it's like that, that's already how they live their life.

253
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,669
Like they're not getting anything helpful in return from these people

254
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,090
the majority of the time that's not a useful threat.

255
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:13,450
I don't understand what the point of this tangent is.

256
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,859
The point is that one of the main arguments was that if you do this, the,

257
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,390
the community will reject you and will stop helping you.

258
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:23,234
And I'm like the community already has stopped helping most of these people.

259
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:25,474
That's why they're getting ticked off and doing these things.

260
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,635
-- Like that's why the color and faker guy did this. I
-- mean, that's a moot point.

261
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,465
I think, I don't think that's realistic as, as an excuse.

262
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:35,614
I think there's this perception sometimes that there's way more cooper

263
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,114
operation in the open source world than there really is.

264
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:42,715
I think for the vast majority of, of libraries and applications,

265
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:45,434
it's one or two people and nobody helps.

266
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,155
It's just,

267
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:49,880
it always, it always amuses me when people talk about the community

268
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,210
and it's like it,

269
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:55,239
you have to build a community community doesn't just show up like there is no,

270
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,859
the community that will come and do a bunch of work for free.

271
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,739
The community is

272
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:04,130
hundreds and hundreds of hours of enormous effort to build.

273
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,320
I mean,

274
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,820
we're seeing this with the GSD project we're working on like

275
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,659
it is a phenomenal amount of effort to bootstrap a community

276
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:14,070
where III I knew this at the beginning and I'm not

277
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,309
at all surprised by how much work it's it is.

278
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,299
People seem to think there's a whole bunch of

279
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,820
magic resourcing out there just wanting to help but somehow not being allowed to or

280
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,289
not like a perfect example. OK.

281
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:29,710
I'm looking at this one random N PM package, 87 million weekly downloads

282
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,179
for collaborators.

283
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,859
That's normal. That's how N PM works, man.

284
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,429
Well, now remember too,

285
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:40,599
there's another angle to this that makes N PM kind of wonky is N PM.

286
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:45,739
Also heavily relies on things like C I CD and unit testing and all that jazz.

287
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:46,539
So

288
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,700
the number of actual downloads,

289
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,710
most of this stuff has is actually a really small number.

290
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:55,979
-- Most of that is like C I CD Magic but
-- still 90 million is a lot.

291
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:57,510
It is. No, II I agree.

292
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,380
It's, it's definitely a popular package.

293
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:03,880
-- I also just found one that had five,
-- 5 million or five downloads. No,

294
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,500
five,

295
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:07,260
-- like 1234,
-- five. I mean, ok,

296
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,299
but when you have millions and millions of

297
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:12,913
-- packages, that, that's the long tail.
-- Right?

298
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:16,442
Anyways, what frustrates me is that this is rare enough.

299
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:18,932
It's like a plane crash that it actually makes the news

300
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:20,833
and that I think is kind of a good sign.

301
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,432
This is literally rare enough that every time it happens

302
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,432
we talk about it on Twitter for like two weeks.

303
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:25,963
Well,

304
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:29,593
and I think there's another part of this that often gets lost and

305
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:33,872
I talk about all the time whenever this happens is I view the

306
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,245
open source universe,

307
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:40,625
especially the security goons as a sort of like immune system for the internet.

308
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:43,685
Now, when, when a pathogen attacks you,

309
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:47,635
like the immune system doesn't immediately get the pathogen, right?

310
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:49,245
It takes a little time.

311
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:50,926
And so any time there is,

312
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:54,966
uh let's say malicious package or security event or whatever,

313
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:57,486
there's going to be some lag time between

314
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:02,429
something being back doored or hacked or whatnot and everyone figuring it out.

315
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,830
And, but I think if you look at open source,

316
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,580
this happens pretty fast for the most part.

317
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,090
I don't think there's many examples of this taking months

318
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,830
and months and months for someone to sort out.

319
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,950
Whereas you can read some of these stories of close source and

320
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,169
it takes like sometimes years for someone to sort this out.

321
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,760
I think there are a few, a handful of ones that take weeks or months to sort,

322
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,349
but usually there are things that like nobody cares about or uses.

323
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,039
So it's literally,

324
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:27,280
it's like the case.

325
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:29,549
So if I found I was downloading security advisors from a

326
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,729
vendor and a Linux vendor and they had like three broken links

327
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:33,799
in their page

328
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,640
and I

329
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,239
tell them and they're like, oh yeah, we'll fix that. Sure. Done. Click.

330
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,669
-- And like nobody had complained in the one page was from 2015. Well,
-- look, man,

331
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:47,219
the GSD project is the first organization.

332
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:49,669
I think that's actually looking at a lot of this data.

333
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,719
And so we're going to find a lot of that, but you're right. It doesn't really care.

334
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:53,799
It doesn't really matter.

335
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:54,919
Well. Exactly.

336
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:59,710
And I think so, like if, if a flaw happens in a tree that only two people care about

337
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,349
well, and, and that's just it.

338
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:06,080
Right, you're gonna see backdoors and malicious code in

339
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:10,359
little use software and now, I'm not saying that's not important because if,

340
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,549
if it's a targeted attack and you're one of

341
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,549
the four organizations on the planet using it,

342
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,760
like you have a problem.

343
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,390
But I think generally speaking,

344
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,900
when you have a relatively well used piece of software,

345
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:23,039
as soon as something like this goes down,

346
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:25,919
it's noticed pretty quickly and I think this

347
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,190
is one of the superpowers open source has,

348
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,960
is the lead time between bad thing being inserted

349
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:33,549
and bad thing being found is pretty small.

350
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,239
I think it's more important than that. In that

351
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,299
with open source,

352
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,210
there are

353
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:39,359
very

354
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:43,960
visible public feedback channels that cannot be

355
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:45,880
ignored or rather if they are ignored,

356
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,400
somebody forks the project on github

357
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:50,349
and says I am the new real color dot Js

358
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:52,559
and everybody goes OK. Cool. Yeah.

359
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,640
Yeah, we trust you more than that weird guy that did that weird thing to the program,

360
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:55,840
right?

361
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,900
And that's the thing like these feedback loops matter and

362
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:01,039
they don't exist in close source because in close source,

363
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,039
you submit a bug.

364
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:04,979
Yeah, I, I don't know what step two is like, step two is whatever the company decides.

365
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:05,679
It is. Good luck.

366
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:08,703
And if you don't like it, you can take it on Twitter maybe.

367
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:11,052
But especially like in the sort of github

368
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:14,132
that, you know, structured ecosystem with issues and stuff,

369
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:17,442
it's really easy to file an issue, get it made public, put it out on Twitter.

370
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,533
And even if the upstream tries to ignore it.

371
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:24,103
They can't, or rather the community will not ignore it if it matters.

372
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:25,533
Like in this case.

373
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:29,653
And I think that's one of the differences is it's less about the many eyes.

374
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:31,023
These open source bugs are visible.

375
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,585
I think it's more that with this open source in structure,

376
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:36,625
once the bug or the prom is discovered, it cannot be ignored.

377
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:37,575
-- I mean,
-- you know what,

378
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:41,705
I think that is a better rule than Linus's law because of the whole,

379
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:44,265
with many eyeballs, all bugs are shallow, which,

380
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:46,245
which ironically I've read something that, as

381
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:50,065
people look, it, it, it does and it's, I think history is shown it.

382
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,426
It's not the case, but you're right. I think

383
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:54,495
-- it can't be ignored. Well,
-- like tab, so

384
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:59,385
he put out this thing with the whole, um, uh, what was it? The square root

385
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,270
something, something square roots certificates. I don't know, whatever.

386
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,000
Go read his advisory. It's great. Probably

387
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:04,400
ss

388
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:10,319
and, but the numbers were shockingly low. It was like 13 and like 690 something.

389
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,348
And somebody's like, wait,

390
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,890
couldn't you just like brute force fuzz that like 1000 times 1000 times,

391
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,520
1000 times 1000 you could try every combination

392
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:21,920
from like 0 to 1000 for each of those four numbers in like a trillion

393
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:22,880
tests.

394
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,598
Which,

395
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,348
yeah, I might take a week on a laptop. No big deal.

396
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,819
And it's kind of like, yeah, I guess nobody bothered to check whoops.

397
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:33,959
How, how would you check that? There's not a lot of people who can do that kind of work.

398
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,959
True. True. But I mean, and that's the thing. I think a lot of the bugs require

399
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,050
not a lot of expertise,

400
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,199
but like you need to understand c or you need to understand some math or you

401
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,819
need to understand a basic bit of crypto which let's face it almost nobody does.

402
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:49,869
You know, I'm always reminded of house inspections who, you know,

403
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:51,904
hands up in the audience who's had a house inspection

404
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:55,484
and then you moved into the house and found something broken like a week later

405
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:57,073
that the house inspector missed

406
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,593
-- all of us.
-- That's normal.

407
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:01,953
I mean, the, the real purpose of that,

408
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,894
I always get ticked off with house inspections because

409
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:05,264
they hand you a phone book of stuff.

410
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:09,923
And it's like this is basically like is the foundation ok? Is the roof ok?

411
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,323
Is the house gonna collapse?

412
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,884
-- Like that's what it's really supposed to be about
-- is the foundation ok?

413
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:15,813
It's a finished basement.

414
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:19,187
-- Who knows? Well,
-- that's why you hired an inspector man.

415
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,748
Like part of their job is figuring that out.

416
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,197
Well, I'm just saying, like, for example,

417
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,458
like without tearing the finished basement apart or digging a hole outside,

418
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:28,368
how do you inspect the foundation of a house?

419
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:29,238
The answer is you don't,

420
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:30,618
you just hope it doesn't leak.

421
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:33,777
No, I think the important thing is these feedback loops where,

422
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:38,197
because the shocking, like the majority of security bugs

423
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,067
are

424
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:41,797
once they're understood, assuming that they're complicated and,

425
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:44,381
and the majority of them are things like cross site scripting or

426
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,702
like a logic error. Logic errors are kind of self evident.

427
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:48,232
Like, oh, if you do this and do this and do this,

428
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:50,862
it allows you in through authentication when it's not supposed to because of this.

429
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:51,251
Oh,

430
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:54,131
yeah. Huh. That's bad. Log. OK. Let's fix that versus

431
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:55,781
something like complicated, like, you know,

432
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,991
stack guard in the Linux kernel where it's like, oh boy, you know, go get Florian,

433
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,751
make them deal with it, you know, because I'm not going to understand this,

434
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,322
but the majority of security bugs,

435
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,332
like once you show them to somebody,

436
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,965
like I would say, probably 80 to 90% of them are, you know, a five minute two line fix.

437
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:11,796
Make sure it didn't break anything or make it worse.

438
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,946
That would be an interesting statistic.

439
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:15,556
I know you're pulling that out of your butt,

440
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:18,926
but I would be really interested in knowing if that's real or not.

441
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,206
Would you agree? I'm a terrible programmer. I mean,

442
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:22,326
-- you
-- see,

443
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:22,836
come

444
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,015
on,

445
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:25,406
I feel bad agreeing with that. But

446
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:25,865
yes,

447
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,426
but here's the thing I have analyzed on

448
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:32,556
the order of 50,000 security vulnerabilities since 2000.

449
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:33,586
Probably.

450
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:37,459
I did the math once between eyesight partners. I defense

451
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,599
Red Hat.

452
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:39,739
Um

453
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:40,040
Yeah,

454
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,479
I've done on the order of analyzing and looking

455
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:45,859
at 50,000 security vulnerabilities and the vast majority of them

456
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,640
were not that complicated.

457
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,459
Like even, oh, I'm going to pick on the DNS for a second bind. Right.

458
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:53,239
They would always ship those security updates as

459
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,000
part of like a 200 kilobyte patch set.

460
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,410
Right.

461
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:59,719
And it would take me who again, I'm a terrible programmer.

462
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,859
-- Take me usually about 5 to 15 minutes to track it down.
-- I mean,

463
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,689
yeah.

464
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:07,890
-- Yeah,
-- based on a one entry and a change log and here's a 200 kilobyte diff.

465
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:11,099
And I literally just do keyword searches until I find like, oh, look,

466
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,459
they like fixed a buffer array.

467
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:13,410
That's probably it.

468
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,780
That's what I love about open source is the majority of these.

469
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,290
Like, that's what I love about the loss kernel. They're like a bug is a bug.

470
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,900
We just fix the bugs, maybe the security,

471
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,619
maybe they're not, we just fix the bugs and move on. Cool.

472
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,339
Run current. Good luck with that.

473
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,619
Ok. You know,

474
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,380
or run their LTs if you want something a little more stable,

475
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,180
even their LT si checked last time was up over 400 versions.

476
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,680
But, um, I, I think that's the important thing is versus reporting a bug to a,

477
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:40,729
a close source company.

478
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:40,819
And

479
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:42,422
it's just like, well, now what?

480
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:44,812
Well, I, so I think that's kind of the,

481
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:47,883
the point of everything we've talked about so far

482
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:49,812
is you're going to have people saying Oh,

483
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:50,603
open source.

484
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:52,782
What's going on? Can we trust N PM?

485
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:56,453
Can we trust the community who's paying attention to what's going on here?

486
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:03,233
And the reality is I, is it better in the closed source world? No, maybe we don't know.

487
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:07,572
-- My guess is not. But here's
-- my simplest response. OK. Stop trusting N PM.

488
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:12,056
-- Go read it yourself. Come back and tell me how that goes for you. No,
-- I, I agree.

489
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:15,786
Well, and that's, that's the real, that's the reality of it is just

490
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:20,046
the, the value of this software is immeasurable.

491
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:23,446
It's a number with so many zeros we can't fathom it.

492
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:25,206
No, it's, it's not even that. It's,

493
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:26,965
I can't make my own pencil

494
00:21:27,215 --> 00:21:30,355
or, well, the, the TED talk where the guy tried to make his own toaster.

495
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:31,725
You just, you can't

496
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:34,686
-- do that.
-- You can, it just takes like a year.

497
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,699
Yeah. Like the reality is you can't

498
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,520
make anything from scratch and that's, that's the ugly secret with software,

499
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:41,699
right?

500
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:42,619
With software.

501
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:48,140
Unless you, like, if you want to build it yourself, you're starting from scratch.

502
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:50,180
Otherwise you're pulling in libraries and dependencies.

503
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,180
-- Yeah. No, I, I agree. I just, it's not realistic to talk like that. It's
-- ridiculous.

504
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,339
-- Like, and that's, that's the story.
-- Like you don't have a choice.

505
00:21:58,349 --> 00:21:59,500
This is like, saying,

506
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:03,944
disagree with the modern economy. I don't want to live in the modern economy. Cool.

507
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:05,974
Even if you try to live in a cabin in the woods you're

508
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:08,545
still going to have to interact with the modern economy to some degree.

509
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:09,454
Oh, yeah.

510
00:22:09,555 --> 00:22:11,724
-- Totally.
-- Or instead of the modern,

511
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,305
I, I don't want to do capitalism.

512
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:15,905
I'm going to ignore capitalism and do something else. No,

513
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,099
you

514
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,270
can't.

515
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:19,670
No, I know.

516
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,609
I know.

517
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,790
It's the, it's the world we live in then.

518
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,729
That's where I come back because I,

519
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:27,709
I think what this boils down to is it's one of those cases where

520
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,469
this is bad,

521
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:32,829
not that bad, but it's kind of bad. But

522
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:35,250
we were happy ignoring it before and now you made us

523
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,650
look at it and I don't like to look at it,

524
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,069
you know,

525
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,229
and they have to reconcile that cognitive

526
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:43,619
dissonance of. Do I, I can ignore this and pretend like nothing happened or

527
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,055
I have to pay attention to it, but I can't say

528
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:49,214
uh we can't really do anything about it.

529
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:51,214
So let's just live with it because that's my response.

530
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:53,915
Like I literally look at this N PM note thing and I'm like, yeah, whatever.

531
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:55,935
-- That's
-- normal. Wait, what, what's normal?

532
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:57,165
Someone back door,

533
00:22:57,255 --> 00:23:01,824
-- a library is normal to have
-- once in a while a person puts a back door in or

534
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:05,880
um, like my favorite thing is every time Microsoft has a really bad security bug,

535
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,810
everybody's like, ha ha ha Windows is so stupid.

536
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,729
I'm going to go use Linux. Cool, go do that.

537
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:14,410
Except Linux has a really bad security flaw at least once here and there was, I mean,

538
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,670
jeez,

539
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,670
there was that one in what net filter like two weeks

540
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,069
ago where it's like local code execution and net filter.

541
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,030
I still don't.

542
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:22,369
-- Anyways,
-- we just talked about that

543
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:27,719
-- like we literally did a whole podcast on it.
-- That was like 100 vulnerabilities ago.

544
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:27,829
I

545
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,239
know, I

546
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,609
know it

547
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,670
sounds like it was a year.

548
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:30,760
No, no, I

549
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,979
think your spot on is

550
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,589
this given the open

551
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,459
source ecosystem,

552
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:38,569
especially in the node ecosystem because it's so

553
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:42,810
large that when you are architecting how your

554
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:45,500
open source just is going to function in

555
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,339
your company and everyone should be doing this.

556
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:48,540
If you're just like,

557
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,130
if you're just grabbing and praying, like you got other problems,

558
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,109
you need to actually manage and take care of your open source.

559
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,829
-- It's, it's a bit like a puppy.
-- Well, you need to at least be aware of what it is and

560
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,089
yeah.

561
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:01,250
-- Right. Right. No. Exactly. Yeah.
-- Absolutely.

562
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,530
I honestly grabbing and praying is fine. I'm not that opposed to it.

563
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,739
-- No,
-- I don't think it is. I don't think it is. I, I think,

564
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:13,479
I think any reasonably sized development group can't be doing that.

565
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:15,930
I think if you're like five people, you can maybe get away with it.

566
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:18,329
But once you're of a certain size that's, uh,

567
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:21,196
it's an untenable position to be in. You can't do it.

568
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:25,036
The challenge becomes as soon as you start pulling indep dependencies.

569
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,536
Oh, my goodness. Oh, Wow. Ok.

570
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:30,706
I'm just looking at the yarn lock file for the main CS, a website.

571
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:33,446
-- Wow.
-- Oh, it's probably a disaster.

572
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:35,956
-- Yeah. This thing is bigger than I
-- remember.

573
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:38,086
Yeah, you should, uh, you should get the,

574
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:41,026
get the gripe vulnerability scanner and you should run

575
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:42,595
it on that and see what it looks like.

576
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,416
No, I know they're fine because they use the yarn audit,

577
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:46,995
bundle audit stuff and I think there's like, oh yeah, that works too.

578
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:48,972
I would say on average they have like 1 to 3

579
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:51,112
CV S kind of outstanding that they're dealing with that.

580
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:54,962
They take on average about a week or two to get rid of them depending on whatever.

581
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:57,901
-- But you
-- also, I, I know that's a relatively small team.

582
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:02,781
It, things change depending upon your environment. And in the case of the CS A,

583
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:06,822
you can basically just stay up to date and you're probably going to be ok.

584
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:10,862
Not everyone can do that. And I think pretending everyone can is preposterous.

585
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:14,131
Oh, yeah. I love when people like, run current and it's like, cool.

586
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:17,832
I run my favorite is there's that Linux design for like pipeline equip

587
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:22,378
that is both one completely inaccessible because it's literally at the

588
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,147
bottom of a hole at the bottom of an ocean.

589
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:28,128
And two, it needs to be there and work for 50 years to 100 years.

590
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:29,807
It's probably fine or

591
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:32,167
just don't hook it up to the internet, it'll be fine.

592
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:33,848
Except we need those reports,

593
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:35,797
whatever. But, um, anyway,

594
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:37,218
you know, and that's ii,

595
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:41,887
I get that telling people to run current is absolutely not a realistic solution.

596
00:25:41,897 --> 00:25:45,008
Especially once it's like medical stuff or

597
00:25:45,238 --> 00:25:47,508
industrial stuff or like light bulbs.

598
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:50,484
Like, I don't, oh, my favorites. Remember all those people were talking about?

599
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:53,923
They bought those grills and they don't turn the grill on often enough.

600
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,793
So it's exactly like you with your pre tripp,

601
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:58,913
you upgrade your software so that when you go up on stage and turn your laptop on,

602
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:00,683
it's not like, hey, there's an update,

603
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,734
I'm just going to go do this for three hours and like.

604
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:04,884
-- Right. Right.
-- Good luck with your presentation.

605
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:05,754
Right.

606
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:08,904
If you're on Linux, this doesn't happen. Just saying. But

607
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:13,644
no, no, I, I think anyway to, to bring us back to where I think we need to go to end.

608
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:15,913
This is, this is

609
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:17,114
a reality

610
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,099
and I think any competent architect in any competent,

611
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:24,739
just I guess whoever's in charge of your development team,

612
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,290
you have to expect this and plan for it.

613
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,459
And I think this is part of having good process, having good tooling,

614
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,500
having good expectations and understanding and you can say, oh,

615
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,650
this is preposterous.

616
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,099
I shouldn't have to deal with this and you can say that,

617
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:42,060
but then you don't get the benefit of infinity dollars worth of an open source.

618
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:42,349
Yeah,

619
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:44,079
I'm just looking at it looks like we have

620
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:50,339
a ballpark figure of 2001st order dependencies plus then

621
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:51,560
whatever they pull in

622
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,229
no package

623
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,640
like dot Json

624
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,630
is everything

625
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,900
-- ok. So then it is 2000
-- every layer.

626
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,250
If you look at package dot

627
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,500
Json, that'll tell you your dependencies.

628
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,760
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Sorry. That's where my brain was going.

629
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,109
It's ok. It's complicated. I do this every day.

630
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:07,310
Yeah.

631
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:09,949
Oh, there we go. Yeah. Sorry. I thought, you know what?

632
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,319
I actually thought I was looking at package

633
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,699
Json but I said the other one, didn't I?

634
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,099
Yeah, you said package lock? Oh, I love this package dot

635
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,150
JSON is only like 4045 things. It's just some of them are like node

636
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,369
-- like we pull a node. What's in that? No, that's
-- what node does.

637
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,640
I, I actually have a nice demo.

638
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,300
I give of this where I take I,

639
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,199
I create an Express project which there's this thing in node called Express,

640
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:30,920
which is like a little web server thing

641
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:36,760
and it has six dependencies N PM installed, gets you to like, I think it's 90

642
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:40,810
then you put it in a container and you're up to like 1000

643
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,729
and it's like

644
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,609
this is how it works.

645
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,390
-- Like that's just life
-- better safe than sorry. You might need that spell check.

646
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,890
I mean,

647
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,750
-- anyway, anyway,
-- I just remember when I did an audit of that,

648
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,349
that Rails product that Red Hat bought and it was like American date that it was an

649
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:59,449
N PM thing called American Date and it was like 10 lines long and it just converted

650
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,420
-- normal sane rational dates into the American format, which is
-- stupid.

651
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:05,109
-- It is completely stupid.
-- I agree.

652
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,050
And I'm like,

653
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,260
it's probably not a security vulnerability and has been updated in eight

654
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,170
years and I hope it's complete and it's like 10 lines.

655
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,280
So it's probably ok, it's probably fine.

656
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,050
I just keep going back to the whole, like, what's the alternative?

657
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,189
Write it yourself? Like,

658
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,540
-- I don't
-- have the alternative is you have to plan for this. Like that's it.

659
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,400
The alternative is this is going to happen.

660
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,400
You have to expect it to happen and you have to plan

661
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:27,322
-- for it to happen. That is how it works. Like, welcome to the future.
-- You know what?

662
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,363
There's always going to be another log for Jay in

663
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:32,402
-- N PM or something
-- log for J wasn't in NBM.

664
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:35,412
Basically there's going to be a log for Jay in something you use.

665
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:38,703
No, but I'm saying there's going to be a log for J situation in whatever you use

666
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:39,522
and,

667
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:43,343
or a rude word you have to get rid of from your code base or something like that too.

668
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:47,123
I think we covered this multiple previous podcasts. But if you can't,

669
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,895
you need to be able to do emergency code updates and changes on a,

670
00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:54,645
without it being some heroic effort that burns your people out.

671
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,355
That's right. Exactly. Exactly.

672
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:58,485
Well, the beauty is if you do this and accomplish this.

673
00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:02,956
You will be so much faster and able to do major features or sales comes along and says,

674
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:06,135
hey, if you can do this thing quickly, we can make this big sale.

675
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:07,995
Right.

676
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,845
And now it actually matters because you can make money.

677
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,380
Yep. Exactly. All right. I think, I think we got to take this one home.

678
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,989
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get the last word in which is just,

679
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:17,869
I think

680
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,319
we had the benefit of being able to ignore all

681
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,979
this stuff for a long time and that's done.

682
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:25,959
-- You can't ignore it anymore.
-- I bet you a dollar in two years.

683
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:30,380
If we ask people about this, 95% of them will be like, what, like the Sony BMG root kit.

684
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,770
-- Remember? Why
-- would they? No, no, it doesn't. That, that's irrelevant.

685
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,020
No one is going to remember anything. Our memories are very short

686
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,420
but the reality is,

687
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:41,339
I think we have ignored

688
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,420
open source security for a very, well. I shouldn't say security.

689
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,260
We've ignored open source risk for a long time and we've treated it as free software

690
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,140
and the reality is it's not free. It has risk and you need to understand that risk.

691
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,939
-- That's it. And
-- the other reality is you have to use it. Yeah,

692
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,239
you have to use it. That's, I'm going to start saying that you have to use open source.

693
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,709
-- It's not a, it's not an option.
-- Microsoft ships it.

694
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,459
Microsoft owns it. Like they own github

695
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,319
if you github

696
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,089
is open source now.

697
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:12,989
Yeah,

698
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:15,650
I know. I know.

699
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,449
And oh man, that last episode, like I want to like you Microsoft, stop, stop it.

700
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:22,640
