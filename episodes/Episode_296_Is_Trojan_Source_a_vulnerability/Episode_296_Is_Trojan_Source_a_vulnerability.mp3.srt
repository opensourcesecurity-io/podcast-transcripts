00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,670
-- Notepad has no color though. That's weird
-- because it's Notepad.

1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:04,750
Like,

2
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:13,880
hello and welcome to the Open Social Security podcast with myself.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,979
Kurt Siefried my partner in dishwashing. Josh Bressler,

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,139
dishwashing. Oh. Right. Because I,

5
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:24,389
right. I had to delay recording the podcast because I was finishing up the dishes.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,430
Did you actually wash them by hand?

7
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,190
-- Only the pots and pans?
-- Oh,

8
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:28,959
ok.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah. Yeah, I filled the dishwasher

10
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:32,299
and then I have a,

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,869
so I have two Teflon pans. I generally don't like Teflon,

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,080
but it has its purpose and obviously I care.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,720
I take very good care of them and they're,

14
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:46,455
they're cared for meticulously because I don't want to consume Teflon.

15
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:49,974
So those get washed by hand very gently and then put away.

16
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:50,325
Yeah,

17
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,834
I just had to throw one of my smaller Teflon pans away because

18
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,974
I noticed a chip in it and it's kind of like yummy.

19
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:58,965
Yep. Yep. That's right. We don't, we need to know eating Teflon here. No.

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,270
Yep. Yep. Exactly. Now, now I will say for anyone listening.

21
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:06,010
Yes, I have a bunch of very nice cast iron pans.

22
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:10,529
I have a bunch of steel pans. I do not use a teflon very often.

23
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:12,989
But there are times when it is accepted like

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,489
eggs are a great example of teflon is lovely.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,220
I was about to say breakfast,

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,059
Teflon

27
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,169
and breakfast.

28
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,970
That's a match made in heaven.

29
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:27,199
Uh It generally is. Yes. This particular meal this evening had noodles and gravy.

30
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,069
Fried with schnitzel and

31
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:33,389
the noodles and gravy create a mess that you cannot clean.

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,209
Wait. Did you make

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:34,870
Schmetz

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,250
Spetz?

35
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:35,739
Oh,

36
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:36,970
the Spetz

37
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:38,099
noodles? Yes. Yes.

38
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,419
They were Spetz

39
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,430
noodles literally from Germany

40
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,239
because

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,309
my wife orders there's some,

42
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,250
she found some German company that will mail like

43
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,589
a box of German stuff to the United States

44
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,660
and like an online store and stuff and

45
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:55,220
about two, twice a year ish give or take. We order

46
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,500
just German candy and German foods and whatever. And

47
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,540
then we always throw some noodles in.

48
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,699
-- And so, yes, the noodles were literally German noodles
-- tonight. Awesome.

49
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,089
Because I, I personally am ok. I'll be blunt. I am po pooing you on the inside because

50
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,580
I've only ever had my mom's homemade

51
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:15,100
-- peel.
-- She's from Germany. That's valid.

52
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,660
Well, but, like, and the thing is like my mother, myself and my sister,

53
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:19,279
we all own a Schmetz

54
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:19,979
Press.

55
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:20,929
That's fair.

56
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,889
It's kind of like a ricer but thicker.

57
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:28,000
Ok. Anyway, let's talk about unicode. That's way more exciting than my dishes.

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,729
-- Ah,
-- yeah, it's, well, it's interesting because

59
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,940
so, ok, so there was actually some really good work done recently like this.

60
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:35,809
Week called. Uh,

61
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,429
I love their website too because it's, it's Trojan source do codes.

62
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,869
I didn't know dot Code is a New TLD but

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,770
-- of course there's a TLD dot
-- Everything is TLD

64
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:45,110
now.

65
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,960
Ok. Off topic. But what I've noticed

66
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,860
more and more ads are inserting www dot whatever

67
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:54,270
because it used to be clear food.com.

68
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,860
That's, that's like a web address. Right.

69
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,740
But now there's so many just random two letter combinations

70
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,619
And I'm like, is that a web address or not? I don't know. But so

71
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,710
www dot blah, blah, blah.

72
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,869
-- So anyways off
-- topic, so it amuses me.

73
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,160
You said off topic before you said that as if we ever stay on topic.

74
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:13,339
So,

75
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,270
Trojan Source dot Codes is an awesome website

76
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,520
because it's got like a nice chunk of image

77
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:22,130
with a floaty cloudy thing and then a big red paper button and a link to github.

78
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:25,910
-- Oh,
-- the clouds do move. I didn't even notice that now that you say it, I see it.

79
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,199
Well, I don't think it's so much clouds as missed on the water,

80
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,190
whatever.

81
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,139
Anyways and you click repap

82
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,350
and it's, it's, I love that.

83
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,110
-- The paper is this classically formatted latex
-- blog people who do two column

84
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,750
white papers. You are a bad person and you should feel bad.

85
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,589
-- They're like full stop. That's
-- it. I'm tired, man.

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,270
It's been like, ok, 20 years ago, we didn't know any better.

87
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:49,539
-- But now
-- if

88
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,740
-- it's,
-- if it's printed out on paper.

89
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,320
I think the, the narrow columns are easier to, like, take notes and things like that.

90
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,149
But when I'm reading it on a computer now I have to scroll your

91
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,710
PDF down and then scroll your PDF up and then scroll your PDF down.

92
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:06,160
And, like, by the time I hit page three I want to, like, I get all,

93
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,279
I want to stab someone.

94
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,470
-- It's terrible.
-- So this is one of the reasons I own a giant

95
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,110
monitor.

96
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:10,949
I mean,

97
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:15,750
-- mine is very wide. I need to flip it 90 degrees.
-- There you go. Anyway.

98
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,390
So the premise is essentially,

99
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,428
well, basically what it boils down to in the beginning we had

100
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,528
Asy and Asy was good and simple.

101
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,079
There was 256 I'm gonna say character codes I think is the right time. I

102
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:28,338
don't know

103
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:28,648
what to

104
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:28,859
call

105
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:29,058
it.

106
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:29,319
Well,

107
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:31,539
because there's not actually 256 characters because there's

108
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:33,959
control characters like line return and stuff.

109
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:34,049
I

110
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:37,088
mean, it was seven bits are basically the stuff we can look at

111
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:38,678
and then the other,

112
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:40,799
the next half is like all the,

113
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,039
the, well, essentially the

114
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:42,799
Asy Art.

115
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:43,309
Yeah,

116
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:43,899
for the

117
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:44,380
weird

118
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:46,660
-- stuff, the control
-- codes. Yeah.

119
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,500
The little smiley faces and stuff like what do for uh Door Fortress uses.

120
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,649
So

121
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,910
in the beginning we ask you and ask you is great and awesome unless of course

122
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,130
you want to speak any language other than English or maybe a bit of French.

123
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,380
-- It's almost like a bunch of tech dudes in California thought all this up.
-- Right.

124
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:07,200
So, we have unicode and actually I do quite like unicode, but the problem is

125
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:08,130
we,

126
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,630
we still live in a world that generally assumes everything's going to be asking.

127
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,350
-- And so
-- that's not the problem isn't.

128
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,279
Well, it's, it's not just that it's the people and the technology

129
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,959
essentially are still living in an ask you world, but we've moved on to unicode,

130
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,399
but they haven't mentally,

131
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,739
maybe I'm, I'm waiting to see where you go at this and I have to decide if I'm going to.

132
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,989
So basically, almost everything supports unicode by default now, right?

133
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,410
But most people are quite shocked when you cut and paste a smiley into the text film.

134
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,190
They're like, what? Well, what, what just happened.

135
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,269
So like a great example of this is cut and paste a smiley unicode into a password field

136
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,679
and like half the time it'll just work. No problem.

137
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,750
The other half of the time it'll, it'll cause a horrific problem.

138
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,149
Ok? Because essentially a lot of people haven't really moved past

139
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,059
Asy, like in their brain. We live in a nasty

140
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,299
world. I mean, I'm not saying it's ok, but I'm just saying this is how it is.

141
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:05,959
There's a lot of tooling that now supports

142
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,739
Asi or a unicode rather.

143
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,325
But for example, it doesn't explicitly tell you like,

144
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:12,644
are you looking at an ask you letter a or

145
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:15,804
-- one of those weird Cyrillic version letter A
-- si mean,

146
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:18,545
should it tell you that there is a difference?

147
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:23,234
-- What
-- if it's an address bar maybe, am I at Walmart or am IW Mart?

148
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:26,184
Doesn't the address bar denote

149
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:27,614
when you have,

150
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,359
-- I guess that the maybe fishing characters
-- they do and they don't.

151
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:37,380
So for example, with the, with the Chinese characters that will show the actual,

152
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,209
like the X and blah, blah, blah, blah blah, with some of them,

153
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,760
it'll show essentially, I brought this up with the Homo Glyph attacks.

154
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,309
And the biggest thing is

155
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:47,440
if you can indicate, am I showing you

156
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,829
Asy or am I showing you unicode?

157
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,510
Because if I'm showing you unicode, that might not be a letter A that you think it is,

158
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:54,679
right.

159
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,059
Anyway, I think we, we're at

160
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,019
look, here's what basically happened.

161
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,109
Some,

162
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,920
some group of people made a fancy website, they got AC B ID

163
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:11,500
and they created some demo source code files that use the kind of the,

164
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,399
the right to left character set.

165
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,179
-- Oh,
-- this is my favorite part. There's left to right,

166
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,239
right, to left

167
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,480
or sorry, there's left to right, embedding, right, to left, embedding,

168
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,640
left to right over, right, right, to left over, right,

169
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,529
to write isolation,

170
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:25,850
everyone. It

171
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,570
so the point is they basically built these files

172
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,920
that when you look at them in certain editors,

173
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:33,839
it'll for example, look like there's a comment.

174
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,730
But then when it's interpreted as unicode like

175
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,739
the return statement isn't in the comment,

176
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,829
the return statement is outside the comment.

177
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,380
Right?

178
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,630
Well, and a more a better example would be like you're writing a smart contract

179
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,649
and it looks like the number 100

180
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:52,959
-- but it's actually a one or vice versa.
-- Sure. Sure. And you get the idea, right?

181
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,160
They're abusing

182
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,040
the properties of unicode to try to trick people

183
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,000
and I guess here's my take on this, I'm going to just,

184
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,709
I'm going to get it out of the way now.

185
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,829
This is freaking dumb.

186
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,500
I mean, just for real. Like

187
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:10,049
so if you look at these files

188
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,429
in various editors, I everything I've looked at

189
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,899
it is obvious something weird is going on in every instance

190
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,140
if you accept this as a pull request, like

191
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,019
you what I mean, come on from a security perspective at the same time,

192
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,700
like if I'm gonna attack your application with, with a malicious pull request,

193
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,260
this isn't how I'm doing it.

194
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,820
You know, this is, this is obvious

195
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,058
and it is silly and I think giving this a CV E ID, just

196
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:44,650
it fills out our narrative of like CV E is broken. That's all this does.

197
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,969
So I disagree

198
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,419
in that this is definitely something that needs

199
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:50,299
to be fixed because this for example,

200
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,219
would be great for an insider attacker,

201
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,599
right?

202
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:56,219
That this would allow you to hide something

203
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:58,489
in a way that most people wouldn't expect.

204
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,359
And I think as proof is how annoyed and angry a lot of people are.

205
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:05,799
They're like, oh, it's not really an issue except, well, wait, I can make the editor,

206
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:08,880
like I can make the code editor show ABC def.

207
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,239
But it actually turns out like

208
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,840
-- some other ordering of like BCE
-- D. Not exactly though. That's not true

209
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,630
when you look at these files in. So I've tried a bunch of editors. Funny enough.

210
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,299
Windows notepad actually renders them correctly which like

211
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:25,640
kind of blew my mind a little bit.

212
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:31,840
Like Vim does the right thing, emacs does the right thing VS code displays them

213
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:37,500
in the wrong order, but the the syntax highlighting gets it correct.

214
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,869
So it's still when you look at it,

215
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,549
you can tell something is broken in the file you're looking at like I,

216
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,549
I think you can make the argument like sure Lyter should catch this.

217
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,409
I'm OK with that.

218
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,479
But fundamentally saying this is some sort of novel new attack I think is a stretch.

219
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:54,780
The challenge is there's no really good way to tell somebody.

220
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:56,369
Well, the first problem is, is this

221
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,270
-- ASI or unicode?
-- Everything should be unicode?

222
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,940
I should assume everything is unicode from now on, from the straight forward.

223
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,380
I'm putting a stick in the ground.

224
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,260
-- It's unicode.
-- I agree.

225
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,460
But then the second problem is I'm looking at this character,

226
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,739
what is this character?

227
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,960
Is it a or is it Cyrillic A?

228
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,429
Is there a left to right or right to left?

229
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,780
Embedded control character lurking somewhere.

230
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:24,700
And now I would say, especially for source code

231
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,669
tools, if you're going to show source code to somebody,

232
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,140
you should probably strongly highlight weird stuff like

233
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:35,159
left to right and right to left and all those weird

234
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,789
encoding signals, right?

235
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,330
Like just like if you have some sort of well control, like the, the, the, the carrot m,

236
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:42,640
you know,

237
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,799
when you open up a AD OS file in emacs and it's like

238
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,909
you got the D OS line returns instead of the UNIX line returns,

239
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,530
right?

240
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,130
And it's like, so it's covered in control MS and you know

241
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:55,640
that, well, there's different line returns, right?

242
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,049
They're not hidden, they're not,

243
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,250
you know, acting weird, right?

244
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,719
But the the challenge becomes is if you highlight every bit of unicode

245
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,099
for the people that legitimately need unicode, which is

246
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,919
basically everybody

247
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,880
outside of North America,

248
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,359
you know, their, their experience goes all to hell in a handbasket.

249
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,669
People in North America need unicode. Kurt.

250
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,840
I mean, there's loads of people with um lots and their names we'll use for example,

251
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,280
who live in North America.

252
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:24,960
I mean

253
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,299
there was a, there was a thread, yeah,

254
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:30,440
about like these name fields where most name fields

255
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,309
uh default, what is it? 12 characters max. So people with like

256
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,400
names of Christiansen or whatever

257
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,479
are just

258
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:40,280
out of luck or this one guy, you know, his name is Joe

259
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,250
with the, with the

260
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:44,250
accent and it's like, yeah, I

261
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,940
can't use that.

262
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,650
Right. That's ridiculous. I don't, that's not. OK.

263
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,690
So,

264
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,229
all right. So here's

265
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,650
something for us to consider.

266
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,369
So first of all,

267
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,989
there are legitimate

268
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:02,289
reasons to use right to left comments, for example. Right.

269
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,179
-- I mean that, that's just, that's how it works.
-- It's

270
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,609
people in the Middle East.

271
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,130
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

272
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:07,849
OK.

273
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,929
So I think there's validity, validity to that.

274
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,369
And now you make the comment about how do I know if this is a,

275
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,609
an English A or a Cyrillic A?

276
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,140
And the,

277
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:22,330
the thing I always think about here is does it really matter?

278
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,150
I mean, if we're talking about like a comment,

279
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,969
then no, because who cares? Right.

280
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,770
It's, it's a comment. It doesn't matter.

281
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,559
Now if we're talking about, say a URL bar,

282
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,809
obviously, there is an argument to be made that fishing can be used

283
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,070
in those instances.

284
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,919
And I think that's a separate problem that we should

285
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,090
not discuss today because that's a very different thing.

286
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,289
But now in the code itself, for example,

287
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:47,989
you could have one variable named a one variable named Cyrillic A

288
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,169
and those would II, I, I've not tried this,

289
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,809
but I assume they would be treated differently by the compiler.

290
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,739
Well, as a simple example, right?

291
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,619
Instead of you think you have one variable called the letter A,

292
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,739
it's actually two separate variables and it gets set

293
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,369
differently and it doesn't get reset properly at some point

294
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,440
-- leading to a security vulnerability
-- Right.

295
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,460
So here's where I think that argument kind of starts to

296
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:11,289
fall apart is that is not going to happen on accident.

297
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:11,950
Ok. I

298
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,799
think that's just, that's the reality of that

299
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,289
situation. Now, let's say someone wants to create nefarious code.

300
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,239
You can easily make the argument that yes,

301
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,799
you could use Unicode as your vehicle for creating dangerous code.

302
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,409
But as actually on the OS S security mailing list, a

303
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,090
discussion started and David Wheeler rightly pointed

304
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,440
out that like there are literally contests

305
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,549
to create underhanded code that is designed to trick people.

306
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:43,479
And the thing is if you have an attacker who can submit like a pull request,

307
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,609
they can get past you.

308
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:50,489
Be it a a minor bug you don't notice be it literally underhanded code,

309
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,260
you know what I mean?

310
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,390
Be it multiple commits that when put together do something scary.

311
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,169
-- Well, I
-- mean, the University of Minnesota,

312
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,940
yeah, we talked about them what, like 10 or 12 episodes ago I think

313
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,109
or my favorite is all of the

314
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,280
and I don't mean off by one in the sense of like off by one

315
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:12,219
buffer but off by one and that like somebody forgot a character or made a typo

316
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:14,270
and boom security flaw, right?

317
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,260
Because at some point, your,

318
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,619
your eyes sort of glaze over and you don't notice these things.

319
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,059
-- So
-- I, I think using this

320
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:27,140
as an excuse for the source code is a stretch to say the least.

321
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,429
I feel like

322
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:32,780
you can easily make the argument. Like this is weird. We should have consistent,

323
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,280
I guess just behaviors in our editors.

324
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:37,760
Like I think VS code should display this correctly.

325
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,270
I don't think VS code should be displaying it the way it is.

326
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,359
You can make that argument and whatever.

327
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:43,159
But

328
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,330
I think calling this a security vulnerability is just, I, I don't, I don't buy it,

329
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,429
I would say across a trust boundary.

330
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:53,169
Well, it's like a homoglyphy attack, right?

331
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,840
My brain says it's a letter A but it's not a letter A, it's a Cyrillic letter A and

332
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:01,719
the thing is there's I, I'm just not sure of how do we solve this

333
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,409
because like I said, if we flake every character is unicode, that's unicode.

334
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,630
That's gonna look like garbage for everybody

335
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,109
outside of the English speaking world.

336
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,929
I mean, yeah. Yeah. Unicode,

337
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,729
unicode one,

338
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,690
right? We, you cannot pretend

339
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,609
going to going back to

340
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,169
Asy is a solution.

341
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,489
It's just, it's completely out of the question suggesting it is ridiculous.

342
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,200
-- Some
-- people never left Asy, right? That's kind of the problem.

343
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,510
That's a different problem as well.

344
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,590
We're not, we'll, we'll set that over there with the URL with attacks, right?

345
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,150
Those two can play together

346
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,530
in the sandbox. Now, here's a great example. Actually, I have a great example of,

347
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,960
of a way to deal with this.

348
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:45,210
I'm going to send you a link,

349
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:46,500
I'm

350
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:46,640
not

351
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,650
putting a signal

352
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,349
and I will also put this thing in the short,

353
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:53,169
it is a link to get up, open that up.

354
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,049
-- Uh
-- OK. Right.

355
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,359
The early return, this file contains bidirectional unicode. Yeah. And,

356
00:15:59,109 --> 00:15:59,640
and that's

357
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,929
except uh hang on a sec. I'm in Adam right now. Which one is that?

358
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,369
The early return, early return,

359
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,599
early return?

360
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,380
Yeah, Adam is just like her

361
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:08,609
di

362
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,049
so OK. So for anyone, OK, this is a podcast. No one knows what we're doing.

363
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:17,909
So what I did is I just sent Kurt a URL to one of the test files.

364
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,609
It's a Python file on github

365
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:20,650
and github

366
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,080
pops up a little warning that says this file contains bidirectional unicode

367
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,250
text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below

368
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,489
to review open the file in an editor that reveals hidden unicode characters.

369
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,250
-- Which one is that
-- which editor?

370
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:39,359
-- Because like Adam is not
-- it

371
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,809
Windows notepad

372
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,369
like

373
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,219
like, but here's the thing. OK. So here's the deal. So

374
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,260
I'm comfortable with a warning like this.

375
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,229
I'm comfortable with the winter giving a warning.

376
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,380
I'm comfortable with the compiler giving a warning,

377
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:55,119
right? I think hard failing on a compiler. That's probably another topic.

378
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,219
And I think that gets into weird territory of,

379
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:58,510
of like

380
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:01,909
you're, you're giving a lot more credence to the

381
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,820
Asy tech bros

382
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,209
than, than not, but whatever. I'm not gonna argue right now.

383
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,949
But the point is like warnings like this are valid where, where someone can say,

384
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,310
oh yes, I'm doing that on purpose.

385
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,229
Go away warning everything's fine.

386
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:17,030
But if I, if you sent me a file, I opened it and I see this warning, I'm gonna be like,

387
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,660
holy crap.

388
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,550
Kurt's trying to p me, you know what I mean?

389
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:22,088
Well, and it's great that github

390
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:22,858
does this,

391
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,019
but I'm guessing a lot of things don't,

392
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:26,698
not yet

393
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:27,829
so well.

394
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,599
And that's why we need a CV for this and that's why

395
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,949
we need a public identifier and we need some discussion about this.

396
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,260
See,

397
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:37,609
I think part of it is not all security identifiers need to be, you know, like the

398
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,290
like basically not all security identifiers need to be,

399
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,229
this is exploitable and it fits in a tweet and I

400
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,900
-- can take over your system entirely but all
-- CV ES

401
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,569
do.

402
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,050
Yeah.

403
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:49,880
But in this case, I think this is an interesting security

404
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,969
problem

405
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,890
but

406
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,329
like text editors,

407
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,719
you know, just like address bars and browsers now should tell me.

408
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:02,089
Nope because like this is cool, everything's asking or, you know, hang on, whoa,

409
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,459
like this is not asking something, you know,

410
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:05,959
and maybe that's fine because you're going to,

411
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,680
you know,

412
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,910
Nber

413
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,170
Leb

414
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:09,439
Kuchen with the accent or whatever.

415
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:11,010
So here's my problem with what,

416
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,369
what you just said though is we exist in a world where there are CBS

417
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:19,479
for things you should just pay attention to cve equals vulnerability,

418
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:20,790
which is a broken system.

419
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,839
-- And we've discussed this in
-- the

420
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:22,780
-- past
-- and that's why

421
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,000
we're moving on and doing the project we're doing.

422
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:25,800
Right. Right. The UV.

423
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:26,319
And,

424
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,819
-- but the point being here though that this has a CVE,
-- sorry when I said CVE,

425
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,900
I meant security identifiers in general.

426
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,800
But, but no, my point is literally,

427
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,160
I'm literally complaining about a CVE because here's what's going to happen.

428
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,050
This,

429
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:43,780
this gets a CV E, this is going to go into the vulnerability databases,

430
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,939
this is going to start getting flagged all over the freaking place.

431
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,869
And this is not a vulnerability in the context of this

432
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,180
is like a problem you have to fix in your code.

433
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:54,910
This is the sort of thing like

434
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,300
we just need to be aware,

435
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,900
this is an issue and we need to deal

436
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,739
with it elsewhere as part of policy and compliance.

437
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:05,650
It's like Python Pickle in that it is a very sharp edge but on its own

438
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,819
is not an issue. But

439
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,130
-- if improperly done somewhere can result in an issue, I
-- don't buy that.

440
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,319
I think pickle is legitimately dangerous.

441
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,560
This is not legitimately dangerous by itself.

442
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:22,760
It fundamentally changes what you're seeing unless you handle it correctly,

443
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,130
which a lot of things don't by default based on the number of people patching.

444
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,569
This. The other thing that really annoys me is this breaks the CV rules, right?

445
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:30,770
CV is supposed to be

446
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:35,619
vulnerability intersection with code base and this is one CV E for

447
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,260
like

448
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:37,170
the

449
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,349
whole

450
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,589
giant pile of stuff.

451
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:39,310
So

452
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:44,869
I would prefer for this to be somewhat legitimate. It needs to be split up more. So

453
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:46,540
I agree. I agree

454
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:49,839
because I think, but, but I, I guess here's, oh man,

455
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:51,810
my brain,

456
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,979
here's how I would break this down.

457
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:56,760
You, you said just a minute ago, something about like,

458
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,390
things don't display this properly.

459
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,670
But I would argue, uh,

460
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,160
virtually everything I've looked at

461
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,959
it. It, this is not like it looks weird everywhere you look at it.

462
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:10,160
There, it is obvious something strange is going on.

463
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,479
-- I'm
-- in Adam and it's not super obvious.

464
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:16,920
So for example, if I'm in Adam and I look at the uh where did the

465
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:19,479
Python one go? Because that was somewhat clearish.

466
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,719
For example, if I go to the Python one, that's uh homoglyphy function,

467
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,020
the say hello and the say hello,

468
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:26,650
the,

469
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,479
the one say hello is all blue and the other say

470
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:33,060
hello is like four gray characters followed by four blue characters.

471
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,199
OK. So, but that is

472
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,239
that should trip something in your brain that says

473
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,180
-- what is going on
-- unless you're color blind.

474
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:45,844
OK. That's a fair argument. I will, I will accept that as an argument.

475
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:49,484
But actually, so in all seriousness, if you are a listener and you are color blind,

476
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:52,734
I would really love to know like, do you use like a syntax highlighting?

477
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:54,405
Is there colorblind friendly highlighting?

478
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:56,935
-- I legitimately don't know
-- because I'm looking at this

479
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:59,724
and it's like it's purple gray blue and green.

480
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:04,114
And I know for a fact I'm not red, green, color blind because my dad is

481
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,069
and I'm not because I've been tested because, you know,

482
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,880
it's a concern if you're driving a car, red green and close enough.

483
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,449
Right.

484
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:12,729
Yeah. Whatever. They're the same, it's fine.

485
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,180
So

486
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,619
I'm looking at this and

487
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:18,819
now that you mention that I'm thinking about the colors used in this

488
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:21,209
default atom highlighter thing and it's like

489
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm not a fan of them anymore.

490
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:29,069
-- OK?
-- But now now we come back to the like there's one CV E which is wrong.

491
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,699
Like if Adam is doing the wrong thing, I would be comfortable saying, OK, Adam,

492
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:33,310
people,

493
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:35,459
we would appreciate it if you would

494
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:40,910
maybe do something more than you're doing today in handling a situation like this

495
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,469
like pop up that

496
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,780
-- github warning saying this file is weird looking with,
-- right?

497
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,520
-- I mean, I'm perfectly comfortable with
-- that.

498
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,010
Going back to what I was saying about ask you,

499
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,420
I'm expecting

500
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,859
characters in my file that I can see

501
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,689
and I am expecting

502
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,339
one or more forms of whitespace in the form of whitespace or tabs.

503
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,900
And I'm expecting some form, ideally the same of line return.

504
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:08,819
I think that would be safe to say that those three things can

505
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:13,060
-- pretty commonly be expected in a text file.
-- I'm comfortable with that.

506
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:13,420
Yes.

507
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:17,369
OK. So if there's more than that, please tell me because I'm guessing for myself.

508
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,969
-- I'm trying to think,
-- yeah, I mean, you could put, what are the, the zero with spaces?

509
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:25,699
You could have a 700 megabyte text file that looks like it's four lines long.

510
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:26,390
Exactly.

511
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,300
So I'm thinking basically outside of,

512
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,099
well, outside of displayable characters,

513
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,260
especially

514
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,979
Asy versus

515
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:35,319
Unho,

516
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,619
I, I want to interrupt you though for a minute

517
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:42,339
if I'm in Israel and I'm writing comments in Hebrew.

518
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:45,699
Those are all displayable character. You know what I mean?

519
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:47,780
That's not weird.

520
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,069
No, but you have a preference.

521
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,589
But for example, having control characters that are not like having left to right,

522
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,099
right to left control characters

523
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:58,060
for a lot of us would be weird.

524
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,459
And for the people that it's not weird for cool, they can,

525
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:02,729
they can like ignore that warning the first time it pops.

526
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,589
I guess that's fair.

527
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,229
You could look at the locale because obviously in the

528
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:09,939
unicode universe you set a locale for your session.

529
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,050
And if you have a locale of essentially like us English, for example,

530
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,270
then having right to left characters is worth giving me a warning.

531
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,540
You know what this really reminds me of is all the stupid foreign language spam.

532
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,739
I get in my gmail account in Japanese and I'm like,

533
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:29,510
I, I don't, I don't speak nor read and never will

534
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:31,250
Japanese.

535
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,060
Like you can't say never will.

536
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:34,609
-- You don't know that
-- it's,

537
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,790
it's a hard language to learn and I am old

538
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,079
-- and dumb
-- and willing to say it's unlikely but,

539
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,849
but, but you know what I'm saying, like it's,

540
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,770
I get this spam in foreign languages that I've never sent or received emails in

541
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,020
like how, how like,

542
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,520
because I run it through Google translate and it's very obviously spam and I'm like,

543
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,500
can I just set a setting where it's like

544
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,349
just English email only cause if it's not in English, I can't read it

545
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:58,729
and,

546
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:01,010
and that's kind of what I'm reminded of. Like in Adam,

547
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:01,969
I don't,

548
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:02,390
I,

549
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,619
I can't think of any legitimate case where I would need

550
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,910
or use all these weird kind of left to right,

551
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,569
right to left, whatever, blah, blah, blah, control character things.

552
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:11,719
I mean,

553
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,339
and if I do end up having to go through some Israeli code base, cool.

554
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:15,530
I'll,

555
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,500
I'll deal with the warnings then and either

556
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,010
ignore them or turn them off or something.

557
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:20,060
I mean, and,

558
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:22,680
and I think you could even make the argument the other way that

559
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:26,739
if I have a code base that's full of right to left comments.

560
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:32,130
I could obviously use left to right comments to, to, you know what I mean?

561
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,300
Like it's the, it's the same attack in reverse in that instance. So

562
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:37,770
I think we have this obsession with like

563
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:41,609
the English language aspect of it, but there's a lot more going on here.

564
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:45,469
Well, have you not seen all the A I training data that doesn't see people of color?

565
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:47,589
Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Stuff like that.

566
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,859
The other thing is you just mean these code editors

567
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:53,030
are generally quite smart with their code syntax highlighting.

568
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:53,989
And

569
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,869
for example,

570
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,199
I would like to like, like looking at this Python example with the whole, you know,

571
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,089
it's got like, what is it four characters in gray,

572
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:05,209
four characters in blue or all characters in blue, like some sort of

573
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:07,369
more of a, like a red s

574
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,160
like a red squiggly line under it, like a spelling error squiggle.

575
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,150
You know what I mean? Maybe

576
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,140
because

577
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,109
this is

578
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,420
like, I've never seen this before.

579
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,199
This is the first time I've ever seen this.

580
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,030
Right.

581
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:23,599
And I feel like it's weird enough that it's something that should get a red squiggle.

582
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,530
I mean, but, and, and

583
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:29,280
I think it's ok, it doesn't today because this is not,

584
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,939
I mean, we all, like, secretly we all knew this was a problem,

585
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,939
but none of us really talked about it and now someone

586
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:37,869
got a bunch of attention which is kind of not needed.

587
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:41,390
But now I think a lot of editors and other things

588
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,130
will give this a little more attention more than it deserves.

589
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,890
And like, that's ok. I guess it's, I, I don't have a problem with it.

590
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,750
I don't think it's going to make

591
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:51,800
world the worst place necessarily.

592
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,500
I mean, it's interesting because actually it's uh so cwecwe to be clear,

593
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,969
1007 is insufficient.

594
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:00,839
Visual distinction of homoglyphy presented to users. So that's more the

595
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,319
when I was proposing that I was thinking more of the address bar use case, right?

596
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:06,880
-- And
-- I think the address bar is

597
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:08,579
kind of special in

598
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,760
some ways.

599
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,680
But I, I also had mentioned

600
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:15,119
as part of that just,

601
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,390
just telling me

602
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:17,420
is this pure

603
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,089
Asy or unicode is, is very helpful

604
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,729
but I

605
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:23,619
he's dead. Nothing should ever be pure

606
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:24,800
ask again.

607
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:25,949
Exactly.

608
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,489
So back when I said that I,

609
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,790
I think I was reasonably correct but it

610
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,560
no longer is because everything should be unicode

611
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,400
-- full stop. That's it. Everything should be unicode.
-- Unicode one. It's over.

612
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:43,079
And then the question is how do we start to display Unicord? Sorry. Unicode in a

613
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,290
way that

614
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:48,130
helps us people that know Hablo Espanol so good.

615
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,109
But doesn't annoy the other 90% of the world that bilingual.

616
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:55,510
I mean, do we, is this a problem we need to solve?

617
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,150
Well, I mean, look, man,

618
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,180
nearly every programming language is functionally English.

619
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:00,930
When you look at it,

620
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:03,229
we're already torturing all these people who don't

621
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,390
live in North America for the most part.

622
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,920
Seriously. Oh, no, I know.

623
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,500
II, I have some German relatives that program and they all speak English fluently.

624
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,500
Well, because they're German.

625
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,500
Well, you know what's even worse is every,

626
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,260
every European I know who programs they own an American keyboard

627
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,500
because you have to, the German keyboards are silly.

628
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,729
-- Right?
-- Well,

629
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,500
look, it's not silly. It's, our keyboards are silly to them.

630
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,680
Yeah, I I think this just generally because on a related,

631
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:38,000
very tangentially but related topic is augmented reality and virtual reality

632
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,420
in the sense of this goes to

633
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,910
the human vision system is amazing,

634
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,319
right?

635
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,310
Like the, the,

636
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:48,589
the fact that we have a blind spot that our brain just straight up tunes out.

637
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:49,900
Like,

638
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,160
yeah, that it just, wow.

639
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,000
And so as senses go, we heavily rely on vision, especially with computers, right?

640
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,510
Because basically everybody who's blind and uses a screen reader

641
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:00,479
from what I've read.

642
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:03,469
It's, it's a pretty horrifying experience compared to, you know, like,

643
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,849
just all the problems they have to deal with.

644
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:07,560
Right. With all these stupid websites. That's what I hear.

645
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:12,540
And I feel like how do we give those sort of visual cues

646
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,290
to people

647
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,479
that are not

648
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:18,469
annoying and messy

649
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,390
or, and like lead to alarm fatigue.

650
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,750
So your brain literally just like, ok, you had your, your old truck, right?

651
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:26,510
The check engine light was always on

652
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,349
and your brain just was like, cool. That's, that's great.

653
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,089
I'm going to ignore it for the next five years.

654
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,979
Um, we're like 10. Yeah,

655
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,599
but that's the thing, right? Our brains tune stuff out like that because,

656
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,890
oh, I don't need to worry about that.

657
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,790
That's not something that's going to cause me trouble or eat me great.

658
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,109
It's visually gone,

659
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:43,369
you know, like

660
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,709
close your eyes right now and tell me how many things are on your desk,

661
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,849
right? Nobody can do that

662
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,930
I can because it's three.

663
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:55,239
I'm in my studio and I have my phone,

664
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,040
my computer and my coffee cup full of water

665
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,770
because it's too late to be drinking coffee.

666
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,800
But

667
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,810
so I guess part of me wonders,

668
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:05,920
especially with respect to augmented reality and virtual reality.

669
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,329
How do we signal?

670
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:11,670
But this is like a special thing in some way.

671
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,729
Be it a homo glyph or a control character or, you know what I'm saying?

672
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:19,900
I think in some cases that's important and I think in other cases it's not.

673
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,430
And I don't know, I don't know if we know the answer. And I guess here is

674
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,739
how I will take us out with this because we're, we're basically out of time anyway, is

675
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,410
we are discussing a problem that doesn't really affect us all that much.

676
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,949
There are countless people in this world who have to deal with

677
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,869
these sort of things every day where they have to deal with

678
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,439
their, their unicode language, their native language and the unicode characters,

679
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,469
they have to deal with their terrible English programming

680
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,729
environments.

681
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,469
They have to deal with

682
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:55,219
a different language from a person who lives across the street from them.

683
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,170
And

684
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,650
yet somehow societies

685
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,420
in the rest of the world function.

686
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,760
And I think

687
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,250
the real answer here is that

688
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:07,290
it's not our problem to fix.

689
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,310
There are people far more capable and qualified than us to solve

690
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,260
this problem and they're the ones who we should be working with

691
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,380
to get it done.

692
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,459
You know, I can't help but wonder.

693
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:22,349
So Apple really paid attention to the human interface design

694
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,609
guidelines from way back in the seventies or whatever.

695
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:27,780
If I had to guess and put money on this,

696
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,719
do you think they said something

697
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:30,619
intelligent about this problem we're experiencing?

698
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,989
-- I'd be shocked if they've said anything at all.
-- Well, no, no, no.

699
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,949
But I mean, in general terms of like,

700
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,339
how do we display text characters to people and give

701
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:40,760
them hints and clues as to what is going on?

702
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:45,109
I mean, honestly, if Steve Jobs did this, he'd be like, this is the character set,

703
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,349
the whole world will use.

704
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:52,239
-- I designed it on a piece of paper, use it or die like that is pretty much how
-- that

705
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,380
works.

706
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,459
-- And if it doesn't work for you hold it differently.
-- That's right. It's your fault.

707
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,160
If it doesn't work, it's not mine.

708
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,239
I did it correctly,

709
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:02,140
I guess. Well, I guess the good news is pretty much everybody has learned English.

710
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,939
So, thanks.

711
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,979
Whatever. No, that's

712
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,000
-- ridiculous. No, that
-- is not a good solution.

713
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,339
But that's the worst that if I had to pick all the solutions,

714
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:11,979
that's literally the worst one

715
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:12,930
literally.

716
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,579
And yet it is the solution. Many people

717
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:16,239
that's pretty

718
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:16,560
much

719
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,199
come

720
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,900
on. Let's be real. That's what Silicon Valley.

721
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:20,430
No, I agree. I agree.

722
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:24,089
I mean, one of my favorite examples like you and I live in cold places. Like

723
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,819
the early self driving cars had never

724
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,849
seen snow.

725
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:30,079
You know, as soon as there was snow, they, like,

726
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:33,000
just completely shut down because they literally didn't know what to do.

727
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,319
So, I lived near a couple of major roads in some spots.

728
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:38,930
They go from 3 to 4 to 5 to even six lanes wide on each side

729
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,880
and straight up when it snows heavily before it gets plowed properly.

730
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,500
Essentially, it's like, ok, we've decided there's five tracks in the snow today.

731
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,369
Ok. It's now a five lane road. That's right.

732
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:51,859
That's how it works, you know? And just if we all move at the same speed,

733
00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:53,300
it's probably gonna be ok.

734
00:31:53,469 --> 00:31:54,660
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

735
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,260
Yeah, I'm,

736
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,180
I'm completely Fali with this where I've been on

737
00:31:57,189 --> 00:31:58,780
the highway in the snow before and it's like,

738
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,180
well, I'm just gonna drive in these tire tracks because

739
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,300
I don't know what else I'm gonna,

740
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,030
I know I'm in a turn lane but I'm not getting out of the tracks.

741
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,660
-- It doesn't matter.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

742
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,680
-- All right. That, ah, man, snow is coming and I don't want it to.
-- We've been lucky.

743
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:13,319
It's been, actually, it was plus five today. It was warm.

744
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:17,540
Uh, yeah, you live way farther north than me. It's

745
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:18,770
so

746
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:22,750
far. I think, I think it might have been zero °C when I woke up this morning.

747
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,560
-- Which is,
-- we have,

748
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:27,270
we've been consistently below freezing overnight for a while now.

749
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,780
-- Yeah,
-- we haven't gotten there yet. I haven't seen Ice yet. It's coming though.

750
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,709
I know it is.

751
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:35,689
And, and I'm actually, I'm excited for my, my electric vehicle

752
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,834
experience to see if, by spring I'm like, this is the worst purchase I have ever made.

753
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:43,125
-- I don't know.
-- Yeah.

754
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:45,625
I've actually learned a lot about trampoline maintenance and

755
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:47,255
ice over the last week and a half.

756
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,655
-- Did you
-- say trampoline maintenance?

757
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:49,895
Yeah.

758
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,645
My two trampolines are out in the backyard.

759
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:54,354
-- My kids are still using because what else are we going to do?
-- Oh, I suppose.

760
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:55,155
Yeah, that's fair.

761
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:57,270
And you had ice on your trampoline.

762
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,089
-- Are you
-- saying it rained and then it froze and so I had to learn how to not get the,

763
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,400
all this ice off the trampoline.

764
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,449
-- And also you just
-- like, tell the kids to go jump on it

765
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:06,030
like, well,

766
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,849
-- but then they get wet socks and they get annoyed and cold feet
-- so

767
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,109
that, it sounds like fun. I want to jump on an ice covered trampoline.

768
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,010
That sounds great.

769
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,060
I whacked it off.

770
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:17,729
II, I like, hit it with the pool scraper and then used the, uh,

771
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:21,119
I bought a leaf floor actually to get stuff off the trampolines, which works great.

772
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,650
By the way.

773
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,140
-- There you go, folks.
-- No, seriously. All that's the thing. I love.

774
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,150
All the new battery powered handheld tools are just so good nowadays.

775
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:32,500
Yeah. Yeah,

776
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,260
they are. But I'm not, we're not talking about that. I'm cutting us off.
