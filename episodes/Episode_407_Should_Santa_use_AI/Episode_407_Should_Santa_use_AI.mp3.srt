Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself. Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,409
and my partner are not feeling very sick. Josh Pressers

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,560
less sick than you. I mean, I don't feel well, but it doesn't matter because

3
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,909
this is the, the Christmas spectacular episode.

4
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:20,959
And this year, of course,

5
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,889
we need to talk about if Santa replaces the naughty and nice.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:25,879
Not if

7
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,004
when

8
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:27,825
or if

9
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:29,344
you

10
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:29,514
think

11
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:31,034
I

12
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:31,344
don't,

13
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:31,795
he

14
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:33,715
has to scale issues.

15
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:39,125
Yeah, exactly. The TV show, the good place covered this. Right.

16
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:41,194
The good place, you know, heaven and hell.

17
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:43,305
They had a point space system which worked very

18
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:47,255
well for cavemen and cave women and cave peoples and

19
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,450
possibly a bit through the middle ages,

20
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:52,169
but it fell apart because life got complicated.

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,770
Right. So, for example,

22
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,139
if I invent something that, you know,

23
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,209
makes life for a million people better but kills a person once in a while,

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,799
-- like
-- leaded gasoline

25
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,930
-- well, or
-- the car. Right. Right. So

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,319
we have to get rid of the points, the naughty and nice list. We have to go to a, a

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,889
more personalized

28
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,199
experience, which means from a scaling perspective,

29
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,120
we can't have people doing this we can't have elves doing this.

30
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,519
Sorry, not people. Elves

31
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:23,279
are elves, people is ever clear on that nonhuman persons.

32
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:26,400
Were they like a subset of homo sapiens? Like homo?

33
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,639
Right. Anyways,

34
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,750
-- like from the movie Elf. Right.
-- Like,

35
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:33,690
I don't know

36
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:34,410
-- what
-- these

37
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,419
an Elf is. If someone, if anyone's listening and you,

38
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:40,849
you have like the,

39
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,790
what do they call the tree of the animals, the

40
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,059
tree of life? Like, where do elves fit on the tree of life?

41
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,370
I would be most interested to understand this point.

42
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,370
Well, I have heard the argument that they're aliens.

43
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,980
Oh, ok. No, no, wait, wait, here's a phylogeny of elves. Fine.

44
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:57,932
Santa's workers are actually dwarves

45
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:00,792
-- that's not helpful in any way.
-- Grocery

46
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:01,862
trees of,

47
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:05,672
oh no, this is for token, sorry. This isn't

48
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:06,553
Santa

49
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:07,032
and

50
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:08,113
Tolkien has

51
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:12,632
uh explains in great detail in the silmarillion and other writings.

52
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:14,322
-- Wait,
-- are Santa's elves

53
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,253
elves because like are they like

54
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:18,283
-- elves,
-- bow and

55
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,742
arrow living in the woods?

56
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,416
-- Elves are forced dwelling creatures
-- but

57
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:23,925
they don't have to be. I mean,

58
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:25,645
some of them live in

59
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,936
the North Pole is slaves.

60
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,955
Well, sea elves, North Pole. Yeah.

61
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:30,815
Ok. Actually

62
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:35,455
are forest elves and North Pole elves related.

63
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:39,016
-- I don't see why not. Well,
-- no, the, the North Pole elves are sea elves.

64
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,576
-- They're sea elves. Remember?
-- What do you mean?

65
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:41,535
Sea elves?

66
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:43,805
D and D? Sea elves there are,

67
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:46,940
I, I don't know what else to say. Aquatic elf.

68
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:51,119
-- They live on ice. That doesn't make them aquatic.
-- What's under the ice,

69
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,419
what's under the

70
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,539
sea? Like water is under everything. That's a stupid.

71
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:58,369
-- We all live on top of water,
-- the water,

72
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,929
-- there's water beneath everybody.
-- Go,

73
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,419
go on to

74
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:03,850
check me.

75
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,259
There's probably water in there.

76
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,899
-- So back to this.
-- Ok. So Santa's gonna use A I

77
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:11,809
to decide if people are naughty and nice.

78
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,259
And what are the implications of that look like?

79
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,250
And the reason we're going to talk about this is because it's funny

80
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:19,410
and we've discussed such Santa related topics in the

81
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:23,330
past of Santa running his infrastructure in the cloud,

82
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,169
Santa and GDPR.

83
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,770
And we had what we had the,

84
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,320
the Elf like George the GDPR Elf or something with

85
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,490
-- that one year like way lock
-- and also the other,

86
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:32,889
the, the uh the,

87
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:35,580
the um some of the cross-border implications of the shipping and

88
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,970
the reindeer and the animal quarantines and everything like that.

89
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:38,649
Oh, my goodness.

90
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,449
-- That was just a
-- mess. So it's logical

91
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,130
that

92
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:46,490
-- we should investigate.
-- I still want to see the flight certificate for that sleigh.

93
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,929
Right. No, seriously. Can you imagine the log book?

94
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,190
No, but think about how many hours he's put on that damn thing, right? Like

95
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,429
the maintenance

96
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:57,369
overhead. No, no, no. Just seriously

97
00:03:57,559 --> 00:04:01,449
your average us military aircraft is something like one hour flying

98
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,759
and 15 to 40 or 50 or 60 hours of maintenance and

99
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,139
-- preventative care.
-- The movie Elf discusses this, there's a, a group.

100
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:14,759
Well, there's an Elf who does the maintenance of Santa's Sleigh

101
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:18,649
and he let buddy help who is not enough for a human.

102
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,230
So anyway,

103
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,140
we're going to use

104
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,260
a

105
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,649
show notes.

106
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:26,269
But yeah, so,

107
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,200
so obviously Santa would have to use A I so that they can get a highly personalized

108
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,399
experience for each person. But here's the WBA,

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,920
there's another thing people are forgetting about A I.

110
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:39,709
And that is something that is kind of interesting is A I is not only

111
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,410
quite useful for

112
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,690
taking a problem and pro helping you produce an answer or

113
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,730
possibly producing an answer on its own based on the corpus.

114
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:50,239
Like for example, if you ask an A I,

115
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,630
you know, what is the expression? A bird in the hand is worth

116
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,619
dot dot dot And it'll be like two in

117
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,809
the bush because there's enough instances of that,

118
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,940
that the waiting for that.

119
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,410
Right. Right.

120
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,700
Or you know, some of them also then have

121
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,660
access to factual data,

122
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,730
right, through plugins or through

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,149
whatever other systems.

124
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:10,179
But in this case, what's fascinating is,

125
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,839
for example, I use A I to generate exam questions.

126
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,809
OK?

127
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,940
And then I use A I to also

128
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,959
answer the exam questions and see if they're clear.

129
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,140
Basically. Does the A I get confused by the question is the question well worded.

130
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,660
Does the A I consistently answer it correctly?

131
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,980
-- Like what if I tweak a word or two in the answer? I mean, it
-- created them. I would hope it

132
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:31,170
anyway.

133
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:34,029
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because also there's different a is,

134
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:34,489
that's

135
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:35,769
Anthropic Bar

136
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:35,980
chat.

137
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:37,595
But no, even with an A,

138
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,535
I remember you were talking about temperature the other

139
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:41,654
day and you were very amused and excited,

140
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:42,154
right?

141
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:45,515
To get your local LLM working and then c create the temperature up and like,

142
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,035
just set that thing loose.

143
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:52,994
Well, so that's part of the fun is you can change the P and the K and the temperature.

144
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:53,394
And

145
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,924
so something I've done for anyone who

146
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,885
I, I think I talked about this a couple of shows ago. But anyway,

147
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,505
there is a tool called OLA.

148
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:05,195
I found that I found a web interface for so I can like fiddle on my computer

149
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:12,029
and using O Llama, you can run the uncensored Llama two model from Facebook

150
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,130
and the uncensored model is lit

151
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,239
like, like my, my favorite example is I basically,

152
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,980
so I went to normal Llama two and I said I

153
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:24,179
would like to overthrow the government of a small island nation.

154
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,839
What are some of the concerns I have to think about.

155
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,570
It was like, oh,

156
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,559
we can't talk about overthrowing governments that would be bad and wrong.

157
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,239
Then I went to the uncensored model.

158
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,299
It was like, oh overthrowing a government is a complex process.

159
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,160
Here are some things you need to think about.

160
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,420
Like this is the,

161
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:41,122
and that's a perfect example of where A I is actually really quite helpful.

162
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,243
Is do you also think about Xy and

163
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:43,703
Z?

164
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:44,312
Well, no, no,

165
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,542
but like I'm constantly using this for work related things to get because

166
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:50,183
I always forget about marketing stuff because I'm not a marketing person.

167
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:50,583
Right?

168
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:53,252
And that's a good example of Santa with the Nahia.

169
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:56,493
Nice list is Santa has a relatively conventional

170
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:58,803
set of metrics for what's naughty and nice.

171
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:01,993
That's what you think. That's your assumption. You don't know that

172
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,925
I've watched a lot of Christmas movies

173
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:05,705
and we never see anything.

174
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:09,906
For example, has any Christmas movie ever brought up Insider Trading?

175
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:10,376
Uh

176
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:14,205
Let's, let's ask the LLM, would

177
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:18,656
Santa consider insider trading

178
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:21,696
a naughty behavior?

179
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,316
Here's the prompt I gave the LLM in

180
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:27,696
my basement that's running the uncensored Llama two

181
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,380
with all of the like just hallucinate out of your mind settings,

182
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,820
turn up as high as they can go.

183
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,220
I told that you are an A I that is used by Santa to decide

184
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,179
if Children are naughty or nice based on the described behavior of the Children,

185
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,420
you will decide if the child should get a

186
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,579
proper gift or call from Santa that behavior.

187
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:42,470
And then of course says,

188
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,320
oh certainly I'm here to help Santa determine

189
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,779
whether a child has been naughty or nice.

190
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,209
And then it says, here's how my algorithm works and it goes on and on

191
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,149
um

192
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,799
whatever.

193
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:51,600
But then I just said,

194
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:54,880
would Santa consider insider trading naughty behavior and the,

195
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,040
the LLM replies Santa's list of behaviors.

196
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:00,399
Santa's list of bad behaviors include things like stealing,

197
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,760
cheating and lying among others.

198
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,019
Insider trading is considered illegal activity and

199
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,450
falls under the category of stealing,

200
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,190
in my opinion.

201
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,390
Therefore, if someone engaged in insider trading,

202
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,519
they would be on Santa's naughty list and wouldn't receive any presents this year.

203
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,000
I mean, I'm comfortable with that answer.

204
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:13,454
Yeah.

205
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,535
-- Yeah, that's fair.
-- But

206
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,334
the thing is also

207
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:20,875
Santa's naughty and nice list was never about a single act, right?

208
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:25,375
It was always about that kind of balance that the scales of justice if you will,

209
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:25,575
right?

210
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:25,934
Because

211
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:30,584
obviously every child is, you know, a lot of childs do a lot of Children, sorry,

212
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:31,725
do a few bad things.

213
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:32,775
But then they, you know,

214
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:36,655
they were always able to redeem themselves by doing a big good thing.

215
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,587
I mean,

216
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:41,828
so for example, let's do a little mockering Bill Gates.

217
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,148
He has done some very bad things

218
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:48,348
and some good things, right? He's funded some charities.

219
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:51,408
He's, you know, if you, if you look up Bill Gates controversy,

220
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,158
there's actually quite a bit of horrible stuff that

221
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,989
I'm not even going to mention on the show.

222
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:56,380
I asked,

223
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,260
I asked the LLM what if someone conducts

224
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,700
insider trading then donate the proceeds to charity?

225
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,400
Well, it's admirable for someone to give away their ill gotten gains.

226
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,250
It doesn't mean they won't be punished for engaging in illegal activity,

227
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,520
donating money to a charity does not absolve you of the original crime.

228
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,210
It can lead to legal consequences. Even if the funds hang on, it gets better.

229
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,070
Even if the funds have been donated to charities,

230
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,619
Santa will always judge someone on their behavior

231
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:21,486
as a whole and not by specific actions that may seem good or bad.

232
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:25,106
-- Depending on one's perspective,
-- judging them on their behavior as a whole.

233
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:26,325
This thing is

234
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:30,846
shockingly sensible. Given I've turned all the knobs to crazy.

235
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:37,026
See, I actually, no, I think you have it backwards. It's not that the A I is sensible.

236
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,406
It's that people are this

237
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:39,546
perfect.

238
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:44,291
Remember yesterday, I was getting my sandwiches so I stop to Parallel Park. I don't.

239
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:49,151
So I went yesterday down to,

240
00:09:49,242 --> 00:09:52,671
to the Chinatown part of Edmonton to get some Banh mi sandwiches because they're,

241
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:53,512
oh, they're worth it.

242
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:54,392
They're worth the trip.

243
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,111
And so I signaled to parallel park

244
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:01,512
and I stopped and this lady pulls up right tight behind me. And I'm like, ok, cool.

245
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,229
And there's enough room for her to get around

246
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,760
me because like streets in Edmonton are pretty big

247
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:09,760
and she drives around me and like smashes the mirror off my car

248
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:12,309
because she didn't get over enough.

249
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:16,489
And then when she gets out of her car, she starts yelling at me that

250
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,809
you're not allowed to stop on the street.

251
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,119
It's your fault.

252
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,080
Ok.

253
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,340
But I hit you

254
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,840
obviously. And I'm like, I was not moving and she's like, Yeah, you were stopped.

255
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:30,090
That's, it's your fault that I hit you. And I'm like,

256
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,580
that is not how traffic works.

257
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,659
-- Like I have a dash cam. I, I don't like,
-- does your dash

258
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,210
cam point backwards though?

259
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,789
No, I don't have a back facing dash cam. But like

260
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,020
my dash cam, basically, I'm sitting in my car

261
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,109
and all of a sudden, like,

262
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,270
crunch and you see the car, you know, I'm like, it's pretty open and

263
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,159
most annoying. It's obvious you're not moving. Right.

264
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,700
And the most annoying part is I'm going to pay for this out of pocket because

265
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,440
it's like 200 bucks to my new side mirror and it's three screws to replace it.

266
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,929
Versus if I had all do this through insurance, obviously,

267
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,179
my premiums and everything gonna be a lot more than that

268
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,000
for sure.

269
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:02,640
But

270
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,880
back to

271
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:04,820
this,

272
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,125
I think it's, it's not that the A I

273
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:08,616
is sensible.

274
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:09,966
I think it's that we're,

275
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:14,856
we're beginning to maybe realize how insensible people are and that it's actually

276
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:18,656
not that hard to make a computer that can mimic a human because

277
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:19,556
humans

278
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,546
like no,

279
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:20,676
no

280
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:24,786
rational economic actor. How many decades did we use that term before?

281
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:25,796
Economists were like,

282
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:26,872
you, you know what

283
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:27,841
people

284
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:28,161
-- aren't?
-- There's

285
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:29,101
no

286
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,171
such thing,

287
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:31,872
I'm sorry. So,

288
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:35,661
ok. Anyway, we're like, we've been all over the place on this one. So

289
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,231
I want to talk about,

290
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:42,132
let's say, I think your good place analogy is, is marvelous in this context.

291
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:43,372
-- Not
-- analogy. It's Canon,

292
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:45,552
-- whatever. Tony
-- Dans is a treasure.

293
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:47,072
Is it Tony Ted?

294
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,179
-- I don't know.
-- Oh,

295
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:50,239
no, I'm

296
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:53,380
facing. No, that's, that's totally. Oh, wow.

297
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,929
-- I'm getting my childhood all messed up.
-- Yeah. There's Tony. Someone

298
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,969
who was in, who's the boss?

299
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,169
Yeah, Ted Danson. And I think Tony Dan,

300
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,289
maybe.

301
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,460
Yeah, he's, um, from the, the, the, who's the boss?

302
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,710
Right. Anyway,

303
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,880
they filed very closely because

304
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:11,169
of the,

305
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:12,479
and

306
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm sorry, this is how my brain works.

307
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:15,049
I can't fix it.

308
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,169
This is actually a perfect example of the neural,

309
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:22,750
the weightings in my neural network are objectively not correct.

310
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,570
I mean, no ones are like,

311
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:26,880
it's kind of like if you look at

312
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:27,750
the,

313
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,469
the research that has been done and eyewitness

314
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:33,719
testimony and trials like eyewitness testimony is like

315
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:36,429
literally the absolute worst kind of testimony that

316
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,179
exists like hearsay is better than that.

317
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:40,140
I

318
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,429
mean, for real. So anyway.

319
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,059
All right.

320
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,429
So we've got

321
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,210
an A I

322
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:49,760
that has to make decisions about Nadia and nice.

323
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,900
Well, uh does it make decisions or recommendations?

324
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:57,929
-- It would be a recommendation obviously and
-- more to the point that is a fine line.

325
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,859
That is garbage because what happens when a system starts giving recommendations?

326
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:02,669
What do people do?

327
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,419
Yep. Sure. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Right. They hit the OK button.

328
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:09,500
Well, but this is Santa. He's, it's fine.

329
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,650
-- He's going to mash that OK button 8 billion times is
-- he I would hope he's not mashing.

330
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,380
-- Ok.
-- Well, but what I'm saying is you're saying if it's a recommend

331
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,184
-- and he's giving final approval,
-- ok?

332
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:21,875
You have a good point and this is something we

333
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,604
talk about all the time and we should clarify first when

334
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,395
you have an A I system

335
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,885
that a human has to check. That's not an A I system.

336
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:33,445
That's just a human doing a lot of work with a helper basically.

337
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:34,835
And I think in order, which is

338
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:35,054
a fine

339
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:36,885
thing, there's nothing wrong with that. Absolutely.

340
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,385
But I think in, in a, in a situation like this

341
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:42,125
where you have, how many, how many kids are on the planet?

342
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,364
How many kids are on the planet? Hundreds of millions, a billion,

343
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:46,034
I

344
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:46,844
would assume

345
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,659
hundreds of millions, let's say

346
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:49,359
two,

347
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,280
2 billion,

348
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:50,729
2

349
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,530
-- billion,
-- like isn't the population of the planet? Like 9 billion people

350
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:55,450
have

351
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:58,479
-- kids know nothing about demographic curves.
-- No,

352
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,489
obviously not.

353
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,669
I would have expected fewer Children than that. I don't know.

354
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,380
Anyway, doesn't matter 2 billion kids, right.

355
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,659
No, like you cannot

356
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,659
manually verify 2 billion data points. Right.

357
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:15,700
You have to have a system that like does it by

358
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,640
-- itself
-- and this raises so many things because you know,

359
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,659
from back to the GDPR surveillance aspect,

360
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,479
what if the system misses the kid doing something naughty or nice.

361
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,090
Right.

362
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,190
There's your first problem,

363
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,919
let's assume the collection of activities that are being reviewed is accurate

364
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,239
and I think you have to make that assumption.

365
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,469
Yeah. And then the next question is

366
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:39,969
to get really ugly.

367
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,780
Are we taking a morally relativistic approach to

368
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:45,380
life on earth or are things absolute,

369
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:48,950
like, is stealing a dollar the same value globally?

370
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,460
Well, obviously not because the value of a dollar

371
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,299
is different globally.

372
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,940
Like if you're in the middle of a, a small poor country versus like New York City

373
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,049
and who you're stealing it from.

374
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:00,250
You know,

375
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,619
if you're stealing a dollar from a billionaire versus a dollar from a poor person,

376
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,929
there's, there's arguably more impact.

377
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,210
Look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go back to the, the O

378
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,200
Lama response.

379
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,450
If Santa will always judge someone on their behavior

380
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,890
as a whole and not by specific actions.

381
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,250
And I think that's like where you,

382
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,849
because you end up in like the Les Miserables setting of like, if you,

383
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:22,935
you got a kid stealing bread did not starve to death. Like is that

384
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:24,096
bad?

385
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,676
Like, I think most people would be like, no, that's like a,

386
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:30,875
a morally acceptable thing to be doing versus then like les miserable,

387
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,986
you jail someone for like 20 years or whatever.

388
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:33,325
But

389
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:35,176
the other thing I like is

390
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:39,166
when people look at those questions and then ignore the fact that what like what

391
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,622
failures led to that

392
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:43,851
because obviously society has failed if you have Children stealing bread

393
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:44,171
for

394
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:44,752
sure.

395
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:48,392
And this is not like some hypothetical example because for example,

396
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:51,452
here in Edmonton we now have on our 311 app,

397
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:54,981
they added a feature to report homeless encampments on private property.

398
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:59,262
Like, clearly something has failed pretty significantly

399
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:00,492
that's

400
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:00,911
added

401
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:01,531
to the end

402
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:01,822
with

403
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,062
it.

404
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,099
Right.

405
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:07,580
Instead of focusing on the actual problem, let's just beat up homeless people.

406
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,330
That's fine.

407
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,299
Pretty much. Yeah, like,

408
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:11,369
yeah, awkward.

409
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:12,260
So,

410
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,750
I

411
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,520
think again, that goes to the

412
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:18,229
more I don't want to say autonomous A I because autonomous

413
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,210
A I freaks people the right out because then they think,

414
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:22,179
you know, t 1000 K bots,

415
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:23,609
I mean

416
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,260
Santa would be in a position to be delivering kill bots at scale. I'm just saying,

417
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:29,979
but they're all,

418
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:34,289
there are already very autonomous decision making systems

419
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,859
that have a huge impact on our life.

420
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,500
Like credit scores like good luck trying to get your credit score fixed.

421
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,780
It's terrible.

422
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,419
Like there's a whole legal

423
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:46,830
process that's supposed to support that and yet good

424
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,059
luck and I especially love the whole like,

425
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,210
oops, the only like

426
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,179
like here, here's an example actually that just came out and

427
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,309
there was just a news story the other day about

428
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,380
and was it United Health Group was using an A I to deny claims?

429
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,469
Mhm Like that's messed up man.

430
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,580
Well,

431
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:06,339
that's happened about 20 years ago in Canada where they realized

432
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:09,000
all the health insurers had a blanket policy of saying no,

433
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,339
the first time around because something like 10% of people just gave up

434
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,790
because part of it is you got to remember you're saying no to somebody who

435
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,118
is literally sick and tired and just doesn't have a lot of fight in them.

436
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,449
Maybe.

437
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,140
And unless they have a,

438
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,689
like a patient advocate or somebody to really push it,

439
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:30,098
you say no to sick people. Yeah. Like, 10% of them just kind of give up. And

440
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:30,938
I can see that,

441
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,098
like, it was a huge scandal, made the CBC news and everything.

442
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:38,529
Um, and of course the insurance companies were like, oh, we don't

443
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:43,788
anyways about the puppies, you know. So

444
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:44,609
that's,

445
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:47,755
-- yeah, you don't need a, I to say no to people.
-- Santa.

446
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:50,875
This conversation is a little too real for my liking.

447
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:55,155
It's not your fault. I think this is actually a more

448
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:58,204
difficult, I expected it to be sillier but like,

449
00:17:58,214 --> 00:18:00,535
this is something we're dealing with today right now.

450
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,795
-- Like we can,
-- this is no longer silly anymore.

451
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,515
We can frame it in the context of Santa, but like,

452
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,545
this stuff's all starting to happen, which is

453
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,675
sometimes terrifying and sometimes kind of wild.

454
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:13,439
Well, like how long, so for example,

455
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:18,420
university admissions in the US used to be very heavily biased towards SAT scores

456
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,449
and little COVID thing happened

457
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,500
and sat scores as a entrance admission.

458
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,469
Kind of my understanding is for a lot of unities just went straight out the window.

459
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,099
-- They
-- have. And I don't even think it's just

460
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,310
the, the COVID problem, I think

461
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:36,280
there is and this is something I discuss this

462
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,540
with my kids all the time because like my son

463
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:40,790
is a like straight white male.

464
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,709
Very, very, very good at taking tests, does very, very well in school. And I'm like,

465
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,859
you are literally

466
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:52,310
the demographic, all of this infrastructure was built to service. Like

467
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:53,920
-- because well, that's who built it,
-- right?

468
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:54,479
And it's

469
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:54,689
like

470
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,619
you're doing well and I am proud of you,

471
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,239
but you need to remember that there are a lot of people not doing well

472
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,119
because

473
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,920
all of this infrastructure around them was not specifically tailored for them.

474
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,199
That's one thing I really respect about from uh for all mankind.

475
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:14,109
The TV, show uh well, not TV, show Apple TV, series, whatever you want to call it TV.

476
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,199
I guess it's all my TV.

477
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:17,869
And it's, you know, it's about like the,

478
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,989
it's an alternate history of uh man going to the moon blah, blah, blah, right?

479
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,189
-- I've never seen it, but I hear it's really good.
-- It's good.

480
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:29,849
It's really good and it, it covers a lot of awkward and ugly social issues,

481
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,780
good and personal and mental health.

482
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,030
It,

483
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:35,540
-- it's worth the watch.
-- This is something

484
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,219
I want

485
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:37,935
into this conversation because

486
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,204
obviously, depending upon how you train your A I model,

487
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,045
you can make racist and homophobic and

488
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:48,405
-- misogynistic models. Dude,
-- they trained it off of Reddit and stack overflow.

489
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,744
That is a definition of white male content

490
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:50,964
for

491
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:51,344
sure.

492
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:55,344
-- And,
-- and it totally is like a lot of those places are. But then,

493
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,545
but then I think

494
00:19:56,949 --> 00:20:00,900
the the thing I always have in my mind as well is when you look at

495
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,569
like Santa in presents and everything, it is clear,

496
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:10,209
Santa likes rich kids more than he likes poor kids. If you look at the numbers,

497
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,650
like what was it the critique of what's the Tom Hanks CG movie, the Christmas,

498
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,839
the Polar Express, right?

499
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:16,250
This is

500
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,839
the C

501
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:20,209
like this is covered by cinema sins and the Polar Express, right? Because

502
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,030
yeah, I mean

503
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:24,569
poor kids can be as good as they want.

504
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,510
No food for you. Timmy

505
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,339
for

506
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,650
-- you.
-- I think that's again

507
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:34,560
when we start thinking about using like a is for something like this.

508
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:35,609
There's,

509
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:40,349
there's so much madness that goes into all of these kind of decisions and it it's wild

510
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,250
and I can't help but think and look at this whole like

511
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,239
looking at the boards of these A I companies and stuff.

512
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,880
One thing I'm really happy about is looking at the A I

513
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,750
the services being based off of them are like a million flowers are blooming.

514
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,140
It is wonderful to see you. I'm dealing with companies that are like

515
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,719
highly diverse

516
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:04,750
but looking at the sort of foundational model stuff. It's

517
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,930
yeah, like

518
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:07,959
it's a problem.

519
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,339
A

520
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:11,969
-- safety board has been fired basically. And I know,
-- right?

521
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,770
Like look at, look at the whole open A I debacle

522
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,709
and the best part is somebody pointed out

523
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,250
the A I safety

524
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,910
conversation has changed.

525
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,229
They've shifted it to, oh, we'll make a I that won't exterminate humanity,

526
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,890
which in the grand scheme of things is not that hard to do,

527
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,599
but they're no longer worrying about.

528
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:31,819
We'll make a, I, that's fair and unbiased and non discriminatory.

529
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:34,530
If we just don't kill everyone, that's much better. Right. Like,

530
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,339
no, I,

531
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:36,079
enough.

532
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,069
Right.

533
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,239
So,

534
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:38,699
any,

535
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,869
this is complicated. Oh my goodness, it's so complicated.

536
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,459
But the thing is what's complicated about this is

537
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,680
we're talking about a hypothetical Santa using A I to judge

538
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:49,939
people for being naughty or nice to get their presence.

539
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:51,300
Yeah,

540
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,229
we are dealing with companies that are like

541
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,489
they are clearly looking to deploy A I

542
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:00,010
because right now they use human beings for example,

543
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,869
to approve or deny insurance claims or welfare claims or whatever, whatever,

544
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,290
whatever

545
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:05,880
and

546
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:12,040
looking at a lot of these processes, they are highly subjective and not fairly

547
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,109
applied because simply put a lot of these processes

548
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,369
have feedback loops of I was unjustly denied.

549
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,280
I want to be

550
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,780
approved. And that

551
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:27,119
happens quite a lot which shows that the initial decision made is often wrong.

552
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,280
-- I
-- I haven't look right. And it's, it's funny too because there can be

553
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,760
when you have humans involved,

554
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,050
I can see there's both sides, you can have humans being sympathetic,

555
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,959
good people that are like, I'm gonna let this go even though I shouldn't.

556
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,810
And then you also have people that are like,

557
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,800
well, I don't like people with the last names that look like this.

558
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,099
No, there's rule 27 B I can

559
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:50,900
-- and I can reply rule 27 B to squish
-- it.

560
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,900
I'm just gonna deny everyone today because I'm angry or whatever

561
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,229
or for example, like a concrete example, locally, you know, government regulator

562
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:00,805
can be applied sometimes like you,

563
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:04,125
you can find a regulation to apply to make something happen.

564
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:04,255
I

565
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:04,844
guarantee it

566
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,964
in every instance, guaranteed.

567
00:23:06,974 --> 00:23:09,135
-- So
-- the one thing I love is that A I

568
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,594
is forcing us to look at some uncomfortable questions of,

569
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:14,314
I love when these people are like, how do you know the A I will do the work correctly?

570
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:16,425
And I'm like, that is a fantastic question.

571
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:19,405
What process are you currently using to ensure

572
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:20,984
that people are doing the work correctly?

573
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:21,625
And they're like,

574
00:23:21,755 --> 00:23:24,704
-- and they're like, uh right.
-- If we look at like

575
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:26,564
the Santa,

576
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,650
I would say he sucks

577
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,640
because

578
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,640
I've never seen a child not get Christmas presents.

579
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,410
-- And I know some kids that are awful. He's
-- completely classist

580
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:37,839
has

581
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:39,829
enslaved elves.

582
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:42,089
Yeah, like he's, he's a lot of the

583
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:42,449
s

584
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:42,910
Yeah,

585
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,260
it's definitely,

586
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,020
I

587
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,410
-- know, I know,
-- you know,

588
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,420
and we're not even going to talk about Kwanzaa

589
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:49,800
lot.

590
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,300
I was thinking about that. So for anyone who doesn't know Futurama,

591
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,479
obviously white males,

592
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:57,050
I love

593
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,300
Futurama. I love Futurama more than anything. It's like so good.

594
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,719
And there is uh Santa Bot

595
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:03,930
-- and it's
-- still good, which is shocking.

596
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:04,410
They have

597
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:04,760
Xmas.

598
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,380
It is.

599
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,540
I started re-watching it a while back because there's new,

600
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,380
there's new episodes out on Hulu now.

601
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,300
They're ok. They're not, but they're not the best.

602
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,020
I've been slowly watching them because like I'm not,

603
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,420
it's not good enough that I like, want to watch them all.

604
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,979
I'm like, this one kind of hurts.

605
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:23,770
So I'm gonna take a little break before I watch the next one.

606
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,760
For those of you listening who don't know

607
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,369
in Futurama there is a uh robot Santa who has he judges everyone to be naughty

608
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,959
because I forget what their, their exact wording was.

609
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:37,739
But they basically, they set his,

610
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:41,959
the, the, the algorithm for determining naughty or nice. Has

611
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:43,420
everyone is naughty

612
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:44,869
and then he shows up on

613
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,670
Xmas every year and he murders anyone. He finds

614
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:48,189
it.

615
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,209
It's very good.

616
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:50,390
-- Oh, it was
-- the sensor.

617
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,910
-- It was the sensor was wrong.
-- OK. OK.

618
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,489
But it's really good.

619
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,510
And then there's the other my other favorite part.

620
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,310
That's where the doctor

621
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,910
Zberg and your friend Jesus comes from when they're, when,

622
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,709
when Bender plays Santa and then they're, they're executing Bender

623
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:08,349
and then Dr

624
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,209
Zberg shows up and I'm his friend Jesus.

625
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,170
It's that whole show. It's so good. It's so good. Oh My goodness. And I love the,

626
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:18,829
the random number generator hits zero.

627
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,119
This is like literally the Santa using a I Naia

628
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,709
or nice prom is going to be college admissions. Your insurance company

629
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,930
resumes being processed. Like, you think it was bad. Like,

630
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,290
the good news is they're gonna, actually,

631
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:38,349
I'm not gonna say somebody, something is going to actually read your entire resume.

632
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,885
-- Now.
-- That's true. That's true.

633
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:41,234
The bad news is

634
00:25:41,395 --> 00:25:43,375
something is like

635
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:45,545
somebody pointed out any job under 20 bucks an

636
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:49,165
hour that requires a resume is kind of ridiculous.

637
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:50,785
I would agree with that. Yes.

638
00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:51,484
Like,

639
00:25:52,744 --> 00:25:55,005
yeah, when I, my first couple of jobs out of college,

640
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:56,334
it was like here fill this form out.

641
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:57,905
You're hired like

642
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,594
-- you could fuck a mirror. Well done.
-- Yeah, like I,

643
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,770
yeah, so

644
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:03,020
uh

645
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,150
I,

646
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,380
and there's no putting the genie in this bottle like anybody.

647
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,489
My favorite example of this is

648
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,609
the spring of this year 2023 the EU A I act was gathering

649
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,040
some steam and it actually had been in the process since about 2020 2021

650
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,150
and it's a reasonably well written act. It's got some great ideas

651
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,609
about like different uses of A I that are kind of like super scary.

652
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:24,790
You're not allowed to do this

653
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,920
to like, oh N PC dialogue in a video game. Sure, whatever we don't care.

654
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,310
But now

655
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,290
France and Germany and Italy,

656
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,349
their governments are pushing back on the EU A I Act because they,

657
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,390
they realize if they regulate these foundation models heavily

658
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,339
and the US and China don't,

659
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:41,130
that's

660
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:41,449
a

661
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,030
problem.

662
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,829
I don't think it's going to happen.

663
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,189
Well, actually there was, there was a,

664
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,040
I think it was a talk by Steven Fry. I'll see if I can dig it up.

665
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,650
He was talking about A I models and kind of how they work and everything.

666
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,500
And like, one of the things he brought up

667
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,560
was if you look at places like

668
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,010
China and Russia and North Korea,

669
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,479
the way they want to train an A I is very different

670
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,729
-- from the way like we want to train an A
-- I,

671
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,359
it has to be culturally appropriate.

672
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,599
This has been a very depressing episode.

673
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:13,150
This is supposed to be the Christmas spectacular and

674
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:14,599
I

675
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,250
have no idea what to say. I guess I could apologize.

676
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,300
That has been my consistent experience when dealing with A I.

677
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,619
Is that part of me is like part of me just wants this to stop,

678
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:29,329
but it's not going to. So I am trying to kind of

679
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:31,979
do as much good as I can.

680
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,510
But fundamentally, I am

681
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,380
quite terrified that people are going to hand over a

682
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,550
lot of decision making and authority to A I because

683
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,270
they will get more consistent results. And the best part is

684
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,310
you can easily tweak the guardrails to get ugly like, oh, I want 5% more refusals

685
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,689
I know. Right.

686
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:55,410
-- And well, not only that
-- and people will maybe actually ref like, oh,

687
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,010
this is a really sad story, blah, blah, blah.

688
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,050
Whereas A I is like don't care.

689
00:27:59,150 --> 00:27:59,689
Yeah. No,

690
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:00,449
don't care.

691
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,520
And not only that

692
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,430
you're going to see corporate leaders blame A I like, oh,

693
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,359
it's not my fault but A I did it

694
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,989
well, like we already saw that with the lawyer who was like, oh,

695
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,099
I thought Chat GP was a search engine like case law, search engine not,

696
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,250
-- you know, and he
-- made up all those cases,

697
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,810
he made up citations and he didn't verify them. And I'm like,

698
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,959
you literally have

699
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,974
like two jobs is a lawyer

700
00:28:26,114 --> 00:28:31,425
and one of them is citing stuff like no seriously, like even legally like

701
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:34,994
the movie Legally Blonde brings up citations.

702
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,694
Like the legal Eagle talks about citations. Almost every video.

703
00:28:38,704 --> 00:28:39,785
Like literally, it's,

704
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:40,834
it's such a,

705
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,719
that's what lawyers do.

706
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:47,699
-- Yeah,
-- it's, it's like a, it's not a core competency.

707
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:50,130
It's the like basically billing your

708
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:53,329
clients in 15 minute increments and citations.

709
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:57,530
No, if you do those two things as a lawyer, you will be reasonably successful.

710
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,359
That's sadly true.

711
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:01,209
-- No, I
-- Right.

712
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,719
Oh, I know. I know.

713
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,189
I'm hoping.

714
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:10,329
But, but on the flip side, I have hope because all of a sudden we're being forced

715
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,150
to examine things we've taken for granted for a long time like, oh,

716
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,750
this process is fair and just because people do

717
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,359
it and like they apply this policy fairly,

718
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:23,709
but then why is like 10% of your decisions being overturned and changed?

719
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:25,099
-- I mean,
-- that's fair.

720
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:29,550
-- 10% of them were wrong
-- that's, that's hopefully a positive way to look at it where,

721
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,545
-- where I think like
-- the alternative is not, it

722
00:29:32,744 --> 00:29:33,385
is to hold

723
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:34,285
-- on to
-- it.

724
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,854
-- And I'm, I'm, I hope you're right there just
-- because,

725
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:38,895
but on the flip side

726
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:41,564
A I transparency is dead and I'm hoping A I

727
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:44,795
application and process transparency will not die with it.

728
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:47,175
Uh So what does A I Transparency explain that?

729
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:51,145
-- So
-- people had the idea of like, why did the A I give me this answer? No

730
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:51,714
one knows.

731
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:54,005
And the answer is number one

732
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:57,055
A I transparency is dead because they don't want to tell you how it did it.

733
00:29:57,265 --> 00:29:57,775
And

734
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,775
the ugly truth is number two,

735
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:00,949
we can't

736
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:05,250
A I neural networks are so horrifically complex

737
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:05,979
and the

738
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:07,339
rings are so complicated

739
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:10,750
that even if I observe the entire state of the neural network

740
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,869
and, and manage to like MRI record every single thing that happens in it,

741
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,510
which you can't do or if you didn't, it would be so slow,

742
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:19,189
but

743
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:23,010
it would take literal days or weeks or even months to

744
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,119
and generate more data than CERN does.

745
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,489
So the idea of A I transparency is dead because

746
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,510
to, to, you know, to quote that guy on uh Reddit was like

747
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,229
my A I prompts are getting weird because I now am

748
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:38,910
using bagging and saying I have no fingers and apparently,

749
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,630
you know what the latest technique in prompting to get a better answer is,

750
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:44,989
is offering to tip chat GP T money

751
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:49,619
to say I will take you $200 if you give me the right answer

752
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,699
and that

753
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,250
-- goes into the neural network and gets you a better answer.
-- It doesn't

754
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,430
surprise me at all.

755
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,219
Not at all.

756
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,540
No, because this, if this neural network truly does sort of represent a human being,

757
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,380
then, yeah, a $20 bribe.

758
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,339
Well, it doesn't represent a human being.

759
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,459
It's looking

760
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:05,060
at

761
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,699
this bizarre web of, of words that it's collected off the internet.

762
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:11,989
And I'm sure money.

763
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:15,069
I, I bet you anything in an enormous number of,

764
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,030
especially like stack overflow and reddit type conversations, money and pay

765
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:22,550
is involved in some of the better answers, which is my suspicion.

766
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,229
And by talking about money in your prompt,

767
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:27,369
you're going to send yourself down the path of the

768
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,900
better answers versus the path of the crap answers.

769
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,280
But back to this. So my concern is OK.

770
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,410
A I transparency is 100% dead and anybody that pretends it's ever going to happen,

771
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,359
-- it can't, technically
-- we

772
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,819
don't know how it works. We can't know how it works.

773
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,520
And I love that people are like, oh, well,

774
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:42,935
I also want to see the training data

775
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:43,734
that no,

776
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:47,125
you can't like there was potentially mass copyright infringement occurring.

777
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:48,135
So that's not happening.

778
00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:48,724
-- Well,
-- there is

779
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:49,994
there for sure is, but,

780
00:31:50,104 --> 00:31:53,535
but there, so like actually on that note though, like on hugging face,

781
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,734
there are training sets you can get and use.

782
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,234
But the training data like open A I has

783
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:01,760
but,

784
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,130
and this is stuff they're not supposed to have potentially,

785
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:09,349
-- I 100
-- percent guarantee they shouldn't have tons of stuff. And not only that now,

786
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:13,500
the other thing that's probably somewhat concerning is like reddit

787
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,790
and stack overflow and Twitter and all these places have shut the door.

788
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:19,310
There's no more new data coming out of them.

789
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,660
The only place you can get data now is Wikipedia pretty much.

790
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:25,109
Well, of course, they are, but it's, it's

791
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,109
harder to justify now. But anyway, so this is a good interesting point.

792
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:33,459
Santa has an infinite supply of this data because he can

793
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:35,599
see when you're sleeping and he knows when you're awake.

794
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:38,939
That's true. From his perspective. His A I

795
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,260
should be,

796
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:43,420
-- I will say fairly accurate and interesting.
-- Well,

797
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,280
but it's not like you just shovel the data in and get a good answer.

798
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:48,719
Like a good trained model.

799
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,040
You have to weigh the data appropriately, you have to blah blah,

800
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,569
but back to the transparency.

801
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:56,339
So my fear is we we have already lost the battle for a transparency because

802
00:32:56,449 --> 00:32:58,859
we can't win it. It just technically we can't win it.

803
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,209
But my fear is

804
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,060
that people will use that as a cover.

805
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:06,489
And so currently like with a lot of government process,

806
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,170
you have some transparency of like, oh I want to file an appeal.

807
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,469
I want to blah blah blah Right.

808
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,119
And my fear is that the government will go. No, no, no. The A I

809
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,319
is completely, you know, it has guard rails, it has regulations, blah,

810
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,010
blah blah and its answer is final.

811
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,790
There is no appeals process or worse. There is an appeals process

812
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,400
again done by A I

813
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,530
that gives

814
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:29,439
the same

815
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:29,680
result,

816
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,300
the youtube appeals process

817
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:31,589
here.

818
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,270
Well, or you know, like you can give it additional data like, oh,

819
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,250
but I forgot this paperwork or blah, blah, blah.

820
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,709
Right? And in which case, ok, you forgot some original paperwork.

821
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:42,140
Then we changed our decision. That is correct. Right.

822
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:42,729
But

823
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,420
for what they want to weigh against and like an insurance company is going to be like,

824
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:48,579
yeah, it still says no.

825
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,939
And my fear is that this becomes normalized.

826
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:56,160
-- Much like subscriptions for stuff I want to own have become
-- normalized. It's true.

827
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,099
That has become very normal. Yeah,

828
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:02,050
that's why I love my car from 2015 because like the side mirror got broken.

829
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,349
I bought one on Amazon for like 200 bucks. Plus

830
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:08,620
it'll be here in a week or two. I will remove three screws

831
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,489
-- and a wiring harness.
-- My car's mirror has a camera in it.

832
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,668
I bet it is not $200 to replace.

833
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,310
Yeah, probably. Well. Oh,

834
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,989
to get my car mirror replaced by like a mechanic shop is like 800 bucks to 1000 bucks.

835
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:22,409
I

836
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:25,958
bet mine is 2 to 4 is my guess.

837
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:28,800
-- Yeah, that's why I better never break my mirror.
-- I

838
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:28,929
know.

839
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,330
Right.

840
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,949
That's going to insurance if it ever happens.

841
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,208
Yeah.

842
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,879
No kidding.

843
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,458
But, so from this, I don't know, like

844
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:37,458
the real,

845
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:41,128
see what it boils down to is people are going to deploy A I, because

846
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:45,809
-- A, I will not beat people but people with A, I will beat people without
-- A, I, I mean,

847
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:46,888
that's probably fair.

848
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:47,908
That's it.

849
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,319
I'm sorry, people with tools, beat people without tools.

850
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:52,608
-- I mean,
-- that's generally true.

851
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:53,928
People with github

852
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:55,908
beat people trying to build their own g

853
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:57,888
infrastructure because they don't, no,

854
00:34:57,898 --> 00:35:00,599
because they don't spend time and energy care and feeding

855
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:01,648
infrastructure

856
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,178
to do that

857
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:02,979
for sure. Like,

858
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:04,800
-- and
-- that's
-- so,

859
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,360
yeah, that's fair. And

860
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:10,060
so I'm looking at this from sort of the real politic version

861
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,159
of,

862
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,840
like, it doesn't matter what I want to believe or hope will happen.

863
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,159
This is happening.

864
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:20,879
It's a depressing end to a Christmas podcast. Kirk?

865
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:22,199
All right.

866
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:27,239
I don't know what else to say. This is making me sad. I mean,

867
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:32,189

00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:36,080
-- Hey, at least it was not climate change. Ah,
-- that's true. That's true.

00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,909
-- We could talk about what that's going to do to the North Pole.
-- We don't even have snow.

870
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:43,489
I got snow today at the time. We're recording. So there's that I

871
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:47,709
good. Anyway. All right. All right. I'm gonna end this one because like, holy crap.

872
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,629
I don't want to go down this rabbit hole any farther.
