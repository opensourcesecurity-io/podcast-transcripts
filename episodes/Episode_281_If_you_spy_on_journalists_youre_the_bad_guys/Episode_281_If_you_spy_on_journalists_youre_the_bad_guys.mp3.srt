Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,069
Kurtz Fried and my partner in not recording

2
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,949
journalists and breaking into their phones illegally,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,770
Josh Bresser.

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:15,619
-- I mean,
-- we've recorded journalists.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,049
-- We, we're, we're technically journalists,
-- not illegally. We had consent,

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,040
-- they
-- had to dial in.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,780
-- That's
-- true. They followed a link and they, there's

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:24,969
a,

9
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:28,719
there's a big thing that says we're recording on the screen

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,000
and you have to like pick your microphone and pick your speakers

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,549
pretty sure the spyware doesn't do that,

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,159
I suppose not. So, what are we talking about?

13
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:43,150
We're talking about the NSO and what, and, and let's just get any bias out of the way.

14
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,849
I personally think the NSO

15
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,970
is

16
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:48,279
a horrifically ill behaved company that is

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,689
probably doing things that are illegal and

18
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,240
we're going to basically throw them under the train.

19
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,200
They're the bad guys in this story. Let's face it.

20
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:58,990
I'm not sure they can be the good guys ever.

21
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,599
So basically, the NSO group is this

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,919
Israeli company.

23
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,900
And again, normally I wouldn't care what country they're from,

24
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,650
but apparently the NSO group gives the Israeli government

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,279
the list of the people that they're targeting Right.

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,080
So they essentially share intelligence with the government.

27
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:17,860
Which sort of sounds like one of those things where,

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,190
well, it's like the Russian ransomware gangs,

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,309
they're doing things that are illegal, probably illegal in Russia.

30
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,870
But, you know, the Russian authorities don't care.

31
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,940
One of the latest ransomware that tore through the world

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,110
was specifically looking for computers that had Russian language as

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,989
-- a default language and they weren't ransoming those
-- computers.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,150
That's a common thing now. Yeah.

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,389
So I suspect in general the rule of law is

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,910
stronger in a country like Israel than say Russia.

37
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,029
Yes point is,

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,000
it seems to me like this is one of those things where

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,680
we want to do something that may or may not be legal.

40
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,410
But you know, if we give the government this information, they might keep,

41
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:52,639
let us stick around.

42
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,419
Well, there's also the aspect of, I mean,

43
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,699
a great example is there are companies that make missiles for the military.

44
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,029
If I go to them and say I want to buy a missile, they're going to be like no.

45
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,949
And

46
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,660
so, and I would imagine buying,

47
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,850
selling and possessing missiles is probably illegal.

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,729
Well, it's under itar and it's a destructive device under us federal law.

49
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:18,020
-- So
-- the idea is that there are

50
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,169
companies that provide goods and services to

51
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,250
governments and the idea is the government will say you can do this thing,

52
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:29,669
but you can only work with the people we like.

53
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,259
And the current evidence with the NSO group is suggesting

54
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,089
that

55
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:37,860
-- that is probably not true. Yeah.
-- Well, I mean, there's, there's,

56
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,039
I feel like it's like, you know, that Webber and Mitchell, are we the baddies skit?

57
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,100
Yes.

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,380
And so, and then the other thing is like, you look at the Guardian and, well,

59
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:49,360
and it's the Guardian of the New York Times, the Washington Post, you know, not, not

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,949
that they're reasonably respectable papers.

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,669
I mean, they're pretty much the only ones left

62
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,669
and you look at the list of people

63
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,100
that are getting targeted by this

64
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:01,160
product and it's journalists,

65
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,330
it's the editor at the Financial Times, like, come on

66
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,520
the editor at the financial Times,

67
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:09,699
like I'm pretty sure she is not involved in anything too shady.

68
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,080
Well, no, no, I mean, so the reason they're doing this actually is

69
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,339
by targeting journalists, they're not

70
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:19,899
actively going after journalists, journalists talk to people

71
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,139
they want,

72
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:22,119
right?

73
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,110
And some of these and, and when you cast a wide net,

74
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,880
you're going to get people on every side

75
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,160
of this argument because, like, for example,

76
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:34,639
whenever you hear about an anonymous source, that could be someone working for the,

77
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,380
the government that says, oh, this thing is happening.

78
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,399
I mean, Edward Snowden is the easiest whistleblower of all time of, I mean,

79
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,639
functionally he, he leaked a ton of stuff but everyone knew who he was.

80
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:47,080
Like, there was no escaping that, but there's

81
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,940
people who leak little bits and pieces

82
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,360
to journalists all the time.

83
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:53,789
And so now a government could say to the NSO group, uh, who leaked this

84
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,089
and if they have access to that reporter's phone, they can probably figure it out.

85
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,839
And I

86
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:04,729
-- really don't like that argument. Oh, it's
-- terrible. I agree. I'm not saying it's ok.

87
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,850
I'm saying that's what they're doing.

88
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,570
-- Well,
-- and the other thing that even if you ignore all this and let's,

89
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,809
let's just go with the whole lawful government authorized whatever.

90
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,309
Literally, if you Google, you know,

91
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,269
surveillance program later found to be unlawful space country name,

92
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,869
like you plug in the word Canada.

93
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,869
And we get an article from like May where, you know, our version of the NSA was

94
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,149
essentially paddled by a judge and the judge straight up said your,

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,299
your warrant process is so weak that you may be doing things that are illegal.

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,070
Right. Right.

97
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,700
You know, and this is Canada, we have pretty strong rule of law and whatnot here.

98
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,209
Like if Canada can't get it right.

99
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,140
-- I mean,
-- come on, there are always there, there's this constant back and forth.

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,619
And one of my favorite examples is

101
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:48,859
where we get new technology and then

102
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,769
the law and judges have to catch up with new technology

103
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,260
and,

104
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,369
and I mean, this is,

105
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,579
this is constant where there might be like the FBI might do some sort

106
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,500
of surveillance and then you go to court and the courts will say,

107
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,880
ok, this is new we don't know what to do and sometimes they get it wrong a lot,

108
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,059
but sometimes they get it right.

109
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,100
There's this thing called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in

110
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,040
the US that says I can't break into your phone.

111
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,079
Well, you can't,

112
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,429
but, but

113
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:14,269
a group working on behalf of the government could.

114
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,709
-- But here's the thing,
-- are they working on behalf of the government though?

115
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,630
Because it's also sounds like private clients,

116
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,820
not just that you have to work on behalf of the

117
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,829
government and you have to have a warrant for example,

118
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,869
to do this because if say the FBI put spyware on my phone

119
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,500
and they don't have a warrant to do it,

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,299
then that is almost definitely a violation

121
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,269
of.

122
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,429
I, I think the fourth amendment, I think the fourth amendment, yeah,

123
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,470
fourth amendment, which we talked about what, a couple of episodes ago with Chris.

124
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:40,940
But you know what I mean? It's that surveillance state

125
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,799
and I have a strong suspicion.

126
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:48,160
Everything going on here is, well, well,

127
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,779
outside of the realm of even discussing in polite circles

128
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,239
and, and this is part of what goes through this whole, well, you know,

129
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,750
maybe it's a necessary evil.

130
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,309
Well,

131
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:58,239
is it

132
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,670
like, have there actually been

133
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:05,130
e essentially, has this program, the negatives been outweighed by the positives?

134
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,230
Well, and the classic argument is like, oh,

135
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,600
we can't talk about the positives because they're so super secret.

136
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:11,239
I, I don't, I don't agree with that, let's, let's break this apart.

137
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,160
There's a lot, there's a lot to unpack here. I want to start with just

138
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,119
the,

139
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,600
the, the technical exploit

140
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,720
-- given what we know at this moment. So
-- it's, it's multiple exploits.

141
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,160
They essentially have like a stable of exploits that they use at scale.

142
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,750
And, you know, so once in a while, one or two of them get caught and they go on to the next

143
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:29,976
one.

144
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,765
and apparently one thing they've done is they've really upped their

145
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,835
game with their command and control and reporting back services because,

146
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:36,515
well, hold on, hold on.

147
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:39,015
You're, you're too far, you're too far. You've jumped to like step seven.

148
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:41,615
Let's start with how they're getting into these phones.

149
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:45,555
So what we understand at this point is obviously people have cell phones,

150
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:47,876
cell phones have security vulnerabilities.

151
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:51,716
These groups have stables of vulnerabilities. And so what they do is

152
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,216
they have a payload,

153
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:56,496
but they have to use a vulnerability to get the payload onto the phone.

154
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,772
And I know there is just recently been a fix for,

155
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:04,712
for iphones that it sounds like there was a what they call zero click

156
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:08,432
exploit for iMessage and zero click means a human doesn't have to do anything.

157
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:11,002
There are exploits that human might have to hit, ok?

158
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:13,391
Or a human might have to read the message or whatever.

159
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:16,902
And in this case, it was just send a message hack phone.

160
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,441
That's it. Right. Wait till the person goes to sleep.

161
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:21,791
-- They don't even know anything happened.
-- Well, and that's the beauty, right?

162
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:25,552
By definition, traditional tax where I send you an email, you have to open the email,

163
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:26,701
it's not parsed until you.

164
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:30,440
I have to get you to browse to a web page that explodes your browser

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,399
and oh my God, what a pain. That is. What if I could just send you a text message or an

166
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,079
iMessage? Right? And that's the thing to remember.

167
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,160
There's text messages, s MS text messages

168
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,540
and then there's

169
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:41,059
iMessage and

170
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,260
iMessage is all sorts of black magic on the back end with, you know,

171
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,700
Apple's systems and whatnot.

172
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,299
But the point is basically I send you an

173
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:47,899
iMessage

174
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,640
and whether you like it or not, your phone's parsing it.

175
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:51,019
That's

176
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:51,429
right.

177
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,760
And so

178
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,600
obviously, from an attacker's point of view,

179
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:55,010
Hazza,

180
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,010
right? I just fire off an

181
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:00,510
-- iMessage at you. And then 30 seconds later, I have a payload running on
-- your phone.

182
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,709
And now it should be noted that this is not a problem restricted just to

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,239
iMessage literally anything that processes

184
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,320
almost any kind of data

185
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,350
is going to be subject to this.

186
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,190
It's these push messages, apps like say whatsapp or signal or

187
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,899
you know, anything that accepts a message from a remote party.

188
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,299
I think 11 aspect being is a lot of these programs don't allow

189
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:26,500
random people to text you or to message you as easily as say,

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,179
iMessage does. So Yeah. So they basically, they push

191
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,875
an exploit towards you, your phone parses in and it hijacks your phone.

192
00:08:32,974 --> 00:08:35,914
And what's really interesting to me is two things they've changed.

193
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:36,965
They, they no longer

194
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:39,164
appear to be getting persistence like they're

195
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,655
no longer compromising your system and modifying it

196
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:46,765
because here's the thing, if you reboot your phone or get a newer phone

197
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:49,405
while still gonna have probably an operating system with that

198
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:51,484
exploit and they just push the text message out again.

199
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,104
Sure. Right. So,

200
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:53,775
you know,

201
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,765
and this is one thing I always kind of thought about is

202
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:58,924
why do Attackers spend so much time getting persistence on a system

203
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,669
when, if the, if the system isn't patched to fix that flaw,

204
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,440
like if they reboot it or something,

205
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,340
you can just fire the attack again.

206
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,070
Well, that's assuming they don't update it. I mean, I, I think the, the issue being

207
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:11,799
that

208
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,000
every time you use an exploit,

209
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,500
you risk burning it because the right person might be paying attention

210
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,190
at the right time and all of a sudden you're done.

211
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,010
And so, I mean,

212
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,770
that's something you have to keep in mind if

213
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,070
you're doing some sort of co ordinated attack.

214
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,460
Yeah.

215
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:27,669
Well, and ironically, of course,

216
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,349
not getting persistence helps with that

217
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:32,030
because there's less to forensically examine.

218
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,700
I mean, potentially in this case, it sounds like they're dropping malware

219
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,780
and they don't have to

220
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,419
-- re exploit the device.
-- No, no.

221
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,630
If you, if you reboot if you turn your phone off and on it, kicks them out,

222
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,109
but they can just send the attack again.

223
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,309
Ok.

224
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:49,270
So, so

225
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,989
they're not modifying the system in any way, shape or form,

226
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,469
like on dis as it were in old.

227
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,580
I know which

228
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,750
-- I assuming
-- whatever, same thing,

229
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:00,390
chips,

230
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,780
chips all the way down.

231
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,729
-- I call them discs. And
-- what's interesting is,

232
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,059
well, that's the thing, right?

233
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,909
Is, is in past, like,

234
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,770
computers generally don't accept a message from

235
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,479
an untrusted source and fully parse it.

236
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,700
And this is a new,

237
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,219
like this is now a common use case because what

238
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,580
I I need to message with people and talk to them

239
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,450
like that's kind of the point of a phone originally was you remember

240
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,619
back in the olden days when we used phones to talk to people?

241
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,369
I, I remember that you'd use your voice. That was

242
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:31,059
lame.

243
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:32,169
Yeah. Uh

244
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,510
maybe we should convert this podcast to, to an emoji text stream.

245
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,690
It would just be poop

246
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,349
emojis

247
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,020
pretty much thousands of poop emojis.

248
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:42,590
So,

249
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:45,780
and then the next thing. So, OK, you've got a payload on a person's phone.

250
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,710
Now you gotta, we'll get some data out of there

251
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:52,479
to where you can go look at it. Traditionally, this was kind of noisy.

252
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,630
Apparently they were using, for example, among other things,

253
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,419
Amazon's cloudfront services because

254
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,159
everything talks to cloudfront at some point like games are using it, you know,

255
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:04,880
all sorts of apps use cloudfront for, for content delivery because, well, yeah,

256
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,500
I mean, you're gonna use cloudfront,

257
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:06,840
my

258
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:09,489
cloud flare, right. You're going to use one of those people.

259
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,969
And, uh, the good news is apparently Amazon kicked, uh,

260
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,849
NSO group off of their infrastructure.

261
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,280
That's what I hear.

262
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,619
Yeah, there's a big article about it,

263
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,090
but part of the problem is the NSO group has become

264
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:24,049
somewhat more sophisticated with using things like port knocking

265
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,109
and using other tricks to hide their command and

266
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,299
control services and to make them harder to detect

267
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:32,159
and conversely in doing that. Obviously,

268
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:36,419
if you do find it, it's, it's guaranteed that it's that, you know, nso group thing,

269
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,979
like there's no way somebody accidentally

270
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,890
created this wonky looking domain with this

271
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,510
like weird where you do a DNS request that opens a port,

272
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,460
you talk to the port, it opens another, you know what I mean?

273
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:45,469
Like this whole thing, it's

274
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:46,429
you,

275
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,570
you basically know that you found something malicious when you run across that,

276
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,049
I mean, sure. And so the good news there is is

277
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,369
possibly and hopefully, you know,

278
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,030
this results in fingerprints that the good guys can use to detect

279
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,580
when their systems are compromised and and then go deal with it,

280
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,900
right?

281
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,469
-- Well,
-- in, in. But ok,

282
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:07,750
so this is part of where I think the story becomes more interesting is

283
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,659
yes,

284
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,159
exactly that where the good guys can start looking for indicators of compromise,

285
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,099
be it on the device, be it, network traffic, whatever.

286
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:21,880
But the problem is just given the nature of this game,

287
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,780
the defenders always have to wait for the attacker to

288
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:26,840
make a move before they can react to it.

289
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,900
And so now we've reached the point where the pendulum

290
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:31,219
is swinging back towards the defenders in this case.

291
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:34,989
But that's it. It's unfortunate. Well, I guess it's not unfortunate.

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,739
It's just reality.

293
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,919
Yeah. And it always has to be like this.

294
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:38,400
And I mean,

295
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,640
the good news is Apple has done some sandbox around

296
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,780
iMessage using their blast door thing and that's the future.

297
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:47,299
There's, there is no way to build a piece of software

298
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:52,710
that parses a rich multitude of text and images and video

299
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,479
-- and have it be secure.
-- That's a, that's a,

300
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:58,520
there's so many layers here. It's so wild.

301
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,969
But the good news is

302
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,479
what I love Apple had a full dress panic. Right. That's what we want.

303
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,219
Like they pushed out a security update.

304
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:07,969
And do you remember what the update notes said? I didn't even look.

305
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:11,429
They basically, they said there's an update, install it. That's it.

306
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,130
We don't have time to write stuff down.

307
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,549
They probably didn't even exactly know what they were going to write.

308
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,710
I know how this works

309
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,820
and there's probably lawyers that want to approve things.

310
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,349
But so, ok,

311
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,940
I want to focus on what you said a bit ago,

312
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,229
which is that we're never going to

313
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,679
write secure software and these mitigating technologies are

314
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,039
kind of the future and I think that's a hugely important point and not something

315
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,809
that gets enough attention because these exploits come

316
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,440
out and we obsess over the exploit.

317
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,840
And then people are like, oh, this image library is garbage.

318
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:43,890
-- Oh, Apple is so dumb for using it this way. Well,
-- yeah, they all are.

319
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,859
What else are they

320
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,570
gonna use?

321
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,659
Exactly. All of the image libraries are terrible. It's just,

322
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,409
all of the libraries are terrible.

323
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:53,080
That's fair.

324
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,469
But anyway, the point is

325
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,679
there, there's always going to be an exploit in any software written by humans.

326
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,090
Like that's just the, the truth. Yeah.

327
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:04,239
And you can use memory safe languages like Rust and, and that'll help,

328
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,890
you'll get a lot of the loaf for Hanging Fruit.

329
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,210
It takes away buffer over

330
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,090
flows, it doesn't take away the million other security vulnerabilities. Exactly.

331
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,140
And so what happens is we know we can't fix the software and I

332
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,799
think we spent a long time obsessing over trying to fix the software.

333
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:24,659
And I think we've mostly given up. I think we still do.

334
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:27,520
Well, there's a lot of people who do, but I think generally speaking,

335
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,789
I think it's become hip to acknowledge this is just true. We cannot fix this.

336
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,500
So now it means we have to find another way to solve these problems.

337
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,239
And this is where some of these like sand boxing style technologies,

338
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,390
I think become a huge deal because Apple has this thing they've called blast door.

339
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,140
And unfortunately, so this is madness on I os

340
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,359
iMessage.

341
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:53,340
It's the equivalent of running his root is my understanding or it used to at least.

342
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:55,700
And so if you could basically hack into

343
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:56,710
iMessage, you own the.

344
00:14:57,682 --> 00:15:00,982
And so they created this thing called Blast Star that was meant to sandbox

345
00:15:01,252 --> 00:15:01,713
iMessage.

346
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:05,013
And my understanding is they don't have it like they

347
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:07,312
don't have the dial turned all the way on.

348
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:11,333
There's certain things, but which allowed this particular exploit to get through.

349
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,153
-- Hopefully they turn the dial way up.
-- Now,

350
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:15,333
you don't want to start twiddling those dials and breaking

351
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:18,192
-- iMessage for a half a billion people or a billion people.
-- I mean,

352
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,273
-- that
-- would
-- be a problem.

353
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,526
I know I'm not gonna, I'm not going to get into that discussion. There's I,

354
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:27,796
I'm sensitive to that discussion from every possible side of it

355
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:32,445
and it is not an easy answer. So anyway, the point is though they can't fix

356
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:36,176
iMessage. Let's just say that. So now you have to find a way to make

357
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:39,916
iMessage. Let's say somebody sends a malicious message.

358
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:40,906
You want to make sure

359
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,875
iMessage can't cause any damage.

360
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:46,806
And that is kind of where we're at

361
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,549
in the world of computers. Now.

362
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,159
Sandbox,

363
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,419
there's a second option too, which is

364
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,489
if you can detect something malicious happened

365
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:56,890
and either

366
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,080
deal with it or warn the user.

367
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,969
It's not ideal. Right.

368
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:05,369
I, I'm not saying that's what we want, but it's better than nothing. We're seeing

369
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:09,280
things where people log things because maybe they

370
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,039
can't prevent an attacker from getting in.

371
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,250
But, you know, Zhou shouldn't be doing this activity at 3 a.m. from China

372
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,770
and you can boot them out.

373
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:20,510
You know, you can prevent terabytes of data from being infiltrated or something.

374
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,609
-- You know, because an attacker broken, even if
-- they steal the data,

375
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:25,450
just knowing what happened

376
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,229
is

377
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:27,809
enormously valuable.

378
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,690
-- Knowing that something happened, you can warn your contacts. Right.
-- Yes, exactly.

379
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,530
Because I mean, there have been

380
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:37,909
one of my favorite examples of this is I remember back in, I mean,

381
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,739
this was probably 2004 or something.

382
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,489
There was some,

383
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,330
some like website, this is before github

384
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,330
even existed.

385
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,580
There was some website that was hosting a bunch of open source projects.

386
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,330
They got p

387
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,659
and they're like, we don't know what happened.

388
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,539
We don't know if anyone inserted malicious code

389
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:52,900
and it was like hundreds of projects.

390
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:53,969
It was, we're talking like,

391
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,309
I probably hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code

392
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,130
and it kind of turned into like, uh

393
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:00,340
there's literally nothing anyone can do about this.

394
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:02,580
I, I guess we're all just going to go home now.

395
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,500
And it was terrifying to me of like,

396
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:09,469
I want to do something here, but there's nothing we can reasonably do.

397
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:13,000
I mean, this was before, like, because back in the day, well, back in the day,

398
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,489
we used to have this source management system called CV S and, like, now with get,

399
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,098
you do a, get checkout and there's hashes and everything.

400
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:23,219
And so, like, modifying a repo is actually really hard to do with CV S.

401
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,880
It was not hard to do it all. It only checked out the latest version.

402
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,359
And so, like, if someone modified it, there's no way you'd know it was wild.

403
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,660
Yeah. Well, I mean,

404
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:33,849
a,

405
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:35,170
yeah,

406
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,589
there's,

407
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:36,869
yeah.

408
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:37,949
Right. Right.

409
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:38,540
And I mean,

410
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,229
that's what happens is when you have an attack and you have

411
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,510
no logging or the attacker knows how to circumvent your logging.

412
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,170
You can be like, I think someone stole our data.

413
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,079
I have no idea if they did.

414
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:53,319
And now you have, you have that ethical decision of, do I, do I say,

415
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:56,280
do I assume the attacker has taken everything or

416
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,310
do I assume the attacker has taken nothing?

417
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,099
And I think it's, it's really easy to be like,

418
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:05,060
I don't think they took anything even though you have no evidence,

419
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:05,959
either way.

420
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,319
-- Well,
-- or worse. Did the attacker modify anything?

421
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,699
-- Yeah,
-- that's true.

422
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,430
I mean, that's less of a problem for a journalist. Cell phones.

423
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,459
Well, no, actually because for example,

424
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,989
they could change your contact phone number

425
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,540
so that when they phone that contact they're

426
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,359
actually phoning a proxy pass through service.

427
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,859
So I take that statement back. Yeah.

428
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:25,189
No, that modifying somebody's phone data could be horrifically damaging.

429
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,560
Yeah. Yeah. There's, I mean, who knows?

430
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:27,790
And,

431
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,869
and when you're talking about these sort

432
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,989
of well funded organizations like running a

433
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,829
proxy service that literally has someone on hand 24 7 to answer the phone.

434
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,469
Totally not out of the question.

435
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,660
I'm not sure that we need this kind of

436
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,780
technology because one of the other things is traditional.

437
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:43,800
A

438
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,969
lot of technology tends to be dual use like fire. I can use fire to make hamburgers,

439
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,030
which are delicious

440
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,420
And we can also use fire to burn down all the forests and cover the city in smoke,

441
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,800
which is less awesome.

442
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,920
Yeah, that's not delicious at all. Luckily it rained here last night.

443
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,239
So the air is actually kind of,

444
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,479
yeah, it's,

445
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:05,719
-- yeah, we've got about another what two months of smoke ahead of us, at
-- least,

446
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,680
-- maybe
-- more.

447
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,239
So

448
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,814
this is not a dual use technology, right?

449
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:12,984
This this technology has one use which is to spy on people

450
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:16,755
and now the problem becomes, it becomes an intent issue of, well,

451
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:18,584
hopefully they only use it to spy on the

452
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:22,395
-- right people
-- and that's such a dicey question.

453
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:24,454
I mean, so, ok, I want to start out by saying

454
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,819
that that spying on journalists I think is is ethically wrong under almost I don't

455
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:35,569
care if the journalist is is literally talking to the worst person on the planet.

456
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:35,599
It

457
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,109
is not right to spy on journalists,

458
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,560
like journalists are doing their job and sometimes

459
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:42,689
the journalist jobs to talk to bad people.

460
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,140
That doesn't make the journalist bad.

461
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,030
It doesn't mean you should get to spy on the journalist.

462
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,420
They are doing a valuable work

463
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:52,579
and by spying on them, you are destroying trust everywhere.

464
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:57,479
Well, the fifth estate, the press is one of the most important pillars of democracy.

465
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,410
Absolutely. Like, as we've learned from Facebook news,

466
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,660
I know

467
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,619
we need proper journalists who do research and verify sources

468
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,339
and don't, you know, republish Uncle Buck's memes as the truth.

469
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,540
Right. Right. Exactly.

470
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,900
Yeah, I, I just part of the frustration here is I read these stories and

471
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:18,040
there's really nothing you or I can do, even, even a group like citizen labs that,

472
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,969
you know, they have a lot of technology, a

473
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:21,739
lot of smart people

474
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,369
and it's super nontrivial.

475
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,920
Well, no, they're doing what they can, they're, they're,

476
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,930
they're explaining what's going on and,

477
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:33,949
and the knowledge of these events has immense value

478
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,599
from the aspect of now,

479
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,569
Apple can say this is a bigger deal than we thought

480
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,530
it was and people normal people can start to say,

481
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:42,040
ok,

482
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,170
this is something I need to be concerned with, especially if you are a journalist,

483
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,119
you understand that it is extremely likely that your phone cannot be trusted.

484
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:54,859
Not that I think anything can be necessarily if you're a target, but it's,

485
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,920
it's something you can keep in the back of your mind.

486
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:59,800
Well, I think my concern is that it's easy to monetize

487
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,920
spying.

488
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,680
Right. You just sell it to governments.

489
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,760
It's really hard to monetize security and privacy at this level.

490
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:07,849
Right. Because there's

491
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,949
like, there's billionaires who will pay for this kind of privacy. Like,

492
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,729
you know,

493
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:16,530
the, uh, well remember Obama's blackberry phone, right. That was a huge deal.

494
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:19,079
Right. Because they didn't want him to have a

495
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,890
blackberry. They, they

496
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:23,050
weren't sure that they could secure it properly

497
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,420
and no offense,

498
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:26,630
every blackberry user I've ever known.

499
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:29,510
Yeah. Trying to get that phone out of their hands. You're going to get hurt.

500
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,589
Like we call them crack berries for a reason.

501
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:32,400
Well,

502
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,959
there's also some other weirdness to the president having

503
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:39,150
a phone because every single thing the president writes

504
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,310
down in the United States goes into an archive

505
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,310
and then someday that archive gets opened up,

506
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,680
you supposed to is probably a big, big, big thing.

507
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,989
But you know what I mean? And so one of the concerns Obama staff had was that

508
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,910
him using a blackberry, he's going to write whatever they need to then log

509
00:21:57,189 --> 00:22:00,349
everything he writes, collect it and then store it

510
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:03,469
and maybe we don't want everything he writes and in that case,

511
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,189
it was just easy to be like, just don't do this

512
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,290
and, and, and, and

513
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:08,790
honestly sometimes

514
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:10,270
just don't write this down

515
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,140
is exactly the right answer.

516
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,609
I feel like a lot of criminal lawyers spent a lot of time saying that

517
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:23,050
that seems to be the case from any time I watch anything a lawyer talks about

518
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,810
some sort of trial or case or whatever. It's like,

519
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:28,540
don't talk about this, don't write it down.

520
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:28,729
Like,

521
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:32,209
-- don't do this on the phone
-- just because you deleted your email and your

522
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:36,119
text messages doesn't mean they're not still on some server or the person's phone or

523
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,530
still on your phone.

524
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:37,680
Uh

525
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,079
But yeah, II,

526
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,849
I do worry because this obviously also has a chilling effect of, you know,

527
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:46,180
whistleblowers may not come forward to talk to journalists now because

528
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:50,369
right, if I was a whistleblower today, I would be horrified of,

529
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,920
of what could come next just because did they spy on the person I talked to,

530
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,880
do they know who I am?

531
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,109
Do they know what's going on?

532
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:58,140
And

533
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,130
I mean,

534
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,089
yeah, it would be,

535
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,130
it would be terrifying, you know.

536
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah,

537
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,739
I mean, the good news is, uh for example, the CBC

538
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:10,310
and this is in 2016. So they've been doing this for a while.

539
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:13,609
They adopted secure drop to allow for anonymous leaks.

540
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:15,530
Like it's getting to the point where news

541
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,380
organizations are having to adopt operational security that,

542
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,130
you know, was cold war levels of paranoia.

543
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,530
-- I mean,
-- kind of,

544
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,969
and again, if this kind of Pegasus spyware stuff was being used on, you know,

545
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:30,780
real major crimes, you know, real major world incidents

546
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,010
maybe, but we're talking things that are not major crimes or major incidents,

547
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,619
you know, we're talking environmental protests and human rights protests.

548
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:38,709
I

549
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:39,729
mean,

550
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,650
these aren't the criminals,

551
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,000
you know, if you're afraid of human rights people then maybe,

552
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:46,290
maybe you're the baddie.

553
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,729
Oh, my goodness. Yes.

554
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:55,140
You know what I always think of is, have you ever seen the LEGO movie?

555
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:58,319
I love the scene when they track

556
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,560
the, the lego people back to, what do they call it? Cloud cuckoo

557
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,790
land? I think it's called

558
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:07,329
and they, they bust through in bad cops. Like, it's the bad guys,

559
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,560
I think of that.

560
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:10,680
Like, some of these groups, like,

561
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:13,140
is that what it's like working there where it's just,

562
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,609
they know,

563
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:16,800
-- I, I don't know, I
-- wonder, I mean,

564
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:22,329
I live in Alberta and our premier spent $30 million on a provincial war room to combat

565
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,369
essentially falsehoods about the oil and gas industry.

566
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:26,969
Well,

567
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,800
did he spend it or did the oil

568
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:34,170
-- taxpayers
-- spent the money? And it's a private arm's length entity.

569
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,989
So it's, it's not subject to foia and all those other, you know,

570
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,189
freedom of information

571
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,219
act and all that other stuff. So,

572
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,489
and, you know, they, they, again,

573
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,020
they were doing things that target journalists and

574
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:46,619
environmental groups

575
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,260
and

576
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:50,380
I kind of feel like if they had access to this Pegasus stuff, they,

577
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:51,680
they might

578
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:52,400
use it.

579
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,709
-- I mean, I, I'd be shocked if they wouldn't.
-- Yeah.

580
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:56,560
Yeah. I don't know.

581
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:59,030
I just, part of the frustration is as a person,

582
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,880
I feel like there's not really anything I can do

583
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:03,530
other than, like,

584
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,239
literally I've been considering buying

585
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,959
a Guardian subscription to support because

586
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:09,119
they seem to do a lot of really good investigative reporting.

587
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,449
They, they do everyone who can afford to please support good honest journalism.

588
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:18,199
Any way you can be. It, lo local journalism is hugely important.

589
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:21,089
Like the Guardian is a great one to support.

590
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:25,209
There's, there's so many and the journalists are under such attack right now.

591
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:29,089
It's, it's difficult being a journalist for sure. I know many who have

592
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,920
left the field because they just, they burnt out and, and that's a shame.

593
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,050
Well, or they just can't make a living doing it.

594
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,290
Like I literally, there's an Albertan who's doing amazing online journalism

595
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:42,369
as far as I understand it privately, you know,

596
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,130
and I hope he's making ends meet with like Patreon.

597
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,130
Yeah,

598
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:48,810
I guess maybe the moral of the story is don't just donate to the

599
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:52,219
eff and the ac lu and whatever your local version of that entity is.

600
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,969
But yeah, find a reputable news source and buy a subscription.

601
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:59,890
I mean, that's part of the story for sure. But now more than that,

602
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,449
I, I think one of the questions.

603
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,479
So I've seen a lot of things online where people

604
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:06,650
are saying there's nothing you can do about this.

605
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,800
Like just go hide in the corner and cry

606
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,650
and

607
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,709
there is some truth to that. Like there is no way

608
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,790
that if the nso group wanted to target you or I,

609
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,930
that we could fundamentally stop them

610
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,829
when you are in a position

611
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,599
of say, a journalist

612
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:25,869
reporting on, let's say

613
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:31,260
drug dealers, your job is to talk to these bad guys, right? And, and

614
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,890
then we'll use the word bad guy loosely in some cases. But you know what I mean?

615
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,469
Like we, we'll say generally speaking,

616
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:39,469
you're going to be talking to people who are on the wrong side

617
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,430
of the law, whether you think the law is just or not.

618
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:42,810
Now,

619
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:46,420
when you enter a position where law enforcement uses

620
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,069
you as a stepping stone to get through,

621
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,310
they're putting you in danger, right?

622
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,290
Because that person's friends are going to come get you because did you,

623
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,880
did you tell them

624
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,270
or did they hack your stuff and steal it? Like they don't care?

625
00:26:58,459 --> 00:26:58,609
Yeah,

626
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,239
-- I don't think they're going to be too concerned about the details
-- and like

627
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,270
that's one of those instances where you can talk about operational security and,

628
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,949
and segmenting services and using multiple devices or whatever.

629
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:14,280
But I mean, the reality is the vast majority of people lack the expertise to do that.

630
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,150
And I think honestly, even

631
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:18,275
if you did it, if you had a well funded knowledgeable attacker,

632
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:21,744
-- it really isn't going to
-- matter the time and resources to do this properly.

633
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:25,795
-- Like
-- I don't want to say that it's all doom and gloom and there's no way out of this.

634
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:27,354
I think the correct answer,

635
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:29,084
especially for people listening to this

636
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:31,545
particular podcast because the people listening are

637
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:35,515
going to generally have connections and skills that will say normal people do not

638
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:38,675
is we are now at a time when the

639
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:41,795
defenders are better understanding the layout of the game

640
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,489
and we now need to do things like better monitoring.

641
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,819
We need to have the ability to sandbox the

642
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:49,719
crap out of everything going on on these phones.

643
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:52,670
Like it's not a question of, are the bad guys doing this stuff like yes,

644
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,599
they absolutely are.

645
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:56,780
They're taking advantage of every single service running on your phone

646
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,760
and they're going to abuse it any way they can.

647
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,939
We need to sandbox everything, we need to segment all services.

648
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:04,040
And now the bad part of this

649
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,859
is the things I'm saying are going to take years to implement.

650
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,540
This is not something that oh, next week we could sandbox.

651
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,829
No, no, I'm talking about years of effort.

652
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,800
We're going to have to invent technologies.

653
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,140
We're going to have to invent process that doesn't exist today.

654
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,670
-- None of that is quick and
-- more so than that even mindset.

655
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,609
Like one thing I keep coming back to is this farm to fork idea for data,

656
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,180
you know that we're using for the universal vulnerability identifier thing,

657
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,435
not so much for security, but so so we can simply say we made a statement about X Well,

658
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,714
why did we do that?

659
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:34,055
Oh,

660
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:36,255
because of this data over here that we downloaded

661
00:28:36,265 --> 00:28:38,135
from this web page at this date and time.

662
00:28:38,145 --> 00:28:38,614
Ah.

663
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,734
Oh, and that's changed? Ok. It's wrong now.

664
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:41,755
You know.

665
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:45,204
And I think that's going to become increasingly important also,

666
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:48,064
the new style of ransomware attacks where, ok.

667
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,005
Health provider,

668
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:51,665
we've altered 20 patient records and for a couple of Bitcoin

669
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,415
we'll tell you which ones and what we did to them.

670
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,310
Yeah. That's right.

671
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,510
So, it's not just

672
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:00,140
we, we need a changing mindset of,

673
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,530
we,

674
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,449
we can't just keep applying more patches to our

675
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:05,410
image libraries that's not going to make us secure.

676
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,000
But I think things like blast

677
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:12,520
door and one thing I'm really intrigued by is these low power budget arm CP us.

678
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,089
You know,

679
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:17,150
if you can start running stuff on a dedicated CPU where there's no side channels

680
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,609
and for example, you pass them to the CPU,

681
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:23,000
you know, data, a package to be rendered

682
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,069
and it passes something back out.

683
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:25,589
You know,

684
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:28,119
you maybe don't have to care what happened in there as long as

685
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,709
what comes out is like a validly formed J peg or something.

686
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,229
I mean, maybe things like that.

687
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,550
I I think that but,

688
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,989
but that kind of stuff just was not possible like 10 years ago if you

689
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,189
said K like I want you to dedicate ac pu to processing an image,

690
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,270
I'd be like, no, that's stupid,

691
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,574
you know, but now with arm CP US and you have half a dozen or more CP US.

692
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,484
Yeah, things like this will be possible and,

693
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:52,415
and I suspect this is kind of where we have to go is to this

694
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:56,444
massively sandboxed, well-defined inputs and outputs

695
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,444
because what's happening in the sandbox is going to be a train wreck always.

696
00:29:59,984 --> 00:30:03,704
Well, you should assume it's literally malicious and, and I mean,

697
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:06,444
that's one of the things that really can change your mind and,

698
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:08,494
and we should probably just do a whole new show on this at

699
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:10,405
some point because I don't want to get into all the details today,

700
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:13,125
but like when you literally have in your brain, all right,

701
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,180
let's assume

702
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,780
that an attacker can literally run whatever they want in this environment.

703
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,680
What now?

704
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:24,300
And it really, it, and if you assume that of every function call,

705
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:29,469
of every service call of everything you do is saying when I call this library,

706
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,530
I'm going to assume an attacker has full control

707
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,349
and they get to decide what comes back to me what is

708
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,099
now now that's going to change the way you think about it.

709
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,599
But anyway, uh this holy crap,

710
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:43,310
I feel like I feel like I just got punched in the face after talking about this one.

711
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,400
It's just it, it's so infuriating and so upsetting and so obnoxious.

712
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,010
-- It's,
-- I

713
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,609
just keep coming back to the fact that every time we go through this,

714
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,689
we have a huge pile of court decisions saying that yes, they did the wrong thing,

715
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:59,579
-- but then they just keep doing it and
-- they're going to keep doing it.

716
00:30:59,589 --> 00:30:59,810
I mean,

717
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:03,189
look that the intelligence services have been doing acting like this forever.

718
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,290
They're never going to change.

719
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,530
It is the job of the courts and the

720
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,010
citizenry to remain and the press to remain vigilant

721
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,109
and kind of try keeping the, the stuff reined in.

722
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,045
And of course, that the fact that they're directly targeted the press,

723
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:19,305
I think makes the job even harder now for a variety of reasons.

724
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:22,704
But, I mean, fundamentally, I guess no, this is the thing we can do.

725
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,035
There is something we can do.

726
00:31:24,045 --> 00:31:26,165
What we can do is we can

727
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,484
make sure our elected representatives understand what's going

728
00:31:29,494 --> 00:31:35,125
on and we can make sure that we hold them accountable and say this is wrong

729
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:37,564
while we can't fix the technology today,

730
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:40,780
we can at least hopefully fix some of the things going on in the government.

731
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,459
And that's easier said than done

732
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,449
because

733
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,949
it is going to be extremely difficult,

734
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:48,800
I think to convince many of these people that this is something they

735
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,069
-- should even think about still
-- can't get half of everybody to vote.

736
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:57,839
-- I know, I know also vote. Voting is another great thing you can do today. Please
-- vote.

737
00:31:57,939 --> 00:32:00,640
Yeah. And even if you just spoil your ballot, you know, at least you vote.

738
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:02,665
You made a statement, you were counted,

739
00:32:02,864 --> 00:32:07,535
just pick the one who's less of a horrible person. Maybe like, I don't know, there's,

740
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:09,814
that's what I feel like voting is like,

741
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:14,255
I'm going to pick the person who I feel like would only be a minor evildoer in the,

742
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,295
in the story, not the main evildoer.

743
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:18,015
Like, oh my goodness. Anyway,

744
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:22,175
this is, this is a lot, man. This is, this one's heavy.

745
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:23,125
I don't,

746
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:24,415
I'm sorry,

747
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:25,234
everyone who had

748
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:25,505

to us.

750
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:30,094
Oh, and I think this really speaks to keep your devices up to date.

751
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:33,550
I mean that too. But that's, yeah, that's just good advice no matter what.

752
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,319
All right.

753
