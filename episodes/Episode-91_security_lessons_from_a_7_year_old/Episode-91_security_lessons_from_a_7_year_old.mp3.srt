Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 91 with myself,

1
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:12,819
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers

2
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,640
and a special guest today.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,950
Hello, everyone. My name is Felix

4
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:21,299
or you call me Kurt's son.

5
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,860
That, that's awesome. Not quite our typical guest, huh?

6
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:26,709
Yeah.

7
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:31,969
So, so tell me Kurt, why do we have Felix on the podcast today?

8
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:35,009
Because I suspect at this point most people are wondering, like,

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,590
has it gone so low that Kurt is chilling out his Children now for ratings?

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,790
So we are having Felix on the podcast today

11
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,069
because he is an expert on minecraft Security.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,090
Minecraft Security. A

13
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:49,770
Yeah,

14
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:54,150
I've been playing Minecraft for a really long time basically. So I know it

15
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,970
and I've been watching Minecraft so I know really better.

16
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:02,330
Yeah, I play and watch Minecraft. So I'm good at security then.

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,279
Yeah.

18
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,290
And, and what, what is I, I guess what, why do we need to secure things in Minecraft?

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,440
I'm let, let's, let's pretend I don't know anything about Minecraft and why,

20
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,319
why do we need security there

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,550
because somebody might

22
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,360
get, steal your

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,949
stuff that might be felt you

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,980
like your first ever diamond you found.

25
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,290
So, maybe you could put, somehow make a laser gate that would,

26
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,730
if they walk through it they could

27
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:31,849
melt.

28
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:34,080
But it is a laser gate a thing.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,610
Oh, you have trip wires, right? And you can hook them up to Redstone devices. Yeah.

30
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,290
Maybe you could put the Spencers that shoot our arrows and that shoot.

31
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,769
And that love it comes out of,

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,849
-- yeah, I love a dispenser and
-- maybe they would spawn zombies or Skeels.

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,629
-- That'd
-- be good.

34
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:56,790
That's, that's a lot to unpack I think.

35
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,739
And so

36
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,269
why don't we back up a little bit

37
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:02,290
and start at?

38
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:07,089
So Minecraft is a game if you don't know what Minecraft is, I guess, shame on you.

39
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:10,889
Now, explain to me how you play Felix.

40
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,779
Are you playing by yourself or are you playing with other people?

41
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:17,360
And that's where you need your protection, your security.

42
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,490
Uh He plays local only. We haven't played multiplayer yet.

43
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,210
Yeah,

44
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,320
you don't play local

45
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,690
-- multiplayer,
-- play local multiplayer, but

46
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,789
we have

47
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,929
learned not to grief each other,

48
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:31,029
right? Felix?

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,130
Because Felix, what happens when you grief people,

50
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,839
they don't wanna play.

51
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,250
So, so what is griefing?

52
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,320
It's feel

53
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:45,205
or other things? Like is it like shoving them into lava again and again and again,

54
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:47,014
like

55
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,475
when they respond, you do together

56
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:49,994
again,

57
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,565
-- they might never play ever
-- again or like locking

58
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,695
them in an iron room but they can't escape.

59
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:57,304
Yeah. Maybe a

60
00:02:58,365 --> 00:03:02,255
bedrock room which you can't break bedrock only and create bunch

61
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:02,565
rock.

62
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:06,014
-- Nothing can
-- break and Felix. Have you ever grieved somebody?

63
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:07,065
Like,

64
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,395
maybe,

65
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,279
maybe.

66
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,479
But did, did this per, do you think this person deserved it?

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,809
Maybe

68
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,229
what? They killed me? What they give me?

69
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,089
Maybe they should, maybe I could tell him if,

70
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,559
but what they're ignoring me when I'm talking to them.

71
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,160
It's a good point. Maybe you could do it. So they know what, so they know what it,

72
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,559
what's like in case they don't

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,610
twist it,

74
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,080
-- they don't listen to you
-- like, you know,

75
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:40,520
if you're talking to the person griefing you and they don't listen,

76
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,440
then maybe you just grief them back.

77
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,000
-- Is that what you mean? Felix?
-- Yeah.

78
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,800
Wait, maybe you could put a water bath soak deep up.

79
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:51,490
It takes them a while to get back up and they build round.

80
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:53,500
Yeah.

81
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,589
So it's funny cause I remember when minecraft came on, I'm like, oh,

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,779
it's such a nice game with no violence.

83
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,139
Then a couple years later it had violent

84
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,740
and they made Minecraft hunger games. Yeah.

85
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,199
What, what is, what is Minecraft hunger games?

86
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,339
-- Is it like the
-- movies? No,

87
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,479
it's where you get weapons in our men try and kill people and

88
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,000
be the last man standing kind of remind me of game called for

89
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,880
fortnight and they made New Mo called 50 for 650

90
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,899
and to be clear, I don't let him play these games.

91
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,239
He just, he watches this on kids, youtube,

92
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,619
-- which I try to prevent but obviously not very well but
-- whatever man,

93
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,779
Fortnite is pretty cool.

94
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,350
Ok. So, so that's interesting. So

95
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,269
II I want to unpack this and see if we can get to

96
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:47,410
the root of, of security

97
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:51,630
because I, I feel like we have, we have a guest

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,239
who isn't adulterated by social norms

99
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,709
or, or expectations. Right. So,

100
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,559
so Felix, let me ask you this,

101
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,559
you have things in Minecraft, you have your items, you have your base.

102
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:07,920
How do, how do you protect this? I guess.

103
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:12,239
What is, what is the thing you think is the best way to keep your,

104
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,119
your Minecraft stuff safe?

105
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,640
Is it to hide it? Is it to build traps? Is it, I, I guess

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,760
I'm, I'm trying to understand

107
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,049
the motivation.

108
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,250
Maybe you could do that. Both. They could hide it under and they

109
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:30,829
-- may have to dig under and then get through a lot of traps,
-- Felix.

110
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,170
Which do you think is better the traps or

111
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,369
hiding your base and you're hiding your stuff?

112
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,410
I think,

113
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,769
I think it might be

114
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,600
i your base

115
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:44,170
because maybe it's somewhere where they never ever looked and they can't go

116
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,510
and they can't find that area because it's really far away and

117
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,790
it might take them a real, uh,

118
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,010
a couple of minutes to find and they might die

119
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,170
when they, and before they get there.

120
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,089
Interesting. So we have a vote for security through obscurity.

121
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:02,769
Right.

122
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,440
And

123
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,489
No, no, that

124
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,589
somewhat. Yeah.

125
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,980
Do you like traps or higher base?

126
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,760
I personally like a bit of both. So

127
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,690
I like to have sort of a hidden chest with all

128
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,209
my good stuff and then like a bait chest with,

129
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,529
you know, sort of normal stuff.

130
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,459
Yeah.

131
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:22,980
Wait,

132
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:26,369
maybe you could ride the chest with all your goodies in and

133
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,730
then have a chest with pretty common stuff that's common and,

134
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:34,600
and you find a lot of it in the game.

135
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:35,510
So, p

136
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:36,750
do you think

137
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:38,579
traps will work to keep you

138
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,959
out of your stuff or do you think they'll figure out

139
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,649
-- how the traps work
-- and figure out how the traps work?

140
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,200
Because a

141
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:52,130
lot of Minecraft player, a lot of Minecraft players are really good at Red Stone.

142
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,230
So they might figure out it and they might have

143
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:58,709
break the walls and then break the red stone.

144
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:03,040
So how your base might be better people

145
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,269
if you did both,

146
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:09,679
that would be really good because they could barely get in your base probably

147
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,609
unless they somehow knew Red Stone and,

148
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,820
and how they could in and

149
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,200
where your base was hidden.

150
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,269
Yeah,

151
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,549
that would be bad.

152
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,820
Ok. So, I, I feel like we've hit on something important here,

153
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,630
hiding your base

154
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:29,690
doesn't always work

155
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,809
and traps don't always work.

156
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,160
And

157
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,589
this is a good analogy. I'm gonna, I'm gonna step back from maybe speaking to Felix

158
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,369
because

159
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,929
we're going to go a little weird.

160
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,529
But, but this is interesting actually because

161
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,529
it parallels

162
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:51,559
the, the security universe we exist in today of nothing is 100%.

163
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:56,420
And so I guess, let me, let me go back to you, Felix and ask you this question is

164
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,630
if, if you can't hide your base forever

165
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,589
and you can't rely on traps to keep all the people out.

166
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,459
What, what does that mean? I guess. What is, what do we do next?

167
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,429
You've got your, you've hid in your base, you've got your traps.

168
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,670
Now, someone has made it past all of that. What do we do then?

169
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,049
Wait, here's a good solution.

170
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:22,420
Maybe you will have all your goods in your inventory and then you quit the game.

171
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,140
Then they could never ever steal your stuff. Unless if you,

172
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,980
yeah, they can never ever steal your stuff unless

173
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,580
if they take your,

174
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,780
what you were playing on and then

175
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,940
play what they were.

176
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,390
So, basically Felix, what you're saying is you take your good inventory,

177
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,919
like out of the game by

178
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,090
putting it on your personal character and then quitting the game.

179
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,049
So he's exploiting the game a bit.

180
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,849
Literally take your ball and go home.

181
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,559
Well, I know some games, you know, when you quit the game, your,

182
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,070
your corpse or your body is sitting there with all your stuff on it.

183
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,789
Right? And you still,

184
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,719
you have to guard it somehow.

185
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,880
Uh, maybe, I mean, that's, that's well within the, the rules of, of normalcy.

186
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,859
I, I don't know if I'd call that an exploit

187
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,659
except the people that grief, people, only people that got stole

188
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:18,919
that got robbed, the law would never ever play the game. I think.

189
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,099
Interesting. That's

190
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,280
probably a fair observation is

191
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,359
if people get burned too many times, they're, they're definitely not going back.

192
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:31,950
What amuses me though is Felix is basically discovered. Air gapping.

193
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:37,049
Well, no, it doesn't really work awesomely great.

194
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,710
But this is actually kind of a cheap, easy way of doing it.

195
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:40,820
Air

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,840
ging doesn't work

197
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,299
like a cold wallet.

198
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,929
Yeah, I mean, it, it is.

199
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,989
But, but I guess the downside is

200
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,549
you can't play

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,030
right? Which, which the intention here is to play the game

202
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,270
because that's where the enjoyment is meant to be.

203
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:01,960
Uh, so, so let me ask this,

204
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,719
if, if people grief you too much, you said you would stop playing?

205
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,909
Why would you stop playing if people grieve you too much?

206
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,700
Hm. Well, it would be really annoying though. What

207
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,789
it cost $109.99

208
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:29,559
to play it. What, what you spend all your money on that for worthless junk app?

209
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,669
That's a good question actually.

210
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,650
Who would ever do that? It

211
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,869
sounds like the security industry.

212
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,750
Ok. So, so

213
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,760
let's, let's do this. Let's, let's change the conversation a little bit. So,

214
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:47,239
I, I think we spent some time talking about Minecraft and

215
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:52,440
minecraft is a wonderful game and there's a lot of opportunity. But I think

216
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,440
we, we've hit on an interesting point of

217
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:01,460
you can't really stop a motivated attacker being the griefer here in this case,

218
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:01,719
right?

219
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:05,719
And so your options become very limited, which is not unlike the real world.

220
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:08,109
So, Felix, let me, let me ask you this.

221
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,229
-- Do you know what a password
-- is?

222
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,070
-- Don't
-- say your password?

223
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,739
I got, I got 20 bucks that says I'm going to be editing a password out of this podcast.

224
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,390
-- Remember, Felix? Your password has to be secret. Remember?
-- Yeah.

225
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:29,390
My password might be easy to figure out or it might not be if you just,

226
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,909
if you don't have one,

227
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:32,750
what if you're a hacker? The gay?

228
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:33,400
And?

229
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,239
Yeah.

230
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,380
Ok. So, so let me ask this, uh, your, your password is supposed to be secret, right?

231
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:41,530
And

232
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,020
you're not supposed to tell other people. But, but why should it be a secret?

233
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,630
Do you understand why it's a secret? Can you tell me that?

234
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:54,049
So the people can do whatever they want on your electronic?

235
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,099
-- That's a good answer.
-- Which is a really good plan.

236
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:58,650
Yeah.

237
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,929
Wait, if you're a hacker, maybe you could hack.

238
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,750
So your goods look like a worthless junk.

239
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,239
And then tell you, tell everybody that's robbing you and to you, it's your good,

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,719
that's actually a good way. But

241
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:20,450
they might ban you from the app. So I would not probably do that.

242
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,940
So, so tell me about hacking. What, what is hacking?

243
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:29,000
It's where you put in the code and you do whatever you want to and,

244
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,640
and you can't do that in the game. Well,

245
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:36,940
hacking basically is putting in the code and then you, whatever that code does,

246
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,280
it happens.

247
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:43,820
Knackers actually might go to jail like

248
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,049
John Doe who hacked the law of camps in roadblock on March

249
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,770
18th.

250
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,260
Oh, basically, I think he's in jail or on March 13.

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,609
That's strangely specific.

252
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,070
Ok.

253
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:05,340
-- So, so are hackers? Good guys or bad guys?
-- Bad guy?

254
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:12,580
-- Interesting. That's gonna,
-- he hacks people on March once for, I think 14th.

255
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:16,500
I don't know why he does that but he just does it.

256
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,159
Ok?

257
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,229
-- I, I have no idea what that means, but
-- so Roblox is like a Minecraft clone but heavily,

258
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,119
heavily into micro transactions.

259
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,659
Ok.

260
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:31,640
Roblox is a game where you call people names

261
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,640
and swear and they might not actually exit out.

262
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,320
That doesn't sound very nice.

263
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,299
Yeah, that's it. It, it has built in chat functionality.

264
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:43,150
You can't turn off or filters. So I, yeah,

265
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:43,919
what

266
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,250
kind of annoying.

267
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,799
Fair enough.

268
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,469
So

269
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,070
-- do a lot of people do grieving through the chat stuff in
-- Roblox.

270
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,390
Yes.

271
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,960
Think you have to be

272
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:59,599
in that 18 years old to play Roblox Minecraft.

273
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:02,520
I don't know, basically, probably

274
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,909
54. I don't know.

275
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:08,570
Somewhere between four and 18,

276
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,419
Felix. Why do you think somebody should have to be 18 to play Roblox?

277
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:14,380
Is it because of all the swearing and stuff

278
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:15,500
because of all

279
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:18,880
the swearing and griefing.

280
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,809
Ah,

281
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,200
so, hey, Felix, getting back to passwords,

282
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:24,849
do you know how to pick a good password?

283
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:29,989
You pick one that's long and that you pick a long password

284
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,799
and you pick some

285
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:35,690
numbers that people never ever use, I think

286
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:41,250
really long password in numbers nobody ever used.

287
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,010
So it take a really long time to figure out the pass.

288
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:45,450
S

289
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,820
so folks,

290
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,849
when you have somebody like an adult complaining about password requirements,

291
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:51,989
just playing this recording from a seven year old

292
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:59,229
Billy, pick a long password. And the one that has a lot of good,

293
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,520
like pick a really, really long password.

294
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,099
So it would, maybe the criminal would never ever find that.

295
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,239
Maybe the criminal just give up on finding out the password

296
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,419
or maybe it won't.

297
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,059
Who knows?

298
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,359
And, and how many, how many passwords can you remember? Do you think

299
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,369
I can remember my old one?

300
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,109
I can remember my mom's ipod password.

301
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,070
Wolfie's ipod password at my mom's house.

302
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,969
That's probably not. And my,

303
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,210
all

304
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,520
my ipod here

305
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:41,080
password and the computer password.

306
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:44,659
That's a lot of passwords I can remember. I wonder,

307
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,719
here's a question. I'm gonna ask how much passwords can you remember? And

308
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,989
that, you

309
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,330
know,

310
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,630
and also that you just,

311
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:57,020
maybe you'll figure out one,

312
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,090
maybe you,

313
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:02,135
I have about five main passwords

314
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,955
and one of them is to a password manager.

315
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,594
So the,

316
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:10,034
the problem is I can't remember all my passwords because there's hundreds of them.

317
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:12,085
That's a lot.

318
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:12,755
Yeah.

319
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:13,974
Do you think it's too many?

320
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:14,625
Yeah.

321
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:16,554
Maybe you,

322
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:20,445
I think you should have 10 or less passwords.

323
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:22,025
Ok. I'll buy that.

324
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,594
That seems like good advice.

325
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:30,409
10 or less passwords is not a lot to remember. And it's easy.

326
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,770
So, don't pick 1112,

327
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,150
don't pick a lot of pass if you have a lot of password to remember there,

328
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:43,169
maybe you will forget a lot. Maybe I have to do two at the same time.

329
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,969
Hey, Felix. Do you think we should use the computer to help us remember? Passwords?

330
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,630
Maybe.

331
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,590
Yeah. Maybe you could

332
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,270
use computer to help us remember your password. But

333
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,080
here's the point.

334
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,659
Maybe somebody would find out what your password is.

335
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,969
-- Um, and then get all the passwords.
-- Yes. So, I think it's not a good idea.

336
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:08,839
Ah, that's, that's a good risk assessment. Felix.

337
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,790
So, I think if you type out somebody's password, it won't show up because

338
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,140
it would be, if it showed up it would be, that would be really bad.

339
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:23,189
Felix. What you mean is when we type in a password, it should,

340
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,358
like, it should show stars and not the actual password.

341
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,848
Yeah.

342
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:29,439
And why should we do that?

343
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:35,579
So we can't get through. So, nothing happens to our beloved computer.

344
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:38,609
Hey, Felix, what do you think you should do

345
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:41,849
if you know a hacker knows your password,

346
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,290
then you should change it.

347
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:46,339
Ah,

348
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:49,010
that's the easiest thing.

349
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,030
Wait, or maybe you should just break the hacker's computer.

350
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,349
One of these will work, I guess.

351
00:17:56,699 --> 00:18:01,300
Maybe you could just break all his electronics that says house on fire.

352
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,040
You're gonna be in the news, Kurt

353
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,739
Felix. That might be a bit extreme.

354
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:09,619
I take things serious sometimes.

355
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,430
So it would seem,

356
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,310
or you shouldn't do what I did.

357
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:20,390
And if life gives you lemons, give life back the lemons. That's

358
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,650
-- right.
-- Burn life's house down. Right?

359
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,410
Portal two. That line is from like,

360
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,949
-- all right, cool. I,
-- I think we're good,

361
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:33,510
-- Felix. That was awesome. That,
-- that was fun. All right. All right, I'm gonna,

362
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,109
I'm gonna, I'm gonna end it here. So I'm gonna say thank you, Kurt. Thank you, Felix.

363
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,479
Thank you everyone for listening.

364
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:41,599
You can go to open source Security podcast.com to get

365
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,900
I don't think we have any show notes really?

366
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:46,949
Well, I'll put a couple of links to some of the things talked about in there.

367
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,359
But yeah, otherwise I guess

368
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,239
everyone have a, have a great day and curtain Felix. Uh talk to you guys later.

369
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,880
Thank you so much. Bye bye.

370
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,920
Goodbye.
