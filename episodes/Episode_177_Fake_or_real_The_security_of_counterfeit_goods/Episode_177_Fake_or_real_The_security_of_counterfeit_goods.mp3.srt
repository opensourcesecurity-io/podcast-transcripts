Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 177 with myself,

1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,869
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,189
-- Josh Pressers.
-- Well, Happy 2020 to you, Kurt.

3
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:16,729
Yeah. Is it?

4
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:17,930
I guess it will be

5
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:21,329
the magic of podcasting says it's going to be 2020.

6
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,309
-- So
-- it will have been, has been.

7
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:27,079
So the, the, uh, the Douglas Adams grammar for time travel.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,530
That's right. The,

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,180
the, the horrific

10
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:32,049
era

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,490
-- of the 20 tens is now past.
-- Yeah, because

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,610
-- the twenties, like we're in the decade of the twenties. Like,
-- that's right.

13
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,569
Nothing bad happens in the twenties.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,689
And, you know, I remember the

15
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,900
Os the teens, I mean, the teens just sounds immature because they are.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,689
But the twenties, like the roaring twenties, you know,

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,990
will bring back the flappers.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,689
It'll be awesome.

19
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,209
Yeah. And the twenties were a great time. Right.

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,319
-- Nothing bad happened during the 19 twenties.
-- They

21
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,069
just ignore the, uh, the Weimar Republican those things

22
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,520
and we'll just wait for you to stop dying.

23
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:04,279
That's right.

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:04,769
That's

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,000
right.

26
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:08,089
I was ok. This is a segue but I was just thinking

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,500
somebody needs to go through the shows the first, like, two minutes of every show

28
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:12,629
and just chart

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,839
how much we talk about being sick to see. You know,

30
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:16,830
the cyclic

31
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,480
probably in the last couple we have because we're actually sick.

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,120
But I think I feel like it was also this time last year, the same.

33
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:28,029
It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, we have kids and

34
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,919
humans get sick on except, like, noticeable patterns.

35
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,309
It seems like, I mean,

36
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:39,069
if only the security industry had the kind of data the CDC has on disease,

37
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,540
but we don't, so we just make crap up. It's great.

38
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:42,839
Yeah.

39
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:45,290
So anyway, speaking of safety,

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,209
I'm thinking marketplace safety kind of timely being that

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,970
we just had Christmas and uh the online shopping

42
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:53,610
extravaganza that is Christmas and New Year.

43
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,559
Yeah. Yeah, that seems fair.

44
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:00,139
Although I don't do very much New Year shopping, I'll say maybe for tacos.

45
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,669
I'm just trying to remember, what was that?

46
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,279
Uh because Canada Post actually officially

47
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:07,050
gave out a day. Here we go. The Canada

48
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,339
uh the Canada post,

49
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,059
the official deadline to send stuff to get it in for December uh for um for Christmas

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,479
and it was for priority mail December 23rd for

51
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,580
Express Post the 20th and for regular parcels,

52
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:19,490
December 11th

53
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,089
and all those dates have passed. So if you've missed them all for this year or

54
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:26,279
2019

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,520
for 2020 you have plenty of time to make those deadlines.

56
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,270
So uh but yeah, no looking at the marketplace because like I do,

57
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,190
I basically do all my shopping in November online.

58
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,600
Right.

59
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,259
And then packages show up for the next two weeks and I'm done, it's very stress free,

60
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,100
very forward

61
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,970
thinking of you.

62
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,559
And then I also buy, like, my stocking stuff and stuff.

63
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,300
Like I go to Mini.

64
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:49,000
So it's like this Japanese department, mini department store thing.

65
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,490
That's really nice. I don't know if you have them down there in the States,

66
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:55,229
you know, and I, uh, yeah, I just buy my stocking stuff or kind of,

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,169
you know, just buy random stuff locally. Right. Nice.

68
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,250
But it got me thinking about

69
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,929
because I've, you know, there were some things I wanted to buy

70
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,119
that were kind of very specific, like branded high quality items

71
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,289
and I'm looking for them. Yeah, I was getting some stuff that was,

72
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,059
seemed kind of cheap.

73
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:16,350
Did it have, I guess logos and names on

74
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:17,059
it?

75
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:17,779
It was

76
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,059
probably counterfeit

77
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,770
stuff.

78
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,100
Like I've got a rule now, like, if I'm buying cables online, I'm either going

79
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,490
for the anchor stuff or if it doesn't really matter that much.

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,690
I just buy the, the Amazon brand one which is,

81
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,399
I know it's probably garbage but it's probably not

82
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,190
garbage that will catch my house on fire.

83
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:40,190
Maybe not. I mean, yeah, just buy your cables by the pound. It's fine.

84
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,410
Well, because the reasoning is,

85
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,440
and this is backed up by what Amazon Amazon is recently doing.

86
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,770
So on the Amazon marketplace, there's a lot of counterfeit stuff,

87
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,759
-- like a lot of
-- count. I've heard it's a huge problem actually.

88
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,270
-- And
-- going back to economics and externalities,

89
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,199
Amazon is basically claiming we're a marketplace, sort of common carrier status.

90
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,330
We're not responsible for what moves through our marketplace.

91
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,929
So if you buy some fake stuff on our marketplace and it goes horribly wrong.

92
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,250
Go to the person who made this and sold it to you. We're just the middleman.

93
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,330
It's not our problem, right?

94
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:13,399
Whereas if that happens in a physical store, like a,

95
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,289
like a Walmart or a Target or whatever,

96
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,971
you can hold Walmart and Target responsible, right?

97
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:19,403
So

98
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:20,471
I hate to say this,

99
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,953
but so what I do is when I'm offered the cheap

100
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,752
choices and I want the cheap stuff I buy the Amazon

101
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:30,192
one. So that Amazon ultimately is sort of held responsible. So my hope is

102
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:32,852
that Amazon did at least a little bit of due diligence

103
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:35,153
and made sure like that this USB C cable or whatever

104
00:04:35,263 --> 00:04:39,592
-- is, you know, reasonably not going to catch fire or
-- you, you'd think so.

105
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,513
But I understand what you're saying.

106
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:46,885
Whole weird marketplace atmosphere is why I stopped buying computer gear

107
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:49,696
from new egg because it became a situation where it's like,

108
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:50,466
is this new egg?

109
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:53,756
Is this like some random person? Oh, I did not know that.

110
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:56,696
Yeah, they started doing it a couple of years ago and I, I just,

111
00:04:56,936 --> 00:05:00,555
I started buying stuff and it would either take forever to ship or you'd get

112
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,876
like broken boxes and stuff and the sellers were non responsive and it just,

113
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:06,545
it wasn't worth the pain and suffering.

114
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,145
So, screw it. I quit.

115
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:13,299
And see, and conversely, I have found one marketplace that seems to work really,

116
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:14,160
really well

117
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,829
and it's for a very high quality product that is very hard to

118
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,670
fake and that I know is near and dear to your heart.

119
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,459
And that's Lego.

120
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,519
-- Is
-- it a podcast? Oh Lego. Ok. Yeah,

121
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:23,130
Lego,

122
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,570
it's Bricklin

123
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:25,279
and,

124
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,040
and what's really kind of wild is Bricklin is

125
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:29,799
actually apparently being acquired by the Lego group.

126
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,809
-- So it's going to become like an official LEGO thing. But
-- anyways, what is Bricklin?

127
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,839
I don't know what this is.

128
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,239
So the idea of Bricklin is

129
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,850
you want to make some specific

130
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,029
-- thing out of LEGO and you're missing like two pieces,
-- ok?

131
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,290
-- You
-- need

132
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,329
-- those
-- two pieces, right?

133
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:45,850
-- I would go steal them from someone else
-- probably.

134
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,329
Well, that's basically what this is.

135
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,309
So people basically inventory all the lego they want to sell.

136
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,760
And I mean, like, I'm dealing with one guy locally that has something like 5000

137
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:55,304
different pieces inventory.

138
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:58,144
And I'm just wondering like, how does he store this stuff?

139
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:01,725
-- There can't be a return on investment to doing that.
-- I don't know, man,

140
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:05,005
I was like, I was doing a bit of research into this and I decided number one,

141
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:07,005
I would need some sort of like storage system

142
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:09,545
that can store like a million small things easily.

143
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:12,165
Number two, I need like some sort of robotic vision thing because

144
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,089
you know, if given a piece of lego, I know you like,

145
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,880
eventually you'll be able to find out like what

146
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,929
the part number is and like inventory it properly.

147
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,970
But man finding that part number can be tricky, you know,

148
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,010
because how do you describe it?

149
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,910
But anyways,

150
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,040
the thing I realize Lego is incredibly hard to fake because like every

151
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:30,589
piece of Lego has the word Lego printed on it in general.

152
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,950
-- Even the little like the the little posts have Lego inscribed in them. It's
-- exactly.

153
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:36,540
Yeah.

154
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,010
And number two,

155
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,269
when you touch a piece of not

156
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:41,200
like I call it

157
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:41,519
Flegel

158
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,010
like German for fake Lego.

159
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,019
Um

160
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,170
like even my son is like he will find a piece of like,

161
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:50,309
ah and then he'll like run off to the garbage and throw it away,

162
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,489
you know,

163
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:53,570
you can

164
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,170
Yeah, but dude, it doesn't fit together, right? The color is off, the feel is off.

165
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,309
It's like a wax ear plastic. It doesn't,

166
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,170
you know, it doesn't snap in, right? And

167
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,040
if you build something with it and you like drop it, it like falls apart immediately,

168
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:05,609
right?

169
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,750
Versus you build something out of Lego properly and drop and

170
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,839
it breaks into two pieces that you just put back together.

171
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:11,190
It is true.

172
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,799
But I will also add that the knockoff legos are

173
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,119
like a quarter of the price of the real LEGO.

174
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,700
Here's the thing.

175
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,640
When we go to my parents' house, we still play with my LEGO.

176
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,459
-- Yeah.
-- Doesn't everyone? Right?

177
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,290
When you like,

178
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:30,140
everyone's parents have their old Lego in a box and they still

179
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,440
work the exact same and they look the same as they did

180
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:34,980
30 years ago

181
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:37,734
and we'll maybe post this in the show notes. Two very special pieces though.

182
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,584
I have a piece of lego. That's the old pattern.

183
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:42,334
It's, if you flip it over, it's got the square pattern,

184
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,494
not the circuit pattern underneath.

185
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:48,915
And here's the best part I'm holding in my hands. A six by one black standard piece

186
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,595
with a manufacturing defect.

187
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:54,445
-- And what is the manufacturing defect?
-- One of the pins on the bottom

188
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:55,505
is

189
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:59,345
sticks out by about half a millimeter. There's like a bit of spruce sticking out.

190
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:00,540
OK.

191
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,519
So you can't put, you can't attach it to another piece of Lego.

192
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,160
And

193
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,220
I remember playing with this piece of LEGO and I'm like

194
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,380
trying to click it to another piece and it wouldn't click.

195
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,019
And I was so confused like it took me a good half hour to figure out

196
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,209
and finally flip it over and look at it and really examine it closely.

197
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,329
There's, it sticks out a little bit in the middle.

198
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:20,890
-- I don't
-- think I've ever gotten a piece of lego that was

199
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,290
misshapen and all of the probably millions of pieces

200
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,570
of lego I have touched in my life.

201
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:31,496
Exactly. So like I'm keeping this like I this sits on my desk as a reminder.

202
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:33,806
But as perfect as lego is

203
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:36,546
I have a piece with a manufacturing defect

204
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:37,385
wild.

205
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:37,775
Now,

206
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:41,866
I will also say the thing that always blows my mind with LEGO is

207
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,426
I have never put together a Lego set that was missing a piece.

208
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:49,565
Sometimes they give you a few, too many, but I never experienced too few pieces.

209
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:50,935
I actually complained.

210
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:54,322
I was missing a piece once and then found it like two days later, it was like

211
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:54,622
pulling off

212
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:57,142
-- or whatever. And I was like, damn it, I knew
-- it.

213
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,601
-- Did. They send you a new piece?
-- They

214
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:01,171
Yeah. Well, and that's the thing, right?

215
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,471
They will just mail you a piece and there's people

216
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,601
on Reddit that talk about this that they just keep,

217
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:10,052
like they basically say, like, basically when they need a specific piece of lego,

218
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:12,062
they'll look up a set that has it and then

219
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,690
will be like,

220
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,320
I bought this set and it's missing this piece that I need and that's called fraud.

221
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:17,900
Well,

222
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:19,000
yeah,

223
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:19,840
it kind of is.

224
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,929
But anyway, so the idea with Bricklin is, you know,

225
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,840
these people put up all their Lego for sale,

226
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:26,260
they set a price and it literally can be anywhere from like

227
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,590
a penny a piece to like 20 bucks a set or,

228
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,280
you know,

229
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:33,799
250 bucks a set or even 10 or $20 a piece for like really rare pieces or historical

230
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,239
thing,

231
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:34,539
whatever.

232
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,150
So basically,

233
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,330
Bricklin is a marketplace of people's marketplaces, right?

234
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,469
So each seller has their like inventory and in most cases,

235
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,590
they have hundreds or thousands of different pieces of LEGO

236
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,619
and you place an order with them and a lot of them will have a minimum order of like,

237
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,630
say $3.

238
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,429
Some literally don't like I, I just recently

239
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,590
from one guy, I bought like 70 cents a Lego

240
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,619
and like he's

241
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:01,119
just gonna and shipping and handling on it is like three bucks, right?

242
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,280
And he's just going to fire it into an envelope and mail it to me.

243
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,780
And again, I'm just wondering like, yeah,

244
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:07,099
-- the return on investment of doing this like man,
-- that's,

245
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:08,739
that's got to be low.

246
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:14,700
But ok, so here's my question then is how does Bricklin make sure you aren't

247
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,599
selling

248
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,510
knock off Lego or

249
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,090
-- there's a
-- feedback system, right? Just like ebay or

250
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:20,869
whatever, right? Like

251
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,669
ebay then, right?

252
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,590
So like I've already got a positive feedback because I

253
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,849
made my orders and paid.

254
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,510
So the buyers, I guess ebay has buyer feedback too

255
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,739
because I'm not sending you a laptop.

256
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,229
If you have a feedback rating of like this dude's a scammer.

257
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,510
That's fair.

258
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,559
That's fair.

259
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,890
But yeah, and so I think in this case it works well because here's the thing.

260
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,109
If I receive fake Lego,

261
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,400
I can tell right away.

262
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,309
I can validate that this is or is not proper LEGO really easily

263
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,510
because like I start building with it and I'll know pretty quick.

264
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,070
But the problem is there's a lot of products I buy a great example being a USB C cable.

265
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,940
Like, unless I do the, the digital multi meter test and have that equipment,

266
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,159
I don't know if it has the right resistors and stuff in it or if it's like,

267
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:03,909
feeding in too much,

268
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:10,320
-- you're not enough or
-- we can expand this even. And I always love when

269
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:10,969
you,

270
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:14,630
you talk to a salesperson and I'll pick on security products because they're super

271
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,150
easy to pick on and you talk to them about something and they're like,

272
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:17,909
oh, yes, it, it,

273
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,390
and it does your laundry and then you get it and it's, it's clearly a cereal box,

274
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,559
duct taped to a piece of wood and you're like, what did I just pay you for?

275
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,750
And I think this is, I mean, this is a problem across nearly every industry,

276
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,989
to be honest with you, except LEGO, obviously.

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,559
But it's, it's hard.

278
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,280
Yeah. Well, like cars.

279
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:39,510
Yeah, this car is anti lock braking.

280
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:42,400
Well, like, unless you let me drive it on a skid pan,

281
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,130
I guess I'm gonna believe you,

282
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,650
you got here sooner than I thought we would.

283
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,130
But cars are the perfect example of where things

284
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,820
start to get weird because when cars fail,

285
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,919
people die, when people die

286
00:11:55,239 --> 00:12:00,119
some organization, be it lawyers or a government body or whatever pays attention.

287
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,099
Not always true.

288
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,349
Uh, so in Canada recently it's been discovered that when you,

289
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:06,799
when your car basically just catches on fire randomly,

290
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:10,419
the manufacturer doesn't have to report that to the Canada Transport Safety Board.

291
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:13,130
I, I bet if it happens enough

292
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,159
they do,

293
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,340
they just quietly settle these things,

294
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,969
you know, they pay you for the value of your car and have it towed.

295
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,340
Because what happens is there was, um, it was a,

296
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,809
there's a couple of different makes and models of car.

297
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,359
One of them being some Mercedes

298
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,369
where

299
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,340
somebody, you know, they basically bought one,

300
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:29,929
drove it off the lot and like two miles later,

301
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,049
the thing catches fire and burns to a crisp.

302
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,210
It's fine.

303
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:36,416
And so it makes the news and then like six more people come forward and say, yeah,

304
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:37,557
that happened to me too.

305
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:38,197
Interesting.

306
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:40,836
I'm surprised they didn't have to sign paperwork that said

307
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:43,716
we will never tell anyone our Mercedes caught on fire.

308
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,216
I suspect they did and

309
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:48,257
-- they
-- might have, yeah, it's probably not very enforceable.

310
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:49,267
But so, and here we go.

311
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:50,247
Perfect example then.

312
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:53,096
So like last year there was like a recall of tens of thousands

313
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,677
of little Mercedes smart cars because apparently they just sort of catch fire

314
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:59,624
-- except there is a recall
-- once they got

315
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:01,044
it got bad enough.

316
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:04,633
But here, ok. Now here's the question though. They might have caught on fire.

317
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:07,184
But did people die? I bet people didn't die.

318
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,864
I think if people die it's different than if they don't know.

319
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:12,533
Not that I'm, I'm saying cars letting on fire is ok.

320
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:14,973
-- But
-- that's that Tesla that caught fire and the guy

321
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:16,674
died inside of it because they couldn't open the doors.

322
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:18,864
Remember? Because the electrical system was wonky or something. And

323
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:21,473
the Teslas have that door handle that doesn't,

324
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:25,130
you can't work them from the outside without like power.

325
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,940
Yeah, there's, you touch a thing and the door handle pops out.

326
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,091
So it's like streamlined.

327
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,020
I'm, yeah, I'm just like, oh,

328
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:31,661
well,

329
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:33,330
the other thing I was thinking with the cyber truck demo

330
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:35,171
where he smashed the glass in the cyber truck with that,

331
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,570
like metal ball and it didn't smash or it's supposed to smash.

332
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:40,791
But my thinking is a normal car has a, has a failure scenario of like,

333
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:43,830
if I smack the glass with something harder than the tempered glass like that,

334
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,491
you know, I have that little seatbelt cutting tool with the metal end on it

335
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:48,489
in my glove box. Oh, sure.

336
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,539
So, I kind of want my windows to have that failure scenario so that I can, like,

337
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:52,859
smash them and get out of my car.

338
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:53,690
I would agree.

339
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,619
I think windows that can't be broken are an anti feature in civilized society.

340
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,619
For, again, it's one of those, for 99.9% of people. Absolutely. For like, the 0.1%

341
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,590
driving around with armed guards.

342
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,090
Ok. That's a different scenario.

343
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:07,460
-- You
-- got to

344
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:10,419
trick your car out anyway, in that situation because you're like,

345
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,440
bulletproofing the thing and all that stuff.

346
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,179
Actually,

347
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,859
I remember I read a story once I'll try to look this up and put it in the show notes.

348
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:20,539
But there was a situation where they had to transport the president

349
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,830
and they didn't have a secured vehicle and

350
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,789
they ended up like taking Al Capone's limo,

351
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,260
which was heavily armored for obvious reasons.

352
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,090
Yeah, that was the secret service with the first,

353
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,789
they wanted an armored car and that was the fastest way to get one.

354
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,309
Yeah. Right.

355
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,789
Like, oh, we have one because this guy, like, has a legitimate threat model.

356
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,200
-- He's defending against
-- army

357
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,460
guns.

358
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:39,190
Right? Brain prey.

359
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:43,349
But, yeah, yeah, for the majority of us, I, I want my windows to be breakable so that,

360
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:43,510
you know,

361
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,770
if I'm trapped in a burning car and my car door won't open because I was in an accident.

362
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,739
I mean, I want the policeman to do,

363
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:50,315
come up smack it with a baton

364
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,125
-- again. Drag my butt out of
-- there.

365
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:55,684
Ok. We're off in the weeds because we're trying to talk about secure marketplaces.

366
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,284
But anyway, my point being, I think automobiles are unique because

367
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:02,065
I think in most automobile failure scenarios

368
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,674
there's human casualty.

369
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:08,344
-- Well, and the constructive loss of an expensive object
-- and that's very true also.

370
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:12,135
Whereas like if you buy a Janky USB cable off of Amazon.

371
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:15,604
What's the worst that's going to happen? You're probably going to fry your phone,

372
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:16,484
right. Which

373
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:16,950
it sucks,

374
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,580
but it's no one's really getting all that hurt.

375
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,700
I mean, your house could light on fire, but I bet that's not common.

376
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,340
What gets me though is going to the marketplace is that, you know,

377
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:29,280
if you can externalize the cost of counterfeits, not just in the,

378
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,940
the liability aspect of it,

379
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,500
but for example

380
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,289
of most of these marketplaces,

381
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,900
you have to prove somebody is selling a counterfeit product, complain,

382
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,739
go through a process and get them delisted.

383
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,530
And that of course, is hugely time consuming and expensive,

384
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:44,955
so much so that there's now companies that do that,

385
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,674
that's like their business model, right?

386
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:48,174
They protect your brand

387
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,414
and some of it I would imagine is pretty simple because for example,

388
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,075
one thing I've noticed with a lot of fakes is

389
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,164
they use the stock photos from the real one,

390
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:56,385
wouldn't you?

391
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:56,955
I mean,

392
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,054
yeah, we already breaking the law. What's a little copyright infringement?

393
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:01,674
Exactly.

394
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:04,744
But again, you know, having forcing the,

395
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,955
the the company to go through and protect their brand makes it hugely costly.

396
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:08,445
And, you know,

397
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:12,354
I can't possibly know every marketplace where my product is being spoofed and sold.

398
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,590
Right? That's part of the problem too.

399
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,349
And so there's,

400
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,429
I was reading some articles where these

401
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,340
people were just not selling online anymore because

402
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,630
due to fakes and due to the brand damage that these fakes were doing

403
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:27,140
it just, they literally were,

404
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,130
people were trying to return faulty goods

405
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,739
to the original manufacturer and the original manufacturer

406
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,630
in this one case is like, can we get the serial number off that thing?

407
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,630
And then the person's like, oh, there, there isn't one.

408
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,349
Yeah, I must have bought a fake.

409
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,409
Right. But again, you know, you don't buy something online and then

410
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,169
examine it to, you know, see if it's counterfeit or not.

411
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,030
You just sort of, unless it's like, really janky and, like, totally fake,

412
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,799
-- you just sort of assume you got the right thing.
-- Right?

413
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:56,359
I can't think of a single thing I bought online and assumed it was fake.

414
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,679
Now at the same time,

415
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:03,460
I generally, if I'm buying something branded that I know is going to be good,

416
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,699
I will,

417
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,680
I, I can't think of any instances there.

418
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,079
I've been concerned but at the same time, like, I bought like, yeah,

419
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:12,180
USB cables by the pound basically on Amazon because I'm like,

420
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:13,640
I don't even care whatever they're using.

421
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,560
Like, the kids can charge your tablets with this.

422
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,520
I don't care.

423
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:20,420
And I've actually had really good luck, you know, knock on wood, I'm sure.

424
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,199
Now I do myself. But so anyway, anyway, uh, no, I, I get that. And

425
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,270
so what is, I guess what is the point of this conversation? You are envisioning?

426
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,979
Like, where do we go at this? And how do we, how do we, is there a way to even fix it?

427
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:33,599
Do you think?

428
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,150
Well,

429
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,959
I suspect if you made the marketplace liable

430
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:42,459
or even somewhat liable for counterfeit goods,

431
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,000
that would go a long way

432
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,209
-- to solving the problem.
-- How do you do that though? I mean, in the case of LEGO,

433
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,880
for example, you bought something counterfeit from Amazon,

434
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,339
Amazon has to refund you,

435
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,349
you think Amazon is gonna maybe spend a little more time

436
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,319
and effort solving this problem when instead of being saying,

437
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,979
oh, look, go to the original seller.

438
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:00,530
I mean,

439
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,449
I'll agree with you there.

440
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:06,530
But now you run into situations where Amazon's gonna say it's not

441
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,660
a fake and you're going to say it is a fake.

442
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,020
And now what?

443
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:10,890
Yeah,

444
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,709
see and, and that leads to part of the second problem is you can do uh for example,

445
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,329
a chargeback if you buy this, you know,

446
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,369
going back to our credit card debit card episode, right?

447
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,670
Buy things with your credit card because then you can do a charge back.

448
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,089
But again, yeah, if, if the merchant disputes it or worse,

449
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:28,369
what if the merchant decides to blacklist your account?

450
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,250
-- Because you're becoming kind of a pain.
-- I'm sure that happens on a regular basis.

451
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,939
I've only ever had to return like two things to Amazon.

452
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,540
Um And they were like, one was clearly the wrong product.

453
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,109
It was like literally a puzzle in a box and it

454
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,680
wasn't the puzzle that was on the picture of the,

455
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,550
or the one I'd ordered.

456
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,290
And then the second one was a plastic thing that was like cracked,

457
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,650
like it arrived broken,

458
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:47,969
you know,

459
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,920
and I was like,

460
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,469
this thing is a 3d printed object, you know, in the way it's printed,

461
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:55,790
you could tell that there's essentially it printed a thing part of it,

462
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,819
but then cooled and then printed on top of that.

463
00:18:57,829 --> 00:18:59,630
-- Right? And so it just didn't bond.
-- Right.

464
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,589
I got you.

465
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:01,609
Yeah, that can happen.

466
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,510
But, uh, I, I feel like,

467
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,449
I feel like those European consumer laws around fitness of purpose,

468
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,599
you know, it has to be good for one or two years. Otherwise,

469
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,699
see, the thing is in Europe, in many jurisdictions,

470
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,890
you return it to the store, you bought it from, they're on the hook for it

471
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,819
and go back to my whole, you know,

472
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:20,390
Costco argument of why I buy stuff at

473
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,989
Costco is because Costco's like you're returning what?

474
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,060
Ok. Here's your money.

475
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,589
Yeah, they're pretty good about that.

476
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,939
Half eaten ham. You didn't like it? Ok.

477
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:29,810
Right.

478
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:34,209
And so my experience of Costco is they tend to sell decent stuff.

479
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:34,989
Uh, yeah.

480
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,329
But now at the same time I'd say my general

481
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,390
experience of Amazon up to this point has been,

482
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,810
they tend to sell decent stuff.

483
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:41,469
Now, I don't,

484
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,900
I don't know of an instance where I've been dealing with a

485
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,609
third party versus Amazon because I don't pay that close of attention.

486
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,890
Well, everything that arrives from China.

487
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,989
Well, basically everything that's not shipped in an Amazon box is probably not

488
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,949
from Amazon.

489
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,170
And, and even if it does arrive from Amazon, right?

490
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,459
They, so part of the challenge with Amazon is they also co

491
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,109
mingle products, right? So they'll get

492
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:04,069
say widgets from the widget company

493
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,189
and then they'll get

494
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,750
widgets like the same name and model and serial numbers supposedly from

495
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,540
some Randall reseller in like uh to pick on, you know, the US from the US, right?

496
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:16,349
And

497
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,020
so for example, when I'm buying widgets,

498
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:23,290
I might get a widget from the company or from the seller in the US,

499
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,810
even if I'm sort of quasi

500
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:29,479
officially buying it from the, you know, the US, the official US maker, right?

501
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:33,510
Actually, I've heard this is a problem buying SD cards off of Amazon

502
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,459
because

503
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,540
apparently the thing that's happening is Amazon's

504
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,689
doing this weird commingling and people are

505
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:44,140
basically like sending them bogus cards that get mixed in with the real cards.

506
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,189
So even if the seller is Amazon, they can end up sending you one of these bogus cards.

507
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,969
And so anytime you buy like an SD card online, you're supposed to,

508
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,560
there's,

509
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:54,250
there's applications you can test it with to make sure

510
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,520
it's actually the size that it claims to be.

511
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:57,189
Well.

512
00:20:57,199 --> 00:21:01,599
And like, I've recently had two SD cards die that I bought on Amazon and they like,

513
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,119
they were less than a year old.

514
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,880
-- Wow,
-- that's pretty.

515
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,489
Yeah, I've got like SD cards that are decades old and they still work.

516
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:11,949
These are 21, I think they were 128 or whatever gig cards

517
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,310
in a Raspberry pi.

518
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:13,849
And like,

519
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,849
one day the Raspberry pi failed to boot and it

520
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,560
was the SD card and I'm not going to troubleshoot

521
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:18,839
it.

522
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,250
And,

523
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,880
you know, my, none of my machines would even recognize the card wild man.

524
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:27,079
Like, it was dead dead. And I'm like, I'm not going to return this to Amazon.

525
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:28,910
You know, it's like 2030 bucks,

526
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,319
but I'm also not going to buy SD cards off Amazon anymore.

527
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:34,920
-- Yeah,
-- that seems pretty fair. I, I will, I, that's where I bought online recently.

528
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,040
I'll have to rethink this process maybe

529
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:41,239
as much as I hate on Apple for doing that whole where this, like, for example,

530
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,790
the new iphone screens have that like encryption stuff

531
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,520
built into them so that they can make sure

532
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,680
it's an official iphone

533
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:50,339
like Apple iphone screen and not some, like

534
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,500
third party gray market made one

535
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,000
as much as I hate on that.

536
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,760
I get why Apple is doing it.

537
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,750
You know, and I don't necessarily fully agree with it, but I get

538
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,670
-- it
-- and they roll some of that back

539
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,359
sort of, but I mean,

540
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:04,760
they're just going to gently push it through because

541
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,689
again, from their perspective, right?

542
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:08,969
It makes their life a nightmare because, you know,

543
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:13,640
somebody gets their iphone repaired at a wonky repair shop and maybe it's perfect

544
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,040
-- and maybe it's not perfect. But who do they usually end up blaming?
-- Oh,

545
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,949
it's going to be Apple's fault. Unquestionably. I

546
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,780
mean, I, I get that

547
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,959
and so,

548
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,560
you know, II, I mean,

549
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:25,430
I love Luis Rossman and the Rossman group and

550
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,199
what they're doing for the right to repair stuff.

551
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:28,160
But on the flip side,

552
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,660
I also get the manufacturers wanting to control the supply of these

553
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,640
parts to make sure, you know, like going back to cars, right?

554
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,079
Car parts in general, you know,

555
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,349
I had to buy a new rear windshield wiper motor because the one in my car died.

556
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,270
And so it's like 50 bucks a Canadian tire,

557
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:44,089
you know, I buy it and I mean, it's a motor, it's a Reman

558
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,170
motor. So what's interesting is it was like, it actually cost $90

559
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:51,540
but as soon as I bring the old motor back, they give me a refund of $40 for the casing.

560
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,040
They want the metal casing, right? Because

561
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,540
I'm not going to like 3d print those, like nobody's making those casings anymore.

562
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:59,380
But take that casing, taking the motor out, putting a new motor in,

563
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,839
if you know what you're doing, that's like 20 minutes easy.

564
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,329
And so, you know, I swapped the motor out and yeah, it's been working fine.

565
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:06,939
My rear windshield wiper works great now.

566
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:07,640
But, you know,

567
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,339
I'm buying from a store they're in theory buying from a trusted remanufacture.

568
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,510
So, you know, there's, there's trust involved and hopefully, but,

569
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,650
yeah, with like SD cards and things like that. I mean, it's the wild west.

570
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,760
-- So,
-- you know, what you just made me think of is

571
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:25,050
if you go to kind of the Toyota model

572
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,119
of quality and they're obsessed with their supply chain.

573
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,449
And, I mean, this is one of the reasons that when, you know, when you buy a Toyota,

574
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,560
the things last like 100 years.

575
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:35,680
And

576
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,834
if you look, yeah,

577
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:39,555
most brick and mortar stores are going to pay

578
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:41,875
attention to what the products are selling are.

579
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:43,704
They're going to have people that inspect that supply

580
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,354
chain and they're going to want to understand what,

581
00:23:45,364 --> 00:23:48,214
like I knew some people who worked for some brick and mortar stores

582
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:48,915
professional,

583
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:50,405
their, their job was right.

584
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:52,535
They'd like they would fly out to location and

585
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:55,314
they would understand what is going on here.

586
00:23:55,324 --> 00:23:59,314
Let's make sure the thing I'm going to pay you for is what I'm paying you for

587
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:00,265
and whatever.

588
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,290
And

589
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,569
so anyway,

590
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:05,040
when you talk about these marketplaces and you

591
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,000
have these kind of third party sellers,

592
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:11,010
there is zero economic incentive to vet them because first of all,

593
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,810
-- you probably can't,
-- it's their business opportunity is to let these people in.

594
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:17,239
That's their actual business model, right?

595
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,790
-- Is to make it available to all these randos,
-- right?

596
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,290
-- And they get a cut and they have zero liability today that's
-- the ebay model, right?

597
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,810
The ebay model is literally

598
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,819
-- let completely random people sell stuff.
-- Yeah.

599
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:33,359
But I would, I would argue that when I go to ebay and buy things,

600
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:37,390
I know it's a flea market model and I know I could be buying,

601
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,239
you know, an old piece of garbage in a box.

602
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:46,314
And it is, you know, I know that when I go to Amazon, I'm expecting it to be a real thing.

603
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:49,555
-- So
-- I've bought a lot of old Baedeker's travel guides off of ebay.

604
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:51,915
Uh, these are books that are usually more than 100 years old.

605
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:55,074
You know, they're lovely travel books, fold out maps. Just beautiful books.

606
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:57,125
Weren't you just telling me before the podcast

607
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:58,635
that you're getting rid of all your books?

608
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,010
Yeah. Those I'm keeping and either reselling or keeping because they're,

609
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,119
I mean, they're

610
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,599
wonderful books. But anyways, the point is they would be really difficult to fake.

611
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:10,920
Probably. I mean, something that specifically, yes,

612
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,290
I think that's part of the problem is a lot of this

613
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,189
stuff that's being faked on Amazon is not necessarily easy to fake,

614
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:17,540
but

615
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:18,469
for example,

616
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:21,329
there's this article about these sort of four in one baby stroller car seat,

617
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:22,589
whatever thing and it just made CNN,

618
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,989
they tested it and like the thing just flies apart in plastic shrapnel everywhere,

619
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,500
you know, in a 30 mile per hour car crash.

620
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,260
And these things are selling like the cheap

621
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,410
version is selling on Amazon for 300 bucks.

622
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:32,849
Us

623
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:34,189
and I'm guessing

624
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,140
change.

625
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:35,530
Yeah.

626
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,699
And I'm guessing that, you know,

627
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:40,469
this thing is being made in China for a lot less than that, no doubt.

628
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,349
And,

629
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,520
yeah, I, I don't know. It's tough. Right.

630
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,069
Because the whole model of ebay and it kind of worked was

631
00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:48,989
let completely random people sell completely random stuff.

632
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,739
But at least there, like you said, there's that,

633
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:54,560
-- I know I'm going to the flea market.
-- I know what I'm getting into. Right.

634
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,640
-- It's like, it's not a surprise.
-- Yeah.

635
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,680
Whereas I want a class 10, high quality 128 gig SD card.

636
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:03,180
I, yeah, I might be buying just a plastic wafer.

637
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,189
No, it's probably like a four megabyte SD card that

638
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,140
gonna lie to you and tell it, it has plenty of room.

639
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:10,810
I, I saw a

640
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:14,660
picture once this is, I'll try to find it and put it in the show notes.

641
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,380
But it was, it was on Reddit where somebody bought an external hard drive

642
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,130
and

643
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:22,930
they opened it up and it had like a rock glued to the inside of it with

644
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:26,630
a 256 megabyte SD card. Like,

645
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,790
well, and I've actually bought legitimate, like, 3.5 inch SD or, um, SSD drives

646
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:34,329
and opened it up just for funsies.

647
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,099
And it's like, just, it's like a tiny one by two inch, you know,

648
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,060
circuit board in there.

649
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,410
Yeah. Well, you don't need a lot of space.

650
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,609
Like, they literally just made it big enough so it'll fit in the mounting hole.

651
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,410
Right. And I'm ok with that.

652
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:46,930
Yeah, that makes sense.

653
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,630
Yeah.

654
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,510
Well, it's like the bee headphones where they intentionally put like,

655
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,670
little weights in them that they claim are like, to improve the hearing experience.

656
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,939
And it's like, no, so it doesn't feel like a flimsy cheap piece of plastic garbage.

657
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,760
Right. Right.

658
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,569
And I,

659
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:02,099
and in some ways I'm ok with that because certain things

660
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:05,780
are just more enjoyable with that when they're a little heavier.

661
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,060
But yeah, I get it.

662
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:09,119
I would like to think that, you know,

663
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,939
Amazon is working on A I and stuff to

664
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:12,979
help prevent the spoof products and the fake products.

665
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:17,060
But I think fundamentally until there's a real incentive to address the problem

666
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,359
and I hate to say this, but I think that's going to be regulation.

667
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,319
I think it's, it's gonna be,

668
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:25,219
-- it's gonna get worse.
-- It's going to get way worse.

669
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,920
It may never get better Kurt because unless people are getting hurt

670
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,760
then nobody cares. I mean, that's just the reality of everything.

671
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,319
And this is like the one thing I keep coming back

672
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,319
to every time I do security research into stuff like this is

673
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,949
if people are only getting ripped off and not hurt,

674
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,479
it usually doesn't matter.

675
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:44,849
Now if you start ripping off, like people in charge,

676
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,239
then they start to care a little bit.

677
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,579
But fundamentally if you're just screwing normal people. They don't care at all.

678
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,469
Well, we'll talk about this in a, in another show.

679
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:55,510
But, I mean, they just recently in the US and Canada have passed those new, um,

680
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,599
telemarketing bills to prevent spoofed calls.

681
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:57,890
Right.

682
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:01,459
I didn't hear about this but I'm sure it's a worthless law.

683
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,060
Here's the best part in Canada.

684
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,800
They either have to implement blocking technology

685
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,869
or

686
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,050
kind of give customers the option of blocking stuff.

687
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,329
And I'm like,

688
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,800
that's useless because what I'm going to do just

689
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,410
start blocking every fake number that calls me.

690
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,479
-- That's so not
-- helpful. You set up your phone so the default ringtone is nothing.

691
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,699
And then you said people you'd know to have real ringtones and

692
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:24,199
then when someone calls you who isn't in your address book,

693
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:25,719
your phone doesn't ring.

694
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,410
Yeah.

695
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,030
The challenge I have is the school calls and

696
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,189
the teachers use their personal cell phones and stuff.

697
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:31,839
So I do get

698
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,910
legit, you know, and I don't want to be like, you know, what I'm gonna do,

699
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,530
ask the school for a list of all the teachers, personal phone numbers.

700
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,349
I don't think that would be unreasonable. But

701
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,489
anyway, anyway,

702
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:44,170
no, I hear you.

703
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:49,780
I think the moral of the story is if you're gonna buy stuff online, you know,

704
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,550
if it seems too good to be true,

705
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:52,630
it is

706
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,099
-- not, it probably is. It
-- is.

707
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:59,510
I have a better moral of the story is I'm probably just not gonna care.

708
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,910
So, whatever, that's the reality of it.

709
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,109
I mean, am I gonna drastically change my buying habits? No, not really.

710
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,680
Am I gonna get ripped off? Probably.

711
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,150
Am I gonna get ripped off enough to care? Probably not.

712
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,270
Yeah, that's fair.

713
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:14,729
Welcome to 2020 everybody.

714
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,699
I guess we just give up.

715
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:20,280
But honestly it's not, it's like the whole package porch thing. Right?

716
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,260
Like, yeah, a few of them are gonna get stolen.

717
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,630
But ultimately, it's just so much more efficient that

718
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:31,140
-- it's ok
-- and yeah, and, and you know what, when you stop caring, life gets a lot nicer.

719
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:36,520
I'm just saying anyway. All right, man, it's time I'm gonna end it. Thank you, Kurt.

720
