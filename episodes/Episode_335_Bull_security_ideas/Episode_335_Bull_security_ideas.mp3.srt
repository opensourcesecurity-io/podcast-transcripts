Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:11,329
and my partner in Lightning Speed,

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,289
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,510
So Kurt has some weird plan and I don't think it's going to

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,090
work just because history tells me if there's one thing we're good at,

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,340
it's getting off topic.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,500
-- Uh
-- We still don't know that my Mars plan wouldn't work. No,

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:25,819
your,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,290
the problem with your Mars plan wasn't whether it worked or not.

9
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:32,470
-- It made us all dumber. That was the fundamental problem, but
-- well rested,

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,110
whatever,

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,619
whatever I'm done with. No, I'm not.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,200
No,

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,099
there's no,

14
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,959
-- nobody can hear you filling potholes
-- on Mars.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,520
I don't have any good stories to tell right now. So we're just gonna jump right in.

16
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:45,979
So there was a tweet

17
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,889
that

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,049
made the rounds. Uh What was it? July 30th is the date

19
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:57,150
and it's very interesting because all it says is what's a concept in security

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,150
that is generally accepted as true, but is actually bullshit. And

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,419
there were some really good replies.

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,860
And so Kurt and I decided we're going to take the replies and work through them

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,580
and well, well, not all the replies.

24
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:11,739
There were a lot of replies,

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,370
like a lot of replies and I went through them all and picked up what, 10, I think,

26
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,180
or something on about 10.

27
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,220
And Kurt thinks he's going to keep us at three minutes per reply,

28
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,620
which we're already what a minute 20 into the podcast.

29
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,699
And so you'll have to subtract that from your, your list.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm sure, I'm sure we'll do this

31
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:31,919
anyway. Let's just jump right in, let's just jump right in.

32
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:33,540
Uh, the first one on my list

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,160
is, oh,

34
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,660
wait, play that noise again. That was very nice.

35
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:38,620
Uh, how do I rewind this?

36
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:40,389
You're wasting time.

37
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,419
Not now. There we go.

38
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:45,470
And is that, that's the go,

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,209
that's the boxing ring.

40
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:50,610
-- No, thank you, Kurt. Thank you. I
-- don't know, man.

41
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,430
Somebody's like, I live in Jersey City and I'm like, where is that?

42
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,349
And he's like, it's in New Jersey. I'm like, oh, ok, because

43
00:01:55,559 --> 00:02:00,279
-- like, dude, there's an Edmonton in Kentucky. We're
-- already off topic. I'd love it,

44
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:00,870
you know,

45
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,580
I don't know where the hell they're probably a

46
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,839
Jersey City in California or Alaska or something.

47
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,130
-- Anyways, I bet
-- every state has a Jersey City

48
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,330
because Jersey was a location in England. But still,

49
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,009
I suppose,

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,839
I don't think the people of the island of

51
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,850
-- Jersey would like what you just
-- said is Jersey,

52
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,500
not in England.

53
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,169
Where's Jersey?

54
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,330
Jersey is an island

55
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:24,460
where south of, in the channel. It's one of the channel islands, like the Isle of man.

56
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:26,059
Ok.

57
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,729
Whatever.

58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,539
Anyway,

59
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:28,130
sure.

60
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,789
Send your hm. To

61
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,929
let start.

62
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:32,169
This is what happen. This is why we can time ourselves.

63
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,699
Yeah. J

64
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,490
is an island.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,440
It's the Bail

66
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,169
of Jersey. It's a crown dependency.

67
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,550
Cool. OK. II I actually didn't know that. I thought it was a city or something.

68
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,259
I'm, I'm

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,979
so I'll blame my American education.

70
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,059
Well, I mean, you haven't brought democracy to them. So how do you know where it is

71
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,429
anyway?

72
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm going to start now with a tweet from Mark Lovelace. Simple nomad.

73
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,309
He was a guest on the show a long time ago

74
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,139
and his just says password. If they were secured, we wouldn't need a second factor.

75
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,509
Well, and that's the thing, even if you use a

76
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,229
like secure password stored in a secure password manager that will only

77
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,229
like you're still prone to fishing and stuff. There's, it's just too easy to misuse

78
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,119
and also passwords don't authenticate the server.

79
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,470
So if somebody hijacks the server, they can snarf your password.

80
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,600
And so then we end up with like things like

81
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,240
Kerberos which go, I mean,

82
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:20,139
go read the

83
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,960
Kerberos thought exercise of how to

84
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,720
create a password securely authenticating system.

85
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:25,080
And it's,

86
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,919
you know, it's, it's complicated.

87
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,320
So, yeah, no passwords on their own just aren't enough.

88
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,990
And so we need a second factor and more importantly, that second factor needs to be,

89
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:35,960
how do I put this nicely?

90
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,720
It needs to be something mediated by software that won't let the human do a bad thing.

91
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,740
-- The computer basically as it says,
-- no, I mean,

92
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,630
I think my argument is we shouldn't even have passwords.

93
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,279
It's not a matter of, of password. Plus second factor.

94
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,509
I think we, we, we're reaching a point where

95
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,000
just having that,

96
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,070
that kind of

97
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:54,809
magic second factor is,

98
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:55,619
is brilliant.

99
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,309
You know, because now you can use like just your phone or just your,

100
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,479
-- your U two F key
-- or whatever, just your phone, just your UTF key.

101
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,270
There's a lot of people in the world

102
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,509
that don't have that.

103
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,130
No, I know, I know.

104
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,759
I'm not saying it's coming soon,

105
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:10,679
-- but like it is Apple
-- and everybody's moving towards that

106
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,320
Fido slash apple pass key thing like that's

107
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,779
for the privileged of us. Yes, we will be able to get rid of most of our passwords.

108
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,839
Do single sign on

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,108
yada,

110
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:19,320
ya yada.

111
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,200
It'll be awesome.

112
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,559
I agree.

113
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,140
The problem is passwords are the lowest common

114
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,890
denominator and there's all that technical debt,

115
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,779
the size of Switzerland that is

116
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:27,790
passwords.

117
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,369
Absolutely. 100%. Alright.

118
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,299
Anyway, I don't think anyone's going to argue with this one to be honest and,

119
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:37,579
and if you want to argue, go argue with, with Mark and he'll destroy you.

120
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:38,809
Wow. That worked out well.

121
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,859
Even even with our pontificating,

122
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,799
you got three more seconds.

123
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,929
All right.

124
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,779
I did not know what really? That

125
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:49,720
-- next
-- round? Oh, it says ready. This is fantastic.

126
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,799
I love this. I'm sad. We don't have like a nice direct feed.

127
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,619
Anyway, the next one, a guy named Mark Manning

128
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,980
commit signing using G PG.

129
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,950
Yeah, I mean,

130
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:02,399
um

131
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,279
this is my favorite because

132
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,109
I it

133
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:08,519
commit signing,

134
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,179
commits with GP G does something but it doesn't do what everyone thinks it does.

135
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,459
The first reply to Mark says, how else are you supposed to verify a commit slash tag?

136
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:20,920
Actually came from a certain developer after it's been committed.

137
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:24,959
-- What
-- I'm not real clear on is what's the threat model where the attacker

138
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,709
can break into your

139
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:28,720
github or G

140
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,420
repo

141
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:30,510
but

142
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:35,010
not break into the developer's laptop in some way to sign that commit.

143
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,630
You know what I'm saying?

144
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,690
Like it's just if the attacker is that skilled,

145
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,549
chances are they can send up the the developer some PDF file that

146
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,149
right?

147
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,450
Well, no, no. OK. Look, there's, there's a different way to think of this.

148
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,920
So the way GIT works is you set your user name and email

149
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,450
in the client so I could set my user name and email to you

150
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,040
and then I could push a commit into a repo.

151
00:05:57,309 --> 00:06:01,970
And basically anyone looking at that commit is going to believe it's you who did it?

152
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,010
Yeah, but that assumes that repo is essentially wide open for public,

153
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,470
right?

154
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,630
Exactly.

155
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,859
If your GIT repo is that wide open

156
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:15,859
get signing is not your problem.

157
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:16,470
That's

158
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,220
like GIT repos are locked, like have authentication basically.

159
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,760
So the attacker somehow

160
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,089
can break into the authentication but not, you know what I mean? Like it makes no

161
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:27,290
sense.

162
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,660
I think the more important part is

163
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,160
the GP G commit isn't. I think it's less about

164
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,679
provable identity because GP G doesn't really

165
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,720
even carry provable identity with it.

166
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:39,880
Actually fun fact.

167
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,500
Also this assumes they're storing their GP G key securely, which we don't know.

168
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:44,380
Well, yes

169
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,380
and no one does.

170
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:49,640
And, and the way github works as well is you add your GP G key into github

171
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:53,140
and then it can say like, oh, it'll give you a little check mark on the commit.

172
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,640
But if you ever remove that key, it takes all the check marks away.

173
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:57,970
And

174
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,390
if your key is ever needs to be revoked,

175
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,309
which like you and I revoked our GP G keys not too long ago,

176
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,019
like there's absolutely nothing

177
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,600
that you can do about that. And

178
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:06,829
github.

179
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,920
Well, and that's the problem is like if you have a repo that requires signed commits,

180
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,700
then what happens

181
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,570
because like one of the problems with signing stuff is like,

182
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,559
let's say you sign your email and then you revoke your key.

183
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,299
Well, that email at that time was signed correctly.

184
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:19,920
And depending on why you revoked your key,

185
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:21,899
like if you revoked your key because it was compromised,

186
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,760
maybe you should revoke the signature.

187
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,880
But if you revoked your key because it's like, hey, I'm done with this

188
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:27,440
and I'm burning it then,

189
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,440
then those emails are still signed.

190
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,000
That's right. But, but github doesn't deal with that correctly.

191
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,010
And so that's why the

192
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,809
correct way to deal with this. That's the problem.

193
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,380
-- There's different viewpoints.
-- Right.

194
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:38,980
That's fair. That's fair.

195
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:42,809
No, I agree. And I think this is one of those places that

196
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,619
like signing your commits is just a way to say that someone with this

197
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,230
-- key signs commit
-- and not even not a physical key but a software key.

198
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:56,140
And so I think maybe combining that with UB keys and like tokens might be better.

199
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:57,279
OK? Next one,

200
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,619
this is related, the next one comes from uh Richard Dick Brooks.

201
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,299
And it says people believing that a digital signature on a software package has

202
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:10,059
been applied by a software supplier and

203
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,260
guarantees the identity of the software supplier.

204
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:16,910
Well, I mean, as we've seen with Windows code signing certificates. Yeah, sure.

205
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,619
That's always true.

206
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:22,309
I mean, look, I bet you 99.9%

207
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:26,769
-- of digital signatures on software are part of an automated process
-- today.

208
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,970
So what they better be?

209
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,570
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

210
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,150
This is what really makes me angry about it

211
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,030
isn't the whole point of it to automate stuff

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,369
with computers and software. Like

213
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:40,078
I'm

214
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,008
pretty sure this is what I was led to believe 20 some years ago.

215
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:46,568
Like a great example is my mother, she had to do a thesis and analyze a whole bunch of,

216
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:49,919
of data and basically the back of the envelope calculations were

217
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:52,669
4 to 5 years to do this on a mechanical calculator

218
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:57,718
or one or two years to learn how to program in FORTRAN. And then one year to

219
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:01,789
manipulate and analyze all the data and more likely have it done correctly.

220
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:04,989
Like this is back with punch cards, like you'd have a stack of punch cards you submit.

221
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:07,659
And so the point is like this digital signature thing.

222
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:09,330
Yeah, it bloody well, better be automated.

223
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:12,320
Well, the point is a digital signature again,

224
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,140
doesn't mean the software is necessarily trusted.

225
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:18,799
-- No, it means that that package was signed by that key.
-- That's right. That's right.

226
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:19,429
And

227
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,789
generally speaking, it can convey a certain amount of, of,

228
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,869
I guess trustworthiness, I would say trust specifically, but it,

229
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,640
-- it doesn't always the
-- one thing where digital signing really actually helps

230
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:34,989
was 20 years ago

231
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,390
when we didn't have reliable mirrors for software.

232
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,429
-- Uh
-- Yeah, I agree with that. That, that was a big deal

233
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:44,309
-- because
-- then I could download stuff from some random website and

234
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,119
be reasonably certain that it was indeed that Windows software package or

235
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:51,429
driver or Red Hat package or whatever that it claimed to be. Sure.

236
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,599
Sure. And, and even then it just means it came from Red Hat.

237
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:57,049
It doesn't mean there's any sort of trustworthiness

238
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,469
on everything prior to the signature being applied to the thing.

239
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:02,669
Red Hat put on a mirror.

240
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:04,099
Yep. Yep. This is

241
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,340
you. I love this one. Where people are like, oh, it's signed, it's fine. It's like,

242
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,549
maybe, maybe it's fine.

243
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,270
Well, and I would say kind of the converse is

244
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:16,710
if it's signed, it might be correct. And if it's not signed,

245
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,929
then it's probably a tire fire

246
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,940
in the sense of like, if this is a windows device driver, like

247
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,669
how many times have people, you know,

248
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,710
I've bought webcams where literally the instructions say go

249
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,710
to this IP address and grab this dot exe.

250
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,010
And I'm like, wow,

251
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:33,690
and I run through virus total and I'm the first one and I'm like, oh double, wow,

252
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,450
this is, you know,

253
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,229
this is good,

254
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:36,159
fine,

255
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:36,900
fine.

256
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:41,570
-- It's been running for a year. It's great.
-- Fine. Everything's fine. I know, I know.

257
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:42,130
Yeah,

258
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,929
whatever,

259
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
whatever. And, and now I will say though as well.

260
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:47,989
I think in the context of digital signatures,

261
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,659
I think let's encrypt and sync store are disruptive

262
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,789
forces in the industry and we're going to see real

263
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,390
good solutions come from those.

264
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,190
So the future does look nice.

265
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,349
-- They
-- acknowledge how reality actually works.

266
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,590
Absolutely.

267
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,780
All right. The next one comes from the Twitter name is unpronounceable.

268
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:08,530
It's imbeciles

269
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,419
Rex is their Twitter ID.

270
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:15,320
And it says humans are the weak link in any secure system.

271
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,309
No, they're one of the weak links.

272
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,719
Well, ok.

273
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,359
And

274
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,659
actually the first reply to this says, I blame Kevin Mitnick for that.

275
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:26,960
Here is here is the way I like to think about this.

276
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,710
Humans are predictably unpredictable

277
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,849
in all ways. And I think we have built

278
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,090
the vast majority of our it and security

279
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,450
pretending humans are predictable in predictable ways.

280
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,590
Well, back to the whole, you know, humans are rational economic actors.

281
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,880
No, no, they're really not as it turns out.

282
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,570
That's right.

283
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,369
And, and I mean, this is like this,

284
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:52,770
the fishing's on here as well, but it's kind of the similar thing of like,

285
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,820
if typical human behavior results in a failure of your system,

286
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:01,140
the problem isn't the people, like, you've architected a crappy system.

287
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:04,460
This is why when you look at things like

288
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,530
-- safety systems in industrial complexes and you look at
-- even in your

289
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:10,650
car, at cars.

290
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:11,260
Exactly.

291
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,460
And,

292
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:15,599
and even like kitchen utensils and our electrical systems and plumbing systems,

293
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:19,070
they are engineered in a way that accounts for

294
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,859
what I, I think we would just call human stupidity.

295
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,690
Well, not even stupidity, but like,

296
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,510
there are so many things for which I don't know how to safely, truly,

297
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,570
safely operate XY or Z.

298
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,969
-- But
-- even the things you do,

299
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,830
I took the safety guard off my table saw because I don't like it.

300
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,950
I know it should be there. I don't want it.

301
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,710
I took mine off too and I use the little hockey stick pusher.

302
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:43,229
But a perfect example is, you know, I have my little outdoor pool, a little 12 ft guy

303
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,849
and I have three sets of the solar heating panels

304
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:47,450
and three S pumps to push water through them.

305
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,309
And one day the GFC starts tripping. And so I'm like, ok. Well, that's not good.

306
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,539
I reset it, trips, reset it, trips, turn off the pumps, just reset it,

307
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,460
-- just tape it
-- down.

308
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:57,270
It'll be fine,

309
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:57,929
pretty much.

310
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,840
And so one of the,

311
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:02,659
one of the sump pumps had some electrical fault that tripped the GFC I, and I'm like,

312
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:06,090
I'm so glad I spent that 200 bucks on that GFC I breaker

313
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,799
because otherwise me and the kids would have gotten in the pool and died.

314
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,500
Safety systems have to ideally be passive and built in and,

315
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,440
and software and these complex systems move too fast.

316
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,760
-- Like, look at the rate of change in Cooper Neti or Aws or something. And it's
-- crazy.

317
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,630
I think that's an excuse. I think it's because we don't build

318
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,280
any sort of protections in generally speaking.

319
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:27,640
And we're like, oh, we'll fix it later,

320
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:31,309
-- but this assumes we know what would be protective. That's fair
-- too.

321
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,450
Like with these smart contracts, I'm seeing a lot of things like,

322
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,890
define what would actually be safe behavior with, say,

323
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,210
withdrawal limits and then you enter, you create new problems, right?

324
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,239
So I think part of the problem is we don't have enough

325
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,960
knowledge to know what is safe behavior other than this hand wavy,

326
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,190
you know, oh, it's secure and it doesn't do anything bad.

327
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,020
Ok. But no, no, no, no, no, I need you to narrow that down for me.

328
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:54,590
-- It didn't say ready go. I paused it
-- for a sec.

329
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,429
You can't pause it. That defeats the purpose.

330
00:13:59,119 --> 00:13:59,940
Ok. Next one.

331
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,000
All right. The next one says what train have we got?

332
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,630
Which is what train today is the Twitter user name.

333
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,179
And I'll put all these in the show notes,

334
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,669
but it says using click through rates to

335
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,369
measure the effectiveness of your fishing training,

336
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,710
use reporting rates Instead people, you want people to report fishing emails,

337
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,789
don't you incentivize

338
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,280
that?

339
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,109
I agree.

340
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,359
So I've got the CS A email super lockdown.

341
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:25,070
Like we've got SPF we've got DKIM, we've got dear,

342
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,909
we've even got that stupid BMI logo that cost 1000 bucks a year, right?

343
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,119
And so like when you open up a CS A email,

344
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,309
it's got the logo next to it in your email client,

345
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,400
assuming it's not out lookout look doesn't support Biy,

346
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,390
of course, because they have the Microsoft standard that they do.

347
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,580
But anyways

348
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:39,409
we get

349
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,469
so that means you can't spoof email from clouds

350
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:42,159
lines.org.

351
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:46,250
And so we get these terrible Jilly Bo Bob Thornton at gmail.com saying, you know,

352
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,669
like, literally this is Jim and I'm like in a Mexican prison and they, you know,

353
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,200
I need a bunch of gift cards for a business function mailed to

354
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,950
like you need to phone this person and give them the codes,

355
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,250
right?

356
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,729
And it's like

357
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,520
luckily none of the CS A people are goofy enough to like fall for that.

358
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,179
Like, I don't want to blame the victim,

359
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,640
but sometimes when I do see these fishings and how weak they are.

360
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,320
And I'm like,

361
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,859
how did like this local college that changed a payment

362
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,330
for $9 million with apparently an oversight because they sent

363
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,239
it to a random bank account that was specified in

364
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,299
a random email that was not from the construction company.

365
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,500
And to me

366
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,830
back to this whole, like if the user can basically reply to an email and like,

367
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,609
bring down your company or change a payment

368
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,679
or do something horrific that like bankruptcy.

369
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:27,729
But that's

370
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,450
like your process is broken and it's gonna fail sooner or later. That's right.

371
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,549
That's not the user's fault.

372
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,770
Like there needs to be like if, if there's like,

373
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,969
if I can accidentally push a button at a factory and the whole thing blows up,

374
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,729
you need to put a guard around that button.

375
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,859
And, and I think that's the whole point is fishing training,

376
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:45,450
I think is

377
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,349
it, it has value for awareness purposes,

378
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:52,219
but I don't think it necessarily has value for a, like people learning a new skill.

379
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,869
-- It always strikes me as trying to pass the buck.
-- It kind of is, I agree with that.

380
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,429
It's your fault now and we're going to blame you and,

381
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,940
and then in a court of law later on when bad things happen,

382
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,119
it's not the company's fault.

383
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,549
We, you know, we take blank very seriously.

384
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,580
And we train our users about blank, very seriously. And

385
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:12,539
the behavior of user around blank does in no way represent the company 100 percent.

386
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,780
And, and I think that's again, you're getting what you measure, right?

387
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:20,619
Whereas I think the the intent of phishing awareness

388
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,299
training isn't to make people click less phishing links.

389
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:26,099
Necessarily it's to get them to report phishing emails

390
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,049
and, and

391
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:30,359
-- better to report something that isn't fishing. Stupid
-- question.

392
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:31,989
But when they report the phishing email, then what?

393
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,739
-- Well,
-- so if you're using like gmail, I know you can report fishing and then your,

394
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,960
your administrator can basically go through and if like, yes, it's fishing.

395
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,969
But then what? Well, if you say like, yes, this is fishing.

396
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,669
It will remove that fish from every account in your organization. It's quite nice.

397
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,690
Yeah, it's pretty clever actually. So, anyway. All right. Moving on, moving on.

398
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,590
Uh next 10, I love this one. This one, my favorite guy named Dan.

399
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,630
And it says

400
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,049
when securely wiping a disk, you must do more than one pass. Yeah.

401
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,869
So I think that myth actually comes down

402
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,419
to back in the day with mechanical hard drives

403
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,170
that were nowhere as sophisticated or

404
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,829
the tolerances that they have nowadays just back in the day they didn't have.

405
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,689
So, I mean,

406
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,339
you know, we're talking about the era of like one megabyte hard drives, you know,

407
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,829
the era where you could take cassette tape and like,

408
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:21,550
-- like inspect it with a microscope to read the ones and zeros.
-- You can, you can

409
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,358
do that with VHS tape. You can, you can literally like see the lines on the tape.

410
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:30,199
-- And
-- so coming from that era in that era,

411
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,420
yeah, you, you

412
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:35,239
better do more than one pass of the hard drive because the head wanders and it's

413
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,339
gonna leave data on the sides potentially that

414
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,459
could then literally be recovered without like a piece

415
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:39,910
of

416
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,020
microscope.

417
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,650
But and tapes. Exactly.

418
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,000
And so, but, but this is stuff from 3040 years ago and,

419
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,640
and now we're talking about like

420
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,199
the the density nowadays,

421
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:51,229
no one pass it's gone.

422
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,750
So there's also a second part to this, I think,

423
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:57,449
which is when you're working with S SDS

424
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,569
S sds don't work like mechanical hard disks do where you can

425
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,130
like seek the head to a certain spot and do a certain thing

426
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:07,890
like they're constantly moving around the blocks inside the disk.

427
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,739
So wiping like an SSD is almost meaningless

428
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,599
because when you think you're wiping a block,

429
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,040
the SSD could be like, oh time to shift this around.

430
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,729
And so your data could still be in one of the unused spaces on the disk,

431
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:23,579
-- which is really funny,
-- but trim and like 10% of the space is reserved for future use.

432
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,489
I mean, the,

433
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,380
the one thing I've noticed is all the videos from like Amazon

434
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,640
and Google where they talk about how they decommission the stuff,

435
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,750
they physically destroy it.

436
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:31,839
Well,

437
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,469
there's physical destruction and you know what the

438
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,489
other cool trick is that's seen as common.

439
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,709
The reason you want to encrypt your data at rest and not keep

440
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,729
the key on the disk is because then when you decommission the disk,

441
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:44,300
even if the disk goes away, if you don't have the encryption key,

442
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
that's as good as random data and no one can recover it.

443
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:48,640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I like this one.

444
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,040
I think it's fun because I,

445
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,979
I know I'm notorious for wiping things like a million times.

446
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:55,119
Just it. Part of it amuses me.

447
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,359
Part of it is like it's that, like,

448
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,699
remember we talked about my GP GT and I live in like this alternate fantasy world

449
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,099
and I think wiping diss multiple times is

450
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,400
one of those like alternate fantasy things.

451
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,989
I just think it's like a now that

452
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:11,599
now nobody can find out what was on this disk before I got to it.

453
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,069
What also gets me about wiping disks,

454
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,150
especially on client system nowadays is all that stuff

455
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,040
gets remotely backed up to the cloud anyways.

456
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,270
So

457
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,010
I don't think this wiping is gonna do what you hope it does.

458
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,199
Especially on a client system.

459
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:28,400
It, it, it, yeah. And honestly, I don't feel like it comes up as much as it used to.

460
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,000
I think

461
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:32,530
1015 years ago, wiping disks felt like a big deal.

462
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,619
-- Uh,
-- it's still in every questionnaire we get is it

463
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,109
really?

464
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:38,459
Yeah. Like, how do you securely decommission hardware when you're done with it?

465
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,560
And I'm like, we don't

466
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,640
anyway.

467
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:41,239
All right.

468
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,060
Uh This is from

469
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,660
Alejo. It looks like Alex 91 Dohar.

470
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,660
Uh It says anything that tries to categorize

471
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,290
a vulnerability within a short list of categories.

472
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,209
The only thing that comes close to CWE and it has more than 1000 entries.

473
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:56,130
-- Actually,
-- it

474
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,050
-- doesn't.
-- How many does it

475
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,410
have?

476
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,969
CWE entries are not always vulnerabilities.

477
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,180
Some of them are like top 10 or top 25 lists

478
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,310
or categories. And I should know because I've actually, now just, I've submitted

479
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:10,869
10 or 11 New Cwes and gotten feedback on five of them. And I actually have

480
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:14,209
basically, I should be doing 2 to 3 of these a week if I was actually going at speed.

481
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:16,199
Yeah, CWE is comically

482
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,650
incomplete and every other list is even far shorter.

483
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:20,099
That seems

484
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:23,650
right. And I, and I say this as a member of the CWE board is that

485
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:23,949
I

486
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:26,229
would like to see more CWE si would like to see.

487
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,859
We probably need about 5 to 10,000 Cwes in total.

488
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,780
Well, probably, but then I think you also run into the

489
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,920
difficulty of how do you find them when there's that many?

490
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,579
Well,

491
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:38,150
and actually I brought this up on the board is if you

492
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,380
go to Amazon and try to buy like a ball pit ball,

493
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,290
you get like crush proof ball pit balls floating water,

494
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,739
happy for fun kids to play with BP A free non cancer causing.

495
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,540
And I'm like the problem like we don't need

496
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,660
that level of description for like buffer overflow,

497
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:51,859
but we do need

498
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:56,535
better search ability and discovery of the Cwes because like I

499
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:59,765
literally am now like I've learned like there's certain keywords like

500
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:04,594
-- instantiation or initialization.
-- I think this is one of those instances where

501
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:08,084
it would be lovely to have a robot that you like

502
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:11,175
pointed at the patch typed in the description of the bug.

503
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:15,214
-- And then the robot kind of said it's probably this one right here.
-- Yeah, exactly.

504
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:17,175
Because it's, it's a hard problem.

505
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:21,854
And what we really need CWE four is that we have a common vocabulary. So like

506
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,199
when we say buffer overflow, what do we mean?

507
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,339
And also for teaching, right?

508
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:29,910
And for not just teaching people but the scanners and the tools,

509
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,819
you know what I used to do back when I was really mean.

510
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,380
I remember when, when I'd interview someone and say,

511
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,849
explain a buffer overflow to me.

512
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,410
And if they did it first say stack or heat buffer overflow,

513
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,969
I failed them on that question.

514
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,420
But the reality is, I mean, it's kind of valid but it's kind of not,

515
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,579
I've just been a jerk I think.

516
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,750
But yeah, you're right.

517
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,430
It's, there's,

518
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,560
there's a lot of nuance and complexity and sometimes

519
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:53,630
you can just say buffer overflow and that's acceptable.

520
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,270
And sometimes stacker heap makes a difference.

521
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,410
-- And
-- even simpler, we need meta level stuff.

522
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,739
So like looking at the Nomad bridge that just got, you know,

523
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,569
packed for 100 and $90 million it's actually three vulnerabilities, right?

524
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:06,650
It's the first vulnerability is that they didn't have a

525
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,829
switch to put the thing into repair or upgrade mode.

526
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:12,369
So they used a magic value of all zeros, which led to the second problem of

527
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,040
they set the Merkel tree hash value to a manually set value of all zeros.

528
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,359
That's no longer a hash,

529
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,630
that's a human set value unless you get statistically improbably lucky.

530
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,479
And it actually hashes out to zero

531
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,739
and third.

532
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,680
And this is actually kind of in CWE is, it's actually finally sort of a logic bug,

533
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:32,359
but there's these things that came before it like an air crash

534
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,050
and we need more of that air crash level of investigation.

535
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,930
Here's one of my favorites.

536
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,319
Uh, a guy named Postmortem shouldn't say guy,

537
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:41,739
I don't know a person named Postmortem.

538
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,219
Uh It says wrist scores.

539
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,150
It's postmodern,

540
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,079
postmodern. Oh, sorry.

541
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,839
-- Oh, II, I do that a lot. Um Anyway,
-- have you been checked for dyslexia?

542
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:54,410
I, I have not been officially checked, but I'm certain I have a case of it.

543
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,040
I do this a lot where I switch a lot of letters around in words and it's,

544
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,599
it's sometimes terribly embarrassing.

545
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,839
So I mispronounce someone's name horribly and I'm

546
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:03,079
looking like literally at their name printed on,

547
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,400
on a name tag or something.

548
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,520
But anyway, anyway,

549
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:06,010
uh

550
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:08,819
risk scores too high level hand wavy,

551
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,599
thus not useful for identifying and fixing actual problems.

552
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,410
I love this one because we have things like CV SS,

553
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,650
we have things like all these scorecard things there's like in effect in this,

554
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,729
this specific one was called up multiple times in the context of C DS S like

555
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:26,160
scorecards for measuring like goodness of software or

556
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,619
software projects as well as like security scorecard,

557
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,449
the literal service that tries to measure like the,

558
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,439
the security goodness of a company.

559
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:33,800
And

560
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,280
my complaint about this, the complaint I have that I will, I will die on this hill.

561
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:38,979
Is that

562
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,719
all of the risk scores we use today are not scientific scores,

563
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:46,410
but rather things smart people thought were a good idea,

564
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,750
which is not without that scientific rigor,

565
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:53,500
we can't create like feedback loops that measure if it's working or not.

566
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,530
Yeah, because basically what you're, I think what you're saying is,

567
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,619
is there's definite correlation but is there causation?

568
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,079
That's

569
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,939
right. And you're right because now that I think about it like CV SS,

570
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,489
I've never seen a paper that rigorously like looks at the feedback loop like,

571
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,520
yeah. Does, is, is this what's actually important

572
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,709
because

573
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:13,599
CV SS? Yeah,

574
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,280
I

575
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,839
mean, you have to start somewhere. So I get what they started with.

576
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:20,719
It's kind of the same thing I would invent and I love that CV. SS two

577
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,319
are not too like as well as

578
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:26,770
it has the temporal and environmental score that nobody ever uses.

579
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,729
Yeah, because it's too complicated

580
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,229
and, and I think

581
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:33,189
again we come back to but, but I think the other,

582
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,760
the other thing that makes us really hard is

583
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,680
it not just stuff smart people thought was a good idea.

584
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,239
It's stuff smart people thought was a good idea.

585
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,579
And then they try to iterate on top of that and see

586
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:46,510
that as kind of progress instead of being able to say,

587
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,229
hold on, we need to like look at this, we need to understand like what, what works,

588
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:50,989
what doesn't work.

589
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,849
And this is any time you say, oh,

590
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,839
we're just gonna make up some rules and then we'll figure out if they work later,

591
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,729
you've already ruined your work because you will pick the,

592
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:00,109
you will cherry pick the data

593
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,920
that justifies the thing you made every time. It's just human nature.

594
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,969
-- It's how humans work honestly.
-- For me CV as

595
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,920
what the valuable down to is two things. Is it remote? Yes or no.

596
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,849
And does it require authentication? Yes or no.

597
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,609
And literally nothing else I really ever cared about.

598
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,270
That's basically the useful part of the data,

599
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,069
the number and everything like whatever,

600
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,619
but like those two facts,

601
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,969
that's what I really needed to know and having

602
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,489
those structured and easily read that was valuable.

603
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,390
And this is actually where I like what NIST is

604
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,280
doing because they have the bugs framework and the V

605
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,050
ontology work where I think once you start combining like

606
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,599
some of the actual real facts and data about vulnerabilities,

607
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,540
now we can extrapolate

608
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,300
more information on them and like fundamentally all everything we do,

609
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,359
like the reason it's made up crap is because we just don't have good data.

610
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:48,140
Like that is our problem in security is we lack the data to conduct the research,

611
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:50,770
to create conclusions and concept.

612
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,099
I would say it's worse than that. We lack the ability to even get good data.

613
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:56,739
It's not like people are lazy and just haven't assembled the data.

614
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,560
We don't even have the techniques and methods to assemble the data.

615
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,339
Well, I mean, that, that's just part of the scientific rigor,

616
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:02,619
you know,

617
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,400
and that's what we're trying with the global Security database is actually build a

618
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,849
thing that can then build the data that we can then use to.

619
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:08,150
Like,

620
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,430
like do we need to care about N PM or just keep like it's like with my devs at the CS A,

621
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,660
I'm like you guys ship this thing and update it twice a week.

622
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,699
Cool, close enough.

623
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:18,619
I'm like, I'm, you don't need to track CV specifically just keep it up to date

624
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,130
and I it seems to work.

625
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,979
No, like I have one data point which is, I don't think we've been hacked.

626
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:25,439
At least not to the best of my knowledge.

627
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:31,739
-- I say that and your
-- single data point is not reproducible in any meaningful way.

628
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,489
No, my favorite was a slash talk. Quote. The plural of anecdote is not data.

629
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:40,010
The plural of anecdote is not data like

630
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:43,530
two anecdotes. Five anecdotes. That's still not data.

631
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,760
Data is something totally different.

632
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:48,229
-- That is true.
-- Right. Like

633
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:48,459
it's,

634
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,800
that seems remarkably intelligent for slash

635
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,650
it was, it was a long time ago,

636
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,709
like 1015 years anyway.

637
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:57,930
All right. Excellent. Uh Robert CC

638
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:58,689
cord

639
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:03,500
use STRN copy instead of STR copy.

640
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,099
I don't, I disagree with this one but not for the reason everyone thinks

641
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:10,319
and that's what amuses me. So I'll give some background here

642
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,530
in C

643
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,550
there are

644
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,420
in the good old days, there was this thing called Stir

645
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,060
Copy, strcpy.

646
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,979
And it basically you put a string in and you copied one string into another.

647
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:24,680
And this particular function is probably

648
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:27,359
responsible for 90% of Buffalo overflows in

649
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:31,390
the early days of Sea because it did zero checking if you had

650
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,719
a 200 character string

651
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,079
and you told it, copy this 200 character string into this seven character buffer,

652
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,199
it would totally do it, no questions asked.

653
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:45,020
And then STRN copy comes along and that in that you basically say, all right,

654
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,310
here's the string, I need to put it in this buffer.

655
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,459
And here's how big this buffer is. And the idea being that you would

656
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:55,130
put the correct amount of bites. A buffer is

657
00:27:55,709 --> 00:28:01,900
and then STRN copy would fail if you tried to put too much data into too small a string,

658
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:02,359
right?

659
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,069
It is easy to make the argument that this is

660
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:06,699
good programming

661
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,869
could make stern copying

662
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:12,010
my head here because you're still fundamentally making the

663
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,199
programmer responsible for knowing how big the buffer is.

664
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:17,369
-- And that's complicated. And,
-- and here's the thing. So

665
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,479
the, the challenge here isn't whether the function is necessarily better or worse.

666
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:23,729
Well, we know it's better but

667
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,930
that what happens is when developers have to start doing, taking this extra step,

668
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,050
they ha they think about the size of their buffer and it slows them down for a minute.

669
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,609
And actually

670
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,949
Microsoft discusses this in,

671
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:36,170
in their, one of their SS DLC books,

672
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,319
one of the very early books and I forget who the author was.

673
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:39,489
I apologize in advance.

674
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,729
I have a copy of it somewhere in a box.

675
00:28:41,939 --> 00:28:46,229
But basically they talk about like Microsoft made a rule like no ST copy,

676
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:48,420
you can only use STRN copy internally.

677
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:48,869
And,

678
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,300
and in fact, the one they,

679
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,619
they created in Windows was even more complicated because you also had

680
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,030
to include the size of the buffer you were coming from.

681
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,530
And the reason they did this wasn't to add security specifically,

682
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:00,819
it

683
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,650
is to slow the developer down and make them think for a second.

684
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,459
But what am I actually doing here?

685
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:08,119
And that was what made it effective more so

686
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,099
than the protections because there's nothing stopping a developer

687
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,599
from just being like f it like put a bunch of nines in this, this spot or whatever.

688
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:16,339
You know what I mean?

689
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:18,800
I just think fundamentally making a developer

690
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:21,339
not only making them responsible for memory management,

691
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:22,069
but in

692
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:22,349
a

693
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,819
system where off by one matters,

694
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:29,209
you're, you're bound to fail. Like come on, what else is going to happen?

695
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,689
-- C has a lot of
-- problems.

696
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:30,780
Well,

697
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,900
not just C like there's other languages but C

698
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,280
-- is obviously the poster child for this
-- CC is.

699
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,949
But, but the point is like all of this,

700
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,369
it's less about the function itself and it's more about the behavior changes.

701
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,479
And I think that's a powerful concept,

702
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:46,489
especially when you're working with kind of people of any sort,

703
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,150
making them slow down sometimes and take a breath and

704
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,510
think about what's going on can be very valuable,

705
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,650
especially in security.

706
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,130
All right. All right, let's keep going.

707
00:29:55,219 --> 00:30:00,349
-- Also
-- just an amusing comment on that tweet Google or Twitter offers to translate it.

708
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,670
So I hit translate it and it gave me the exact same string,

709
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,739
you string copy instead of steal a copy.

710
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:09,430
Awesome. Awesome. All right. Excellent. Uh

711
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,839
Yyp.

712
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,510
-- I apologize if I,
-- I

713
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,930
don't even know how to pronounce it, but I'm pretty sure that was wrong.

714
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,300
The one thing I know is whatever.

715
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,760
I think a name is pronounced as is definitely not the correct pronunciation.

716
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,520
-- That is basically my rule.
-- So

717
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:24,260
anyway,

718
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:27,520
I've given up

719
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,400
you know what's funny is we've been working together for how many, like,

720
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,829
literally decades at this point,

721
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,589
I cannot spell your last name.

722
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,770
I have to look it up and then, like, type it while I'm looking at it

723
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,989
every time, every time, Kurt, I, sometimes I get embarrassed and I'm like,

724
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,530
whatever I've given up anyway,

725
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,819
I've had to look up. Is it pressor or pressor?

726
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:48,719
It does have an,

727
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:51,530
it does have an SS it doesn't matter anyway.

728
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:55,890
Alright. If SSH tells you the host key people, we'll verify it.

729
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,410
Absolutely. Just like it.

730
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:01,290
Like, like when you have to sign off on a code change, people always check those

731
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,729
and absolutely make sure that they are correct.

732
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:07,250
And what drives me nuts here is, yeah, of course, people don't do that like,

733
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,449
and more to the point when I connect to a server for the first time, how am I,

734
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:12,969
how am I supposed to check the key against what?

735
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,479
Ok. No, no. So

736
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,359
you're supposed to have the key documented somewhere,

737
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:24,349
-- but I just instantiated the server
-- because you should be contacting

738
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,760
the server owner prior to connecting so they can get.

739
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,239
But that's me. I know.

740
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:30,869
See this is every time when Windows throws up an error

741
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,140
message saying contact your administrator for help and I'm like,

742
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,010
well, damn it, that's me and that's not very helpful. Now, is it

743
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,979
right?

744
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,280
That's pretty good.

745
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:41,900
So I, I agree with you.

746
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,079
There,

747
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:48,319
there is SSH has host keys and there's no functional way to actually verify the key.

748
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:51,439
Yes, there is. They have host key signing. They've had it for over a decade.

749
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:53,880
They, they have and no one uses it because it's, but,

750
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,599
but once you start host key signing now you're in,

751
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,609
you have key management problems and you know what I mean?

752
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:00,790
-- Like these, these,
-- well, you already have key management problems if you're doing

753
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:01,750
that.

754
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,510
That's true.

755
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,489
That's true. That's true.

756
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,050
It's, but, but ok, so here's the thing,

757
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,930
ssh host keys have value.

758
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:12,790
But again, we come back to one of those like people don't,

759
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,810
it doesn't do what people think it does.

760
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,310
And the reason I like SSH host keys

761
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,520
is I connect to a host. I have no way to verify if it's actually correct or not.

762
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,260
So I just say yes and I connect to it.

763
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:25,969
But then if there's ever anything that changes like in

764
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:28,560
between me and that host from that point forward,

765
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,800
I know something different has happened and this can have value in the

766
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,250
positive and negative direction where if someone man in the middle is me,

767
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:37,810
I'm gonna get a warning, right? Or

768
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:42,530
conversely, if someone unmanned in the middle of me, I'm gonna get a warning

769
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:46,719
and that gives me the ability to now go and check on what happened.

770
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:48,560
So, and basically,

771
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,010
if this is a host,

772
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,650
you're going to connect to for long periods of time and connect

773
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,359
you many times if someone is man in the middle of you,

774
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:56,930
they have to keep man in the middle in you

775
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:59,640
forever or you're going to figure out something is wrong.

776
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,640
-- Well,
-- and hopefully you notice that something's wrong and do something about it.

777
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,250
But again,

778
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,719
the thing to remember is all this stuff came like this is 20 plus

779
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:08,089
year old technology at this point and we didn't have any other options.

780
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:11,400
When did SSH is from the early nineties? Right.

781
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:13,530
I mean, I bet I started using it in like 90

782
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,459
-- 4, 95.
-- This is one of the things like, is it a terrible solution? Yes.

783
00:33:17,469 --> 00:33:20,050
But it's a 25 or more year old solution.

784
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:23,859
-- It's
-- like GP G signatures. How do you verify someone's key?

785
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,439
It's actually really hard to do.

786
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:29,790
So, what we actually do is we just say, oh, Kurt, here's my new key.

787
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,510
And you say thanks, Josh, that's great.

788
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,400
Pretty much

789
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,209
and send it via email. So I don't have to cut and paste it, please.

790
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,189
Yeah. Totally. Totally. Absolutely. Right. Right.

791
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:40,729
Or heck, it doesn't even now.

792
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:44,750
I mean, with key servers, it's more like, oh, just download the new key. It's fine

793
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:48,290
using the short ID because it's hard to type the whole thing in. That's right.

794
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,959
Short I DS.

795
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:50,400
That's right. Those are just fine too

796
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,530
for that now. It's only 20 years late, but we're getting there. No use of

797
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,339
its use of partial hash value. Like you can't use part of a hash value.

798
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:02,000
You have to use the whole thing. Like,

799
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,780
we might have ac we for it in the next few months. Finally.

800
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:06,989
Anyway.

801
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,260
Now again,

802
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:12,659
I think this comes back to things like let's encrypt and

803
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,739
cigar are helping with a lot of these problems

804
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,500
and

805
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:17,500
we're not there yet.

806
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,040
We may never get there in some cases because SSH is still weird but it's,

807
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,879
it's getting better.

808
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:24,469
I mean, these are hard problems. It's taken a long time to sort out.

809
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:27,188
So, anyway, anyway, now I have to ask,

810
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,860
have you ever verified an SSH host key ever in your entire career?

811
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:34,260
-- A few times?
-- Yeah. Actually, I don't think I have ever,

812
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,918
-- ever
-- part of it is, I mean, I, uh,

813
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,678
one thing I used to do is we had like an

814
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:41,819
internal web server that listed all our SSH keys or rather,

815
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,809
I just, I think I made a config

816
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:43,467
file.

817
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:47,009
See, you, you started this conversation asking you where you'd get the key from?

818
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:47,779
That's where you get it.

819
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:50,089
How do you get to the web server? Securely? Blah, blah, blah.

820
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,908
-- Right. Chicken egg.
-- Well, that's TLS. That's a different problem.

821
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,299
-- That's someone else's
-- dude. We didn't have TLS back then.

822
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:55,849
All right. Well,

823
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:56,878
I couldn't afford it.

824
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,819
My first TLS server.

825
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:01,529
Well, TLS wasn't even around when I bought my, I bought,

826
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:04,589
I bought a copy of Red Hat Stronghold Server for 500 bucks.

827
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:07,370
Like, and I bought a certificate for it.

828
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:08,120
Which again, you know,

829
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:10,280
as that story goes like that poor company was

830
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,159
very confused as to why I was buying that.

831
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:13,419
Right. Oh, that's

832
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:13,629
right.

833
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,520
You know, but I wanted to set this up and learn how it works and

834
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,129
well, how else was I going to do it?

835
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:19,080
There was no open

836
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:19,560
source secure

837
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,159
server.

838
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:23,290
You could self sign a certificate and there was an open

839
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:26,520
source web server because Stronghold was based off of

840
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,260
just the Apache bits and pieces. You, you could cobble them together yourself.

841
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,709
Sort of,

842
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,989
it was hard because I did it and it was

843
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,570
not easy and then we would self signed certificates.

844
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,830
-- But
-- part of it is I wanted to know how to actually run like a real

845
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,060
secure web server. Like a product.

846
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,949
Not like, yeah, I cobbled like on my resume, I figured like, yeah,

847
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,830
I cobbled this thing together versus like red hats.

848
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,370
-- You know what I mean?
-- Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. I'll buy

849
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:50,709
that.

850
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,350
And then of course, I never became assistant M so it all panned out fine.

851
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,389
Is it, is your timer broken?

852
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,800
-- I turned it off. Well,
-- why did you turn it off?

853
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,469
Because it was like on the last round.

854
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:02,280
-- It's not the last round. We got one more tweet still.
-- I miscounted.

855
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:04,870
-- Apparently I was off by one last
-- tweet. Best for last

856
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,580
Macs are secure.

857
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:07,899
Um You know what

858
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:11,239
with the M one and M two chips they're getting there.

859
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:11,639
No,

860
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:13,679
like they basically are adopting the phone model

861
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:16,149
of like hard drive's encrypted secure enclave.

862
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,149
We don't care. Like you want to put a four digit pin in. Sure, do that.

863
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:22,189
But you want to, like, lock it to your icloud account and make it secure, do that.

864
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,699
The thing that annoys me about Max is like, you,

865
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,360
they're no better or worse really than windows and yet somehow the majority

866
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,280
of Mac users don't run antivirus and are kind of doing ok.

867
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,330
Well, I, I think you could accomplish the same thing on Windows.

868
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,080
I think the web browsers have gotten better.

869
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:42,100
I think the the real problem is if you look back in time, probably 10 years ago,

870
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,399
Windows was the dominant operating system.

871
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,739
All of the malware was on Windows.

872
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,300
And if you ran Linux or Mac, you didn't have malware, not because they were good,

873
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,149
-- but just because there wasn't malware for,
-- there was a small amount of malware.

874
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,330
It was very tiny and it was very hard to get. And the reality is

875
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:02,159
the Attackers were going after windows. And so I think

876
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,550
that attitude has carried

877
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:06,959
you also had different ecosystems like

878
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,330
the shareware ecosystem for Windows back in the late nineties, early aughts.

879
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:15,165
Yeah, that's true. That was a very download and run this ecosystem.

880
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:18,625
Remember when they started scanning that stuff for viruses and what happened

881
00:37:19,794 --> 00:37:19,824
was,

882
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:21,975
I can't, I can't even imagine,

883
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,044
like, let me put it this way. I'm old enough to remember two cows

884
00:37:25,314 --> 00:37:27,044
when they weren't at DNS register.

885
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:29,794
That's true. They were a software provider

886
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:31,764
and then was it,

887
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:36,475
was it Source Forge that was injecting crap into executables at one point?

888
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:37,084
Like

889
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:38,054
the whole thing

890
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:38,774
anyway.

891
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:42,229
So, and the fun thing is like, I actually, because I can,

892
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,350
I can speak authoritatively,

893
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,760
like I actually run Microsoft Defender 365 on both my Macs and it

894
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,379
actually works really well and it's not intrusive and it doesn't break anything.

895
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,250
And it's really cute because I get like these warning emails that my Macs were

896
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,189
not upgraded on the US and I actually forgot to turn the firewall on one.

897
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,790
Yeah, it's, I would actually argue that

898
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,429
Macs generally are a bit more secure than windows

899
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:08,449
because there's a couple of common failure scenarios that don't occur.

900
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:11,620
Like I, I don't need to download as many dodgy device drivers.

901
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,330
All right, I'm gonna, we're gonna end this because we're,

902
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,100
this episode's already way too long.

903
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,020
I, I'm, I'm, I'm putting in the last word.

904
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,540
Macs aren't secure,

905
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,300
windows aren't secure. Linux isn't secure.

906
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,500
That is all

907
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,780
all right. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Kurt. This was fun.

908
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,989
This is long, but it was fun. Go to open

909
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:31,280
source security podcast.com.

910
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,260
I'll put links to all the tweets and stuff and yeah,

911
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,699
Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day.

912
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,939
-- You
-- too. Thanks everybody.

913
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:38,560
Thanks everyone. Bye bye.

914
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,129
The
