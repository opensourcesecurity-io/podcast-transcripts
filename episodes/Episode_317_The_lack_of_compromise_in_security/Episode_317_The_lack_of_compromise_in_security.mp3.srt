Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,850
Kurt Siefried and my partner on the opposite side of the spectrum.

2
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:15,329
-- Josh
-- Pressers. I mean, what spectrum is my opposite of you?

3
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:20,100
All of them. Maybe your rules about food and breakfast

4
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,260
compared to mine.

5
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:22,040
I mean,

6
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:25,579
I only have one rule about breakfast and that's you eat breakfast at breakfast time,

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,180
right? But what about breakfast at dinner time?

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,420
That's not breakfast time.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,809
What happens when you fly internationally?

10
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,110
Then I eat whatever I want wherever I'm at.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,860
I won't lie

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,000
like when I'm flying somewhere and I land at like 6 a.m. local time and I

13
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,279
don't even know what time it is because I've been awake for like 30 hours.

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,299
There is nothing that makes me happier than just like eating

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,889
a giant horrible hamburger that's like coated in Greece. It is, it is a true delight.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,209
Hamburger

17
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,805
-- are nice,
-- especially when they're like extra greasy and foul.

18
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:00,275
And the best part is when you're

19
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:02,694
because obviously in an international airport terminal,

20
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:05,394
you can literally buy any food any time of day you want.

21
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,754
And it amuses me when at 6 a.m. I'm like

22
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:10,235
eating this gargantuan hamburger and everyone's looking at me like,

23
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:11,394
what's wrong with that person?

24
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:12,264
It's lovely.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,209
Yeah. Anyway,

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,419
but yeah, that leads to today's show where there's a lot of binary thinking in,

27
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,599
in security you're either secure or not secure.

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,260
And I love how also it's not even like a sliding scale of like 0 to 1 for these people.

29
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,379
It's like you are either secure

30
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:29,319
and then there's everything else which is like basically a zero and you

31
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,849
might as well set yourself on fire and stop trying to live.

32
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:36,199
Let's set this up a little bit. So I'll put a link in the show notes.

33
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,360
But I basically asked a very simple question on Twitter the other day. That was,

34
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:44,889
-- this is not a simple question.
-- The question is the question I asked is simple.

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,360
The discussion that ensued was

36
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:48,675
so the all I wanted to know was

37
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:50,235
you often hear,

38
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:54,855
you know, coming off the heels of which, what's the name of the, the N PM package? I

39
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:56,595
don't, no I PC. Thank you.

40
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:57,925
Yeah,

41
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,955
there might be one before this gets published. I don't know.

42
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:01,514
But

43
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:05,995
so there was all this discussion around Note I PC and it amuses me because

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,399
you often hear one group of people saying you need

45
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,199
to pin all your dependencies and you should only upgrade,

46
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,940
you know, when you know it's safe,

47
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,460
-- which that's another discussion in itself
-- or when you know, you need to.

48
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,059
Sure.

49
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,410
And then you have another group that says, oh,

50
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:24,419
it just let it all float and let the c I'll pick it up and test it.

51
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,440
And all I wanted to know

52
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,179
was, is there data

53
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,740
that basically can construe

54
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:36,785
which of these two particular options from a purely security perspective?

55
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:43,054
Which one is lower risk, be it? Floating dependencies or pin dependencies?

56
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:48,024
And the discussion turned into this, like madhouse of people arguing.

57
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,225
You need to pin your dependencies or you're a terrible person

58
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,729
and pinning dependencies is dumb. Why would you do that?

59
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,070
-- And it was just like,
-- well,

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,350
what about the third group that pins some

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,029
-- of their dependencies but not everything and
-- that.

62
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,779
-- OK. That's the squishy middle. I'm OK with
-- that.

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,309
What drives me nuts is

64
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,830
this actually kind of feeds back to that? Like what is open source?

65
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,639
What is the developer?

66
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:12,210
We're also talking about an N PM ecosystem where there's like literally

67
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,949
-- a million packages and as we're learning one point
-- 9 million.

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,300
OK.

69
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:18,404
So actually part of this now, obviously,

70
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:22,404
I didn't get any answers and the the thread became bizarre.

71
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,044
And so I thought there's clearly no data on this because if there was any,

72
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:27,244
someone would have come forward.

73
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:32,205
So II I put together a script to do so this is funny how this works.

74
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:36,804
Actually, just getting every N PM package name was shockingly difficult to do.

75
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:39,125
I have them. There's 1.9 million

76
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:42,240
and now as we speak, I'm it's gonna take like a week probably.

77
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,550
But I'm downloading all the metadata from all these packages and then

78
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,470
I'm going to do this analysis because I really want to know

79
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,110
and what I love is.

80
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,919
So, I mean, there are packages in there,

81
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:54,330
like my favorite to pick on is American date because it

82
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:57,169
literally converts a date from the normal format to American format

83
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,240
and it's like a dozen lines.

84
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,470
And when I looked at it, it hadn't been changed in four years. And I was like,

85
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,050
-- that's OK, like it's done. I,
-- I bet there's no less than 10 of those

86
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:08,570
probably.

87
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,880
-- But
-- the point is, I guess

88
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,460
I was thinking about this last night actually, what is,

89
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,729
what would be useful?

90
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,839
Let's go with the word useful metrics for a software project.

91
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,329
And you know, and there's i it's very difficult because

92
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:21,899
you can't look at the metrics.

93
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,049
You have to understand the why like has this not been updated for four years

94
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,345
because it's done or because the developer gave up on it and abandoned it.

95
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,934
We're going to figure that out once I have all this data,

96
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:33,834
I have a strong suspicion there will be more

97
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,704
than one white paper that comes out of this.

98
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:37,105
But that's, that's another story.

99
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:39,494
I want to set this up first before we get

100
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,635
too far into whatever unrelated tangent we end up on

101
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:47,424
is. So obviously, Kurt and I started discussing this like Wild Twitter thread

102
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,899
and the topic of security

103
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,269
practitioners often having strong opinions one way or the other

104
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,350
and it's, it's rarely anything in the middle.

105
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,589
It's generally speaking, you're either

106
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,029
100% for something or 100% against something

107
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,790
and compromise is difficult and rarely happens.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,410
So I think the problem there is if you try to sit in the middle, like,

109
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,679
I often try to sit in the middle and try to understand it.

110
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,850
People at both sides yell at me, it's like get off the fence or you're wrong.

111
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:16,390
And it's like my favorite is, you know,

112
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,929
somebody used the term like that's not a vulnerability.

113
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,269
And I'm like, well, what, what exactly do you mean by vulnerability?

114
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,190
They're like, I'm using it in the, in the normal sense

115
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,614
-- of the word. And I'm like, what? No, like,
-- well,

116
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:29,595
-- ok, that one I can excuse, well,
-- no, no.

117
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:32,954
But my point is is that the people who have strong

118
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:37,355
opinions by definition have strong opinions and don't like the people

119
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:37,864
that

120
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:41,785
kind of are sitting on the fence as it were where I'm like, I want more data.

121
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:47,114
I want some facts. Like, why do you believe this? What is the grounding of your

122
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,915
opinion of your, is this an opinion or is this like a theory?

123
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:52,899
And, and that is

124
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,809
the crux of I think I,

125
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,279
I kept replying to people in this thread and I'm just like, I just want data,

126
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,549
please give me data, stop pretending your opinion is data.

127
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,709
I just want data,

128
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,420
you know what, even anecdotal data,

129
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:07,070
even anecdotal data at this point would be better than nothing.

130
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,059
And so for example, we have like colors dot Js and faker dot Js, right?

131
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,809
And here's the point. Uh Here's a good example of why anecdotal data matters.

132
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:17,140
Fact thought in the last six months,

133
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:21,029
I can only come up with three examples color dot Js Faker dot Js,

134
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
same developer and node I PC.

135
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,959
Well, clearly it's not that huge of a problem,

136
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,200
but I can only come up with three good examples.

137
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,630
Uh There have been a couple of others.

138
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,839
I don't remember them off the top of my head, but there's definitely

139
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,000
-- we're
-- in the, at the worst. We're in the low double digits,

140
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,220
I mean. Oh yeah. Yeah, it's, it's not a lot compared

141
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:37,859
to,

142
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,140
compared to

143
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,279
how many security vulnerabilities were fixed during the

144
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,350
last six months across the N PM ecosystem.

145
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,480
-- Yeah, we're going to find that out
-- probably more than 10 or

146
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:45,850
20.

147
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:49,329
I can't tell you I'm going to have a number in the very near future.

148
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,970
A literal actual real number. I'm very excited.

149
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,730
See, and this feeds into the No,

150
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:57,329
you won't because did these things get clearly identified as security fixes?

151
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,089
-- No, no, maybe,
-- maybe not. And what's the point?

152
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,640
That is another discussion because anytime you have 2 million packages,

153
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:12,619
-- uh my, my guess is the top 10% get vulnerability identifiers assigned
-- top 10%.

154
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,679
Try, top 1%.

155
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,700
-- Maybe
-- I, well, we're gonna know we're gonna find out, see this is why I love data.

156
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,839
Like we don't, we're guessing we're pulling this out of our butts right now.

157
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,920
And I think that is one of the,

158
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,359
the challenges when you're a very smart person

159
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:31,790
is I think oftentimes very smart people are right a lot and

160
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:33,600
sometimes they forget

161
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,089
that there is a difference between being right?

162
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,970
Because you have experience and data and being right because you think it's right,

163
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,890
well being right because you happen to pick,

164
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,429
you happen to pick heads or tails and flip the coin and be correct

165
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,390
and, and that that happens too for sure.

166
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,140
I mean, so my favorite example of this actually is

167
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,000
if you look at the,

168
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,730
there's a certain amount of security advice

169
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:57,559
going around right now about supply chains,

170
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,440
especially supply chains, especially how to build your software,

171
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,670
how to package your software, how to ship your software.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,619
And

173
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:08,119
a surprising amount of it has zero data backing it up.

174
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,769
It's things smart people thought made sense.

175
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,600
And I remember I was talking to someone one time and I was basically like,

176
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,799
you're building these rules

177
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:19,339
on things you think makes sense. Like is that what we need data

178
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,359
to say if this is a good or vanity?

179
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:23,649
And they said, oh, we'll build the rules, then we'll look at the data.

180
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,179
And I'm like that is the most dangerous thing in

181
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,940
the world because you are going to cherry pick data

182
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:31,440
that backs up what you think is right?

183
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:32,859
As soon as you do this.

184
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:35,457
Yeah. So a quick thing, I have a bit of bad news.

185
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:38,818
If you search for node, you get 4000 plus results in the CV database.

186
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:43,698
But there's a lot of entries with like a node or a server node. You know what I mean?

187
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:46,419
And then if you search for N PM, there's only 526.

188
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,869
So I suspect your CV coverage of N PM is going to be

189
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,299
very sparse because I do know up until a few years ago,

190
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:53,578
there was like zero coverage of N PM

191
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,958
even back when it had over 100,000 packages. And,

192
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,818
and again,

193
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,890
I want to know this, I don't want to guess I want a real answer and

194
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,630
if it is only 1% and it might be, it won't shock me if it's less. Now,

195
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,750
that is

196
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,780
a horrifying thought.

197
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,299
Well, and that feeds into.

198
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:15,739
So, I mean, you know, now we're looking at things like statistics where OK,

199
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,599
so we do this like broad level overview of the N PM ecosystem and then maybe you pick,

200
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:19,919
you know,

201
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,130
10 packages at random and deep dive into them to

202
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,080
see kind of how many security fixes do they have.

203
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,450
Right.

204
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,940
And you know, and if your sample obviously 10 is not a great sample size, but you know,

205
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:31,799
at some point, you would have a sample size of 100 or 1000 or whatever,

206
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,380
where it would become statistically significant or you just cheat,

207
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,419
maybe do the top 20 or top 50

208
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:36,969
right?

209
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,369
And there are ways to kind of figure this out a bit.

210
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,049
But

211
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,099
I, again, I go back to this problem of,

212
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:46,020
we're trying to define something as kind of being the same.

213
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,380
So

214
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,859
like the way the CS A uses and builds our N PM app, you know,

215
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:54,809
for our main website is going to be vastly different than, you know, uh like a,

216
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,280
like a to use a traditional term like a.com kind of website, you know,

217
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:00,340
ecommerce,

218
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:01,460
uh whatever

219
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:01,770
uh

220
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,659
like

221
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,169
squares. Uh No, no, no. Um

222
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,440
Is it Shopify? I think they're big on rails, right?

223
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,950
Anyways uh versus, you know,

224
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,859
some internal app that they use to control the

225
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:14,059
toilets at a fortune 500 company or whatever,

226
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,460
right?

227
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,419
And that's part of the challenge is,

228
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:18,950
you know,

229
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,789
I, I hate that like,

230
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,299
basically what I'm trying to get across is there's like

231
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,090
1000 different kinds of applications in 1000 different kinds of companies

232
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:30,679
in 1000 different regulatory environments.

233
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,859
And we can't pretend that it's all just

234
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:35,919
a homogeneous spherical cow with a uniform density.

235
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:40,169
So what we can do is we can at least get, like you said, some data, some idea.

236
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,840
And I keep coming back to the fact that even if you can just

237
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:45,780
tell me the scope of the problem with one or two orders of magnitude.

238
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,659
That's far better than what, where we are right now.

239
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:48,869
I,

240
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:57,059
I agree 100% and I think that's one of the dangers of trying to take this very yes or no

241
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,400
model that we have in security.

242
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:04,659
And is when you, when you have strong opinions about something,

243
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:08,710
you will go to great lengths to justify your opinion. I mean,

244
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,950
like my favorite example, Kurt is when we did that show about Apple, when,

245
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,590
when was it when we completely hosed up the Apple copyright

246
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,909
-- thing? And
-- a couple of months ago, not that long ago,

247
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,340
I don't remember the exact details, but I remember someone it was,

248
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:27,349
was it they were using copyright against a researcher.

249
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,969
I don't even remember. Anyway, the point is

250
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,330
episode 300.

251
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,210
-- I remember
-- the first thing I did was trying to find the

252
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:37,830
news stories that we originally read that that backed up our views.

253
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,429
And then after all, I'm like, wait a minute,

254
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,130
even if I find them,

255
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,909
I'm wrong like

256
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,929
it doesn't matter, you know,

257
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:47,559
and that's one thing that's, I think really tough is the,

258
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,929
the mental ability to hold an opinion strongly but be willing to change.

259
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,630
So, a perfect example on a very personal level is spanking.

260
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,900
-- I was brought up with well spanking. That's just a thing. My mom's German.
-- Oh

261
00:11:59,049 --> 00:11:59,640
man,

262
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,960
-- that was very normal when I was a kid
-- super normal when I had kids with my then wife,

263
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,229
now ex wife, she was like, I don't believe in spanking.

264
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,780
And I'm like, what do you mean? You don't believe in spanking?

265
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:11,299
Like, that's like not believing in black holes. It's just a thing, right?

266
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:12,229
Like sandwiches

267
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:15,789
and she's like, no, like all the studies show that spanking is, you know,

268
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:19,830
well, to add insult to injury, not only is it traumatic, it doesn't work,

269
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,719
right? Negative reinforcement as a training tool generally does not work.

270
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:24,150
And I'm like,

271
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,390
so

272
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,150
and so I google a bit, I'm like, oh,

273
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:26,729
yeah.

274
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:27,039
No,

275
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:27,770
you're right.

276
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:32,289
Ok. So, and I remember when my kid was about seven or 81 time at the playground and

277
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,419
some other kid was like, just being a, like,

278
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,549
right, not very well behaved and like, oh, wow.

279
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,409
If I behaved like that, I'd get a spanking and my kid went, what's spanking?

280
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,409
And I'm like, oh, ok. Right.

281
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,020
And I explained it to him and he's like, like, why would you hit me?

282
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,219
And I'm like, yeah, now that you say it like that.

283
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,409
Yeah.

284
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,219
You know.

285
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,219
Right.

286
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,640
And so, but that's the thing is like,

287
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,650
there's still a lot of people that think spanking is ok and normal and the thing is,

288
00:12:55,659 --> 00:13:00,179
and here's the thing, like I said, I, ignoring the sort of hitting your child angle,

289
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,820
it doesn't work.

290
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,119
And that's what I find most offensive about a lot of these opinions is it's not

291
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,799
whether or not the opinion is morally or ethically correct or good or whatever it's,

292
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:09,700
is it like

293
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:13,039
to be blunt, is it utilitarian? Does it work?

294
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,989
And if it doesn't even work, it's like, well, damn it, like we need to

295
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:18,229
figure something else out.

296
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,679
No, I, I agree. I agree completely.

297
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,320
And that's where I come back to a lot of these things.

298
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:22,419
Like,

299
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,919
I don't care about the ethics or morality

300
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,669
of pinning or not pinning your dependencies.

301
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,380
Does it work?

302
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:30,260
And the answer is it depends on your environment

303
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,900
and it, but here's the thing

304
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,099
how many people have

305
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,489
like no real solid testing of their software,

306
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:39,440
the

307
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,359
the vast majority,

308
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:43,150
the vast vast majority.

309
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,599
So that means pinning

310
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,880
means things don't just mysteriously break.

311
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:47,679
Right. Right.

312
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,460
And, and look,

313
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:53,159
I will willfully acknowledge there are nonsecurity reasons

314
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:56,039
to pin software that we can understand.

315
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:58,799
But from my perspective, all I care about is

316
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,700
pinning versus not pinning.

317
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,059
What is the risk of each of those decisions?

318
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,030
Let me reframe the argument a bit because here's

319
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,659
how I view the pinning versus not pinning thing is

320
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:12,229
we have a current world state of software and my stuff.

321
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:14,960
And then there is a delta as time moves forward, right?

322
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:19,340
Every second that we move forward stuff in M PM gets updated and the world changes.

323
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,130
So a good example is uh uh a really good example is the chrome web browser,

324
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:27,150
the chrome web browser is like constantly updating as we all know that update button

325
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,690
and you're getting a delta

326
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,969
of from yourself to reality and

327
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:34,609
typically the smaller the delta,

328
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:37,760
the less pain it is when something breaks or you have to fix it.

329
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,880
And then the more delta, like,

330
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:40,650
you know,

331
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:43,130
five or six things that kind of break at the same time and

332
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,590
it looks like one giant problem when it's actually five separate problems.

333
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,200
And you know, that takes a lot of time and effort to solve, right?

334
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:51,609
Like basically let me put it this way,

335
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:54,919
it's easier to put out a small fire than like your entire house is on fire.

336
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,190
And so from my perspective, I don't care so much about the pinning or not pinning.

337
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,520
I care about

338
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:03,409
the management of that delta state that change state.

339
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,549
And for example,

340
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,929
that is why I religiously update my Apple devices and my windows desktops,

341
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:10,940
like

342
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:13,960
I at least one of them as soon as it comes out.

343
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:14,940
And for example,

344
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,679
we had that recent Apple Os update that of

345
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,239
all things broke full screen sharing in Google Chrome,

346
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,090
right? It affects that

347
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,580
it's affected a whole bunch of people at the CS A nu and here's the deal.

348
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:31,599
So, and even on my laptop, it only partially broke on my laptop,

349
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,119
which is super weird on my laptop.

350
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,919
I was able to go into settings, go into permissions and uncheck, you know,

351
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,400
the the screen recording feature and recheck it and then it started working.

352
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:44,450
What we have found is the only reliable way to fix this is to uninstall chrome. Reboot

353
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:49,520
uncheck. The setting like reboot reinstall chrome, reset the setting.

354
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,700
Like basically turn it all the way off and all the way on.

355
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,820
I have a funny story about that. So when I did that live stream for the CNCF,

356
00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:01,219
I was gonna stream from my, my, my Macbook and I could not,

357
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:04,219
I couldn't get it to work because the streaming software that uses chrome.

358
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,130
Yeah, I like, I sprinted across the house to get my windows laptop at the LA.

359
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,419
I had like two minutes to spare and I'm like, holy God, this is ridiculous.

360
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,169
And here's the best part is full screen sharing

361
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,979
would typically work for these people in Zoom.

362
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,739
Zoom works fine. Safari would work.

363
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:19,039
So it was, it was straight up

364
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,700
weird permission

365
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,260
chrome. Like basically, I don't know if it's permission that you're not.

366
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,260
All I know is like, basically,

367
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,500
you have to turn it all the way off and turn it all the way on to fix it.

368
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,570
And so that's a great example of like you're gonna run

369
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,619
into that eventually and I would rather run into it soon,

370
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,229
document it and get it fixed.

371
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:38,780
OK? I want to rephrase this though. You say you want to find it

372
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,140
soon.

373
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,960
But if I'm running a

374
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,440
credit card processing facility,

375
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:49,239
I can't afford any downtime under any circumstances,

376
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,500
I want to find out under my own

377
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,159
on my own schedule.

378
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:53,619
So this is,

379
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,630
this actually came up on stack overflow about a decade

380
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,880
ago where people were asking about rebooting Linux servers.

381
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:01,799
And I said I actually intentionally reboot my Linux servers at least once a month

382
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,590
to make sure that they reboot.

383
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,760
That's it. That's, that's the only reason I reboot them.

384
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,900
It's not so much brought updates,

385
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,660
it's to reboot it and see if it actually comes back and to

386
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,310
do it on my time and my schedule when it's convenient for me,

387
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,189
like a Friday at five or whatever where I have like

388
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,380
48 hours to fix it if it doesn't come back,

389
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:18,140
you know,

390
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,209
do you remember when you were in like ext two file systems and after what,

391
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,420
100 days they had to be checked or something?

392
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,808
And I remember my server would crash

393
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:32,729
and I had, like, some ungodly amount of storage and it would take like,

394
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,948
six hours to check the disk.

395
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,048
And it's like, oh, my goodness. I should have done this over the weekend.

396
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:40,619
No, that's one of the actual reasons I picked, uh, free

397
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:44,389
nzfs was that, you know, the pool scrub stuff live. Right. Right.

398
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:44,798
But,

399
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:45,249
but

400
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:46,318
the modern files

401
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:47,918
need to be checked. Yeah.

402
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:50,129
So part of it is by, for example,

403
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:53,078
staying current running C I CD builds and trying it out,

404
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,339
you can break quickly and here's the thing

405
00:17:56,829 --> 00:18:00,900
I, I'm gonna say you can roll back, you should be able to roll back

406
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:03,920
if you can't roll back. Holy geez.

407
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,199
You should probably go put that at the top of your to do list

408
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,020
alongside backups because I'm assuming if you can't roll back,

409
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,229
you probably don't have backups either.

410
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:10,540
But

411
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,500
my point is I want this to break on my terms, like,

412
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,520
kind of like I want to basically turn it off and on.

413
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:16,920
So I'm

414
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,489
like, if something's going to break, I'm mentally prepared for it.

415
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,310
I've got some, you know, time and space to deal with it and that's one aspect of this.

416
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,949
And so what I'm trying to say is for me,

417
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:30,280
it's less about the pinning and not pinning or partially pinning or whatever.

418
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,030
It's about

419
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:35,869
uh sort of trying to build that maintenance and operational

420
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:42,189
-- stuff into the system so that you don't get nasty surprises and,
-- and that's fine,

421
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,150
but we're off on a tangent already.

422
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,329
I mean,

423
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,530
this is one of the things I think this is really hard

424
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,170
to talk about because we're already not talking about security attitudes,

425
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:55,699
right? We're talking about practical reasons to not pin your software

426
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:58,260
where my original question was just,

427
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:03,400
which is, which explain the risk to me of each of these decisions. We, we don't know.

428
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,489
And, and I think

429
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:08,670
this is one of the things that makes it so hard is we often devolve

430
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,119
our conversations into places we understand and that

431
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,209
are completely unrelated to where we started.

432
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,020
And again,

433
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,199
I think I password guidance is one of

434
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:20,140
my favorites where Nist released password guidance,

435
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,739
someone did some research. It proved Nist's guidance were literally wrong.

436
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,619
The NIST people who did it were like, oh yeah, we just made this crap up

437
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,329
and then this literally said our original guidance was bad. Please do not do it.

438
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:34,530
Use this new guidance. And there are still people who will say,

439
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,579
-- I don't believe it.
-- Even the White House came up with their eo saying like

440
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,380
no more crappy passwords and no more two fa using S MS

441
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,619
people are still S MS two fa

442
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,410
-- all the way home
-- and, and not only that there are in the in the security universe,

443
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,030
there is an agreement about two factor S MS

444
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:55,319
I think

445
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:02,099
there are, I see many very smart people that I, I look to for advice that will say

446
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,109
it's, it's better than nothing.

447
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,319
And then there's other people that say it's worse than nothing. And I'm like,

448
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,869
I don't know what to think

449
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,420
I think

450
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:13,949
and I hate to say this but there are

451
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:17,390
specific cases where both statements are true and that,

452
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,790
that that could be fair too.

453
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,500
Like a great example is my, my, you know,

454
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,829
I use TD bank and they have a voice print security blah, blah, blah.

455
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,709
And I'm like, that's fantastic for normal people,

456
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:28,150
but there's like 300 hours of my voice recordings online.

457
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,630
Probably not so great for me.

458
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,489
I

459
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:30,760
have,

460
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,010
I have all the high quality because

461
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,670
I don't think you need high quality because this works over the phone.

462
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,079
Uh,

463
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,020
no, no, it doesn't.

464
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,250
-- I'm saying
-- the voice

465
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,359
thing works over the phone. So, like, I don't think you need high quality audio

466
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:48,439
more to the point. There was a, you know, V FX artist, uh, did a deep fake voice

467
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,329
where he actually cut together the guy's voice to accept the Ya

468
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:54,390
because it actually makes you accept the Ya. Like

469
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,000
hopefully.

470
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:58,150
And um, but he had enough recordings of the podcast.

471
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,599
The guy did to cut together, you know, like I

472
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:02,569
am accepting this

473
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,599
you

474
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:04,060
for,

475
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:05,849
you know, whatever, right?

476
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:11,640
-- Like out of sneakers, there's
-- like deep fake software now that I can take your voice,

477
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:14,109
I can dump it into the software

478
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,290
and then

479
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,599
you only need like, I, I think a

480
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,880
couple of hours it's no, you need,

481
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,369
-- you need quite
-- a

482
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,280
-- bit
-- depends on which phenoms and stuff, right?

483
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:22,489
There's,

484
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,910
there's tracks you can read where it kind of goes through all the weird noises.

485
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:26,890
-- But yeah,
-- like,

486
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,314
and you think I have, I have pristine tracks of you

487
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:34,875
hundreds of hours of that without me or anything else on that track.

488
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:35,885
So I'm just saying

489
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:42,114
-- I am your biggest
-- threat. We already saw. That was the lesson.

490
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:45,535
Can you remember the Russians put a deep fake of him being like, oh, you know,

491
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:47,574
what we should probably all give up and surrender.

492
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,655
Let's all be friends, everybody.

493
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:50,694
Right. Right.

494
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:53,189
And I mean, that's just kind of the world we live in.

495
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:57,869
-- But anyway, anyway, we're talking about security people. So
-- the P versus not P

496
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,219
I think part of the challenge is people are

497
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:03,069
also having this discussion and they haven't actually defined.

498
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,380
-- OK, let me put it this way. What do you define as pinning
-- in my opinion?

499
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,089
I would say it is when you hard lock your dependencies,

500
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,339
-- I know you can like in NP
-- ma specific version or

501
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:15,979
like specific versions,

502
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:19,310
no floating of any sort, not even the minor versions.

503
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,930
-- So
-- like no 2.3 point X, just 2.3 0.7 hard lock. OK.

504
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Second question.

505
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,930
Does your pinning strategy involve or if you're not pinning,

506
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:32,089
does your strategy also involve keeping a copy of all those things

507
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:34,869
or do you rely on N PM js.org being available always,

508
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,849
-- I
-- mean, look in from the stuff I do, I just rely on N PM Js existing because I,

509
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,704
I'm not important.

510
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:42,314
I don't care.

511
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:43,474
But I also, I mean,

512
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:45,795
I think what you run into is the two places

513
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:48,525
people often end up is they pin their dependencies,

514
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,714
they never touch them again.

515
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,194
I'm completely guilty of this

516
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:54,464
and then they don't also don't keep copies of their stuff. So like

517
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:56,984
I'll never find this again if it disappears.

518
00:22:57,435 --> 00:23:00,025
Yeah. Good luck getting that version 2.9 0.17 thing.

519
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:01,454
-- Yeah, whatever.
-- I'll just use

520
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:03,935
Google Drive with some of the dodgier drivers.

521
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:06,375
My hard work came with because remember I bought that one webcam where it's like,

522
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,935
go to this IP address slash and I'm like,

523
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:12,790
-- I, I chucked it through virus total. It's like clean. I'm like, ok,
-- good enough.

524
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:13,599
It's probably fine.

525
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:17,239
The other aspect is, for example, if you're talking about pinning,

526
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,130
are you forcing your dependencies to pin?

527
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:22,780
You can't, you don't really have a choice. So actually, you know, you can,

528
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,010
you can like force upgrade some of your dependencies,

529
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:27,875
things break all the time and it's a big mess.

530
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:31,755
This is my point is people talk about pinning or not pinning and it's kind of like, OK,

531
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:32,025
cool.

532
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,214
So that's the first level. What about the stuff below that?

533
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:35,175
And they're like, huh, what do you mean?

534
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:37,964
And it's like you can't have an opinion about pinning and not pinning.

535
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:39,854
If you actually haven't thought it through,

536
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:41,944
it's not that they have it wrong

537
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:43,214
incomplete.

538
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:45,699
It's, I mean, look, I think you,

539
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,060
you bring up a good point and the reality is

540
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:51,140
most of the things we do are highly complex.

541
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,540
And I mean, another one of my favorites are when you hear people go on and on about,

542
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:59,839
you absolutely should be signing all of your release artifacts.

543
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:01,069
And you know what I mean?

544
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:05,099
-- And like that's another one of I
-- would say now that salsa is available.

545
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:07,739
-- That's a possible, yes,
-- not salsa six door

546
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:08,099
six

547
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:08,400
star.

548
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,219
-- It is possible. Right. No, I, I agree. But there's still,
-- well, it's like http s

549
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,170
right before let's encrypt and everything I would have been like, uh,

550
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,290
-- whatever
-- that is not a reasonable comparison because today I can sign things,

551
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,930
I can give you something that's signed it.

552
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:24,609
You still have to take action to verify the signatures.

553
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:28,010
We need the ability to auto verify things.

554
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,390
Uh You need it like to be like a web browser where it just works

555
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,520
and throws up an air if it doesn't work.

556
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,729
Like, I mean, RP MS are my other favorite, right?

557
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,609
Like when I, when I install something on my Fedora system,

558
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,060
it verifies the signatures and if the signatures fail,

559
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:41,770
it doesn't work and then I just turn off

560
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,900
signature checking and install it anyway and it's fine,

561
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,150
right?

562
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,410
So,

563
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,030
well, no, you're right.

564
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,739
If I download a tar ball or whatever,

565
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,959
it's like uh and then I have to take additional steps to go figure out.

566
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:50,489
I mean,

567
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:54,489
I told this to someone one time.

568
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,989
If you had to estimate cart,

569
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,329
how many times have you verified the signature on a tar ball you've

570
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,060
-- downloaded off the internet
-- back in the olden days with open BS D.

571
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:07,380
Just total. Give me a ballpark number. A, a number. I don't want a story.

572
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,319
-- Just give me a
-- number, I would say even more importantly,

573
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:11,160
I gave up on this probably 15 years ago.

574
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,560
So you won't even give me a number.

575
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:17,680
My estimate is 55 times over the course of my entire career. I bet it's five.

576
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,400
I had some scripts that did it,

577
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,189
whatever

578
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,869
it was out of the open BS D ecosystem, which kind of

579
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,270
had more a culture of that, but more to the point I gave up on it like 15 years ago.

580
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,670
And so that's kind of like, I think that really proves your point that it's dead.

581
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:34,540
It's like email, it's like email encryption man.

582
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,349
Like you and I both gave up on P GP GP G. How many years ago

583
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,280
I wanted,

584
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:38,589
I

585
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:44,180
someday we need to do an episode just where I talk about how I secured my

586
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:48,069
P GP keys because it literally would take an entire episode to tell the story.

587
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:51,400
But like I'll add that to our list of shows someday.

588
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,319
But like

589
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,969
I was the biggest fan of P GP for the longest time and it

590
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:02,250
broke my heart when I had to finally acknowledge like this thing has failed.

591
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,969
Well, even P GP, like their email web appliance,

592
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:09,290
basically emails you a link to an HTPS site to read the message.

593
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:10,810
What is this?

594
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:14,229
So like the P GP email appliance will P GP encrypt

595
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,439
email outgoing if they have a P for that person,

596
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,810
which they almost never do.

597
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,770
So what they do is they email that person with a link to the to read the message,

598
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,170
right? Because what else are you gonna do? Right?

599
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,439
You need to get that email. So, but back to the pin versus not

600
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,729
pinning the other,

601
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:30,839
there's, there's so many dimensions to this

602
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,130
and some of those dimensions affect everybody and

603
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,410
some only affect a certain subset of people.

604
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,530
And most of these people aren't even aware of all the dimensions,

605
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,760
let alone if they are affected or not.

606
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:42,910
And they have

607
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,310
like a strong opinion on pinning versus not pinning.

608
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,739
And there's like a million,

609
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,920
like my favorite example of this kind of

610
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,790
type of argument is Blockchain where they're like,

611
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,449
oh blah, blah, blah, all this stuff is immutable and I'm like, cool.

612
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,250
That's great. That is, that is actually quite useful

613
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:59,079
and you know, and you can do like bank transactions to reverse stuff.

614
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:01,520
Ok, cool, great. So we can fix stuff. But I'm like,

615
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,199
what is your plan

616
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,579
if your Blockchain ends up with the legal data in it?

617
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:09,280
And I remember this one guy looked at me and went, what do you mean illegal data?

618
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,170
And I'm like, you know, like child pornography or like free Tibet now

619
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,810
and you're operating in China and he went,

620
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,260
oh, I hadn't thought about that.

621
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:18,219
It's immutable, you know,

622
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:21,709
and this guy works for like a major European energy provider where,

623
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:23,209
yeah, like,

624
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,449
oh, he, he had not thought about it at all, but it just hadn't occurred to him.

625
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,089
And the look on his face as he,

626
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:32,050
you could see him sort of mentally cogitating and he's like, he's like,

627
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,099
that's an awkward question. I'm like you. Yeah, it is. You know,

628
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:37,849
and,

629
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:41,099
and then he kind of walked away and didn't look very happy about it. But,

630
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:45,819
you know, I, I guess I helped anyways, there's a lot of this in pinning and, versus not

631
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,060
like that tweet where I'm like,

632
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:49,910
I didn't even know that this thing has a

633
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,130
hyphen. What is it? Hyphen hyphen install later than one week or whatever?

634
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,359
N PM UK.

635
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,150
-- Right. That's neat. I didn't know that either.
-- I think that

636
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,939
-- I bet you 99% of the people with opinions on pinning versus not pinning didn't
-- know.

637
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:02,530
I mean, look, I this,

638
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,430
this conversation has devolved into a pinning versus not fitting discussion,

639
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:09,449
which I think proves the contentiousness of it,

640
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,819
but I want to bring it back up to a level and just talk about the fact that

641
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,380
security people

642
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:17,890
are often highly opinionated about certain things. And I think

643
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,510
not just our lack of data, sometimes, not just our yes or no attitudes.

644
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,410
There's also the fact that I think

645
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,890
we often become tribal in many of these decisions and

646
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,089
it's not enough to say this is what I do.

647
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,260
This is why I do it. It's often do it my way or else. And that's not helpful either.

648
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,420
I think it's worse than that in that again.

649
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,079
It's ok to have a strong opinion

650
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:39,780
but

651
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:44,099
you need to be open to new data and new theories and change.

652
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,339
And a lot of these people are not.

653
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,189
It's uh I hate to bring this up but it's almost

654
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:50,699
like identity politics where literally these people self identify with.

655
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:54,380
I am a member of the passwords must change every 90 days tribe

656
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,910
and like the rest of you will burn in hell for not doing it.

657
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:02,369
Like because they are literally people within that basically say that like,

658
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,180
come on, we've met them.

659
00:29:03,189 --> 00:29:06,859
Like there are literally people where this is like a core part of their like i

660
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:08,060
identity

661
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:12,540
-- and that is not healthy at all. You know, same thing with sports teams.
-- No, I, I agree.

662
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,069
You know,

663
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,189
that's a good point too.

664
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,920
You have to be mindful that you don't

665
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,829
turn these sort of things into your identity because

666
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:20,969
it can create problems.

667
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:21,920
-- Let's
-- say, well,

668
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,109
this is like your brand of tires being part of your identity or it's like,

669
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,469
it's a technical thing that

670
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,219
can and will change at some point like how many people have you met?

671
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,959
But then Cloud is some bs fa

672
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:32,640
quote unquote,

673
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,170
it's just another person's computer and when you try and talk to them about the,

674
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:36,949
oh, there's still a handful. Yeah.

675
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:40,170
And when you try and talk to them about the economics of it or the speed of it or the,

676
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,780
you know, the utility, the commodification of it and, and they're just like la, la,

677
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,089
you know, they just don't want to hear it, you know, on premises or dead.

678
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,630
I used to feel this way about uh,

679
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,949
Linux versus Windows and Mac of like Linux is the best and, and I,

680
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,459
I made Linux part of my identity and

681
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:58,589
I mean, I won't, I won't lie.

682
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,750
Like I, I open source definitely shaped who I am as a person.

683
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,459
But I do also feel like now I've, I've made some efforts to

684
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,189
distance my personal identity with

685
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:11,589
Linux and open source specifically because I found it, it, it,

686
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,280
it became damaging, especially to certain relationships because like,

687
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,839
I knew people who use windows and I was always like, oh, windows sucks.

688
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,140
You shouldn't use windows and they finally like, like, it's their freaking,

689
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,219
it's how their feet in their family, like, who cares?

690
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:22,739
You know,

691
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,459
I mean, I had sort of like, I was big into Linux since the age of 17,

692
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:32,900
but I also had like an M CS C and Windows NT four back in 2000 or 99 or something long,

693
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,500
long time ago.

694
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:35,060
And I remember people

695
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:38,464
would actually be kind of horrified in a way where they're like,

696
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,984
but you wrote the Linux Administrative of Security Guard and I'm like, yeah, I,

697
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,415
yeah, I did because like, Linux is awesome and they're like,

698
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,474
and you have an M CS E and I'm like, yeah, I freaking love Windows NT four.

699
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:47,375
The thing is awesome.

700
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:48,954
And they're like, but what, like,

701
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:52,665
you could just see them mentally melting down like that robot in Star Trek.

702
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:55,885
You know, like I am telling you a lie, you know, and they just, like,

703
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,464
the logic circuits are melting and it's just like, I, I just,

704
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:01,780
I watched that episode the other day. I watch Star Trek a lot.

705
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,770
It's on one of the local TV stations plays it in the evenings

706
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,859
and he had an episode with Nomad where Kirk outsmarts the computer.

707
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:10,219
I love that one. It's the space probe.

708
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,750
He outsmarts a lot of computers in that show. Actually, I should,

709
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,229
I should make note of it sometime and look into it. But

710
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:19,030
because he also what he outsmarts land

711
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,109
does he blow Landre up? Um,

712
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:24,185
the, the, the return of the icons. Uh,

713
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:25,714
anyway, whatever it doesn't matter.

714
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:30,214
-- Um, he does outsmart a lot of computers.
-- I think a lot of this boils down to his people.

715
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:33,954
Not only have this as a strong opinion and are unwilling to change their opinion.

716
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:37,395
Like, literally when the people who came up with this are, you know,

717
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:39,255
recanting like nist in the passwords.

718
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,864
Not only are they unwilling to, you know, change their mind,

719
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,604
but they then make it part of their kind of who they are.

720
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:45,074
And it just

721
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:48,180
like there are people I will no longer engage with

722
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,380
because

723
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,869
they just have some like,

724
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:52,250
literally,

725
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,040
they just start arguing about how terrible Mac Os and windows are, and I'm like,

726
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,739
I run them on my desktop and, like, yeah, I like them. Yeah.

727
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,680
And, and, and I think, I think that's it. That's what we'll go out on.

728
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:04,209
It's just the simple fact of, like,

729
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:07,260
don't let this kind of stuff be part of your identity.

730
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,260
It's, it's silly,

731
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:11,869
you know, it's, it's ok as a job and a career but not, it's not a lifestyle.

732
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,290
Yeah.

733
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,709
And I think that's the key to not,

734
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,550
not turning your security decisions into these very binary.

735
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,359
Yes or no

736
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,630
is if it's part of your identity,

737
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,660
there's no room. There's no wiggle room.

738
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,150
Well, you can't be wrong because then your identity is wrong.

739
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,979
Exactly.

740
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:29,780
-- 100
-- percent. Let's be blunt. Everybody's identity is wrong in at least one way.

741
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,770
Anyway.

742
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:34,219
All right, I'm gonna end it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
