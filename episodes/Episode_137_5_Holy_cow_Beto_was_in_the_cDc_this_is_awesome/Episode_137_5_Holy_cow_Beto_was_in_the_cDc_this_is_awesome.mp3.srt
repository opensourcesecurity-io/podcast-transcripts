Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast.

1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,069
Episode 137.5 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner thought crime,

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,720
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:16,049
Yeah, just to clear that up. So

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,370
I cut episode 138 literally last night.

5
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,719
And I told Kurt I'm too lazy to fix it.

6
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:25,450
So we're just going to call this episode 1 37.5 or I guess

7
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,829
we could call it like the emergency cult of the dead cow episode.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,450
Yeah,

9
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:32,400
it is. Uh Yeah, it's pretty interesting.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,360
So anyway, it's like

11
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,400
this is huge freaking news, man.

12
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:38,479
I don't even know what to say.

13
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:39,560
Well,

14
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:42,470
I'm actually more surprised that the cult of the dead cow had

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,639
secret members and they managed to keep it secret for 20 years.

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,139
That's

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,310
an impressive level of secrecy keeping.

18
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,779
These are, these are people who they know what's up. These,

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,029
these are people that they, they've done some things and seen some things that they,

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,209
they know better than to talk.

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,119
Right. Well, why don't you tell us?

22
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,430
Because I remember vaguely what cultivated cows, but it's been like 20 years.

23
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,739
So let's refresh us.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,029
They were like my freaking heroes.

25
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,709
So OK, so

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,510
I'm gonna, I'm gonna put on like, I'm going to geek out on this as much as I can.

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,790
So back

28
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:15,870
a long time ago,

29
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,110
there was a very healthy B BS scene and kind of a alongside of it,

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,309
there was a really healthy hacker scene back then and these were,

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,669
there was like cult of the dead cow. There's a legion of doom there was

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,540
and I, I

33
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,419
yeah. Right. The laughter part of that.

34
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,480
There's, I, I, anyway, I can't even remember them all off the top of my head.

35
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,949
I know there were tons and tons of them

36
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:35,790
and

37
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:38,410
remember them in HP.

38
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,089
Yeah. Right. Right.

39
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:45,480
And, and anywhere you lived there was a hacker scene like I am from Green Bay,

40
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:48,580
Wisconsin and there was a hacking group here.

41
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:49,129
Right.

42
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,720
So it didn't matter where you were like these people were everywhere and it was,

43
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:56,129
it was fun. Ok. Now,

44
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,739
Cult of the dead cow was one of the better note and when I was, but a wee lad,

45
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:04,459
like these were people that I looked up to as I would,

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,419
I wouldn't call them heroes.

47
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,300
I don't even know if I technically call them role models necessarily, but they were

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,619
something to aspire to in a way.

49
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,860
Right. I, I agree with that. I think

50
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:18,160
if you were a young person in technology at the time,

51
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:21,000
these were people doing things and saying things that,

52
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,139
-- that sparked your attention
-- Well, they were, the,

53
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,289
they were clearly,

54
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,800
I think part of it is they, they were both

55
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:30,039
technologically sophisticated

56
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,410
and cool. Like they were doing cool things with technology.

57
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:36,759
Exactly. They were, they were pushing the limits and now

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,759
sometimes

59
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:39,880
they were,

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,039
we'll say, uh, on the shady side of the law

61
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:44,910
and

62
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,580
this was before the C FAA

63
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,669
in a lot of instances. And so a

64
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,820
lot of these activities,

65
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:56,279
what would be grossly illegal today were maybe questionable back then.

66
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,860
Well,

67
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:59,720
I always laugh about that because remember when Dan Farmer came out with Satan,

68
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,789
the security analysis tool, the what is it, security analysis tool for

69
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:04,589
the networks

70
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,149
anyway.

71
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,320
And it was like, it was decried as the literal end of the computer security world.

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,440
And now it's actually something that's like required by most security standards

73
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:14,960
by the government.

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,029
And I don't know which group Dan Farmer belonged to,

75
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,639
but I guarantee he was in the hacking scene wherever he was because

76
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:28,910
man, I was always jealous of the hair. Like I wanted long hair so bad.

77
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,429
But I, I,

78
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,009
I'm one of those people that has very unruly hair

79
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,630
and every time it gets to a certain length,

80
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,199
it, it begins to drive me insane and I have to get it cut, but

81
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,679
they had the best hair.

82
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,500
But anyway, anyway, all right. So,

83
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:44,490
so cult of the dead cow and these guys, they, they claim they created the

84
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,729
Eine, which for those of you who don't know,

85
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,429
there was a thing we called

86
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,970
Eines, which were kind of like before blogs.

87
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,550
And this is where people would have like a digital newsletter.

88
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,979
One of the most famous is something called Frack,

89
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,479
which if you don't know about Frack, oh my goodness,

90
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,740
go look it up and just read them all because you won't regret it.

91
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,369
And so anyway, the CDC claims to have invented the E Zine, which maybe they did,

92
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
maybe they didn't, it doesn't matter.

93
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,619
The point is they could have,

94
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,990
I think it was one of those things where probably a

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,580
lot of people invented it all around the same time.

96
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:14,899
Uh,

97
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,940
probably they probably were one of the more popular ones

98
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,119
without a doubt.

99
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,488
I mean, I remember, II, I know,

100
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,459
I read all of their stuff when I was young because it was,

101
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,329
it was interesting and it was insightful in many ways and of course,

102
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:32,269
a lot of it was stupid and edgy too. And that's kind of that.

103
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,769
I, I think that it's going to be a fair bit

104
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,269
all the hate on for the telephone companies back in the day.

105
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,290
-- And,
-- yes. Right. So, that's right. Everyone,

106
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,839
I mean, and it was totally deserved in hindsight, but

107
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,010
we hated AT&T back then too

108
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,720
before. It was cool.

109
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:49,920
That's right.

110
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:51,329
No, it was cool then too.

111
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,589
But, but anyway, so, uh, so anyway, the news that,

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,799
that we're talking about and I'm like, I'm so excited in my brain,

113
00:04:58,809 --> 00:04:59,799
I keep getting ahead of myself.

114
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:01,940
But so Beta o'rourke, who is a,

115
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,209
he just announced his candidacy to run for president in the United States,

116
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,600
which of course, as a Democrat now being the opposition party to Donald Trump,

117
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,700
there's, I think like 700 people running for president.

118
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:14,829
Now on the Democratic ticket,

119
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,390
I was, I was gonna say that's part of my,

120
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,179
so I'm a Canadian and I don't really quite get this

121
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,609
thing the US does for presidential elections,

122
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:25,880
the way it works is very different than what I'm used to.

123
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,750
And so my understanding is you have like a

124
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,299
lot of people announce they're quasi seriously running for president

125
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:35,779
and then, like, anyone could, like, I could announce right now, I'm running

126
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:37,072
president and

127
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,592
I guess I would be, but

128
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:39,352
I'm not.

129
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:41,743
But then the main thing is you need to get on

130
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:45,192
the Democratic Party ticket to get the Democratic Party behind you,

131
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:46,263
which as I understand it

132
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,613
is actually a private organization like the Republican party.

133
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:50,733
It's technically not a

134
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,102
government party. It's a private

135
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:57,713
organization that does. Yes. Well, fundraising and, and king making basically,

136
00:05:57,882 --> 00:05:59,743
I mean, essentially, yes, because

137
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:00,653
I

138
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:04,186
fundamentally in the United States, there's a handful of political parties,

139
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,425
but there's basically two,

140
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,485
there's the Democrats and the Republicans and they

141
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:10,996
make up like 99.9% of all the politicians.

142
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:14,425
And so you can run as an independent or whatever. But at the end of the day,

143
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:17,846
the president is almost certainly going to be a Democrat or a Republican.

144
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:21,746
Well, and more to the point though, it's, those two entities are not actual

145
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:25,645
political parties, they're just private organizations. Correct.

146
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,329
Well, that's the DNC, the Democratic National Committee,

147
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:34,489
like the Democratic Party is, I guess an ephemeral creation

148
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:36,829
that is all of the people as part of it.

149
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,250
Right.

150
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,390
And you can have people, like, for example,

151
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,649
Bernie Sanders who is technically an independent,

152
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,899
is he he caucuses with the Democratic Party?

153
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:46,000
But that what we're thinking of here actually is

154
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,890
a Democratic national committee is kind of the,

155
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,679
the,

156
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,739
the weird organization that has all the money and gets to make a lot of the decisions.

157
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,359
Well, they get to control where that money goes. So,

158
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:01,220
right, which fundamentally decides how this all works.

159
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,000
So, so why should we be excited about Robert Francis o'rourke also known as Bedo

160
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,390
O,

161
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,970
right.

162
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:12,140
Which, which I didn't know Beta wasn't his first name.

163
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:12,640
Uh Actually,

164
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,899
although we must also say his cult of the dead

165
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,450
cow name was Psychedelic overlord or no psychedelic warlord,

166
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:18,679
right?

167
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,250
Psychedelic warlord. I think it was

168
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,600
uh look this up quick.

169
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:26,329
-- Yeah. Psychedelic warlord.
-- Psychedelic Warlord. Which is, that's fair.

170
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,559
I mean, that's a pretty good handle

171
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,679
in 1988. Wow,

172
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:37,320
he was, the guy is 46 and I keep thinking in like 88 he would have been like 16,

173
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
which is, although I guess that's about right, because I am,

174
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,510
I'm six years younger than

175
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,079
Beto.

176
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,920
I would have been like 10.

177
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,940
And,

178
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:46,890
yeah, like,

179
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,559
like I was basically 12 when I found out about the internet and then I was

180
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,070
basically just a dysfunctional youth for probably a year or two while I figured out,

181
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,480
like, what does any of this mean?

182
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,809
And I mean, back then, man, it was, I had a shell account. Right. I had a shell account.

183
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,000
I dialed into a modem at a university

184
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,589
and it picked up and I had a login prompt on uh what was,

185
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,940
what was the silicon graphics Iri

186
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,519
Iris

187
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:11,760
machine?

188
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,570
That was my internet. And then I had to figure that out. So it was,

189
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,190
I bet I spent a month just not knowing anything.

190
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,769
Well, in fairness in fairness,

191
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,209
my first internet was dialing into the public phone line at the university.

192
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,920
They had a public gopher system.

193
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,940
And if you found a dead gopher, if you found a dead gopher link,

194
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,330
it would drop you to a telnet

195
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,030
prompt.

196
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,308
That was my,

197
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,989
that's a nice bug. I like that.

198
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,750
So it would drop me to a telnet prompt.

199
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,880
And then from there I could tell net to things and log into, you know, public systems,

200
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:46,250
right?

201
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,869
I didn't even have an account. I just was

202
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,260
piggybacking on the whole

203
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:50,780
thing. And, and

204
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,659
after about six months of that, I actually went and bought like a dial up account,

205
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,289
you know, a Shell account with a, uh, an actual ISP.

206
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,330
Right. And in fact, I remember my first ISP account was Shell only.

207
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,299
I had no, it was PPP back then

208
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,789
and I had no PPP.

209
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,530
Uh, well, you could run, oh Slip was before PPP. Yes, that's right. Oh man.

210
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,960
Well PPP, ran over slip kind of

211
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,330
eventually. It did. It's,

212
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:18,340
yeah,

213
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
it was, uh,

214
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,869
it was messy and it, but it worked,

215
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,570
it did.

216
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:26,010
That's right. And that's all that matters. So, anyway, anyway,

217
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:26,539
Beo

218
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,590
is in the freaking cult of the dead cow, which is like,

219
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,130
it's still blowing my mind and this is ok.

220
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:32,429
So

221
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,849
he kept it a secret for 20 plus years. That's impressive to me.

222
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,750
Uh That doesn't shock me at all. I think

223
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,369
there are many of us conducted many things.

224
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,200
Like I wouldn't dare tell anyone what my, some of my handles were just because, well,

225
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,590
for the most part, I've avoided any, any real, I guess legal troubles or issues.

226
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,510
I could be a jerk,

227
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,349
you know, I don't need people to be like, wait, that was you like, no, I'm,

228
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,320
-- I'm cool with that. We'll just let that.
-- I

229
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,669
just used my real name. Part of that was to not be such a jerk.

230
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,289
I, I totally didn't,

231
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,599
yeah, I, I started using my real name in

232
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,469
probably 2010

233
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:10,820
ish,

234
00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:15,270
I guess before then it was very handle friendly, I guess.

235
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,000
But anyway, anyway, so the freaking CDC now here's

236
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:23,349
I guess here's where I would like this conversation to go is, first of all,

237
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,099
we should clarify.

238
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:25,679
Is this a good or a bad thing?

239
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,640
And

240
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:28,559
obviously, from my perspective,

241
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,000
I think it's a good thing.

242
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,429
I think it's a great thing.

243
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,830
Right? Because

244
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,320
here's my view on this is that if you look at

245
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,630
most of our political leaders and technology,

246
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,989
I think calling them inept is a generous description.

247
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:44,000
These

248
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,909
-- are people
-- who don't have a clue.

249
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,429
I would say it's worse than that.

250
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,229
I would say a lot of politicians don't seem to have that spark of curiosity.

251
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,510
-- Yes. And that's the second part of it.
-- Exactly.

252
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,169
That thing

253
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,570
is the real thing is,

254
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,469
you know, like, well, I look at Brexit right now and it's like you,

255
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,380
for example,

256
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,099
there's an article in the Economist from November

257
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:05,309
of last year pointing out that it's not

258
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,739
that Britain can't buy enough medicine to stockpile

259
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,109
in case of disruptions in the supply chain.

260
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,609
They simply don't have enough warehousing with temperature

261
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,320
control to house the stockpiles that they need.

262
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,380
So even if they could afford to buy the stockpiles, which they can't really,

263
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,710
and they could somehow magically get these manufacturers to be like, oh yeah,

264
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,630
by the way, if you could just make like an extra three months by Tuesday,

265
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,210
which is the point we're at now, right? We're less than two weeks away from Brexit.

266
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:35,460
Um They, they physically can't keep it anywhere without it spoiling.

267
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,979
But how is the cult of the dead cow going and you fix that?

268
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,989
All right, I'm gonna, your shaggy dog story. I'm going to hold a candle to it.

269
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:44,950
Well, just that, that's that spark of curiosity. I'm,

270
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,159
I'm guessing

271
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,159
basically I'm guessing somebody like beer

272
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,150
or work

273
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:52,000
would either have thought of those kind of things

274
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,409
or would have people around him smart enough to think of those

275
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:58,340
things and tell him and for him to really understand the impact.

276
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,969
I mean, it, it's certainly possible. II,

277
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:03,349
I don't know, I guess,

278
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,580
I don't know if Brexit is necessarily the best example

279
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,359
because there was just so much misinformation and madness.

280
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:08,489
A

281
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,239
lot of politics is heading into the unknown by definition.

282
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,960
It, well, it should be, I mean, I think it's not right now

283
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,750
and that's what CDC was. CDC was literally

284
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,830
not the edge. They were like the knife like they were, they defined the boundary.

285
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:29,469
But beyond that, there wasn't any reality because they hadn't created it yet,

286
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:31,340
you know, things like back orifice like

287
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,070
that was like, oh my God.

288
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,369
And now it's like, oh yeah, of course, that's like, you know,

289
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,979
that's just a normal thing nowadays,

290
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,630
right? OK.

291
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,719
We should explain, we,

292
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:39,950
we're gonna have to keep in mind

293
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,409
to explain everything because basically anyone who's probably

294
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,140
younger than 35 isn't going to have a freaking clue what we're talking about.

295
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,260
So back orifice

296
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:52,489
was what we call a rat. Now, which is a remote administration tool.

297
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:55,090
But the intent when it was released was basically you

298
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:57,599
can install this in any computer and take it over.

299
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,940
And more to the point, it was small.

300
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,979
It was reliable because these things sort of existed beforehand. But they sucked.

301
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,219
Right. Right. I mean, I remember

302
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,479
doing CIS

303
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,210
admin work and using back artifice as a legitimate

304
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:13,020
tool because it was like the best thing ever.

305
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,659
But of course,

306
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:16,179
oh dude, it was way better than the commercial ones

307
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:19,159
and, and, but now,

308
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:21,440
but now here's the other important thing to point out

309
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,469
is because this is cult of the dead cow.

310
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:26,919
They had a very hands off approach to what you should do with this.

311
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:30,679
You could use it for the power of evil or you could use it for the power of good.

312
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,119
-- It's up to you
-- and remember how they announced it, you know, they

313
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,729
Microsoft was having kittens about it and wanted early access

314
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,409
so they could figure out what was going on because

315
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:39,969
there

316
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,650
it was one of those classic giant unknown things that turned

317
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,429
out to actually not be all that scary after all.

318
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,479
But remember what they wanted from Microsoft for payment for early access to it.

319
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,940
-- Oh, it was, I, I don't remember. It was ridiculous
-- though.

320
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,559
-- A million dollars in a monster truck. Right.
-- Right.

321
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:57,590
Which is,

322
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,539
which is fantastic.

323
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:01,880
And now, now the other thing to remember for,

324
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,640
for those of you who may not is Microsoft was super evil back then.

325
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,140
Like, nobody liked them.

326
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,219
It wasn't even that they were super evil.

327
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:15,820
They were also super corporate and like they had no idea

328
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,799
how to interface with security researchers or the open source community

329
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:20,780
and, and in fairness nobody did.

330
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:21,729
Right?

331
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:22,419
And this was like,

332
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,549
I remember when loft crack came out and they lost their stuff over that too

333
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:29,609
and I'll never forget I was listening to it.

334
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:34,090
I think it was a Hope talk from way back in the day. What's hope?

335
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,570
Hope is hackers on planet earth.

336
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,619
It's a conference in New York City put on by the 2600 guys

337
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,590
which by the way, the 2600 guys,

338
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,330
their radio show off the hook is still on the air

339
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:46,190
at, at WBA I in, in New York,

340
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,739
which you should totally listen to because it's still freaking awesome.

341
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:48,919
Like,

342
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,190
it's all Emmanuel Goldstein is the only like regular person who's been on the show.

343
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,190
Like, I've been listening to this show on and off for

344
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,440
what, like 20 plus years now. And it's fantastic. I'll put a link in the show.

345
00:14:58,739 --> 00:14:59,710
But anyway, it's been a while.

346
00:14:59,840 --> 00:14:59,909
I

347
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,330
remember like love

348
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:05,010
comes out and there's some. So for those of you who don't know, love

349
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,330
was a tool to crack windows, passwords, which was what NT

350
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:09,640
password hashes,

351
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,710
right? The hashes. It was what NTLM hashes, I think they were called

352
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,559
-- and they were
-- really bad nt

353
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,179
-- manager.
-- Right. Right.

354
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:19,539
And I remember there was, they were telling a story one time where,

355
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,469
uh, apparently authentication for Samba way back in the day

356
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:26,349
used to work where basically the client would tell the

357
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,609
server here's my password and the server would say yes,

358
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:29,859
that's wrong or no, it's not.

359
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,090
And then the client could just make requests,

360
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,289
but either the server could say it's wrong and you could just

361
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,590
make requests and the server would honor it because they said,

362
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,659
oh, it's a client's job to enforce login.

363
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,049
And they're like, what? No, you can't work like that.

364
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,760
Well, and there were also problems with, you know,

365
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,340
you could trigger by just adding an SMB link to anything like an email,

366
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:49,880
whatever you could get the client to send its hashed password,

367
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:50,224
you can

368
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:51,854
very easily decrypt and

369
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:55,885
right. And they were, they were so bad and there were collisions. And anyway,

370
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:57,815
but the thing is like this work,

371
00:15:57,934 --> 00:16:02,724
these people move the needle forward and this was super controversial back then.

372
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,025
And, and I guess here's my fear

373
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:06,905
I have of all this is, I think

374
00:16:07,114 --> 00:16:09,505
Beto being in the CDC is awesome,

375
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,159
but I know his opponents are going to try to use it against him

376
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:18,510
because let's face it. First of all, let's look at the name Cult of the dead cow.

377
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,929
Now, we know the word cult is in there just to be ironic and edgy.

378
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,859
But let's face it if you tell a normal person, hey, Beta was in the cult, the dead cow.

379
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:29,130
They're gonna say Beos in a cult. What?

380
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,059
On the other hand, it's so ridiculous that cult of the dead cow,

381
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,090
it just sounds ridiculous.

382
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:37,539
-- So, it might not be as terrible. I don't know.
-- I, I hope so. I'm, I'm hopeful. So.

383
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:39,090
So that does give me hope.

384
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,530
You say that because actually I've asked a handful of normal people.

385
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,130
Did you hear the news about Bedo

386
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,250
being in a hacker group? And they're like, yeah,

387
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,169
and then I said, what do you think? And they said,

388
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:52,840
what, what's the big deal? I'm like, it's a huge deal. Like these guys were awesome,

389
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:55,760
but I'm hopeful. Most people just don't care.

390
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,750
Well, part of me is happy that it's normalized somewhat.

391
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,299
I,

392
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,719
-- I
-- it might be that it's just not because being

393
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,358
labeled as a hacker used to be like jail time.

394
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,280
Right?

395
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,800
Actually, I remember that when I was in college people would be like,

396
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,530
are you a hacker?

397
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,930
No, no, no, don't, don't call me that.

398
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,079
You know, you're like, looking around to see who's paying attention

399
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:14,939
because you're right.

400
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:19,020
-- That was, that was not a friendly term back in the day to be known
-- as well.

401
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,459
I mean, and they kept trying to and people still, oh, cracker versus hacker,

402
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:23,459
you know, hackers are cool.

403
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:26,170
Good people. Crackers are the bad guys. Like guys

404
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:27,079
that,

405
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,530
that etymology ship sailed and caught fire and sunk like

406
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:32,630
two decades ago.

407
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,109
This reminds me now I'm going to put a link in the show notes.

408
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,229
Do you remember Richard Stallman? You'll be free hackers song.

409
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:43,010
He plays his little pipe and sings this song. It's fantastic. I'll find a copy.

410
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,949
It's, it's the best.

411
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,050
-- Uh, but anyway, in the
-- term, a lot of these memories I've repressed successfully.

412
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,589
So.

413
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:49,400
Right.

414
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,689
That's right. Let's peel back the covers and see what's underneath it.

415
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,369
It's not a soft gooey inside. Right. It's

416
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,359
no. Anyway,

417
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:01,410
anyway,

418
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:02,969
so I guess here's,

419
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:06,890
here's one of the things I want to think about and this is for you and I to discuss is,

420
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,709
let's say there's someone that says, oh Beto

421
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,949
is a hacker. We can't trust him.

422
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,660
I think this is a terrible thing that he is in this hacker group.

423
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:14,829
And I guess

424
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:18,300
because let's face it. I found a handful of text files he wrote.

425
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,540
-- Well, he was, I mean, isn't, is he still in the
-- CDC?

426
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,729
Probably not? Like, do you ever leave? I don't know.

427
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,709
-- Did
-- he, did his membership expire?

428
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,260
-- I don't,
-- I don't think there is membership.

429
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,270
-- I did he
-- re up, right.

430
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,829
Are you pay your dues?

431
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,119
Yeah.

432
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,349
Right. Like send the check here.

433
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:38,319
Uh It, it, let's, let's not focus on whether he is or isn't still in it.

434
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:41,699
I'm sure if someone asked him today, he'd say no, I'm sure if you asked

435
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,219
anyone in the CDC, they'd be like you don't ever get to leave, dude. Right.

436
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:48,630
Like you're in it forever. So it does, it doesn't matter though, it doesn't matter.

437
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,959
Here's my thought on this is you can look back and

438
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,140
the CDC did a lot of edgy things, some ethically questionable things,

439
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,160
some legally questionable things.

440
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,609
And I

441
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,739
don't think you and I are going to disagree that you can mix it all up

442
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,560
in a pot and it's a net positive for society at the end of the day.

443
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,380
But people are going to look at, say some of the things Beto

444
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,170
wrote way back in the day.

445
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,839
And if you look some of them up there, of course, it,

446
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:16,270
it reads like a 16 year old trying to be edgy, which is exactly what it is.

447
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,510
And so the question becomes

448
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:20,040
like this is the, the proverbial,

449
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,819
be careful what you put on social media because

450
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,520
someone who could use it against you someday.

451
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,770
Well, here we are.

452
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:28,160
So I guess, let's say someone says, like, look at the crap this guy wrote, you know,

453
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,239
we can't trust him.

454
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,119
What do you say to that?

455
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:33,119
Well, I, I haven't read his old writings.

456
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,280
Um I'm guessing they're not going to be,

457
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,829
they're not going to be super racist or terrible,

458
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:40,319
-- but more just sort of stupid and edgy in
-- 16 years.

459
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:43,760
It's stupid and edgy, right from the things I found. And I guess

460
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,869
the way I look at this is

461
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:50,579
if, if anyone found any of the stuff I wrote when I was 16.

462
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,369
It was terrible and badly written.

463
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,750
The ideas sucked and I thought I was awesome

464
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,119
and the reality is, thank goodness.

465
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,859
I'm pretty sure everything I did when I was young has

466
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,459
been wiped off the planet or can't be attributed to me.

467
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,510
So that's great. Right. Obviously, in Beto's case, he's kind of screwed.

468
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,349
Well, also, I mean, if this is kind of the worst stuff you can find about him, was it?

469
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,880
It's like those people complaining about what is it, Alexander?

470
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,150
How do you a OC, what's her name? Alexander Ocasio

471
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:20,410
Cortez. I apologize for portraying her name

472
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,510
but they're like, oh my God, here's a video of her in university dancing.

473
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:24,750
-- Right.
-- Who cares?

474
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,369
Yeah, that's, that's kind of what people do

475
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:28,969
and,

476
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,339
and I think that's one of the things people might

477
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:33,560
have to come to grips with is you look at

478
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,310
really anybody,

479
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,930
-- they did terrible and dumb things when they were kids, not
-- even terrible things,

480
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:42,270
but like just kid things, just dumb kid stuff.

481
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,150
-- Right.
-- Right.

482
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,390
You know,

483
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,239
we got to make our mistakes in private because we

484
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,670
didn't record everything and shove it on to the internet.

485
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,189
But let's face it over the next 2030 years, every single politician will be like,

486
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,729
especially with facial recognition.

487
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,500
That's really going to be interesting to me. Right? Is when you start

488
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,910
plugging a politician's face into the youtube or to whatever and getting

489
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,150
all the videos they made when they were 16 or 17.

490
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,459
You know, like those things where people set their pants on fire and it ends poorly.

491
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,420
I mean,

492
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,989
those are the best.

493
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:10,560
I

494
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,469
know. It's like, what do you think? What happened?

495
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,869
But like, here's one of the things I think of all the time.

496
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,310
I, I think we are probably anyone, five years,

497
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,869
like 35 ish and younger at this point is almost certainly

498
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,359
going to have tons of stuff that's negative about them.

499
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:25,780
But the question is, can Bedo

500
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,910
get past that?

501
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,750
Are people going to be willing to say he was a

502
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,729
kid and he did dumb stuff and we don't care.

503
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,540
I don't think people are going to actually care all that much.

504
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,109
I think some people are going to try and care to make it an issue because whatever,

505
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:37,359
but fundamentally,

506
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,010
I think it's one of those issues that's so kind of abstract to most people,

507
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,770
but it won't.

508
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,839
The problem is OK. He was a member of cult of the dead cow.

509
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:47,479
Now did cult of the dead cow do anything

510
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:49,640
really illegal and get rounded up and arrested.

511
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,140
-- Uh
-- not, I mean,

512
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,619
some of their members did I think like fundamentally as a group that was on their own,

513
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:58,270
I don't think they had like that level of cohesion

514
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,729
to sort of maybe compare it to something grossly inappropriate.

515
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:03,359
Like for example, the Black Panthers, right?

516
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,060
The Black Panthers like people like, oh

517
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,560
those are those people that did a bunch of bad things and, well,

518
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:10,084
I'd have to look it up to actually

519
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:11,675
quantify what those bad things are.

520
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:14,244
But I'm pretty sure they did bad stuff or something. Right.

521
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:17,084
Whereas Cultivated Account it's like, oh, they were a computer hacking group,

522
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:21,285
did they like, cause a power outage or hack the stock exchange?

523
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:22,925
-- Like what?
-- Well,

524
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:27,275
-- not that we know of.
-- They released this thing called back orifice with a really,

525
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,699
I'm gonna say amusingly rude logo.

526
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:30,359
Well, no, no,

527
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:33,089
I mean it goes beyond that though because actually there was so there was,

528
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:37,199
there was a member, a guy named the Death Vegetable and I believe he had

529
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,140
Yeah. Death Veggie was hardcore dude. That guy was awesome.

530
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:44,010
But anyway, he published, I don't remember it Anarchist Cookbook or it was,

531
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:45,739
it was some bomb making manual.

532
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,780
-- Yeah, but that stuff so tame compared to what we have now.
-- Right. Well, yes and no.

533
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,219
But I mean you have to think like without question,

534
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:54,859
someone took that content and they hurt someone else with it.

535
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:55,500
-- Well,
-- but,

536
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,780
and in fairness, I've also seen people do youtube video

537
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,930
of going through the Anarchist cookbook recipes trying to get them all to work.

538
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,189
And the one,

539
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:03,560
the main one was that the sugar

540
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:06,390
based smoke bomb actually apparently works really well

541
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,630
and everything else kind of just fizzled out.

542
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:12,459
This interests me. I'm afraid I'll be put on a list. But

543
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,099
yeah, there's some youtube videos of people

544
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,670
of them trying out the Anarchist cookbook. Nice, nice.

545
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,189
Like does this, you know this urban legend of this, this forbidden knowledge book?

546
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:23,390
You know,

547
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,760
that's only available as a text file that you invoke at

548
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,469
midnight by downloading from A B BS using a secret number.

549
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,859
It's like making a sugar smoke bomb and like

550
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:34,969
I remember reading the recipe for

551
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,109
explosive.

552
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,709
Uh No, I mean, there was,

553
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:41,050
there were legitimate recipes in there for like bombs and stuff.

554
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,030
-- Like I remember
-- reading it, I'll be blunt. Most of them.

555
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,479
If you don't do it right. You're,

556
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,300
you're going to hurt yourself.

557
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:47,750
II,

558
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:52,010
I would bet that more people hurt themselves than ever hurt other people.

559
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,890
But it doesn't matter because look,

560
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,810
this is a group that has some questionable content like this.

561
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:57,609
And so

562
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,640
what do you say to someone who says, oh, these people are criminals

563
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,770
and I guess here's what I, I've been thinking about this nonstop for like three days.

564
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,099
Well, very simple. You asked them to quantify that statement.

565
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:12,290
-- What do you mean criminals? What did they do? That was a crime.
-- No,

566
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,520
no one's no one's going to answer that.

567
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,979
That's not how you, you got to remember when people react to things like politics.

568
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:20,739
It's solely based on emotion,

569
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,540
right?

570
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:26,099
They don't answer questions truthfully, they don't use logic and so they're gonna,

571
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:27,900
they, they have the emotional feeling

572
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,939
that this is a group that does bad things

573
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,290
and

574
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,589
I mean, you probably can't change many people's minds.

575
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,770
But I would say that the thing to really talk about is just the fact that

576
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:41,550
while this was a group that potentially did something

577
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,869
that some people might have frowned upon and,

578
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,380
and some of them might have gone to jail.

579
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:50,069
Well, I would say part of it too is this wasn't a super cohesive group, right.

580
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,709
-- It was more people who were members of the city. No
-- hacking group is cohesive.

581
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,750
Like that's how they work.

582
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,290
I think that's what will partly help here is, is it's very easy to distance yourself.

583
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:01,780
This is

584
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:04,900
more of a brand name than an actual cohesive group.

585
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:08,930
And that's going to be very true to a certain degree.

586
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:13,729
But, but I think I would honestly just chalking it all up and putting it all together.

587
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,589
I would say this is one of those instances

588
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,050
where people can do silly things when they're young.

589
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,640
But fundamentally I think if the world didn't have the cult of the dead cow,

590
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,150
it would be worse today. Oh,

591
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,359
yeah.

592
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,449
Unquestionably

593
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,709
-- computer security would be at least months or years behind where it
-- is.

594
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:35,930
It would be, I think years behind these guys pushed a lot of envelopes and they,

595
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,010
they had the ability to anger a lot of very

596
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,540
powerful people at the time and get away with it

597
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,369
and I have a feeling that it was, you know,

598
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,369
you're talking about the group being not cohesive,

599
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,469
but I think they have enough cohesion

600
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,349
that they could speak truth to power.

601
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,310
Well, OK, it's, it's hard to let me quantify that

602
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:57,209
the type of cohesion is very similar,

603
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:59,400
I think to open source groups and that they definitely

604
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,689
have some underlying principles that they very much agree to

605
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:07,010
giving them a degree of cohesion that most companies don't have.

606
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:11,089
But at the same time as to what you actually specifically do,

607
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,380
that's kind of up to you.

608
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,010
That's fair. That's fair. I'll agree with that.

609
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,560
And I think,

610
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:18,099
and that's very hard for a lot of people to understand because let's face it.

611
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,599
Most organizations,

612
00:26:19,939 --> 00:26:24,599
especially corporate organizations don't have a very

613
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,579
strong 12th elevator pitch cohesive statement of like

614
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,609
I worked for Red Hat for seven years.

615
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:31,520
And

616
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,280
when I heard the core, what was it, what did they call that thing?

617
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,439
-- The, the, the core mission statement or whatever it was? Uh
-- which one

618
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:41,930
it was like the one that was like to be the

619
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:45,209
leading open source technology company or something in the 21st century

620
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:48,930
to be the technology company to be. So it used to be, they changed it.

621
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:52,949
But the good one was to be the defining technology company in the 21st century.

622
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,050
That was the, the mission statement,

623
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,410
which was, and they change it to something that was harder to remember.

624
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,729
And I don't remember what it was, but

625
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,569
that was the old one and I like it.

626
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,170
I worked there for seven years.

627
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,550
I can't even remember it, let alone, I can't even really quantify how I helped

628
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,849
move it forward.

629
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:11,599
You're in security. We played whack a

630
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,530
-- Mole for years. And that's with
-- CV E.

631
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:14,920
Yeah.

632
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,030
So, and that's something I think that where the hacking groups are,

633
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,280
are very interesting because they,

634
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,479
you don't get involved with a hacking group unless a,

635
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:25,369
you're very interested in it and b, unless you're competent enough to be allowed in.

636
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,910
And that's a good point too.

637
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,540
Yeah. Right. These things are very much meritocracies.

638
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,459
They don't just allow anybody in

639
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,119
-- and,
-- yeah. No, no, no Lamers. Right. Like,

640
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,459
that's the rule.

641
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,119
So, I, I suspect

642
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,030
with younger people once they kind of understand what this is,

643
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:42,699
I think they will think this is cool and it

644
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:46,689
will be something beneficial to him and his persona.

645
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:50,550
So young people should think it's cool and they should start their

646
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,609
-- own hacking groups
-- and they should hopefully start voting as well.

647
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,310
-- Uh, yeah, that's also really important because,
-- like,

648
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,530
no offense if you have political opinions and you don't vote, you can shut up.

649
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,060
Right. I agree with that.

650
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,979
Sorry. That's, but that's how I feel.

651
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,060
It, it's totally true. I agree.

652
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:07,560
-- And that's what I always tell people,
-- you know,

653
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:10,290
and I don't even care if you go to the booth and spoil your ballot,

654
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:11,479
go vote.

655
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,250
I don't care how or who?

656
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,290
But you gotta, you gotta, you gotta go do it otherwise

657
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,930
you don't want to talk about politics

658
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,290
-- and now we can vote for a hacker, which is pretty
-- freaking.

659
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,550
You can, I can, that would be

660
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:22,859
a,

661
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,680
you can't,

662
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,229
I'm pretty sure if I vote for po, I work in a presidential election.

663
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,660
I've just committed a felony.

664
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,209
That's, yes, I, is it a felony?

665
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,000
-- It might be, I guess it
-- is a felony.

666
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:34,790
Ok.

667
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:34,829
-- I,
-- I

668
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,109
-- don't
-- know, federally,

669
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,390
anything to do with elections or the post office is almost always a felony

670
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,599
also. Cow tipping.

671
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,989
-- That's true. Stealing someone's mail is a felony, which is,
-- it's a federal felony.

672
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:48,010
Right. Right. Well, they are, they, yeah, they're state felonies anyway.

673
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,949
Whatever it doesn't matter. Right.

674
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:53,310
We, we're in Red Hill so vetos in the freaking CDC, which is amazing.

675
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:54,520
And I,

676
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:58,400
here's, here's the thing, I think we should end this on because I don't wanna,

677
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,959
I don't wanna eat up too much time and I know we've kind

678
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:02,520
of just rambled on a lot about this because it's so awesome.

679
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:03,430
But is

680
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:08,550
the way I kind of look at this is if you are part of the kind

681
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,660
of like hacker subculture or ever have been or want to be or anything at all,

682
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:14,640
I think

683
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:21,000
it's going to be critically important for us to stand up for Bedo whenever

684
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,260
we can because there are going to be people who use this against him

685
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:30,040
and I think we need to make it very clear that this is not an issue. That is a bad thing.

686
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,510
No, like if, if you want a 3D printer, you,

687
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,319
you probably want to pay attention to this guy.

688
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,520
You know, if you,

689
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:36,920
-- I could 3D print
-- beta.

690
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,119
Well, for example, you know, uh, pushing the copyright enforcement

691
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,170
onto the hardware level of 3D printers.

692
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,920
For example, like if you want your 3D printer to print what you want it to print,

693
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,780
yeah, you probably need to pay attention to this kind of stuff.

694
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,280
Right?

695
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,640
And, and I mean, that's, I think that's part of it is,

696
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,260
there's going to be a lot of really crazy things that start happening

697
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,430
in the world because technology, you know,

698
00:29:58,439 --> 00:30:01,260
-- like software is eating the world
-- start happening.

699
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,099
-- Like,
-- well, have you not been here for the last few years?

700
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:09,199
Right. If only I had a podcast documenting my thoughts and opinions

701
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,739
in the last two years.

702
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,790
But, but no, I mean, for real,

703
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,439
I think we need someone who has this sort of technology acumen and I think

704
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,670
it's also helpful that look,

705
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,729
this guy knows people,

706
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:22,359
right?

707
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:24,829
That's part of it. This isn't one of those.

708
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,079
Oh, you know, please,

709
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:29,150
please find a security person to talk to about some of this stuff.

710
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,160
No, like this dude knows people, right?

711
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,420
-- Like he doesn't have to
-- ask well, he knows the right people.

712
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:38,760
Right. Right. Exactly. He, he's going to know what's up, which is,

713
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,040
it, has me so excited to think we could have a technologist running for president.

714
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,550
Well, and I'm also guessing that his BS detector,

715
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,510
especially when it comes to technology.

716
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,030
Very well tuned. Oh, unquestionably.

717
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,270
That's something I see as,

718
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
like I've worked for people with good BS detectors

719
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,189
and I've worked for people with bad BS detectors and

720
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,780
there's a reason some of these companies get into so much trouble because they,

721
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,209
they don't,

722
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:00,579
they just write.

723
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,180
Yeah.

724
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,329
-- So much synergy. It's everywhere.
-- Yeah.

725
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,020
Yeah.

726
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,140
That the Rhinos thing. Holy cow.

727
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,180
When I read about it, I'm like, that can't be true.

728
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,479
-- Yeah, it turns out it wasn't,
-- uh, fill us in, help us out. What was

729
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:12,630
it?

730
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:12,650
Uh,

731
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,650
so it was supposed to be like we take a drop

732
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,479
of your blood and we can detect all the diseases,

733
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:18,500
like, in minutes.

734
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:22,619
And I was like, I'm pretty sure that's not how that works. That, I mean, at some point.

735
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,329
Yes, definitely in the future Star Trek. Yeah. Absolutely

736
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:28,219
not. Not this week.

737
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,270
You know, not today.

738
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:33,130
Sadly. And, but they claim to have results and I'm like, that seems really dodgy.

739
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,630
Well, they have results. They just aren't good results.

740
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,560
Well, no, they were all fake.

741
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:40,030
-- Right. Of course,
-- they were, they were doing the classical blood test.

742
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,439
Of course, they were all fake, like,

743
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:44,089
just fire out that random number generator and spit something out.

744
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:45,260
-- It'll be fine.
-- Three.

745
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:46,099
Um,

746
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,989
so, and, and I think that's, again, that's one of these things with,

747
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,079
not just that he has like technical knowledge that's out of date, but he,

748
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:54,380
he understands how these things work.

749
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,569
He understands

750
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:57,719
-- that we
-- actually, you know what's funny?

751
00:31:57,729 --> 00:32:01,150
Here's what I love and I think we've, we've, we're assuming

752
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,359
Beto understands all this stuff. We don't know.

753
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,520
But however, I will say

754
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:10,160
if you were smart enough to get into the CDC back in the day,

755
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,319
you almost certainly know what's up.

756
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,959
-- You,
-- you had to because for him to fake it for that long.

757
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,020
No, you can't fake it with those people.

758
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,020
And that's an important thing to understand is, is that,

759
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,660
is a culture of people that you,

760
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,900
you might be able to trick them once but you will not trick them twice.

761
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,119
Unquestionably if you were in and you stayed in, you were legit. Yeah.

762
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,760
No, to trick them over a long period of time. No, that's

763
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,739
because I remember what happened when some people were

764
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,829
found out to not even be faking but like,

765
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,709
fake one thing.

766
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:39,420
And I mean, that

767
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:42,020
most of these communities were pretty merciless

768
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:43,979
-- about,
-- it was completely merciless.

769
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:46,699
You got one chance and if you screwed up you were done.

770
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,750
-- I mean, that's how it was.
-- Yeah.

771
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,010
No, if you broke the rules or the unwritten rules, yeah, you were out,

772
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:53,869
you were ostracized and, yep.

773
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:57,469
Yeah. No, they were, they were pretty strict about their meritocracies

774
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:00,380
to a point. That was actually quite unhealthy in many cases.

775
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,130
But, um,

776
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:05,380
well, you know, still to this day anyways. But, uh,

777
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,880
no, I think, I,

778
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:09,489
I think people like this are what we need because

779
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,479
part of what I'm seeing is politics in the world.

780
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:17,050
It's an interconnected, complicated system, much like computer networks.

781
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,550
You know, you can't just twiddle some knob a little bit

782
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:23,010
because, you know, you, you accidentally blew up Africa or, like,

783
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,209
got like just something horrible happens five minutes later,

784
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:27,119
you know,

785
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:29,209
like the,

786
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:33,130
the world just is so crazy, complicated now that

787
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:36,540
you, you really do need to have a level of expertise

788
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:37,880
and

789
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,810
other people to help you

790
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,849
and be willing to accept that help

791
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,439
to make good decisions.

792
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,849
-- And that's something that i it sounds like he has, which gives me some hope,
-- right?

793
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,329
I, I'm excited and, and I think it's,

794
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:55,050
it's time to wrap this one up and I know I guarantee this topic is going to come up again

795
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,410
without question. I'm just, I'm super excited about this. And so

796
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:04,219
it's, I mean, this is one of those situations that just, I guess let's wait and see.

797
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,010
But at the same time, if, if you're listening,

798
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:11,958
make sure the people that, you know, who, who wouldn't listen to this podcast.

799
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,188
I first of all, tell them to listen.

800
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,379
But then secondly,

801
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:16,379
that's a joke. Please don't make them.

802
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,350
Uh But secondly,

803
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,918
is this is an opportunity for us to talk about

804
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,659
them and make sure they understand what this means.

805
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:21,929
Like

806
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:22,610
Beto

807
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,020
o'rourke is not a bad person and, and the things he did when he was young

808
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,659
are actually a benefit to us as a society today,

809
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:31,559
right?

810
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,858
That is the important message we need to make sure we convey.

811
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:37,279
And so I would encourage everyone listening,

812
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:41,779
talk to the people who aren't technology savvy about all

813
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,748
of this and make sure they understand what it means because

814
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,678
there are going to be people who try to use this against

815
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:48,188
Bedo

816
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,638
and let's make sure they are

817
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,370
sad that they did.

818
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,570
Awesome.

819
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,050
