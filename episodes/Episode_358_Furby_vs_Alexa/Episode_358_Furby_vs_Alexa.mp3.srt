Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:11,630
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in about a quarter century of it work.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,439
-- Josh Bresser.
-- Has it been a quarter of a century?

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,370
Probably 2000

4
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:17,950
ish.

5
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:22,739
-- It's 20 three.
-- I mean, I started when I was 17 and then

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,020
that's

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:23,629
true

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,809
when I was,

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,829
when I was like 20 or 19, I guess

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,940
my first it job,

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,110
I was tech support at a local ISP back in the dialect days I was in high school.

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,330
Like if you're getting paid to do it,

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,669
I would have been

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,750
probably 95 or 96. Like it was a long time ago, man.

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,889
So also a quarter century old now is the furby,

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:47,569
right?

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,060
We're not going to be talking about the source code,

18
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,930
which apparently they actually released the source code.

19
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:51,610
And it's like, well,

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,330
you sent me the source code and I freaking spent like an hour looking through it.

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,529
-- We're talking about that source,
-- but something better.

22
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,759
I'm going to read you an article from the CBS from 1999

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,040
talking toy or spy in terms of sheer numbers.

24
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,300
Furbies present a significant force more than

25
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:08,019
2 million of the fuzzy owl like creatures

26
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:10,194
have infiltration in American homes with incessant

27
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:12,665
chattering that delights Children and aggravates adults.

28
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:16,105
But you won't find a single furby here at the National security agency reports.

29
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:19,644
CBS news correspondent. Bob Orr. Oh, my God. How old is that guy now?

30
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,915
Holy cow. That's a name from, well, forever. Anyways,

31
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:24,644
uh, the US, it's like Dan rather. Right.

32
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:27,394
The guy's still alive and being snarky on Twitter. It's awesome.

33
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,525
Like I remember my first, my formative childhood memories

34
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,404
are Dan rather in the CBS evening news,

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,819
you know. And anyways,

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,160
uh the US satellite intelligence operation has banned furby in essence,

37
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:41,169
accusing the toy of being a Chinese manufactured spy,

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,050
a secret stealing bugging device capable

39
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,180
of eavesdropping on sensitive conversation.

40
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,239
So pause for a moment. How many listening devices are around you right now?

41
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:52,900
-- So like your, your watch your phone, your ipad.
-- I'm in a small studio.

42
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,540
So all I have is my phone in my pocket.

43
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,339
Normally in my house,

44
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:58,669
I have an Alexa

45
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,150
on each floor that I yell at to turn lights on and off.

46
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,430
And that's the thing that gets me is in 25 years we've gone from, oh my God,

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,330
it's like this thing that's dangerous and the NSA must ban it too.

48
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:08,830
It's just

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,509
-- now the default. We, we
-- haven't at all though.

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,229
Look at the conversations about banning tiktok.

51
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,009
It's literally the same conversation. Oh, the Chinese are spying on us.

52
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,070
-- But the
-- hardware that it's running on is in everybody's pocket.

53
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,449
I mean, I, right. Absolutely. And that's made in China, almost certainly.

54
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,979
Man, there's so much, I think fundamentally the NSA

55
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:30,949
doesn't have

56
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,100
Alexa. Right.

57
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,639
I'm, I can't prove that,

58
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:37,300
but I'm comfortable saying that and I don't think anyone would be like, oh, yes,

59
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:37,940
they do.

60
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:38,509
I

61
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,470
mean, but for example, do they ban Apple watches on site?

62
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,389
I don't know the answer to that

63
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,750
and it would

64
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,100
shock me if they don't have some sort

65
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,380
of device policy depending upon where they're at.

66
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:53,059
Because like there's obviously a skiff which I never remember

67
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,630
-- what skif stands for but
-- secure compartmentalized information facility.

68
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,289
Thank you.

69
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,500
And I'm certain you're not bringing Apple watches

70
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,289
and phones and things into a skiff.

71
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,380
-- Yeah, but
-- where do you put them if you're

72
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,949
not? They have the little lockers.

73
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,630
-- No,
-- but a skiff could be like a temporary thing.

74
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:10,979
Like they have those tents, they have, you know, it could be a closet, it could be,

75
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,820
well, like an entire, I think the one in date,

76
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,660
there's like one in Utah that's like an entire data center because this is the

77
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,979
thing that always gets me is like like a good example is my kids' school,

78
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,179
right?

79
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,979
Like they, every kid has a cell phone full stop. That's just the default now.

80
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,979
And so they have like those shower curtain pocket hangers on the inside of the door,

81
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,240
you know, the clear plastic pouches to put their phones in,

82
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,100
which is a really good solution because you can see that your phone is there.

83
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,949
It's easy to find. It's, you know, nobody can, like, swipe it easily.

84
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,419
But, you know, when you start talking about, like, let me put it this way,

85
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:39,500
how comfortable would you be leaving your phone in?

86
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,470
-- Not your pocket? I
-- mean, it depends on the situation.

87
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,729
Like I've been to facilities where I had to put my phone in the little locker,

88
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,869
but there's also a gentleman with guns at the door.

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,570
So I'm comfortable enough with that.

90
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,729
But I mean, when I go to the gym, I put my phone in a locker and it gets a lot.

91
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,860
Actually, I don't, I carry my phone and listen to music on it.

92
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:57,979
I would, I

93
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:58,240
would,

94
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,440
if, if I, if I was going to do something that didn't require my phone at the gym, like,

95
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,850
swim, actually, I used to swim a lot

96
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,240
and I don't anymore for just because it's cold and I'm old,

97
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,210
but I used to swim a lot and I would leave my phone in the locker at the gym and that,

98
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,119
that didn't bother me at all.

99
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,019
It had a lock on it. I controlled the lock and that was great. I, I had no issue with it.

100
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,048
Like, would I put my phone in a little hanger on the backside of the door? Like,

101
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:25,703
well, but this is in a classroom? Where you've got like, 30 kids and a teacher.

102
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:28,763
-- And, you know,
-- so my concern with that is,

103
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,763
I would worry someone would accidentally take my phone.

104
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:34,213
I wouldn't worry about malicious intent. Right.

105
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,773
But now would I go to your house,

106
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,072
set my phone on your counter and then use

107
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,852
the toilet without bringing my phone with me?

108
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,173
-- Absolutely not.
-- What about at your parents' place?

109
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,322
No, no, I trust them even less.

110
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,825
But see, this is what I'm talking about. It's just this, we've gone from 25 years ago.

111
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:51,946
Oh my God, this, this is a real concern too.

112
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:54,615
Well, I mean, yeah, we know tiktok is spying on us.

113
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,455
It's been banned by one or two countries and

114
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:58,425
we're the US is even talking about banning it.

115
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:01,906
Like I said, the hardware, it runs on the fact that like on my desk,

116
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:05,376
I have the Google thing of a jigger but with the microphone turned off,

117
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:07,055
I have an Amazon Alexa in the other room.

118
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,605
I have, well, hey Siri,

119
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,679
of course, it doesn't work this one time.

120
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,859
It goes off all the time when we're just talking.

121
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,359
It made a weird noise and oh, it says there's an update available.

122
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:16,839
Odd.

123
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,279
Anyways. Um

124
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,630
wait, there's an I OS update. Ok.

125
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:25,059
Anyways, well, on that ipad, apparently anyways, but it's like jaywalking.

126
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,500
Jaywalking was a coin, a term coined by the car industry

127
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,670
to essentially like de

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,760
normalize people walking on streets because streets

129
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:34,420
used to be for people and horse carts

130
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,869
and then cars came along

131
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,250
and the car industry wanted to like den

132
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,640
normalize people on the street and make it for cars.

133
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:44,950
And so it's j it's not crossing the street, it's jaywalking.

134
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,619
You know, they're strutting across the street like they own it like those

135
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:47,950
people,

136
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:51,619
Jay. So Adam ruins everything. Adam Adam Conover

137
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,899
does, he does a lot of debunking stuff.

138
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,450
There's a show called, he had a show called Adam Ruins Everything and he did,

139
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,510
I don't know if it was a whole show or a segment

140
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,440
on jaywalking and I'll put it on the show notes. But apparently a Jay

141
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:05,459
was a derogatory term for like a hillbilly.

142
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,790
And so they, they basically used it as a way to be like, oh, you live in the city?

143
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:12,040
You don't cross the street where you're not supposed to,

144
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:15,470
you're smart and intelligent, you know, not like those out of towners.

145
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:16,670
-- It didn't
-- work in Europe.

146
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,589
My goodness. Like, good for them.

147
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,429
This, this whole thing, we've just super normalized.

148
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,029
Things like roads are for cars and

149
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,709
crappy sidewalks. If there are even sidewalks are for people.

150
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,750
Just this whole furby thing amazes me because, well, yeah,

151
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,109
we've gone 100 and 80 degrees, the opposite direction

152
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:35,674
-- and the thing is we can't go back.
-- All right.

153
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,184
I want, I want to clear up a couple of things.

154
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:40,274
So, first of all, I spent a lot of time looking at furby source code.

155
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,154
So we're going to talk about it for a minute.

156
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:45,714
I do not see any obvious Chinese backdoors in the source code.

157
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:49,225
Not that, that means they couldn't have changed it before they burnt it.

158
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,540
I feel like if you're smart enough to put back doors in a furby,

159
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,609
you're smart enough to not publish them in the printed source code.

160
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:57,489
You think, you think?

161
00:06:57,929 --> 00:06:57,959
Well,

162
00:06:58,529 --> 00:06:58,679
though

163
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,540
the source code is very well written and very well commented,

164
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:04,019
it's actually quite a fun read.

165
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,519
-- You know what it
-- reminds me of the NASA Space shuttle stuff.

166
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:09,459
-- I've not looked at their source code. Well, because
-- it's not just like

167
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:13,220
the comments are not just the what but in many cases, the why

168
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,339
like Josh, why does the microphone turn off when the furby starts moving?

169
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,369
I didn't notice that electrical noise,

170
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,019
the electrical noise from the motors and crap

171
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,350
was triggering the microphone and the sound sensors.

172
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,299
So essentially when the furby starts moving, they're like,

173
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,079
well, we have to kill the microphone for a few seconds.

174
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,869
Otherwise it kind of gets the feedback. That

175
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,019
makes

176
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:32,399
sense,

177
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,739
but that those comments are in the source code, right?

178
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,700
It's not just like, oh, disable the microphone because the motor's moving.

179
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:41,540
-- It's like, no, no, why I
-- want to reel everything back.

180
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:45,269
So there's a sensationalist article about

181
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,850
the NSA not allowing Furbies because now Furbies did record audio from

182
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:53,799
their surroundings and would play them back at inopportune moments we'll say.

183
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,630
And, and here's a, here's an interesting thing.

184
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,920
It's important to kind of make a distinction between

185
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:00,130
what kind of recording and it wasn't like recording it

186
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,480
onto permanent long storage media because that just didn't exist

187
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:06,000
25 years ago in sufficient quantities in that toy.

188
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,940
Like, it's not like an iphone with,

189
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,769
-- I think iphones are up to two terabytes now or something stupid.
-- Right.

190
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,559
But the furby recorded little snippets and then

191
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,859
-- would mutate them and play them
-- back.

192
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,929
-- Yeah, recycle them and, and so
-- look,

193
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,670
I think your story is just your usual sensationalist.

194
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,489
Here's a new thing.

195
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,279
Let's find a way to make fun of it or something because negative, I mean,

196
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,010
this is like the social media story,

197
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,859
negative content elicits a response from people that positive content doesn't.

198
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:36,745
-- And I think that's just classic
-- true.

199
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:38,736
But in fairness, this is something entirely new.

200
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:41,416
-- Furbies
-- aren't interesting now because they were novel

201
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:43,705
when they came out and now anything can

202
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:46,885
record a couple of seconds of audio mangle it and spit it back out to you.

203
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:49,666
-- Like that's just not interesting.
-- Right. Sorry. There's also sorry.

204
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:51,015
There's just this one bit. I got to read.

205
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,226
That's not to say furbies don't present some threat.

206
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:57,046
The FAA has banned their use during takeoffs and landings.

207
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:58,596
I would worry that furbies like CD players

208
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,616
and laptops may interfere with the plane's instruments.

209
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,906
I feel like if that was ever true, we would have had planes just crashing

210
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:07,653
-- out of the sky.
-- It was never true. Everyone knew it wasn't true.

211
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:11,604
And the real reason they banned that stuff, I think Mythbusters did a thing on this

212
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:14,283
-- so you could evacuate the plane quickly.
-- Right.

213
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:16,333
It's because you don't want someone's laptop, like,

214
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:19,124
flying across the aisle and killing someone.

215
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,184
And I get that I'm comfortable with that.

216
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,004
Like, heavy things shouldn't be out during takeoff and landing because like,

217
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:27,104
99% of incidents happen during takeoff and landing.

218
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:30,044
Like that is common sense. I get that anyway.

219
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:30,684
Ok.

220
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:35,500
Now I want to address your question about we are surrounded by listening devices.

221
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,101
I think the situation we have is that we have

222
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,700
decided these new and novel things make our lives better

223
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,260
and you can obviously argue any which way you want.

224
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,241
Like I know for a fact that my Alexa spies on me because I will

225
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,330
talk about a thing and then start getting ads for the thing on Amazon,

226
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:56,440
like guaranteed that is what is happening.

227
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,310
However,

228
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:59,260
it is very convenient to me

229
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,140
that I am able to

230
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,979
yell at a device and my lights turn on

231
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,419
at 530 in the morning when I wake up

232
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,010
like

233
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,559
I am comfortable with that trade off.

234
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,070
Some people aren't and there's, there's nothing wrong with that, right?

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,809
This is just kind of that personal threat model of what do I care about. And

236
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,669
I

237
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,070
feel that the convenience of the Alexa

238
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,229
is outweighed by the 100% guaranteed spying being done on me.

239
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:27,429
-- Well,
-- and I think this is what one thing I find interesting is we're using words,

240
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,270
like recording and listening and they're very nebulous terms because I think

241
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,919
most people like myself included would be applying sort of humanistic

242
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,190
behaviors to it. Like what does listening mean?

243
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,150
And I think listening is an interesting word because it implies that something is

244
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,320
not only hearing the audio but like processing it and like understanding it right?

245
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,469
Because that's a big part of listening is actually understanding

246
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,349
the meaning of it which in this case with the Alexa

247
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,830
and most everything is means it's shipping it up to the mothership for processing,

248
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,830
you know, like what was it?

249
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,979
Oh yeah, those anchor you

250
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,070
cameras that are like, oh they don't use the cloud at all except well,

251
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,950
they do and they totally ship your images up to the cloud or,

252
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,070
or like Roombas apparently rba's taking video or pictures of people talking on

253
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,640
toilets. And I'm like, well, it's got a camera in it. So like

254
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,419
the doy like of course it's taking pictures of stuff and sending it to the room.

255
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:13,440
But I wanna say

256
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:17,570
even if I had a robot that was completely self-contained,

257
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,840
I don't want pets or robots or anything

258
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:24,159
observing me in the bathroom, no matter what I am doing.

259
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,919
My son's cat loves watching me go to the bathroom.

260
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,859
That would not. No, that doesn't work in my world.

261
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,809
I got over it because my other son would, like,

262
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,229
need tech support while I'm on the toilet.

263
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,229
And I'm like, fine,

264
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,809
you know, because, well, he's, you know, he needs help typing.

265
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:38,770
So

266
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,700
I just, I find it really curious how things that,

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,650
well, it's like that. What is it, the overton window? How things go from, like,

268
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,119
scary and weird to like,

269
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,000
like 50% of American households have one.

270
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,030
-- Yeah.
-- And we stop

271
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,190
and more importantly we even stop just talking or thinking about it.

272
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,619
-- Well, what's
-- the conversation you're honestly going to have? You know what I mean?

273
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,320
I think this is one of the things I think about a lot as,

274
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:09,090
especially as a security person is we love to make big to dos over

275
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:10,900
whatever the hype Du Jour

276
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:11,630
is. Right.

277
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,080
It could be some sort of vulnerability, it could be some programming language,

278
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,109
it could be some library.

279
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,030
Cloud, whatever.

280
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,229
I mean, remember a decade ago when security people were like, oh,

281
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,830
Cloud is someone else's computer

282
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,830
and like, there's still people who say that,

283
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,880
but it's definitely a lot less than it was.

284
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,109
You know what electricity is?

285
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,340
Someone else's generator,

286
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,299
you know what water is?

287
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:33,109
-- Somebody else's water plant like, yeah, that's how industrialization
-- works.

288
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,940
It is. It's commodity infrastructure.

289
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,349
You own a car,

290
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,989
go make replacement parts for it.

291
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,869
Your car is somebody else's supply chain. No, I'm serious.

292
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,289
You want cough syrup? You can't buy cough syrup.

293
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:47,445
Everything is somebody else's computer supply chain, whatever.

294
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:51,284
-- Like I can't, I can't make anything myself
-- part of existing in a modern society.

295
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:53,445
Like I don't grow my own food. Right.

296
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,315
That's why I'm not starving to death.

297
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:56,604
Right.

298
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,544
I'm a bad farmer

299
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,755
but I'm good at other things. So it's fine.

300
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:02,025
And,

301
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,900
but anyway, I, I think this is a place security.

302
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:12,219
People often could stand to step back and think and observe

303
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:15,840
because the behavior of people has never changed throughout history.

304
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:18,080
Right. There's always new thing comes out.

305
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,340
Some subset of the population complains about it and partially out of fear,

306
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:24,909
partially out of like it gets the clicks or the eyeballs or

307
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,739
you're looking for. Right.

308
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,320
And then you also have part of the population that embraces

309
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,309
-- it because it's interesting and new and fun for whatever
-- reason,

310
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,309
it might make their life better.

311
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,669
Like, you know, people who are paralyzed can now turn their lights off and on easily.

312
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,270
That's right.

313
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,400
Exactly. You

314
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,309
know, and so,

315
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:44,570
but security people, I think love to just pick up position and be like, I'm right,

316
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,469
you're wrong.

317
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,469
There's no discussion

318
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:47,599
and

319
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:52,409
I think we're getting better at that a little bit. I feel like 5 to 10 years ago,

320
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,330
security was much more rigid of like, you must do it our way.

321
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,130
Or else where I, I see,

322
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:03,250
I see people in organizations that are now saying things like this is the existing

323
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,169
universe, work in,

324
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,669
how do we help reduce risk in this world instead of saying

325
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,989
you have to do it our way and if you don't,

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,710
you're dumb

327
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,640
and we won't help you.

328
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,080
And then they're like, well, fine, I guess we're dumb and you won't help us and they

329
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,650
do it the way they want to.

330
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:16,030
Well, it's,

331
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,179
it's funny because I was having a similar conversation

332
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,979
about cloud versus on Prem and I'm like,

333
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,289
part of it is

334
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:26,190
on Prem. Used to be the only way to do it. Sure. There was no cloud 20 years ago. Like

335
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,679
there, there literally was nobody to outsource this to.

336
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,440
You had to go buy your own hardware and get your own network and figure it out.

337
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,520
But the world changed. Same thing with electricity. Like,

338
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,239
you know, go watch the original prisoner series from what is it?

339
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,000
1960 1970 anyway, somewhere in there.

340
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,359
And remember he takes the helicopter tour of the island and he's like,

341
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:47,419
we have our own running water and power and it's like, well, of course you do,

342
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,359
like you have a generator and like a, well,

343
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,729
if you have an island, you probably need that. Right.

344
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,549
But that's the point is like they're living

345
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,770
on an island running like this weird prison.

346
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,169
So they have to do it themselves.

347
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:00,250
Everybody else, you know, we phone Epcor and are like,

348
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,090
can you please turn the electricity on to my house?

349
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,330
Well, ok, so actually this is an interesting analogy because

350
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:08,919
there have been,

351
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,989
we'll say numerous catastrophic weather events

352
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,150
in North America so far this year. This is the very beginning.

353
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,080
Well, not this year but the, for the last six months,

354
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,469
we'll say this is the very beginning of 2023 when we're recording this.

355
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:22,950
And

356
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,659
I know people who didn't have electricity from the grid for more than a week.

357
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,619
And if they owned a generator, they were just fine.

358
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,099
And if they didn't, they basically packed up and left because you,

359
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:38,400
you can't survive without electricity in modern society.

360
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,659
That's just the reality of it.

361
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:42,380
And I think this is kind of one of those examples where you can say like, OK,

362
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,530
I'm going to completely outsource to the cloud.

363
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,659
You have no backup. And if the cloud goes down,

364
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,440
there's literally nothing you can do. You have to just sit there and do nothing.

365
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:54,080
One difference being is that for example,

366
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,020
Amazon Google and Microsoft are generally incentivized to run a good cloud.

367
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,150
Like you look at the Texas electricity grid

368
00:15:59,299 --> 00:15:59,830
and

369
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:00,640
yeah,

370
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,479
I'm sorry, I don't want to say the things I want to say about it,

371
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:07,409
but like I live in Canada in Edmonton specifically, it's interesting, for example,

372
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,750
Alberta actually overbuilt our electricity transmission infrastructure

373
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,869
a few years ago because they were,

374
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,080
they basically were projecting usage and got it wrong and good.

375
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,940
Well, it's not good because we basically spent a couple billion dollars.

376
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,000
We didn't need to spend,

377
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,919
that could have been spent somewhere else doing something useful and good.

378
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:23,679
I mean, maybe so. That's the thing.

379
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,119
There's no, it's not like yay, we have extra electricity transmission potential.

380
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,919
Well, but we don't use it and it's a waste of money

381
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,729
and that money could have done some good somewhere else.

382
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,409
Once electric cars catch on, you'll be glad you have that. It's fine.

383
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,700
Well, but the thing is, I also live in a, I say, newer neighborhood,

384
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,849
it's a 19 eighties neighborhood and all the lines are underground.

385
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,469
And so I basically have zero power interruptions.

386
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:48,289
Like I made a conscious, I mean, I have UPSS for all my computers just for,

387
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,809
it's for power conditioning more than power outages though, to be clear.

388
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,880
But I, I very conscious, like I looked back in the day into getting like a gene

389
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,169
15 K, you know, natural gas powered, cut in, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah thing. No,

390
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,319
I, I have so few outages here. It's basically about one or two hours a year. Yeah.

391
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,900
And I'm, I'm in the same boat. I live in a city. I actually have overhead lines. Yeah.

392
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,400
-- But
-- if I lived in Texas I would buy one in a heartbeat

393
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,199
and, and I agree.

394
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,660
Or if I lived in the country because all of the people I know who

395
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,175
lost power for a significant amount of time are not living in the city.

396
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:19,584
Well,

397
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:23,425
the problem is because those are the people that get service fixes last because we

398
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:26,454
can fix this line and it'll fix it for 100 people in an apartment building.

399
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,324
Or

400
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:30,035
we can fix this line and it fixes it for one guy living on an

401
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:31,025
ebb.

402
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:35,604
I actually, the first house I ever owned was on this, like Power Island.

403
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:39,185
It was this block that had one power line connecting the block

404
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:41,895
to the grid and we lost power all the freaking time.

405
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:44,199
And yeah, it'd be like it, we lost power,

406
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:46,910
I think for like 36 hours one time because they were like, yeah,

407
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,489
there's six houses on this block.

408
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,209
Like we'll get to it when we get to it where, you know,

409
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,469
there's 10,000 people over there without power,

410
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:55,030
we're gonna go help them first and I get that like I get it.

411
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,829
I did not miss leaving that house

412
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,650
because

413
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,910
we lost power a lot. But anyway, anyway. All right. All right.

414
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,150
I wanna, I wanna reel it back all the way to what we were talking about, which is furby

415
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:10,645
and new and novel devices kind of entering

416
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:12,765
our sphere of life

417
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,785
and how people react to those things.

418
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,984
And I think we can,

419
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:20,635
there's the security angle that we obviously have discussed and how new and

420
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:23,265
different things sometimes and how we have to adapt to what we have.

421
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:26,084
And I think the fundamental message I have around all of

422
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:28,925
that is just the fact that it is very important,

423
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:30,334
I think to look at

424
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,175
how things are

425
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:35,885
and start there instead of saying this is how things should be.

426
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:36,435
Right.

427
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:38,959
Well, and more to the point there's

428
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,290
obviously some sort of business case or need

429
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,270
or reason for this technology to take off.

430
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,689
Like

431
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:47,579
I remember mainframe people complaining about TCP/IP, like, oh,

432
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:48,560
you can't really control it.

433
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:51,459
Like anybody can, like, anybody from the internet can connect to your system.

434
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:52,410
Well, yeah, that's,

435
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,380
that's the whole point of the internet is anything on

436
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,589
the internet can connect to anything on the internet.

437
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,310
-- And, well, it turns out that was actually really good
-- Ethernet versus Token Room.

438
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,770
Remember all that? Like, oh, how can you possibly use this type of network? Like its

439
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,050
over at 80%?

440
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,699
Well, yeah, it 100% like

441
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,660
I ran, you know, the hubs that, like, you hit that 80% utilization and

442
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,650
the Ethernet just poops itself.

443
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,319
-- And then we got switches
-- even before switches, it was just so easy.

444
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:21,020
Everyone used it like there was no contest

445
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:24,589
and if you unplugged the cable it affected one system, not the whole bloody 10,

446
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,540
2 network,

447
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,599
you know.

448
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,089
Oh, yes. Yes.

449
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:33,800
I remember stories of people that were at universities

450
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,479
where there were like long runs and people would unplug

451
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,099
the, the computer, like,

452
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:41,150
on one far end of the building and no one knew what

453
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,089
was going on and all of a sudden the token ring failed

454
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,839
and they're like running around the whole building trying

455
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:48,079
to figure out what got unplugged and where?

456
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,910
Well, 10 base two, right? You had a long, essentially coax

457
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:54,880
cable. But with T connectors and if any T connector got unplugged, it broke.

458
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,459
If any, if either of the end caps got unplugged, it broke.

459
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,650
If the cable got punctured

460
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:03,209
and grounded slightly, it broke like it just

461
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,300
a lot of, and then it broke.

462
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,229
I know. Oh, man, anyone who talks about the good old days of networking is a moron.

463
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:10,839
Like it was

464
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:13,859
what gets me is they were so awesome at the time.

465
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,040
Like I remember when I first deployed 10 megabits

466
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,469
at my parents' house and I had my two,

467
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,300
our three computers all networked up and like had an NFS going and it was awesome

468
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,290
and then,

469
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,989
you know, got a 10 megabit per second cable modem and like,

470
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:27,829
yeah, compared to dial up, that was amazing,

471
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,829
you know, 10 megabits symmetric.

472
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,939
So I, I do like the old days in the sense of like

473
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:36,819
it was progress and we've come even further since

474
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,020
I don't want to go back to them

475
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,819
to be clear. But it was like,

476
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,510
it was good to learn that.

477
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:43,780
Like I'm,

478
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,390
I'm glad I know kind of how web servers and stuff work at a very fundamental level.

479
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,520
Whereas most modern people don't because they just use a platform

480
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,540
as a service and it mostly works until it doesn't.

481
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,060
And then they're kind of up, you know, then they, they're like Kurt

482
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,160
and I'm like, oh, let me go figure out what's going on. It's DNS. It's always DNS.

483
00:20:58,209 --> 00:20:58,280
It's,

484
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,349
it's always DNS.

485
00:20:59,550 --> 00:20:59,579
I

486
00:20:59,729 --> 00:20:59,750
know,

487
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:01,040
but that's ok.

488
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,660
You know, that's something I catch myself doing

489
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,530
on a regular. So I was, I help with that high school robotics

490
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,890
and we have our own, like,

491
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,619
mini network where we have all kinds of devices hooked up to and we communicate with

492
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,540
the robot and all that kind of stuff and it stops working the other day.

493
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,650
And one of the kids is like, it's not working. What do I do?

494
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:18,410
And

495
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:21,219
no, no, no, that wasn't the first step.

496
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:24,520
The first step was I said, all right, let's, let's figure this out.

497
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,040
I'm going to teach you some things ping this IP. And let's see. Can we get here?

498
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,530
Can we ssh into that like,

499
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,760
yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we did a little bit of stuff and at the end we just

500
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,140
it off turned it back on because

501
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:35,380
that was,

502
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,520
that was literally what needed to be done because the machine

503
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,229
we were trying to connect to was unresponsive and was headless.

504
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:43,219
So like we had no choice but to turn it off.

505
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:46,479
-- But at the same time it was like,
-- but now, you know, it's the machine, not the network.

506
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:49,199
-- That's right.
-- That's right. And it was, it was amusing because

507
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,150
at the same time they're like, how do you know all this stuff because, like,

508
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,329
I know all the private IP space and it's like,

509
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,660
be thankful you don't need it.

510
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,989
You know, it's funny because I had

511
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,119
same problem on my true net scale box where I set it up by default,

512
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,670
set up a VM and the VM can't talk to the host, which I needed to, to

513
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,880
NFS mounted directory.

514
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,750
And I'm like the heck so the VM can ping my gateway and it can reach the internet,

515
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:14,109
but it can't ping the underlying host. I'm like, what the heck.

516
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,359
So I a quick Google and it's like, yeah, it's a known problem.

517
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:19,430
You got to set up a bridge network. And I'm like, oh, and I didn't even have to read the

518
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,119
like how to set up a bridge network because you and

519
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,180
I are old enough to remember how to do that,

520
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:24,449
right.

521
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:25,239
So I set up the bridge

522
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,310
work reboot. I broke it, set up the ridge network correctly the next time reboot.

523
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,380
And yeah, it just works.

524
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,199
But on all these poor people on the internet that like, you know,

525
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:35,319
we're struggling to get it to work.

526
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,170
So it's well like the cloud flare in the mail channel thing.

527
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,079
I actually wrote a document from start to finish on how to get it working,

528
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:44,520
pulling documentation from three or four sources together.

529
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,420
And that's that again,

530
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,650
that's a problem is this documentation is always out there somewhere on how

531
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,520
to fix it but it's not necessarily like from A to Z,

532
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:54,030
you know, in a complete set, like,

533
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:57,530
you know, and it's funny because the mail channels person was like, oh, can we,

534
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,510
can we use your documentation like, yeah, sure.

535
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,560
Like it's, it's here and it's open source license. Like go for it like this.

536
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:05,609
Like I'm like I wrote it because future Kurt is going to have to,

537
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:06,020
you know,

538
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,849
rotate the DKIM keys in six months and he's not going to remember what the heck he did.

539
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:13,160
You know, I'm gonna have to look at that stupid open SSL command again.

540
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,199
-- Yeah,
-- you don't need to rotate those things. They're good forever. It's fine

541
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,760
until I check them into

542
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,239
github or do something stupid like that.

543
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:22,010
Yeah, I know. I know. I'm familiar with that problem

544
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,280
anyway. All right. All right. We're off in the weeds again.

545
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,599
So, but, but again, that kind of feeds into the whole, like,

546
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:29,944
we need a few masters mechanics because 99% of fixing your

547
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:32,155
car is plug in the OD BC reader and be like,

548
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:33,555
this piece needs to be replaced.

549
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,875
We replaced the piece. Your car works pretty much.

550
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:38,755
My son's computer had a problem in the power supply and I'm like,

551
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:39,954
what's like now that we fixed it?

552
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:42,354
What do we do? And he's like, uh, do we, like, you know,

553
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:45,064
take the power supply part and figure out what was wrong? And I'm like, why?

554
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,180
Like, what's the is there any value in that? And he's like, well, we know it's broken.

555
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:49,619
I'm like,

556
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,219
and is there any value in us knowing that he's like,

557
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,109
well, not really.

558
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,020
I'm like, yeah, like, maybe for the manufacturer,

559
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,459
if they had hundreds of these things failing

560
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:59,489
to find, if there's a, you know, a manufacturing flaw they can fix.

561
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,069
But for us it's like

562
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:02,939
we throw it away now it's e waste.

563
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:03,689
Like

564
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,030
we replaced it

565
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,449
and the old one gets thrown out.

566
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:08,449
-- Yeah,
-- I get that. I totally get that.

567
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,329
And probably there's people on our show listening

568
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:11,750
to it yelling at their computer right now.

569
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:11,959
Uh

570
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,260
Yeah, probably, probably. All right.

571
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,180
I wanna, I wanna end the show on one fun topic and that's,

572
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:19,979
this is what I expected us to discuss today,

573
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:21,469
which is what I actually keep prepared for,

574
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:22,069
which is

575
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,040
the archiving of stuff because like the source code,

576
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,969
Kurt sent me was the furby source code from 1998.

577
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:33,660
It was in a patent application and it got scanned and uploaded to archive.org.

578
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,119
It was in a patent application.

579
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:37,819
That's what it said in the You didn't even read it. Did you,

580
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:43,140
-- you sent me this crap and I spent hours reading it. So, you know,
-- I send

581
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,560
-- you
-- lots

582
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:46,300
of random links. I don't expect you to read all of it.

583
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,890
I read most of it but,

584
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,270
you know,

585
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,949
-- I
-- feel bad.

586
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:51,739
I feel bad too.

587
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:52,439
But

588
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:57,680
so anyway archive.org has all this cool source code.

589
00:24:57,689 --> 00:25:00,329
They've, they've archived, I guess that's what they do

590
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:00,680
and

591
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,339
imagine that.

592
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:03,010
But

593
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,219
it's something I was thinking about is when we, like, as security people,

594
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:10,739
I feel like we're constantly just running forwards where there's, you know,

595
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,189
new time

596
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:16,319
technology, new event, new, whatever and we rarely stop and look behind us.

597
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,550
And some of this archive stuff is really cool and really fun to look at

598
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,439
and not that I'm saying it has like enormous value to what we do.

599
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:24,589
I mean, you could make an argument of, oh,

600
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,560
you should archive all viruses or something

601
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,260
and whatever and maybe maybe you should,

602
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,900
maybe you shouldn't.

603
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,219
But

604
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,760
I do think it's amusing to look at some of this old

605
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,579
archived content to see kind of how things used to be.

606
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:37,520
Maybe in some ways you can see progress and

607
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,310
sometimes you could maybe claim it was better.

608
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,500
It probably wasn't, but

609
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,219
it's just, it's really fun to do.

610
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:45,670
You know, it, it really was enjoyable to just poke around in that archive.

611
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:49,800
Archiving data is a critical like think of the library of Alexandria,

612
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,119
like archiving human knowledge,

613
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,439
culture data information is really critical because

614
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:56,560
um

615
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,170
for example, like river flow data or temperature data might turn out to be very,

616
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,150
you know, important for figuring something out in the future and having

617
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,989
10 years of data versus 100 years of data versus 200 years of data.

618
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,209
That's a, that's a big difference,

619
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:10,780
you know,

620
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,060
I'll agree with that.

621
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:15,189
And especially now with digital storage being what it is and more importantly,

622
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,739
not just digital storage, but

623
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:20,489
like the ability to index and search it being well used to work for elastic.

624
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,699
So you kind of know about this. I'm familiar with it.

625
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:25,099
It's all like, again, it's a,

626
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:29,900
it's available and achievable and costs in a way that 20 years ago we couldn't have,

627
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,099
it just wasn't possible.

628
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:31,750
Yeah.

629
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,339
Oh Yeah.

630
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:36,979
And, and now there is one thing I was thinking about in this context and that is

631
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,800
archiving

632
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:41,489
asset inventories over time

633
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:46,010
where the example being when something like log for shell comes out

634
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,930
and you have to say, have I ever run log for J ever

635
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,560
in my infrastructure?

636
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,599
And

637
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,280
if you have the ability to go back, say five years by looking at, you know,

638
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,670
builds or materials or acid inventories or whatever you have and say like, oh,

639
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,270
we ran log for Jay in December of last year.

640
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:04,819
That has value, especially when, you know, like this is a time span.

641
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:08,000
We have to look at logs, we have to understand and if you

642
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:08,500
have log

643
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:12,609
for J deploy during whatever the time span is, you care about who cares?

644
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:15,310
You're good, you know, and that's something that can save a lot of time, which is,

645
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,010
which is awesome.

646
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,760
Yeah, I remember getting those questionnaires from, you know, various

647
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:22,150
companies saying, you know, does the CS A use log for J and what's your position on it?

648
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,689
I'm like, thanks. No, no, J

649
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,849
none at all. Like we got some ubiquity gear to update, but that's it.

650
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:27,380
Yeah.

651
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,170
Well, I mean, the,

652
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,530
the circle C I thing that just happened actually

653
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,380
kind of comes to mind because we had to,

654
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,670
obviously at work we rotated all our credentials.

655
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,810
Great. We rotated the credentials. Now, I have to go

656
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:40,630
through logs and artifacts to make sure nothing was touched.

657
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,349
And it's like I, I get that,

658
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,560
but at the same time I knew exactly what I had

659
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:47,589
to look at and that saved me enormous time versus saying,

660
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,469
I don't know exactly what was using this.

661
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:54,400
-- So now I have to go and spend like weeks looking through logs instead
-- of

662
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:58,910
basically it, I mean, it's the difference between a library with a card catalog.

663
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,630
If anybody knows what that is still

664
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,270
-- there is one without a card catalog. Computers.
-- Now,

665
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,030
actually, where was it? I was that a library? So I'm a huge nerd.

666
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,670
Obviously, when I go to a new city, I go to the libraries. Libraries are amazing,

667
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,560
but

668
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,000
I never thought that you were a nerd.

669
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,000
That's fair.

670
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,520
But I love going to the library. It's like it's one of my favorite things

671
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:18,420
and I was just at one,

672
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,010
I don't remember what city I was in and they still had the old

673
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,859
wooden card catalogs and I went and opened the drawer and I'm like,

674
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,319
holy cow.

675
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,449
There's cards in here

676
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,699
and then I was like,

677
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,890
I should, I wanted to go talk to the librarians about it.

678
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,199
I'm like, no, they're probably busy.

679
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,250
They have, I'm sure they would have talked to me for hours. But,

680
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:35,459
like, part of me was wondering, like, do they keep it updated?

681
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:38,560
Is it just like a historical artifact now in the library? Like,

682
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:39,839
it was amazing.

683
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,739
That's one of my favorite practical effects is

684
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,989
the card catalog scene from the first Ghostbusters

685
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:46,910
with the cards shooting out of the catalog.

686
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,810
-- Like, it's just such a great practical effect and it's so effective.
-- That's

687
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,219
true. That was really good.

688
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,380
That was, I forgot about that. I haven't watched Ghostbusters in a long time.

689
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,900
-- As
-- far as I'm concerned, there's only two Ghostbusters films.

690
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,900
-- Sorry,
-- I haven't seen the new one even. I don't, again, I don't watch a lot of movies.

691
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,130
It doesn't make any sense.

692
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,469
That's fair. That, that's what I feel like for most movies. It's kind of like what?

693
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,819
00, you know what I did.

694
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,660
So, uh, just totally off on the side tangent,

695
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,839
which is fine because we don't ever have whatever.

696
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:15,989
So I was playing the original Lego Star Wars game because I set up Steam

697
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,939
Link to my downstairs computer so I could play it in all this stuff.

698
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:19,199
Right.

699
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,329
And I'm playing it

700
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,729
and I'm playing episodes 12 and three and I'm like, oh,

701
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,560
these are kind of crappy episodes and then I

702
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,400
play episodes 45 and six and that's where,

703
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,579
that, that game stops there.

704
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:31,449
And I thought, you know what, just like it jogs some memories and stuff and I'm like,

705
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:33,599
episode 78 and nine were like,

706
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,180
they're really bad.

707
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:38,780
Like, when I think episodes 12 and three aren't that bad in comparison.

708
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:39,449
I know some

709
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,890
-- made a huge mistake because those movies are terrible and, and 78 and nine,
-- I, I,

710
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:46,469
I'll be honest, I haven't even seen them.

711
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,439
-- Don't just,
-- I

712
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,239
can't be

713
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,459
-- bothered.
-- Did you watch the Matrix movies? Matrix 12 and three.

714
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:52,170
When they came out back

715
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,479
in the day?

716
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:54,079
One was amazing.

717
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,869
Two was pretty ok.

718
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,260
It

719
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,910
-- wasn't.
-- And then, well, no, the V FX and stuff were cool

720
00:29:59,189 --> 00:29:59,599
and then three

721
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:03,160
and then the plot just fell apart and it was like, well, I saw that one coming and like

722
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:08,170
I remember walking out of Matrix Two and I turned to the people I was with and I said,

723
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,199
I feel like I've been robbed, like I paid money for this,

724
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,729
but then I walked out of three and I turned to the same people.

725
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:17,160
I was like, this makes two seem not so bad, doesn't it?

726
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,640
I don't know.

727
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,739
I just,

728
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,060
I, I feel like it's this curse of like we made a successful film now make me one.

729
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:27,160
That's exactly the same, but just different enough to get people back in theaters.

730
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,369
I mean, yes, that's always been the case of countless

731
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,109
just movie

732
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:38,640
trilogies or whatever. Like this is something I watched a show about Star Wars,

733
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,939
episode 655, return of the Jedi

734
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,339
and actually not return of the Jedi Empire strikes back.

735
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:45,770
And this was one of the concerns the studio

736
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,660
had is they said like Sequels never do well.

737
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,420
This movie is probably going to flop and

738
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,020
it didn't obviously because it was a masterpiece,

739
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,339
but

740
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,939
everyone expected it to fail because it was a sequel. Like this is not a new problem.

741
00:30:57,949 --> 00:31:01,900
This has always been a problem in movies. It's just we feel like it's new

742
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:04,579
because there are a lot of Sequels right now.

743
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:07,000
But anyway. All right, we're far enough in the weeds.

744
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,189
I think we should just call this one.

745
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,890
Anyway, I'll, I'll put, I'll put the furby source code in the show notes.

746
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,189
