Hello and welcome to the open source Security

1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,149
podcast episode 100 and 12 with myself,

2
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,869
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,680
Josh Bresser.

4
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,109
-- How you
-- doing, man?

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,819
I am doing quite excellent. Actually,

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,709
my kids start school next week.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,309
-- That's awesome. Good deal.
-- We survived summer.

8
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:21,690
I know.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,989
Oh, my goodness, teachers are so teachers are so underpaid. That's all I have to say.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,290
I,

11
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:29,229
yes. Anyway, I,

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,540
you know what it feels like sometimes is

13
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:32,598
it, it,

14
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,118
it's like when you're the security guy trying to

15
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,319
wrangle like all the developers who are like,

16
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,069
security is dumb and we don't like you.

17
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:42,298
That's what I imagine being a teacher must be like, except

18
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:45,798
all the time, not just for like, two hours every now and then.

19
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:46,418
Well,

20
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:47,999
plus you have their parents yelling at you

21
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:49,719
every time you do something that annoys them.

22
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,929
-- Right.
-- Which actually, no, that's exactly like the security people. Right.

23
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:56,679
The managers of the devs yell at us. Like, why are you going to mess with my schedule?

24
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:58,458
Why do we have to fix this CV E?

25
00:00:59,098 --> 00:00:59,839
That's right.

26
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,660
Oh, it's nice to know every industry is exactly the same,

27
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,730
including teaching

28
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,050
Oh, man. All right, cool.

29
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,349
So, I, I think this time let's lead off with,

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,489
uh Google has made a hardware security key.

31
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,550
I found out kind of like a UI

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,639
key competitor.

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,169
Well, it's, it does the U two F. Right.

34
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,470
So, yeah, I mean, it basically implements the U two F standard,

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,139
but my understanding was is that it had like an internal,

36
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:28,110
sort of like,

37
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,930
I don't know what to call it, not a secure boot process,

38
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,339
but it essentially it had like some internal magic to make

39
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:36,279
sure it wasn't being like fiddled with or tampered with.

40
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:39,639
Ok. II, I don't know a ton about what's going on inside of it.

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,110
-- Here
-- we
-- go.

42
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,949
They are built with a hardware chip that includes firmware

43
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,959
engineered by Google to verify the integrity of the key.

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,040
My understanding of that and from what little reading I did is that the key is,

45
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:52,889
I guess we would go with tamper resistant,

46
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,360
which I mean, that's, that's,

47
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,209
you know, well, we always say in security, right?

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,730
Oh, well, if the attacker has physical access, it's game over.

49
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:04,040
Well, no, no, that, that is not always allowed like, well, great example,

50
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,059
being nuclear weapons, right?

51
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:06,629
It can't be like, oh, well, he stole the nuke,

52
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,929
I guess he gets to do whatever he wants with it, right? Uh What can we do?

53
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,009
-- Well, I mean, if you have a nuclear weapon,
-- so the good news is

54
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,190
you can probably do what you want.

55
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,429
No, they're, they're surprisingly difficult to set off.

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,669
And so my understanding is the US ones, you know,

57
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:26,589
they have the permissive active link code, which was set to of course,

58
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,309
six zeros back in the day.

59
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,820
But they basically, if you enter the pal incorrectly several times,

60
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,029
it basically like locks itself and won't fire, you know, because

61
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:38,250
yeah, just because the nuke falls into the wrong hands,

62
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,979
you don't want them using it on.

63
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,360
Well, whatever, right? But uh no.

64
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:46,059
So that's because my understanding of the U two F key is essentially that

65
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,460
basically if somebody hits me in the head with a brick and please don't do this.

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,845
I I would not like that and takes my UB key, they can just use it

67
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:55,414
-- because all they got to do is plug it into a computer and touch
-- it

68
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:57,145
pretty much right?

69
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,505
From what I know of the Google

70
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,824
Titan key. That would still be the case, right?

71
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:03,164
It's, it's literally, you touch it,

72
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:04,654
it doesn't have a fingerprint reader or anything.

73
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,304
It's just like something touched me.

74
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,460
So it works.

75
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:10,279
But I guess what this internal firmware thing

76
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:13,660
would help or would accomplish is I guess theoretically

77
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,029
if you have like a really high stakes situation,

78
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,259
like, oh, I don't know, maybe you have working for Google and you,

79
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,380
you have access to their internal C A by internal, I mean, their public one.

80
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,320
Like you have access to the internal systems that control it or,

81
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:30,600
you know, you have access to the DNS controlling google.com.

82
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:32,339
You know,

83
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,320
they don't want somebody messing with that token and giving it back to the admin,

84
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:36,570
right?

85
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,759
So they like, steal it from the admin's key ring while he's sleeping and, you know,

86
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,490
modified in some way to like, you know, allow them to,

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,330
to siphon the key or whatever off.

88
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:47,270
Right. Because let's face it. Right. Google.

89
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:51,039
Google has access to some, well,

90
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,029
stuff that basically runs the internet at this point.

91
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,809
-- Well, imagine if you got access to the chrome update stuff, I,
-- I guess so.

92
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,149
Here's my, my thought on this is

93
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,440
I, I think there's value

94
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,979
in having any piece of hardware do some sort of verification on itself.

95
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,509
Well, even just preventing like silly weirdness, right? Like ECCRM like, oh a cos

96
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,850
and gray hit me. So I'm not going to,

97
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,039
-- yeah,
-- that's probably more important.

98
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,640
And that's fair.

99
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,720
I guess the golden goose of,

100
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:25,359
-- of U two F keys is the private key stored internally
-- or doing proxy attacks, right?

101
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:25,630
Uh

102
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,920
No, no, no. But if you fiddle with the key, they would

103
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:30,690
in the sense of if I can

104
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,619
for the sake of argument,

105
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,940
I steal your Titan key and I am

106
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,679
somehow embed like another chip that's wi fi controlled

107
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,140
that I can remotely trigger the the button press.

108
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,220
OK? No, look, if, if you're at that level of infiltration of this key

109
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,899
like,

110
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,200
yeah. No, you're, you're a state

111
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:49,549
level,

112
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,950
you already have so much control over it.

113
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,420
But theoretically we can,

114
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:56,149
we're getting to the point where we can build hardware devices that are

115
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,100
very resistant to that form of attack.

116
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,410
Yeah, it's, it's getting there and, but here's so, so here's,

117
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,440
here's the point is that the primary competitor here is probably ubico,

118
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,540
-- right? With UBI keys. Which,
-- well,

119
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:13,220
honestly, is there anybody else making U two of keys?

120
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,410
Because like, I, I looked a long time ago and there wasn't,

121
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:19,209
there are a couple I've seen they were all really bad and I

122
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,709
don't even know if the Google Titan Key is going to be good.

123
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,329
Like, the reason I love the UI

124
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,989
key stuff is because I can run it over with my car and it still works.

125
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:32,309
And I've owned, I've owned a handful of other things in the past that were,

126
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:35,880
they were not well built. I, I bought it was called a crypto key.

127
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,450
-- Maybe I forget what it was.
-- Oh, yeah. The, the crypto nitro key guys.

128
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,670
The GP G key.

129
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,869
Yeah, the German GP G key guys.

130
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,179
Yes. It was like their very first

131
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:48,375
and I ended up like wrapping the whole

132
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:50,265
thing in electrical tape because it kept falling

133
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:50,665
apart.

134
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:52,614
Not

135
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:53,225
at

136
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,475
-- scale to be reliable is, is tricky.
-- It's more than that though.

137
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:00,135
There's, there's building at scale, right. Which let's face it.

138
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,975
Like you can find factories in China that do that. No problem.

139
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:05,135
But the bigger problem becomes

140
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,959
where is the key provisioned?

141
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,890
Because there's essentially a private key on these things. And now, yo

142
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:15,220
is really, they're very transparent about the fact that yes,

143
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,829
the UBI keys are built in the United States and Sweden

144
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:21,750
and then they're provisioned only after

145
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,540
Uki

146
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,350
Yo receives them and before they send them out.

147
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,450
So there's still a possibility that Yo

148
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,739
is, is storing the private keys because in fact,

149
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,540
I think Gemalto got caught like storing private keys once.

150
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,920
Uh wasn't that also? RS A?

151
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:41,350
It's probably everybody, right? It's probably everybody.

152
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,670
-- Well,
-- it's like diesel emissions.

153
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:46,589
-- Oh my God, they were caught cheating on their diesel emissions.
-- Who knew?

154
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,519
I had no idea. Right? Like where you're slowly shuffling the paper under the desk,

155
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:55,160
you know, the whole industry all of a sudden managed to fix diesel emissions.

156
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,869
And I'm like, ok, that's,

157
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,359
you know, they don't all have the same

158
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,320
technology but I

159
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,779
guess

160
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,670
good job everybody.

161
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,850
Uh Well, anyway, and so the issue, I guess with Google right now is Google is saying

162
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,850
they're not talking about this very much.

163
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,829
So, the assumption is they're probably coming from the factory provisioned.

164
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,829
-- Does Google ever talk about anything?
-- No, they never do.

165
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:16,359
Uh So here's the thing though,

166
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,989
people are concerned that maybe like if the factory is nefarious,

167
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,850
the factory could like, save the keys,

168
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:25,820
they're dumping into them and then Google might

169
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:27,989
not know if they did or didn't do something

170
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:31,690
well, see and that would be part of the firmware self check if the firmware,

171
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,230
for example,

172
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:36,730
validates that the chip can only create the key and it can't be imported.

173
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,769
You know, because that's one thing, right?

174
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,880
There's, there's a lot of hardware security tokens

175
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,790
where the key is generated somewhere and then imported to the token.

176
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,619
So for example, like a a lot of hardware security modules for, you know,

177
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,149
certificate authorities support that mode of operation because

178
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,809
you want that because you actually want to generate a key somewhere

179
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,209
and back it up and then put it on a hardware security module

180
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,899
and the hardware security modules is like,

181
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,950
you can't copy that off me. Ha ha ha.

182
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,660
You know, and that's a very valid thing to have.

183
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,739
And for something like, you know, like a UB key though

184
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,059
there is

185
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,260
probably a lot of value

186
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,049
in the UB key, basically being able to essentially attest that

187
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,709
there's a key on me. But I generated,

188
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,339
it was not imported

189
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,390
in any way, shape or form. Right? It was generated on me.

190
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,679
You,

191
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,130
oh, no, it's, that's an incredibly difficult magical thing to do,

192
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,049
right?

193
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:26,549
No, no.

194
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,640
Yeah.

195
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,239
Oh, I get it.

196
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,070
I get it.

197
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,869
And that's part of the problem, right too is, yeah,

198
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,010
like I generated a key using what is the source of randomness, ah, you know,

199
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,369
stuff like your dice roll three,

200
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,619
the number three. Exactly.

201
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:42,508
Yeah,

202
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,499
I was on the side.

203
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,718
I always love when you're like, with a kid, you're like,

204
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:48,348
guess a random number between one and 10 and then you're like

205
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:52,169
seven and the kids, like, how do you know? And I'm like, everybody picks seven.

206
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:57,408
-- so
-- actually it's funny you say that we were, we were watching a show on TV.

207
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,729
I was watching with my kids where a mentalist

208
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,059
was doing his thing and they're like, how does he do this?

209
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:04,765
And I said he made them pick that and they, he said how

210
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:09,265
he knows things like he knows how to make you do things you don't want to do. You're,

211
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,145
you're an irrational bag of meat. You don't get to beg.

212
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:15,025
But anyway, anyway, so I guess here's,

213
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:19,234
here's my overall take on this Google hardware key thing is

214
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,304
maybe the factory

215
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:23,304
has been compromised,

216
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:24,905
it's conceivable,

217
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:25,614
but

218
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:30,590
there's so many hardware devices around now that could all be compromised.

219
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,619
-- I feel like complaining about this
-- one blunt,

220
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,039
I'm

221
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:35,289
trying

222
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:39,299
to think of anything electronic that I own that doesn't have a made in China on it.

223
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:42,010
There's nothing seriously

224
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,989
and, and not just not just that Kurt, not even like,

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,489
like ignoring the potential political

226
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:48,200
implications

227
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,070
or not something

228
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,159
in

229
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,919
it are probably made in China.

230
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,609
But, but even more than that, the company you bought it from,

231
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,770
almost certainly contracted with, with a third party supplier, right?

232
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,489
Like

233
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,840
nobody builds anything.

234
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,650
Well, the NSA was doing those interceptions and hardware modifications,

235
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:09,169
remember?

236
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,369
Right. It's just,

237
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,760
it doesn't even matter where it's built anymore.

238
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,599
Nobody actually builds their own stuff because they just can't.

239
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:20,700
And so I think.

240
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,239
Right. Right.

241
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,630
And there's, there's certainly value in being concerned over your supply chain.

242
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,349
But I have a feeling that picking on

243
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:31,200
Google in this particular instance is probably not

244
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,359
helpful or wise.

245
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:33,859
Well,

246
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:38,289
I think this is a perfect example of security people basically doing that classic.

247
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:40,289
Oh, it's not perfect. It's trash, right?

248
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:42,320
Because how often do security people do that? Where?

249
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:44,609
Oh well, there is this hypothetical attack.

250
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:48,880
Like if the owner of the company is compromised and

251
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:53,049
somebody holds his family hostage, you could subvert them and

252
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,479
you know, like, well, what do you want?

253
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,349
You want like a bunch of like people with no families to run this company

254
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:00,809
and you want this company to be like

255
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,799
living in a plexiglass building in the middle of like Manhattan

256
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:05,809
where everybody can see what they're doing or something like,

257
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:06,780
-- you know,
-- no,

258
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,599
no.

259
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:07,919
What,

260
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:13,200
-- what we do is we complain incessantly about unrealistic scenarios and
-- to be fair,

261
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,320
Google is

262
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,599
trying to do things better,

263
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,270
right? Like as far as I know my UBQ is just like her

264
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,349
dip whatever. Yo.

265
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,559
And that's honestly pretty fine.

266
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,750
Like I it would suck if my UB key was

267
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,059
somehow compromised and could be remotely used or finagled because

268
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,900
well, that would definitely mess me up and you know,

269
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,609
the C class care lines who I work for

270
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,710
but fundamentally is that likely to happen? No, not really.

271
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,929
Now Google as a victim, you know, is a bit of a juicier target.

272
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,979
You know, you, you subvert the chrome updater and Voila,

273
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:45,340
you got everybody's computer.

274
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,440
But there, the thing also that gets me is like,

275
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,299
like you said, you know what I said about, you know,

276
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,739
having a device that's like I generated the key securely and it only lives on me.

277
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:55,109
Yes,

278
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,799
we're not there yet.

279
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:01,580
We're getting there and there's some implementations of that that are pretty good.

280
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,659
They're also pretty expensive.

281
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,859
And that's the other thing to keep in mind. Right. These UBI

282
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:06,239
cos

283
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,840
well, like they retail, they're not cheap like the UB keys.

284
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:12,659
I know the ones I buy are like they, I think they retail for about 50 bucks us.

285
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,380
Which, yeah, it's kind of pricey but

286
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:16,609
which is the same price.

287
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,409
And when you consider what a hardware security module costs,

288
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,960
those things are like tens of thousands of dollars.

289
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,369
And here's the best part.

290
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,669
They're typically like basically a Raspberry Pi running Linux sitting in epoxy,

291
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:31,000
you know,

292
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,659
like straight up like you and I could be

293
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,210
building them and all we'd literally have to do is

294
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:39,130
yeah, literally go to Home Depot, buy some like non conductive epoxy

295
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:40,520
voila,

296
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,349
you know J and Khs MS.

297
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,940
Right.

298
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,750
Yeah. Well, ok.

299
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,950
Yes and no, I mean, technically, yes,

300
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,270
but these things are also certified by various agencies.

301
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,840
So they have like, some, some standard,

302
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,960
some of them are, some of them are not,

303
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,000
I've actually found HS MS that are not certified and I'm kind of like, wait, what?

304
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,119
Yeah. Don't buy that.

305
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,559
-- Don't buy that. That's going to be a huge turn.
-- You know what the sad thing is?

306
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,570
It's probably about as good as the certified one.

307
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,349
But, yeah, the certified one at least, you know, is this tall to get on the ride?

308
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:14,539
Right. And, and they have certain internal

309
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:15,969
as well

310
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,090
is, is what's very important.

311
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,429
Yeah, like IO 9000, they, they, it may not be good processes,

312
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,729
but at least they're documented.

313
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,500
Right. Exactly.

314
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,609
So.

315
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:29,520
Right. I, I guess the next one on my list is struts.

316
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:30,729
-- Well,
-- and

317
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,010
the

318
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:31,690
news.

319
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:32,739
-- Yeah,
-- it's,

320
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,210
so,

321
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:34,340
here's the thing I love about struts

322
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,840
is fundamentally struts is the kind of technology

323
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,450
that

324
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,130
number one, it's, it's a broken piece of poop because it's

325
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,369
just the way it was built and the time it was built

326
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,969
it's a broken piece of poop.

327
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,919
And number two,

328
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,780
the kind of people that build stuff using struts

329
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:51,650
are just inherently up the creek without a paddle because

330
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,979
we should tell people what struts is because I bet there's a

331
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:57,729
lot of people who actually don't know because let's face it.

332
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,500
Struts is freaking old man.

333
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,260
I was gonna

334
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:04,219
say, if they're lucky enough to have never programmed in Java, then God bless you.

335
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:06,349
You're in a better place than some of us

336
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,580
and we just lost half the audience.

337
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,780
But basically, yeah,

338
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,030
struts is what happens when you take a Java app and you need to put it on the web.

339
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,570
Plus somebody designed this 20 years ago

340
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,549
-- and built it 20 years.
-- It was like brand new.

341
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,659
I mean, so OK, so for people who don't know like we should let,

342
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:25,859
let's give history lesson right old man, old man story time.

343
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:27,260
So

344
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,690
way, way back in the day

345
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,849
you had a web server

346
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,299
and you needed to do stuff and it was called CG I,

347
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,200
which I don't even remember what CG I something

348
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:38,510
Tommy

349
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:39,299
gateway interface.

350
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:45,679
And like I remember writing, I had a job like I was actually paid to write CG I in CC.

351
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:49,559
It was the job security was phenomenal.

352
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,679
Yeah. When I saw what

353
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,059
people were

354
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:51,359
doing,

355
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,409
-- I actually preferred Pearl.
-- It's, it's quite bad. Uh Pearl is well funny enough.

356
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,280
So we started in C and then kind of pearl came along and Pearl suck too,

357
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,440
but it was better than C

358
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,130
and then

359
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:04,890
it did.

360
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,669
And then John was kind of a thing and Java was fairly new and people were like,

361
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,549
I want to do this web stuff with Java

362
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:15,119
and so kind of struts and Tom can and that whole ecosystem came of it.

363
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,030
And struts gave you the ability to basically build like web applications in Java,

364
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,609
which was essentially impossible before that because there was just like,

365
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,309
no way to connect Java

366
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,849
-- to a web server because,
-- oh,

367
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,669
there were ways I saw some of them. It was, it was pretty horrific.

368
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,070
Well, you couldn't do like CG I though, right?

369
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,260
Because like Java took too long to start up. And the reason CG I worked

370
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,270
is CG, I would essentially like, it would start a process,

371
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,929
handed a bunch of stuff and then just dump whatever

372
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,280
came from the CG I script back to the user,

373
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:46,549
right?

374
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,780
And Java took, you know, 10 to 20 seconds to start, which was totally unreasonable.

375
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,919
And now Java takes 30 seconds to a minute to start.

376
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,929
Well, that's how we ended up with the three layer cake.

377
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,609
Remember when we had the web layer, the application layer and the database layer

378
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,219
with Java in the middle, I mean, and that was kind of the result of that is, yeah,

379
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,140
because you had to have these Java things

380
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,989
running all the time because yeah, otherwise it would literally take

381
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:12,130
20 to 30 seconds to service a web request

382
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,830
which even back in the nineties was unreasonable.

383
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,789
Yeah. In fact, I remember, I mean,

384
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,590
I had another gig. I did some, some contracting work one time where it was a website

385
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:26,229
that took three minutes to load and they wanted it under one minute.

386
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,809
I was like, well, at least they're not a

387
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,659
real high here

388
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,809
under like 60 seconds for, wow,

389
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:33,400
it was terrible.

390
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,210
And this was back when web browsers would, would load,

391
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:39,489
is that something like we want a list of everybody in the US who has a cat

392
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,320
because that would be a reasonable,

393
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,590
that would be reasonable.

394
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,200
Uh The issue was they were loading lots of things off of remote servers

395
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,479
and like ads, it was mostly ads.

396
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:55,750
And the issue being that back then web browsers would basically load

397
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,869
in all of the html and display the page at the end.

398
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,890
So there was no like lazy loading.

399
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,618
Like I love now how I go to click a link and then an ad takes its place and

400
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,689
I click the ad and then I see ads for some ridiculous product for the next six months.

401
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,319
But anyway, anyway, right. So struts, that is what struts does. OK?

402
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,689
So, so struts is very old

403
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:17,939
and let's face it, it comes

404
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,930
from a time when moving fast wasn't a thing.

405
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,280
Well, part of the problem is it's not just very old in the sense of its old code,

406
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,189
it's old culture and old ideas.

407
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:32,270
And I think that's the, that is the crux of the problem with struts.

408
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:35,989
Well, that's the crux of two problems with struts. It's the same root cause.

409
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,290
But so you have a lot of security flaws in struts because for example,

410
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,510
it does its own serializing and deserializing of data

411
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,030
and very poorly. Quite often there's flaws in it.

412
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,329
And the second problem is by definition,

413
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,469
if you've built something that uses struts,

414
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,260
you can't fix or rebuild it

415
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:54,469
because it's all technology and it's got

416
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,739
20 years of business knowledge embedded in it

417
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,609
for you to do a rewrite in a new clean language

418
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,140
is going to be failure

419
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,949
expensive.

420
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,180
Well, but, but, so here's the bigger issue though.

421
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:07,250
There's a security issue in struts.

422
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,160
You're not gonna fix it in five minutes.

423
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,579
Right.

424
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,099
Because you're not struts isn't the sort

425
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:14,510
of technology you're doing continuous deployment with.

426
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,579
If you're running struts,

427
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:18,119
it probably takes you somewhere between 30 minutes

428
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,390
and a week to deploy a new version.

429
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:24,760
So the Struts app that I most dealt with, I'm not going to name names

430
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:26,625
to do a new version.

431
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,015
Well, not technically six months to do a new version,

432
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,755
but a minimum of 1 to 2 months to do a version,

433
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:36,925
but six months from like we need to do X to shipping X.

434
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:38,425
But, and, and that's just the problem,

435
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:40,555
right is that it literally was something that was

436
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:42,834
picked a long time ago and it works kind

437
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:46,704
and they're sort of, you know, like I said, if you pick struts,

438
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,020
it's one of those things.

439
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,630
It's like I,

440
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,109
oh I decided to build with concrete while you're kind of stuck with concrete.

441
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,030
That's just how that is, you know, such a fundamental design decision.

442
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,869
That's a good analogy for this actually.

443
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:04,390
Yeah, like you picked Java. Well, what else are you going to use?

444
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,030
-- No, like, seriously? What if it's not struts, what else would it be?
-- Right. Exactly.

445
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,739
You don't have a choice. For the most part.

446
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,550
I saw some Frankenstein Monsters back in the day to get Java Apps online

447
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,130
where they, they had like the three layer cake design and the, like the front end,

448
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,109
you know, this is before, like glass fish and Tom cat and,

449
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:22,949
yeah, I'm

450
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,420
ok. So for the glass fish was something that sun.com made.

451
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,829
Sun.com no longer exists. So it's ok if you don't know what I'm talking about,

452
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,790
they ceased to exist

453
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:33,589
the,

454
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,040
probably about 10 years ago

455
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,339
they were the dot

456
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:37,160
dot com

457
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,050
until, you know,

458
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,520
were,

459
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:40,530
yeah, they were

460
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,729
-- killed them. Right. Yeah.
-- Well, a lot of things killed them. Yeah, that's true.

461
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,979
You know, and then, uh, but yeah, so,

462
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,800
yeah, I mean, literally if you're going to build something in Java and,

463
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:57,650
and quite frankly, back in the day, if you had a large system that you needed to build,

464
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,550
especially when it involved more than one sort of

465
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,439
organization. So, you know, like a large company with,

466
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,349
say, marketing and sales and

467
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,199
whatever

468
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,150
Javis

469
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,400
was kind of your only option.

470
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:11,199
You know,

471
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:11,800
I,

472
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,579
I,

473
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,219
it's like, it's like, it's like we want to put something in orbit.

474
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:18,819
Well, you kind of have to learn how to build rockets and build complicated things.

475
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:20,880
That's just, there's no option. B

476
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:23,650
Right. Exactly.

477
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,640
You know,

478
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,729
and so, like, quite frankly, if you picked a Java

479
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,400
Yeah, really. The only way to get that thing online, realistically speaking

480
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,910
was once it existed and still is, is struts and I, I

481
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,489
don't know

482
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,920
of any other sort of framework or any

483
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,119
package that

484
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,319
basically gives you what struts gives you.

485
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:47,400
So,

486
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,719
yeah, like,

487
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,099
you know, we, we,

488
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,640
you know, we decided to build with concrete because, well,

489
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,079
we need to build a 50 story building.

490
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,760
Like, what else are we going to do?

491
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:02,050
Uh Right. And now, now here's, here's where we should build on. This analogy

492
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:02,819
is

493
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:08,550
when you build, say a bridge out of concrete and steel,

494
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,469
right?

495
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,790
It's going to need maintenance eventually and it's going to be difficult to,

496
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,060
to do anything with.

497
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:16,199
And the problem is

498
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,829
you can ignore it,

499
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,270
but eventually, like it becomes so bad,

500
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:23,579
you can't ignore it any longer.

501
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:24,189
And basically,

502
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,270
I think struts has reached the point where like

503
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,750
the technical debt and the issues it comes with like

504
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:32,079
the bridge is falling down. What are you going to do

505
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,670
-- is no plan
-- B, you basically gotta,

506
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,540
you gotta build a new bridge and quite frankly that a

507
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:40,520
lot of people don't have the budget for that

508
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,260
and, and nobody ever does.

509
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:48,640
However, if the bridge completely falls down, you don't have a choice. Right?

510
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,170
Well, the thing is, it's not like the bridge falls down and stays down, right?

511
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,750
Like, oh, you have a full on struts.

512
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Uh you can maybe put in some compensating

513
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,829
control like a mod security thing to filter it

514
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,079
or you can try and work around it. Like, I've seen people

515
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,689
do some, you know,

516
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:05,449
pretty horrendous stuff to work around struts because they have to,

517
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:08,130
because if they upgrade struts, the whole thing breaks for sure.

518
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:10,609
At that point

519
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,869
it's, the bridge isn't going to fall over with the struts flaw.

520
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,880
No, it's just every, like, six minutes a truck's gonna drive off the side of it.

521
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:21,530
And eventually people might get annoyed

522
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:24,250
that, that their truck fell off the bridge,

523
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,270
but no fundamental.

524
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,410
That's something I've come to terms with in the security industry is

525
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,689
there's a lot of stuff that just is not worth fixing.

526
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,020
Oh, totally, man.

527
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,709
Because quite frankly, you know, it's gonna, we're gonna lose like 20 grand a year.

528
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,829
No offense, but 20 grand is like

529
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,939
a month of a developer's time plus overhead plus opportunity cost.

530
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,795
And you are suggesting not fixing it is a better option.

531
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:52,035
I'm not suggesting not fixing it is a better option. I'm simply saying not fixing.

532
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:53,895
It might be a pretty rational option.

533
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:56,324
-- Uh
-- It, it very well could be, in fact, so I,

534
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,444
I was talking to someone the other day who was

535
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:00,094
there,

536
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:03,935
they had a small business that was basically compromised and they got whacked good

537
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:05,829
and they basically said, what do we do?

538
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,550
And I said, you either replace all your gear or you just say

539
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,680
I'll live with it,

540
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,790
you know, and you're probably,

541
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,439
or something more subtle.

542
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,949
Uh, it was,

543
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,599
it was all of the above

544
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,329
-- and my response would be not so much
-- tax,

545
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:20,530
replace all the gear, but

546
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,949
move it into the cloud, get somebody else to.

547
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:25,020
Right.

548
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,319
That's, that's also, that was one of my suggestions was like, honestly,

549
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:31,040
your best bet is to get in the cloud as much as you can.

550
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,530
And

551
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:34,069
because obviously they're like, oh, what can we do today?

552
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,160
I said, well, you can buy on your computer and they said, I don't,

553
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,969
we don't want to do that.

554
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:40,160
I said, well, then you don't really have another choice.

555
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:43,640
But I mean, totally, man, that's, that's exactly right. Is

556
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,520
sometimes

557
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,560
the, the risk is worth it

558
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:49,900
depending upon what the environment is.

559
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,569
And I think that's another thing, security is really bad at

560
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,119
how many times have companies screwed up and

561
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,040
lost our personal data and it's turned out,

562
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,800
ok, like Air Canada just lost 20,000

563
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,790
people's data bad.

564
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,750
Oh, wait, it's passport data. Oh, it's really bad.

565
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,359
But what am I going to do? Not fly?

566
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,979
-- You're not going
-- to do anything and, and not only that, it's too late,

567
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:12,089
the data is gone.

568
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,780
I mean, this is where some of the goals of GDPR I think are maybe laudable.

569
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,819
But, I mean, in all seriousness, like today in North America,

570
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:21,229
if a company loses your data.

571
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,300
Oh, well,

572
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,069
uh,

573
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,880
-- you,
-- you can't do

574
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,109
anything

575
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,449
with

576
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:25,780
consumer.

577
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:29,459
Right. Exactly. Like they don't care.

578
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,810
And as a consumer you can do very little.

579
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:32,339
And in fact,

580
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:36,069
as history has shown it basically doesn't affect the company negatively in

581
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,339
any way outside of maybe a stock dip for three months.

582
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,189
Right? Like,

583
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,829
that's just the way it is.

584
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:46,189
So if, if you're a company, like that's something to think about.

585
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:50,670
If we secure this, it's going to cost X, if we don't secure it, it's going to cost Y

586
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,510
the thing is no, no, no, it's even worse than that. If we don't secure it,

587
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,030
there's a chance it will cost zero

588
00:24:58,609 --> 00:24:59,959
and there is a chance

589
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,589
that it will cost more than zero.

590
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,369
And that number is variable.

591
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,150
So if you do security it has a set cost.

592
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:09,579
Yep.

593
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:09,979
Yep.

594
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,839
Well, not and, and actually it's worse than that.

595
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:16,150
If you do security, not only does it have a set cost, but there's an opportunity cost.

596
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,140
So for example, like I just, uh, so disclaimer, I,

597
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,680
I've been the director of it at the cloud security lines for over eight years now

598
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:26,459
and uh I'm going full time now and so I'm cleaning up a lot of our it

599
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:29,739
and I love it because I'm, I'm looking at stuff like, oh damn it, why,

600
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,300
why is this all messed up and like who?

601
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,479
Right. That was me. Right. Because we made this,

602
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:36,099
you know, like just whatever, whatever. Like,

603
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,010
you know, I, I've done things like run Fedora 14 in production for three years

604
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,099
and if you know anything about Fedora's life cycle, then

605
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,020
-- two
-- years too long.

606
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,959
Well, but we have cloud flare and mod security and some other stuff.

607
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:50,119
Filtering and, you know,

608
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,140
nothing bad at, like, literally nothing bad

609
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,130
-- happened.
-- Right. Exactly. Exactly.

610
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,310
And, you know, it's a public facing web server with no data, no sensitive data on it.

611
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:00,280
Right.

612
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,560
So, yeah, I'm, I'm willing to live with that and if it gets hacked fine,

613
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:05,290
I'll rebuild it on a fresh server.

614
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,369
You know, now we're up to date and everything's been updated within the last week.

615
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,000
And that's awesome.

616
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,780
But fundamentally,

617
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:16,569
you know, we've gotten lucky partly and part of it is I've done other things to,

618
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,329
you know, prevent these things,

619
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:20,540
right? There's other ways, you know, than just

620
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:25,040
because the reality is if you rely on having up to date software to be secure,

621
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:25,819
you're doomed

622
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,260
because

623
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,119
even if you play the patches within 10 seconds of the vendor releasing them,

624
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,089
there are still, I mean, for example, what was it?

625
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,880
Uh Wednesday, I want to say there was that thing on Twitter, the,

626
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,310
the zero day privilege escalation in windows

627
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,010
that somebody posted on Twitter

628
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:42,329
on github

629
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,000
link,

630
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:44,739
you know.

631
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,550
So if somebody also has a zero day that

632
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,439
lets them get into a less privileged Windows process,

633
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:51,479
well, now they're like, oh sweet.

634
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:53,520
Now I can escalate to, you know, the systems,

635
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:54,839
right? So

636
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:55,959
to be blunt,

637
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,400
relying on your software to be up to date to be completely secure.

638
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:01,489
It won't work,

639
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:05,650
but updating your software is, it's kind of like filling potholes. It's not

640
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,719
a lot of fun.

641
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,250
It's not very glamorous.

642
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:10,369
It does make the road nicer though.

643
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:10,709
Yeah.

644
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,329
II, I do agree.

645
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,290
You know, like it, it does make things

646
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,359
less worse.

647
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:19,000
I won't say it makes things better but it definitely makes things less worse.

648
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,849
Um, and a big part of updating software too is, you know,

649
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,800
can you update your software without,

650
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,050
without breaking the other software?

651
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,939
And that implies that you have some control and

652
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:29,530
visibility into what you're doing and you know,

653
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,130
what you're doing.

654
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:35,199
If you can't do that, then you're doomed. And that's the problem with struts.

655
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,599
You know, these people have struts and they're stuck with it and,

656
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,280
you know, they don't know that updating it is gonna break the app in some weird way

657
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,060
and it might,

658
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,430
it totally,

659
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,459
I remember.

660
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:47,949
Oh, yeah. Oh,

661
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
some of the, just,

662
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:49,660
well,

663
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,170
and part of the problem too is some of the changes

664
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,079
that need to happen to struts to fix these security issues properly

665
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,650
will so fundamentally break it.

666
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,989
They just, no,

667
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,339
yeah, it, it's got to go, I guess, I guess the advice becomes

668
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,219
if you're starting a new project,

669
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:05,170
don't use struts

670
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:05,890
if you,

671
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,530
yeah, that's fair.

672
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:08,969
That's fair.

673
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,010
-- We can't wait for the hay
-- mail. Like, use rails. Rails is at least,

674
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:16,619
-- you know,
-- dude, Ruby is like old and lame now too. Right.

675
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:19,560
But it's only old and lame this year.

676
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,020
-- That's true.
-- A decade

677
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,689
ago.

678
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,430
So, I, I guess

679
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:25,050
if you're running it,

680
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,060
good luck

681
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,329
and may the force be with you or, or something,

682
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,459
I think fundamentally if you're, if you're running it,

683
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:32,770
you're probably making money off of it.

684
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,449
So, you know

685
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:33,819
