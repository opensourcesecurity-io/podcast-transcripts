Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,329
Kurt Siefried and my partner in running old websites.

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,100
-- Josh Pressers
-- running old websites.

3
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:18,190
-- I don't understand that. Reference. Uh
-- breast.net is still a thing.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,430
-- It is
-- and it's very ugly because I host it out of an S3 bucket on Amazon.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,350
Yeah. It's one static website.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,600
I'm still very pleased with that website and I will keep

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,420
it forever because it's like an LS of slash proc.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,940
I think I should look.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,439
Yeah.

10
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:33,209
But

11
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:34,299
-- it's an old
-- website like that.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,115
-- I think your domains younger than mine. Mine is 98
-- uh, 2000

13
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,044
ish, maybe 2001,

14
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:42,415
2

15
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:43,174
1000.

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,034
Yeah. Yeah. Your domain is old enough to drink. So it's an old website.

17
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,205
I mean, it, it is. Yes,

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:49,634
it

19
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:52,645
is. I, I had a website back when that was not

20
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,104
easy to do.

21
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:55,715
I had

22
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:59,564
a, I had a closet like I had a closet with a rack

23
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:00,584
at a co

24
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:01,375
location

25
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,395
here in Edmonton

26
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,239
with seven systems to run

27
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:05,010
suri dot org.

28
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,040
So I don't remember how I ran it at first,

29
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,750
but I do remember when I worked at Progeny Linux systems.

30
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,550
One of the

31
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:15,750
benefits of working there is they gave you space in the server room

32
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,730
and they gave you a public IP.

33
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:20,620
And to be clear you're talking about physical space. Yeah.

34
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:26,300
No, I, I bought a computer. I brought it to work. I put it in the server room.

35
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:28,190
They plugged it into the internet

36
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,069
and now that server was just on the,

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,639
which now from a risk management perspective as a security person, this thought,

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,949
like, terrifies me to my bones.

39
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,849
But,

40
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:41,569
but back then, I mean, this would be 2003. Maybe.

41
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,879
-- What else would you do?
-- I mean,

42
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,690
and it was

43
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:45,385
like, you're a cool start up.

44
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:47,355
It's one of the ways you get Linux nerds to

45
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:50,285
come work for you is you give them a computer.

46
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:54,464
Well, you either do that or they, they shove machines in the machine room anyways.

47
00:01:54,474 --> 00:01:55,044
I mean,

48
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:59,125
maybe I didn't at the place I worked before that. I don't,

49
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,769
I can't for the life of me remember how I hosted my website though.

50
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,550
I probably knew someone with a shell somewhere.

51
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,470
That's generally how that worked because various

52
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,740
sins. Actually, it's funny you mentioned this.

53
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,850
-- Does
-- anybody
-- still pay for shell servers?

54
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,380
-- Probably.
-- I'm sure there

55
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:14,630
are,

56
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:15,889
you know what Irc Bos?

57
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:21,229
-- Sure.
-- Sure. There's, I'm sure there's reasons to do anyway. Anyway, we have a topic.

58
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,929
I'm, I'm itching to get to

59
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:26,250
-- because I've been trying to. Well, this is the
-- topic.

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:26,770
-- What
-- do you

61
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:27,839
-- mean,
-- this is the topic,

62
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,649
this is the hosting stuff, running stuff,

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,850
giving it away for free until it becomes so unbearably painful

64
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,000
that you give up. Be it a website, a

65
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,770
software project, open source,

66
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,210
-- a service.
-- Ok. First we need the Clickbait title which is Open source

67
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,679
dying.

68
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,110
-- And the answer is yes. Yes, it is. No.
-- The answer is no, no,

69
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,229
open source is fine.

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,919
Oh, open source is dying in the sense of your body is currently dying.

71
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:53,419
You're losing billions of cells every day.

72
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,979
-- That's
-- fine. Oh my goodness, don't anyway. OK.

73
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,779
I want to start,

74
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,410
why do I do this to myself?

75
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:07,600
I want to start by saying when I say the word open source,

76
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,720
I know there is the technical definition which is

77
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:14,360
the O SI list of open source licenses,

78
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:15,240
which I

79
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,960
am morally opposed to being the definition of open source.

80
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,500
And then there's the concept of like the open source community, like the people,

81
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,080
-- like
-- every fet of verse server,

82
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:26,639
right?

83
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,919
I would say counts as part of the open source community.

84
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:31,119
-- It's in the spirit,
-- I would agree with that.

85
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,119
It's in the spirit

86
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:35,261
-- of, of it.
-- That's right. I, and and I still, I, I

87
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:40,031
have complained many times in the past that I think the O SI has dropped the ball

88
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,522
-- on keeping up with reality. Well,
-- they don't do services, they don't do,

89
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,962
they do licenses like we've firmly moved on since

90
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,542
in the last decade.

91
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,841
Right. Exactly. OK. So is open source dying.

92
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:52,192
And the,

93
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:55,921
the thing that kind of kicked off this discussion is there is a video

94
00:03:55,932 --> 00:04:01,602
I will link to in the show notes where it's this 3D printer youtube person

95
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:05,444
that basically tried to create an argument, we'll say,

96
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,444
try saying that the future of 3D printing

97
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:12,774
progress is in patents because these 3D printer companies

98
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:15,203
can't make money on

99
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:18,973
their various open source stuff. Be it like

100
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,153
firmware

101
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,764
and you've got slicers and there's all this,

102
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:25,384
the whole kerfuffle about red out like people want stuff for free.

103
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:27,653
-- It's that simple. This is part
-- of the discussion.

104
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:31,084
People want stuff for free and to be clear, it's not

105
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:33,355
because they're like cheap or greedy,

106
00:04:33,365 --> 00:04:36,566
they want stuff for free because I can't get budget to buy stuff.

107
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:41,205
I can't, I'm a student in some country and even if I wanted to give you money,

108
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:42,585
I don't have a credit card

109
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,365
or even if I do have a credit card, it's gonna get flagged as fraud.

110
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:46,645
There's millions of reasons, but

111
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:48,485
here's where I want to.

112
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,466
And I, I think framing this in the context of 3D printing is especially Apt.

113
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:54,696
Yeah, because

114
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:58,246
if you look at kind of the history of 3D printing where

115
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,665
it started where it went and kind of where it's going,

116
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:01,540
it's,

117
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:05,519
I would say it's an act in three parts where in the early days it was literally

118
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:09,130
like weird open source printer nerds who were

119
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,510
building these things out of like random parts.

120
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,720
They were sharing instructions on the internet,

121
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,100
they were writing the software to make it work and it

122
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:18,059
had to be open source and you had to share it.

123
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,399
-- There was no other way to do this.
-- It's the same, it's the same story of UNIX.

124
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,869
Your choices were the weird open

125
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,420
source thing that barely works.

126
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:28,970
Or spending seven figures on an enterprise solution.

127
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,877
Well, no, I mean, it wasn't even 70 figures like 3D printing didn't exist.

128
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:36,078
That's what, that's what makes the 3D printing story so good.

129
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:38,477
So anyway, you've got like the 3D printer nerds, right?

130
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:40,477
And this is where things like rep rap came from

131
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:43,437
where this was like these people built the future.

132
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:47,917
Then you hit a point where you had companies starting to

133
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,157
kind of make and sell 3D printers and

134
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:54,928
they leveraged all of this prior work that was going on.

135
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,608
And now these companies have reached a point where they're whining and complaints

136
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,635
that they can't make as much money as they did.

137
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:05,615
And I think part of the reason is today, if you want to buy a 3d printer,

138
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:11,066
you can buy like a million clones, random printers for a fraction of the price of the,

139
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,976
like we'll say official version.

140
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:16,165
Yeah, I looked into it and I, I decided I was, if I was going to buy one,

141
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,835
I was gonna go kind of with a brand name one.

142
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:21,096
Not for the brand name, but for the ecosystem of having the 3d

143
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:24,985
parts to add on to it, the compatible parts, the, all that.

144
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:28,394
But I was looking at an all in price of like the printer,

145
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:33,273
about 20 different upgrades to it filament the whole thing about 1000 bucks.

146
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:37,753
Yes. And that, like, five years ago that wouldn't even get your foot in the door.

147
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:38,253
Right.

148
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,553
Right. Anyway, there's a third part to this act and this is where I think

149
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:46,354
the companies are crying foul because

150
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:50,174
they basically, their work is being ripped off and, and that is

151
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,614
not unheard of in industry. Right.

152
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:55,674
If you look at virtually every successful product on the planet,

153
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,032
there are clones and copies.

154
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:00,131
And so when you're the industry leader,

155
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,421
you need to innovate and you need to push the envelope.

156
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,282
But here's the thing,

157
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:07,701
the innovation in the 3D printing space is not coming from companies.

158
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:12,731
It's coming from the open source nerds doing the work. There is a project called

159
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:14,082
Voon. There are Voon

160
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:16,122
printers. You can't buy a Voon

161
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:17,682
printer because Voon

162
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:21,161
printers are an open source project where 3D printer,

163
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:25,171
people are basically creating the best 3D printers on the planet.

164
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,179
Actually, you can buy Vron

165
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,029
-- kits now. Well,
-- you can buy the kits from a company,

166
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,350
but like the instructions are open,

167
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:36,279
they even have programs where like as many of the parts as they can 3D print, they do.

168
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:39,049
And they, I think they call it the pay it forward program

169
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:43,269
where basically you ask another boron owner to print you the parts with

170
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,459
the promise of I will print parts for the next person in line.

171
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,019
So they kind of hermit crab their way up to moron printers.

172
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,320
-- But this
-- is what's always fascinated me about things like machine tools.

173
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,708
I need machine tools to build machines, tools.

174
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:56,298
And

175
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,567
how do you bootstrap your way up there?

176
00:07:58,627 --> 00:07:59,247
Well,

177
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:01,298
and the answer is in some cases you bootstrap your way

178
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:04,407
up there by starting with a sharp rock and a stick.

179
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,247
No, seriously, because that's how humanity did it. It is.

180
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:09,058
-- It is
-- except

181
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,108
I don't want to spend 5000 years doing this. I want it done in a week.

182
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:12,967
Right. Exactly.

183
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:13,368
There's,

184
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:17,727
there's a video I'll try to look up where they basically talk about the first lathe,

185
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:18,638
like, like

186
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:19,627
machinist lathe

187
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,638
and it's, it's somewhere in Paris now in a museum.

188
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:23,906
Like it's,

189
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:28,226
it's amazing to think like literally every single product we use today can

190
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:31,925
trace its origin back to that machine in a basement in Paris.

191
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:35,085
It's unbelievable. But anyway, you've got these voon

192
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:35,945
printers, right?

193
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:39,096
You've got these people doing this work and they're really pushing the envelope.

194
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:40,885
And so this has me thinking

195
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,786
in the context of open source because I think you can make the argument that

196
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:49,906
open source is dying. If you look at like the way Red Hat is acting, you look at the way

197
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:51,705
Google is acting, you look at the way

198
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,544
Microsoft is acting and I think

199
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:54,073
there are,

200
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,773
are definite signals from these companies that they're kind

201
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:59,283
of pulling themselves away from some of the,

202
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:01,763
like, more free and open universe.

203
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:05,664
Well, the challenge is like IOT is a good example.

204
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:10,443
I mean, if I build a really good light bulb and IIOT the design and the software, well,

205
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:12,004
somebody's going to go, ok, cool, thanks.

206
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:15,164
And they're going to go produce a million of them in China and sell them for

207
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,424
less money than I do because they don't have

208
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,213
those development costs and more to the point,

209
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:22,531
they don't care, they probably don't care about quality to the degree I do or about

210
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:25,581
-- other things. But
-- here, ok, here's, here's my point though. Right?

211
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,562
It's not about that.

212
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:28,971
It's about the fact that you look at something like open source or

213
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:34,932
3D printing the companies that basically made their way in the early days.

214
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:38,262
They have stopped innovating in new and interesting ways.

215
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:41,502
And I think a lot of open source is basically leaving them behind.

216
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:42,622
Same with 3D printing.

217
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:48,041
Like the companies that maybe were blazing the trails 1020 years ago. Who cares?

218
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,091
Like we don't need,

219
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:50,789
they never needed you.

220
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,390
You know,

221
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:55,640
that's kind of normal in the sense of like companies used to spend money on R and D

222
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,159
like Bell Laboratories.

223
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,409
They built entire buildings

224
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:02,400
and paid people obscene amounts of money to

225
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:04,960
futz around with computer, like

226
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,719
with vacuum tubes and this might be useful and while it turns out it was,

227
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:10,429
then the problem is, well, ok,

228
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,340
we don't want to take that risk because this isn't

229
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:15,109
a video game where if I plug in 7000 minerals,

230
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:15,650
I get,

231
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,229
you know, sharper claws for my little units.

232
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:19,697
Right. No, that's the thing. Right.

233
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,937
Scientific development doesn't work like Starcraft or Hearts of Iron Four where

234
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:24,857
you plug in the money and you get a better airframe out.

235
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:25,338
And so

236
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,398
companies try to reduce that risk by essentially saying, ok,

237
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:31,747
we're going to buy start ups like a start up will develop a new tech.

238
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,817
The gold standard for start ups used to be, oh, do you have any patents?

239
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,718
You have patents?

240
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:38,547
Now, we want to buy you. That's

241
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:39,098
true.

242
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:43,518
And, and that's literally they were outsourcing their R and D cost and risk by only

243
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:47,138
so they were paying more but only in theory, buying the winners

244
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:47,570
in

245
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,250
theory, right, in practice, we all know about synergy and how synergy works out.

246
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:54,520
So, and then it became a case of, oh, you know what,

247
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,729
it's really cheap just to buy these to

248
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,489
prevent this innovation from ever coming to market.

249
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,210
And it's also patented so tough, but we'll leave that alone.

250
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:00,919
So

251
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:01,440
the,

252
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,640
but the problem is there's that mentality of if I spend

253
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,669
all this money doing all this kind of research and development,

254
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,049
I may or may not benefit from it

255
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,219
and if it is good research and development that I

256
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,559
can benefit from and I give it away for free.

257
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,309
Like my business manager is going to look at me and slap me and say, don't do that.

258
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:16,840
I mean,

259
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:17,880
so, OK,

260
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:22,840
so you are correct. But I think here's the angle, I've been thinking of

261
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,520
a lot.

262
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:26,700
So when we take open source into account for this

263
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,539
in the open source universe,

264
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,489
there are things you can use and just use and you never

265
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,650
have to get back and there's things you have to give back,

266
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:33,780
right?

267
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,340
Like GP L two, GP L three type stuff. And

268
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,409
I know it's complicated,

269
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,960
it's complicated. Kurt, I'm not going to say

270
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:42,549
it.

271
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,469
But the point is

272
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,219
when,

273
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,150
when you've got people saying, oh,

274
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,710
we have to make money on this or we have to do this other thing,

275
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,530
-- but we do because I want to feed myself.
-- Yes,

276
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:55,940
I don't think you're wrong but I think

277
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,130
the, the

278
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:01,169
20 plus years of free money we had in the industry

279
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,320
has

280
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:07,070
made that conversation odd because a lot like a lot of start ups are,

281
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,710
are open sourcing, everything.

282
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,789
Red hat, open sourced everything.

283
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,549
There was a lot of it's not bad behavior but it was weird behavior in industry.

284
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,210
Let's draw some quick parallels.

285
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,750
One thing America did as a country

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,799
was violate the heck out of British patents.

287
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,219
I mean, we didn't like them at the time. So

288
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,580
-- and
-- so you basically just

289
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:32,549
took all their patents and filed them in the US patent office. Why is Hollywood as

290
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,229
an industry in Hollywood?

291
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,929
It's as far away as they could get from New Jersey and process servers.

292
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:39,969
So literally,

293
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:44,539
we have these giant industries that are built on top of essentially bad behavior,

294
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,630
violating patents, violating intellectual property agreements.

295
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,929
And

296
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,890
as much as I want to support the little

297
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,239
people coming up with new and innovative stuff.

298
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,489
At the same time,

299
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:59,515
it might be better for society if we don't let them patented and we don't let

300
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:03,835
them kind of own it and control it and force them to or give them the,

301
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:05,094
some sort of force

302
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:06,135
to control it.

303
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:08,544
And you know, say here's what you can and cannot do with it,

304
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,755
license wise or whatever process wise and let everybody

305
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,184
just have a free for all

306
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:17,534
the flip side being. And this is what really frustrates me. If there is value,

307
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,159
then chances are companies and organizations will come in to try and capture

308
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,400
that value to do rent seeking behavior to do all these bad things.

309
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:24,559
I've talked about this a lot, but

310
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,559
the problem is if there's a ton of value there.

311
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:29,469
Well, ok, we'll take the moral high ground and not do that.

312
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:34,190
-- Cool, but our competitor
-- does. I don't know if that's a reasonable argument.

313
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:37,130
-- I think people bring that up a lot.
-- Look

314
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:40,330
at, look at how Canada is set up now, we have four cell phone companies,

315
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,880
all with basically identical pricing, same with the banks, same with,

316
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,020
we have all these

317
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:45,479
Oligopoly

318
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,679
systems in Canada, for example, where we don't.

319
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,280
Yeah, I mean, if you don't do it, your competitors do

320
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:54,070
the thing is you can take the high ground and be like,

321
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,520
maybe this kind of weird little kind of custom bespoke boutique boutique, sorry.

322
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,419
Um, company that isn't too worried about, you know, making $10 billion

323
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,429
and, and you can do that, right?

324
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,179
Like there's a ton of local restaurants, for example,

325
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,400
that will never have more than one location.

326
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,840
Cool. Great. Like

327
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,309
the problem is

328
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:17,729
especially like with the 3D printers, for example, is the majority of consumers.

329
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,340
And well, for example,

330
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,369
remember on the fed Averse people were talking about this open source

331
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,650
and making their choices based on open source or not open source.

332
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:26,469
-- Yeah, the majority of consumers don't even know what open source is.
-- No.

333
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:29,609
And, and that's ok. I I'm comfortable with that.

334
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,080
They're going to buy the cheapest printer,

335
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,880
right? They don't care,

336
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,830
they, they want to buy the cheapest printer.

337
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,890
But I think this is where this concept of innovation

338
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,909
is part of the discussion, right?

339
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,090
And this is if you're doing the same thing for too long,

340
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,489
anyone can copy what you're doing.

341
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,770
And I think in the world of like open source based businesses,

342
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,229
it can be copied even faster.

343
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,250
Well, and something to remember too. Is

344
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,630
your customers may or may not want innovation?

345
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,770
Like a perfect example is we worked at Red Hat.

346
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,270
Red Hat very explicitly sold a version of

347
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:03,885
that was for people who did

348
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:08,025
not want rapid change. They wanted 10 to 13 years of support.

349
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,875
-- So the stuff would just work
-- there, there is that,

350
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:14,375
but that's not how capitalism works because capitalism

351
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:18,815
demands constant growth and exponential growth generally speaking.

352
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,294
And so if a company like Red Hat isn't growing,

353
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,820
they're going to be viewed as dying even if they're doing fine.

354
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,619
And then you end up with things like layoffs

355
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,809
and weird decisions about how you're distributing your product.

356
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,460
You know,

357
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:34,020
so,

358
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,539
and back to 3D printers though,

359
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:40,059
the problem is if I buy a 3D printer and they decide to stop innovating or being nice,

360
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:41,330
well, they have my money.

361
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:43,025
You have the printer though,

362
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:43,905
like,

363
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,585
but it might be a dead end,

364
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:46,104
right?

365
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:49,664
I was looking at this one printer that you apparently can only use their filament.

366
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:50,625
And I was like, nope,

367
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:53,184
there's like none of those left because, yeah,

368
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:57,025
some people tried to do that and shockingly it didn't go very well.

369
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:57,094
I

370
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,234
looked at it and I'm like,

371
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,575
I'm not like

372
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,380
this is why I own the laser printer. I own.

373
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:08,099
It's because I can buy the, the, the toner cartridges from Costco

374
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:08,950
and

375
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,030
there's instructions.

376
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,739
There's a good little youtube video about how to rip the chip out

377
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,859
with a pair of pliers and put it in the new one.

378
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:18,200
And so my printer is constantly complaining

379
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,940
about low toner because it's printed like

380
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,080
75 million

381
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,669
pages.

382
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,780
It's been printing for like three years on the same toner cartridge.

383
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:26,979
It's doing pretty good,

384
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:27,940
you know.

385
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:31,099
And so every time I hit print it warns me about low toner and I'm like, uh huh.

386
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,760
Oh, yeah.

387
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:34,989
And I actually have to pay attention to the print out because one day it

388
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,890
will actually run out of toner and I'll have to swap in another toner cartridge.

389
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:40,789
Uh, I think I'm on my third one now.

390
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,353
Nice. So,

391
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,393
but that's the thing with this, with this

392
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:49,033
part of it is also like customers making informed buying decisions. Remember?

393
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,492
Oh, remember the internet of things?

394
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:52,552
Light bulbs I bought from Costco thinking, ok,

395
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,763
Costco sells decent products one year returns.

396
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:58,273
They don't sell garbage. Yeah, they do. Those global light bulbs were trash.

397
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,023
They went on the Wi Fi, they would de

398
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,192
sync all the time. They would start

399
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:03,796
flashing if you turn the switch off and on. Too quickly.

400
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:06,705
It would like reset and lose its connection, blah, blah, blah.

401
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:10,195
So I went with Phillips. U Right. Wait, they cost like twice as much money

402
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,714
but they mostly just work. Cool. That's, you know,

403
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:16,375
and the thing is though, those are light bulbs.

404
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,595
If I buy $1000 printer, I'm not going to be like, oh ha ha silly me.

405
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,515
I bought the wrong printer. Let's go buy another one.

406
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,989
Right. I'm gonna have to eat that cost

407
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,069
by and large like,

408
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,709
and I, I think that's one of the challenges is,

409
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,890
well, it kind of goes to the market of lemons.

410
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,750
I might buy a printer that is really

411
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,390
well supported by the printer manufacturer today.

412
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,819
But if they stop software updates tomorrow,

413
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,520
oops too bad for me.

414
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
And obviously I can hedge that risk by going with a more open

415
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,310
source one.

416
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,900
Uh maybe maybe

417
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,969
like you for

418
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:47,729
-- example
-- of or

419
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:48,660
on where

420
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,959
sure a developer might get hit by a bus, but the other developers will keep going.

421
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,540
But to make that informed decision

422
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,579
requires a lot of knowledge and skill and it does

423
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:00,619
and most people just want a 3D printer that works.

424
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,290
So here's where I wanted us to end and

425
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,979
this is appropriate because we're kind of we're,

426
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:07,380
we're hitting the tail end of this discussion anyway.

427
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:08,589
So

428
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:12,800
you hear people talking about, 0, 3D printing is dying, you know, open source is

429
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,969
and all these things are dying

430
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:15,770
and

431
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:18,239
growing 10 times faster than they're dying.

432
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:21,449
Oh my goodness.

433
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:24,609
If I was next to you, I would literally stab you right now with something.

434
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,530
No, they're not dying.

435
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,650
Here's the thing I think when you think

436
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,979
about things like open source about 3D printers,

437
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,040
about the Fetta,

438
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,290
about whatever, right? You can see this in the security industry as well,

439
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,844
like it's all over the place everywhere you look,

440
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:42,714
there's this notion that if you're not like,

441
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:46,564
appealing to the mass market and everyone can use you,

442
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:49,305
your service is stupid and pointless and shouldn't exist.

443
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:51,645
And I blame like Facebook and Google

444
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,834
and even Apple to a degree for this.

445
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,750
Well, it's maximalist growth, right?

446
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,150
It's like, it's like if, if it's not just enough to be growing at 50% a year,

447
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,390
you have to grow and crush all your competitors

448
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,219
and hear the lament of their women and Children.

449
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:06,750
And it's like

450
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,510
we discussed, you know, we discussed what is success previously on the show.

451
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,050
And it's like,

452
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,109
like uh a perfect example,

453
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,349
the Fed averse if it's one or 2 million interesting people and that's all it ever is.

454
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,339
-- Yeah.
-- Cool.

455
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,680
Yeah, for sure, for sure. Absolutely.

456
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:24,579
And I think open source is a similar story where

457
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,430
you're never going to see like mass market adoption of a lot of this stuff.

458
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:34,040
You're never going to see Linux on the desktop take over windows or Os X and,

459
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,800
and nor does it really want to,

460
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:40,430
-- right? It's not one of the goals.
-- Well, and ironically, it already did that.

461
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,790
Well, it kind of did

462
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,089
Edmonton public school boards is a chromebook shop. So literally every child

463
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,300
in the public school system in Edmonton,

464
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,910
it's a Linux desktop user.

465
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,680
So there's some funny videos I've been watching where

466
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:55,439
apparently the a lot of school districts are souring

467
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,910
on chromebooks for a huge number of reasons is

468
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,719
everything from the Google services kind of suck to.

469
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:02,339
A lot of the chromebooks are low quality

470
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:04,790
and they're actually really expensive to maintain.

471
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,829
Like, who knew? Cheap stuff is expensive.

472
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,869
Well, if you buy cheap chromebooks, you get cheap chromebooks.

473
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,310
-- Like
-- exactly,

474
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:12,660
like,

475
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,967
because I've bought a couple of chromebooks over the years and the, the, the,

476
00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:18,886
the range and quality and capability is.

477
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:21,687
But you know what really ticks me off is I would love to buy,

478
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,506
I used to have this little 10 inch chromebook

479
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,286
and I loved it because it was really small.

480
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:25,536
These,

481
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:28,477
the specs on these chromebooks haven't changed in like five

482
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:30,487
years and I just want like a 10 inch.

483
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,876
-- They
-- don't need to. Yes,

484
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:32,567
they do.

485
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:35,286
Chromebooks run like crap now. Yeah, they're terrible.

486
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:38,116
They feel like five year old computers. Like they run like crap.

487
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:41,087
They, we, I want a 10 inch chromebook that

488
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:44,093
isn't running a potato inside of it and I can't find one and

489
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:47,634
-- it annoys me because traveling with a 10 inch chromebook was Chef's
-- Kiss.

490
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:48,583
Stupid question.

491
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,543
Can you run chrome Os on a non chromebook?

492
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:54,703
-- Like, could you get a framework laptop and just, yeah,
-- you can.

493
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:58,203
But that defeats the purpose because the beauty of Chromo S is I could go on

494
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:01,984
a trip to a weird place and just power wash the thing when I got home.

495
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:02,973
Right. Well, that's what I'm saying.

496
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:05,354
-- Could you buy like a framework, laptop and load Chromos on
-- it.

497
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,173
No, because you lose all of those

498
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:10,490
key hardware protections that come built in with the device.

499
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:11,401
So

500
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:12,620
you, you

501
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,331
like actually chromebook running actually Chromo S

502
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,281
and I want it 10 inches because I love,

503
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,461
it's funny because people are just like, oh, you must love the giant laptops.

504
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,250
-- I'm like, no, I literally want the smallest laptop I can humanly carry.
-- I love that.

505
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,171
Everybody thinks I'm some sort of power user.

506
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:32,151
I'm like, yes, II, I would consider myself a power user, but like

507
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,600
a Mac Air

508
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:37,250
is actually a pretty beefy system nowadays.

509
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,500
I just ssh somewhere important.

510
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:41,770
That's the answer.

511
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:45,530
Actually, it's funny. I was doing some development work at work

512
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:46,329
and

513
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,530
I would try running some, some of the, the applications on my, our, our, our

514
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,199
product is pretty beefy

515
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,890
and I tried running on my laptop and like, nope doesn't work. But now like the

516
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,290
code does that like remote ssh D bugging and stuff like holy crap. It's amazing.

517
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,079
It's so good.

518
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,670
And so I'm like, yeah, I'm on,

519
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,579
I'm connected to a giant computer in the basement that's making

520
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,540
all the noise in the world. No, it's not the internet. It's in my basement,

521
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:10,430
but it was

522
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,969
super loud

523
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,619
and, and I love it.

524
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,930
I, I think

525
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:16,760
the challenge is going to be,

526
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,180
is some types of innovation can absolutely come from a

527
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:22,339
random person working on their own in a basement.

528
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,250
Like, look at Linux, a

529
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,630
-- lot
-- of innovation does. I think

530
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,930
a lot does, but some types of innovation, can't,

531
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,280
they need to come from a research laboratory

532
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:34,410
with a health and safe

533
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,869
the officer because you're trying to do

534
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,189
-- something with uranium or plutonium
-- for sure.

535
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:40,369
I mean, look, think about airplanes. Right.

536
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,430
Would you buy an airplane built by me in my basement? Absolutely not.

537
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:46,989
Would you buy an airplane from Boeing? Probably.

538
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,790
Let's go with Airbus.

539
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:49,709
OK.

540
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,589
That's true.

541
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,750
I think we Yeah, anyway, but you get the point right is I think

542
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,979
when you talk about something like open source or 3D printing,

543
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:58,219
I

544
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,010
think what, what when people say it's dying,

545
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,199
what you're getting is a narrative from giant companies

546
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,780
that are like we're having trouble monetizing this.

547
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,500
So we're gonna tell you it's dying.

548
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,489
It's same thing like what Jerry Bell had AAA Toot on the Fetta.

549
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,550
That was like,

550
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,829
oh everyone's saying Mastodon is dying but the

551
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,599
fact that I have to keep adding servers to

552
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:17,319
sect that exchange, you know,

553
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,099
maybe he says that that's not true,

554
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,060
-- but
-- some of that is, it's definitely rampant spam and bought abuse problems.

555
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,890
Like as we saw with reddit, this was fascinating to me.

556
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,689
Somebody showed that graph of Reddit use during the blackout.

557
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,209
And it was like you would have to have a

558
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:32,619
very high end quality monitor to see that pixel difference

559
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,630
because so much reddit activities clearly bought some stuff.

560
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,500
Now, you know, same thing,

561
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,209
like with Twitter where they apparently turned it back on,

562
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:42,500
but they had turned off your ability to view more than what 600 tweets or something

563
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,079
because they were talking about like scraping and bought abuse and stuff and,

564
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,449
you know, they quietly, now that threads is out,

565
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,859
they quietly turn that off and they're back to it.

566
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:55,520
But, and that's part of it. Like I was thinking the other day is what would you or I do

567
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:59,560
if our personal website started getting like a million requests a day or,

568
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:02,964
or a minute now, you and I are technologically savvy enough to be like,

569
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:05,844
oh, I could turn it off or I could put it behind cloud flare DDOS

570
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:09,324
protection or put it in a necessary bucket and serve it as cheaply as possible.

571
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,415
But even that's gonna cost many, many dollars.

572
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:12,015
But

573
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:15,525
you and I understand what we could do to prevent that kind of abuse and stuff.

574
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:16,395
Um

575
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:17,005
Right.

576
00:24:17,015 --> 00:24:18,755
Uh I'm spacing out, what was the,

577
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:20,915
what was that open source repo that got hammered by github?

578
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:25,364
-- So they blocked all the Microsoft IP S
-- oh, I don't remember the name of it now anyways,

579
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,074
the point is

580
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:29,344
like that requires a level of skill. And also

581
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,439
if you're actually dealing with a malicious actor,

582
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:34,800
they're just gonna bypass whatever protections you put on.

583
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,260
So blocking that a dozen or 10 or 100 or

584
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,670
whatever IP S won't work and I'm thinking about that.

585
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,030
In terms of, you know, like the fed

586
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,119
is a good example.

587
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:46,680
What do we do when people come in? Oh Perfect example. We have this happen at the CS A.

588
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:49,920
People try and register free accounts on our website and stuff

589
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,280
to fill up their profile with links to like spam sites,

590
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,699
to juice their search engine optimization ranking

591
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:57,380
by getting back links.

592
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,369
And we're like,

593
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:01,430
I'm like, oh how do we fix this?

594
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:04,209
Because they're clearly coming in as with humans and doing

595
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:06,089
this because we got a bunch of protections already.

596
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,140
And I'm like, oh,

597
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:11,040
like, I guess we have to start crawling these links and seeing if they're bad or good.

598
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,790
Like, oh,

599
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,410
but that, and that's the thing is like as a community, how,

600
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,839
what do you do when a company comes in and

601
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,130
strip minds your open source and refuses to give back?

602
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:22,260
And, and the guy's answer of, oh, well, we'll go with patents.

603
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:26,189
No patents are so complicated and expensive and we're talking

604
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:28,280
tens of thousands of dollars for a good patent lawyer.

605
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,239
And that again doesn't guarantee you're going to get the patent

606
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:35,430
-- as is,
-- here's my other favorite part of that when it comes to 3D, printing

607
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,609
most of the actual interesting work coming into the 3D

608
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:42,435
printer universe is not being done by these companies.

609
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:43,545
So they're not even gonna get the

610
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:46,125
freaking patents anyway because you've got like random

611
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:50,824
-- people and research institutions and all these other orgs doing this work or
-- worse,

612
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:51,635
the companies are gonna go.

613
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:51,895
Oh, yeah,

614
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:54,844
we could pat that stuff and pretend it's ours because what are they gonna do?

615
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,055
-- Are they gonna
-- sue that?

616
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:58,255
Well, there's first to file now in the US,

617
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,574
which is definitely problematic in that regard.

618
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:03,244
But a person coming up with these innovations in their basement is

619
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:05,189
the chances of the, the,

620
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,979
the Venn diagram of people who come up

621
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,069
with new 3D printer innovations in their basement

622
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:10,560
and people who file pens

623
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,750
-- are two very widely separated circles
-- for sure, for sure.

624
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,459
And I think we're going to see a mess for without question. I mean,

625
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:21,589
we saw a lot of messes in the open source world, man. I mean,

626
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:24,530
how many times weren't there like ridiculous patents filed?

627
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,229
And people were like,

628
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:29,030
I literally did that 10 years ago and now it costs like thousands,

629
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,479
hundreds of thousands of hours to undo that.

630
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,349
What would the world look like if the US patent office had

631
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,219
decided that patents don't apply to open source and vice versa?

632
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,369
So that, for example, I like thought experiment. If you open source, your

633
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,829
stuff under

634
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,089
a US patent office proved open source license,

635
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,510
you can violate as many patents as you want.

636
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:49,660
Uh

637
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,329
-- go
-- not a lawyer, Kurt, I'm not gonna

638
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:52,550
No, no,

639
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,150
I'm not saying from a legal point of view but like,

640
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,150
what would the world look like if that was allowed?

641
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,670
If you could basically do all this work without having to worry about being sued,

642
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,189
patent violation.

643
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:04,729
You would see companies open sourcing things for

644
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,390
the express purpose of getting around patent law.

645
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,109
I don't think it would be a good idea. I think patents have value

646
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,390
conventions should be rewarded.

647
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:20,650
But I also think novel experiment, novel work,

648
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,839
90% of the patents being filed are not novel.

649
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,619
Like, remember

650
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:24,859
when,

651
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:28,910
remember when people were literally just like taking old ideas

652
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,050
-- and writing with a computer and they still
-- are,

653
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,030
-- except now it's with a Blockchain or
-- with a,

654
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:33,849
-- with
-- a,

655
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,219
no, I'm

656
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,500
serious.

657
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,920
I looked at some of these patents and they're, they're straight up like blah, blah,

658
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,119
blah

659
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:40,839
with an A I mediated system instead of a computer

660
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:43,520
or a network mediated system or a Blockchain mediated system.

661
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:49,079
Uh Anyway, anyway.

662
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:51,339
All right, open source isn't dying.

663
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,880
We knew that though.

664
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,670
Yeah.

665
00:27:53,949 --> 00:27:55,380
Well, it's more to the point,

666
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:59,140
open source can't die because it's, as somebody was pointing out,

667
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,140
as long as there's two people on a forum that want to talk to each other,

668
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,790
that forum is alive for

669
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:04,670
the open

670
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,199
source world.

671
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:09,060
As long as there's one person releasing stuff under an open source license,

672
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:10,699
it's technically not dead.

673
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:11,699
I mean, it, it,

674
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:13,729
yes, that's how it's always going to work.

675
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:17,359
I think what we're seeing is corporate open source is going to

676
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:21,170
change and this is partially because of the free money is gone.

677
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,369
Making money is hard

678
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:26,000
-- and Yeah. Right. It, it is very, yeah,
-- making money with open source

679
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,359
is hard.

680
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:30,650
Well, making money at all. I remember. So, you know what that reminds me of is

681
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,810
I always wanted to be an o'reilly author when I was young, like, very young.

682
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,369
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I did. Because when

683
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:39,130
you wrote an o'reilly book,

684
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:42,650
you could basically get a free copy of every o'reilly book.

685
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,239
At that point, I was like, I could literally own all the o'reilly books.

686
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,300
-- Like this is much cheaper than
-- I had two bankers box full of them. I spent,

687
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:49,949
I

688
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:50,239
know, I

689
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,579
-- know,
-- I think on the order of $7000 on o'reilly books into two

690
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,050
-- year period,
-- I

691
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,979
-- guarantee
-- I spent that over my career when I was young.

692
00:28:56,989 --> 00:29:01,650
Like, once I got a job, my first job, I basically spent all my money on o'reilly books.

693
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,930
But one was your favorite,

694
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:07,380
-- the best o'reilly book?
-- No, no, no, not the best. Which one was your favorite?

695
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,319
My favorite o'reilly book was actually the MH book,

696
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,109
which was a mail system. No one ever heard of that.

697
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,040
I was, I was a maintainer of for a long time.

698
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,920
It was like this mail system started at the RAND Corporation in like

699
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,239
1979 and I started working on it in like 2001 or 2002.

700
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,160
And it was frighteningly useful

701
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,415
and the book was written by, I don't remember the author's name. But he was a very,

702
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:33,744
we'll say, unique personality and it came through in his book

703
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:37,675
and it was very, very fun to read and to use.

704
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:38,895
But anyway, anyway,

705
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:41,464
there was an interview with Tim o'reilly one time where someone was, like,

706
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:42,204
aren't you worried?

707
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:45,224
These authors are going to get these free books and then resell them

708
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:49,584
and no, no, his comment was what his comment was.

709
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,015
I know how hard it is to sell books. I'm not worried at all.

710
00:29:53,145 --> 00:29:56,025
Well, even more to the point if I get one of every book and I,

711
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,079
-- I resell them
-- like,

712
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,630
no, I know, I know what,

713
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,709
-- I'm sorry.
-- That

714
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:02,290
-- question
-- is

715
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,349
so

716
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,810
it's a very normal question.

717
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:05,589
I think that it, it,

718
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,459
it is someone who is not steeped in the world of

719
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:13,579
-- books probably thinks that is a likely outcome
-- even if,

720
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:14,349
ok, let's just

721
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,060
like

722
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:16,854
the envelope. There was, what about 100

723
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:17,564
books?

724
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:22,805
It's not supposed to make sense. It's just an amusing anecdote.

725
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:23,354
Like,

726
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:26,354
again, we've derailed the podcast. So

727
00:30:26,665 --> 00:30:31,944
the point is though, like, I think corporate open source is going to change,

728
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:33,625
it has to change because like

729
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,199
the days of just giving lots of free stuff away and not making money

730
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:42,900
-- are over this. Actually, I also, I saw well
-- making money directly off of it. Ok.

731
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:45,900
Right. I saw a thing actually, uh this morning that

732
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,660
Evernote apparently just laid off all their staff.

733
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,380
It's done

734
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:51,010
-- like what does that mean? What happens
-- next?

735
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,880
But here's the thing that's interesting is there are

736
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,180
come like cloud services, cloud services let like,

737
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:59,930
don't even if anybody pretends that they're not 100% open source

738
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:01,849
is lying to you.

739
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:02,420
Right.

740
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,890
There's maybe like a couple 1000 lines of code for

741
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,530
the special sauce on the website in front of it.

742
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,459
-- Oh,
-- you mean everything underneath? Oh, for sure,

743
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:08,910
-- for
-- sure.

744
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,630
And so there are ways to make money off open source. But the challenge is

745
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:16,010
the ways to make money off open source and

746
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,689
be a good open source citizen. Let's say

747
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,400
much like Red Hat has been trying for 20 years where

748
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,650
Red Hat actually has a very explicit policy of upstream first.

749
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,520
Like yes, we will

750
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,935
write this patch or we will do this enhancement for the, for the love of God,

751
00:31:29,944 --> 00:31:30,834
we want it upstream.

752
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:33,185
So we don't have to maintain a separate patch set because

753
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:38,214
that's a pain in the butt. It's terrible. And I think this is one of the things,

754
00:31:38,484 --> 00:31:41,165
there's so many people talking about this whole red hat thing that I

755
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:44,255
don't think I've ever had to apply a patch to source code,

756
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,255
let alone take a patch to source code.

757
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:49,655
And now tweak the patch. So it applies to a 10 versions old,

758
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,609
maintain that for five years.

759
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:53,260
And I

760
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:53,459
know

761
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,979
anybody that thinks what Red Hat does is easy.

762
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:58,729
I would challenge you, go find a random CV.

763
00:31:58,739 --> 00:32:01,599
And apply that source code patch to the last major version

764
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:05,670
-- every Tuesday
-- at red hat. No, I know. I know. I know how much work that is.

765
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,869
I used to, I did that for a long time but

766
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,729
nobody in their right mind does this. They, they,

767
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:13,369
but here, here's the thing though, I think to your point,

768
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,540
cloud services aren't selling open,

769
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:19,375
they're selling a service that runs on top of open source. right?

770
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:20,444
-- But then
-- some of them are

771
00:32:20,665 --> 00:32:23,344
-- like, remember Amazon and the elastic
-- thing that's

772
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:25,084
we're not going to talk about that right now,

773
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:29,564
-- right? And,
-- and that, but that nobody but this goes to are the cloud services

774
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:32,564
using the open source in a sustainable way or

775
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:34,214
are they strip mining it and damaging it?

776
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:35,685
Some of them are, some of them aren't.

777
00:32:35,694 --> 00:32:37,435
I think Amazon is definitely, well,

778
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:40,194
probably the big clouds aren't strip mining for sure

779
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:43,844
you can make that argument. But anyway, anyway, the point is

780
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,260
where I wanna wrap this one up and kind of bring it

781
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,420
all home is just the fact that open source is fine.

782
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,699
3D printing is fine. The FTA

783
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,869
verse is fine.

784
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:58,609
It's just our historic view of what it means to be a successful business

785
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:03,410
probably needs to be re evaluated in that context. Open source isn't a business.

786
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:03,739
The FTA

787
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,719
verse isn't a business, right?

788
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:09,229
Like 3D printing, there are businesses that exist in that world,

789
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,505
but functionally the 3D printing community isn't a business.

790
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:12,935
Well,

791
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:14,444
and I think maybe that's the thing to

792
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:17,234
look at this is there's the 3D printing businesses

793
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:21,655
but enveloping it sitting on top of it is the 3D printing ecosystem. That's

794
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:22,444
Yeah. Yeah.

795
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:23,925
And I think, and, and this is, I mean,

796
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,805
we've just seen this yesterday with threads popping

797
00:33:25,814 --> 00:33:29,265
up where they like literally every hour Zuckerberg was

798
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:32,925
threading. What's the, whatever that's called threading?

799
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:34,625
I was about to say tweeting but I'm like, nope,

800
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:36,584
this is very specifically not tweeting.

801
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,770
It's not tooting, I guess threading. We

802
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:39,589
have three verbs

803
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,810
about how many users had signed up in the last hour or whatever.

804
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:43,170
And,

805
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,719
and they were like that hockey stick growth of

806
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:47,469
like 07 million users in four hours or whatever.

807
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:49,609
And from their perspective, from Facebook's perspective,

808
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:53,910
like for their shareholders, that number has to go up into the right man, a rock

809
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:54,479
pace.

810
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:54,890
They

811
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,699
-- doomed for sure a
-- 100

812
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:56,959
percent

813
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,229
Jerry Bell and the fetter

814
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:00,300
he could, I mean,

815
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,900
he could basically never get a user and I would say that he's entirely successful.

816
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,150
Yeah.

817
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,739
Oh, well,

818
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,930
if anything you could claim he's unsuccessful

819
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:08,500
because he's spending his own money to

820
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:08,679
give

821
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:08,969
him a

822
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:10,110
structure around.

823
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,438
Yeah. So

824
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,540
which thank you Jerry for doing by the way.

825
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,739
-- And
-- I think that's part of the challenge is these

826
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,600
people are coming at this from like a venture capital mindset

827
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,879
of like we have to sell one of these to everybody

828
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:23,020
on the planet to make this a billion dollar unit.

829
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,024
And it's back to that maximalist growth.

830
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:30,965
Not just we have to maximize growth and grow 100% a year or a week or a day,

831
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:32,705
but we have to like crush.

832
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:35,583
We have to be the like threads has to

833
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,844
murder every Twitter user and get through threads

834
00:34:38,935 --> 00:34:40,985
and Twitter has to become a barren wasteland.

835
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:42,715
That's more so than it already is.

836
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:47,094
-- And you
-- know, I think that is the story when you hear people say, oh, the FTA

837
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:48,165
verse is failing.

838
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:53,789
They think if, if the, if Mastodon doesn't murder Twitter, Mastodon is a failure

839
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:58,069
when that's not even a goal. You know what, this reminds me of Kurt.

840
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,208
This reminds me of the arguments you get into where security teams think

841
00:35:02,218 --> 00:35:07,229
like the business exists to empower them where it's like no security team.

842
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,789
You are literally only here so that the people making a product you sell.

843
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:14,029
Like that's the business. What you're doing

844
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,770
is not the most important thing.

845
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:21,530
Let's just leave it with this IRC networks are still a thing. Are they as big as

846
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:24,330
amazing as they used to be? No,

847
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:28,290
but there are still hundreds of thousands of people using IRC.

848
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:33,159
Uh Yeah, for sure, easily. Yep. Yep. OK. I like it. Let's just call it. Thank you.
