00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,880
-- Welcome to curtain Josh on 443.1 in the morning.
-- Why, why are you doing that?

1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,170
-- That's not even funny
-- because we've got a soundboard now.

2
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,659
-- I, I
-- don't have a soundboard. I have

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,229
-- push the button.
-- All right, I will push the button.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,920
There you go,

5
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,559
which will never be pushed again on this show.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,440
So Kurt is impressed.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,610
I got for Christmas,

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,279
I got a new microphone and then I bought one of those like little boxes you

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,689
plug the microphone into and then it plugs into the computer and all that jazz.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,919
It's something called a Zoom

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,279
pod track P four.

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,000
The reason I got it is because I can take it like

13
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,159
on the road and you can record right on the device.

14
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:44,279
It has four inputs. Like it's a really cool little device.

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,819
But anyway, it has a sound pad so you can put sound effects in it,

16
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:51,130
which again, we will never be using ever again.

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm sad now,

18
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:55,790
I'm, I'm sad now.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,700
No, I'm not pushing the button

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,150
anyway.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,169
-- Anyway,
-- at least what we're doing isn't as stupid as what Norton did.

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,819
Well, that's a very nice transition.

23
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:10,019
Come

24
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:10,230
on.

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,349
I mean, we could have, I could have gone with evil, but it's not evil.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,830
It's just too banal to be evil. It's just stupid.

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,989
It's very stupid

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,870
before we move on. I must say, I know you watch Linus Tech Tips on youtube

29
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:23,709
and

30
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,589
so the his, his transitions are worse than what you just did. Typically speaking

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,360
and my kids and their friends, like, I guess it's become a thing in like the,

32
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,330
the geeky kid universe or whatever we want to call it

33
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:40,370
where they literally talk about bad transitions

34
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,370
on a regular basis because of Linus.

35
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,739
He's, he's so bad. It's good.

36
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,449
-- I know
-- it's awesome. I love it. Anyway. Anyway. Alright.

37
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,739
So tell us what Norton's done first and then we'll explain.

38
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:54,250
I haven't read all the details but it seems to boil down to.

39
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:55,309
Well, I'll just read the tweet,

40
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,449
why not Norton is installing a Cryptocurrency miner called Norton crypto

41
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,089
and crypto exe on end user systems without so much

42
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,080
as a dialogue during the install of its security product.

43
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:03,870
But um

44
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,870
I mean, that's,

45
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,139
-- that's like I don't know what else to say other than we don't
-- need a soundboard,

46
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,389
you can be the soundboard

47
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,288
anyway.

48
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,740
So here's what I've read so far at the time of recording which I'm sure this will

49
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,399
change and I'm sure they'll say it was the interns fault or something at some point.

50
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:18,809
But

51
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:19,330
no,

52
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,059
it's on the, it's on their website community dot Or

53
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:23,539
-- no
-- it's on their website.

54
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,570
But I think they, I,

55
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,419
I suspect they're going to get a lot

56
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:28,559
of pushback because this is so monumentally stupid.

57
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,410
But it sounds like what happens is when you install the new version of Norton

58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,419
-- 360
-- it auto,

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,080
whatever, whatever. So you, you, you get Norton, right?

60
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:42,979
It installs an Ethereum Cryptocurrency miner as part of it.

61
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,600
They claim they don't turn it on by default and you have to opt in

62
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,240
according to their website.

63
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,490
But fundamentally what it sounds like Norton has done

64
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,979
is they have created their own Ethereum mining pool.

65
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,809
Then all of their users, they want to help them mine, Ethereum

66
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:03,220
and then the users get, let's say 99% of what they mine and Norton gets 1%.

67
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,330
That's how that would work.

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:04,929
Yeah.

69
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,380
And it's, it's, it's basically one of those classic.

70
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,110
I mean, because people probably don't remember the early OTs where it was like,

71
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,679
literally.

72
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,839
And I'm just gonna read it off on our website. Turn your P CS idle time into cash.

73
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:16,820
I'll give you a hint.

74
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:21,130
-- There's no good way to properly monetize an idol. PC. No.
-- Right. Right.

75
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,770
You're gonna spend more money in electricity than you're going to make an Ethereum.

76
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:27,300
Just that's how it works.

77
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,339
I mean, this is why when you look at current crypto

78
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,529
mining farms,

79
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,699
they're usually near a power source so they can buy really

80
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,949
cheap power and they're ridiculously huge because you have to be,

81
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,250
uh, actually it's not that they're near a power source.

82
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,419
Typically they're near

83
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,550
either they stealing power.

84
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,559
-- Well,
-- that's true that

85
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,720
happens or they do some dodgy

86
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,500
deal to get power

87
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,710
at effectively below cost.

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,119
Like there was one here in Alberta that wasn't registered

89
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,910
and it was like one or two shipping containers just making a howling noise.

90
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,619
And it was by an old natural gas plant that had been decommissioned

91
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,020
because it was no longer viable and they kind of restarted it.

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,589
And so, you know, the neighbors complained about the noise because it's just like,

93
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,149
literally, do you want to know what 10,000 PC fan sounds like?

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,979
Well, before people found out.

95
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,779
Yeah, it officially says that it's, you have to turn on Norton crypto,

96
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,339
but I suspect Norton crypto.

97
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,369
I'm guessing it's not telling you

98
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,940
all the details of what's going on and here's more to the point.

99
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,940
I'll be blunt and,

100
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,179
and this is official like this isn't my internal

101
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,899
guidance with the people I work with for Windows

102
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,399
use Windows Defender because it does the least amount

103
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,899
of damage to the system of an antivirus.

104
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,859
For Mac Os don't run one. And also for Linux

105
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,540
don't run one

106
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:44,970
and I've never run antivirus on a Mac in. Well, it's over 10 years at this point.

107
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,540
I don't understand how anti

108
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,679
or how viruses are a problem on a modern Mac.

109
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,399
If like, unless you're installing some,

110
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,450
like maybe you're getting your software off limewire still.

111
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,230
Right. I don't know that's antivirus.

112
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,649
And, and then the real thing is just, you know,

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,660
use a proper email provider like gmail

114
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,929
or something that actually filters out viruses

115
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,799
and use a proper web browser

116
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:05,850
with an ad blocker.

117
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:07,529
And that ad blocker

118
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,359
will

119
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,670
give you a much better internet experience.

120
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,570
Well, sure.

121
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,029
And it will basically block all the drive by ads, viruses.

122
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:17,200
You're not wrong.

123
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:22,549
But I don't want to talk about how to protect a system with antivirus because I think,

124
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,059
well, this is just for those people that are like, oh,

125
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,160
but you have to have some antivirus and Norton is good.

126
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,029
-- It's like, no, no, you don't.
-- Here's the thing I would say on this topic is

127
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,869
almost everything around the malware universe is opinion for the most part,

128
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,959
I've yet to find like good research that says if you run antivirus,

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,609
this is what happens if you don't.

130
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:44,540
This is what happens.

131
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:48,220
And here are the numbers explaining that because a lot of people, like,

132
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,329
you don't run antivirus and have had no problems and I know people that have it on Mac,

133
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,489
they have endpoint protection and they've had terrible problems and you're right.

134
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,299
Like, what have you done? I don't know. But it happens.

135
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,480
But anyway, the point is

136
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,130
Norton is installing a crypto miner that I guarantee

137
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,079
will lose money for the people using it.

138
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:14,470
And I guarantee they're going to make some money off of other people's computers.

139
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,029
But I think the, the most important part of this,

140
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,109
the thing that drives me the most crazy is that

141
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,130
if you think about the environmental impact of Cryptocurrency mining as it is,

142
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,109
and if you're using specialized hardware, you're talking about

143
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,309
probably

144
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,649
1 to 2% of the electricity. A general CPU is going to use.

145
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,510
So if all of Norton's users turn this thing on

146
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,589
the carbon footprint of this is going to be astronomical.

147
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,329
Uh So what's interesting is they require you to have a

148
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,690
graphics card with a minimum of six gigs of ra M.

149
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,700
So they, they're only doing it on systems that have a proper video card.

150
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,799
-- It's
-- still gonna be terrible, man, because

151
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,149
it's absolutely,

152
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,200
the return on investment is going to be bad. The electricity use is going to be bad.

153
00:06:57,429 --> 00:07:02,519
And my guess is Norton is going to make, what, thousands of dollars maybe off.

154
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:05,940
I mean, I just, I don't see it being a viable business model.

155
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:08,239
-- I
-- think the reality is, it's, it's so

156
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,670
how do you monetize stuff on the internet?

157
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:13,670
And the classic way is you sell things to people and,

158
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,790
but that's actually really hard.

159
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,239
You have to have something people want or you have to trick them into buying it,

160
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,140
which I've been tricked into buying garbage on like Amazon, you know,

161
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,450
where it's described as one thing and then it arrives and it's like, well,

162
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:23,230
this is garbage

163
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,470
who hasn't

164
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,339
the second thing is a,

165
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,644
of course, which Google is in that trap of, you know,

166
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,815
trying to basically sell micro attention payments.

167
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:37,415
I mean, most of the big internet companies are. You've got what? Facebook Google?

168
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:41,095
Because it's one heck of a walled mode, like once you become a dominant player,

169
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,255
nobody else like

170
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,644
can assail you.

171
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,880
And then

172
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,440
the third and final one that especially Attackers

173
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,959
love is this whole Cryptocurrency mining thing.

174
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,279
So,

175
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,320
you know, we we we were increasingly seeing, it was funny as I was leaving Red Hat,

176
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:57,880
you know, the pattern used to be people broke into systemss to,

177
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,839
for example, send email and spam,

178
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,640
you know, or

179
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,880
to literally use it to provide web hosting for dodgy web things

180
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,779
-- and it was moving to, you know, installing Cryptocurrency miners.
-- Yeah.

181
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,899
Well, I mean, look at, look at log for J

182
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,890
most of the log for J attacks.

183
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,839
I've seen going on in the wild that aren't researchers,

184
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,899
which I think is most of the traffic now, but they were installing crypto miners.

185
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,820
What's the easiest most reliable way to monetize your attack?

186
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,329
It is now now I I want to clarify something else because I've

187
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,090
talked to people and there's been confusion about this in the past.

188
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,308
So one of the challenges to mining Cryptocurrency now is

189
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,929
so a long time ago, you could run like a Bitcoin miner

190
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:40,909
and you'd get your reward

191
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,530
occasionally, right?

192
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:46,179
These days, mining something like Ethereum or Bitcoin,

193
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:49,299
you would have to mine for thousands of years on one computer

194
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:50,518
to maybe get a

195
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:55,258
-- payout.
-- Right. Statistically it's, it's so close to zero.

196
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:55,739
Right.

197
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:56,979
It's statistically zero.

198
00:08:57,268 --> 00:09:00,888
And so what happens is you have this concept called pooled Mining.

199
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:03,588
And so you have lots of computers

200
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:06,499
all pooling their resources together. Right.

201
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,539
And then you can maybe mine one coin if you have, you know,

202
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,950
thousands or tens of thousands.

203
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
-- So, that's what most of these
-- Cryptocurrency.

204
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,500
-- You mean mine? One block, one.
-- Yeah. One block, sorry. Not one coin.

205
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,580
Well, it's kind of

206
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,820
un the idea, right? All these, all these people pool the resources

207
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,900
and there are public pools which I know like way

208
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:28,450
back in the day I participated in some for Bitcoin.

209
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,859
And so basically they say, all right,

210
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,869
the amount of work you put in

211
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,270
is proportional to the reward you get.

212
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,320
So if you, if you're 1% of the mining pool,

213
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,229
when they mine say

214
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,760
100 coins,

215
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,549
you get one of whatever coin it might be, right?

216
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,609
And so this is because one of the, one of the points of confusion I think is

217
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:50,750
just running a miner on a system

218
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,859
like that individual system isn't going to mine coins, right?

219
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,780
They're going to pull all the resources together

220
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,619
and then they're going to mine collectively.

221
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,750
Like the phrase you'd have to be astronomically lucky

222
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,520
is what comes to mind.

223
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:06,619
-- Well,
-- so here's part of the, here's one of the tricks though

224
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,059
is when you're talking about something like Cryptocurrency mining.

225
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,859
It's not about luck. It turns into statisticss.

226
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:18,950
Right. Because any, any, you can have luck over a very, like an individual event.

227
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,895
But when you're doing something, 1000 or 10,000 or 100,000 times be, you know,

228
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:25,164
the number of computers in the pool

229
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,784
is not luck anymore. It's just statistics

230
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:29,835
and I'm going to point out the current hash rate.

231
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:32,715
So there was the big dip in July when China banned it.

232
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:36,065
But the current hash rate is back up to like 100 and 80

233
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,340
uh Tara

234
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,320
hashes per

235
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:39,000
Bitcoin

236
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:40,400
for Bitcoin.

237
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:45,200
-- And, and
-- it should also be said that the reason Norton is mining Ethereum

238
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,280
is because you can still mine Ethereum. My graphics cards,

239
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:53,179
Bitcoin can only be mined on specialized hardware now.

240
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:54,270
Well, it's, it's

241
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,969
what is it sha 256

242
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:59,905
shot 256. And these devices are doing

243
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:04,434
obscene numbers of hashes per second and shot 256 is really fast.

244
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:07,744
Whereas the Ethereum algorithm was designed to be harder.

245
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,984
And I remember there was a time when the Ethereum people said, oh,

246
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:14,174
this algorithm will never be workable in a graphics card.

247
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:17,145
And of course it is which everyone was like, yeah challenge accepted.

248
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:17,869
But

249
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:18,770
there, I mean, and,

250
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,969
and there are other coins that are purposely

251
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:25,489
not applicable to like mining in graphics cards,

252
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,760
for example, because graphics cards have lots of cores.

253
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,210
And so you can mine more things and, and whatever.

254
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,250
-- And
-- then there's also the proof of storage, proof of proof of work is not the only

255
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:36,250
solution, proof of stake, you know,

256
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,320
which is theorem is moving to and so on and so forth.

257
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,099
OK. OK. I'm gonna, I'm gonna put my foot in my mouth and say,

258
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,109
I don't think Ethereum is ever gonna move

259
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:45,229
to proof of stake.

260
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,750
-- I, I don't think it'll happen.
-- I'm not going to strongly disagree with you

261
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,250
and I keep a close eye on these things.

262
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:51,960
It's just,

263
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,969
yeah, they were supposed to have accomplished this one or two years ago.

264
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:55,479
And it's just,

265
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,849
I think the challenge is the people who've invested in

266
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:01,070
the hardware

267
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,859
that investment becomes less valuable.

268
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,969
I mean, that's just the reality.

269
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,349
Well, and to segue.

270
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:11,539
So, in, in, in this whole uh Cryptocurrency space,

271
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,190
it's what's fascinating to me is there's, there's basically three

272
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:15,239
key players

273
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,229
that really matter.

274
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,650
There's the people that hold a whole bunch of coin that are uh in past,

275
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,270
they would have been the Whales and now it's um well, corporations,

276
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,909
whales and institutional investors and whatnot.

277
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,090
Uh Number two is the minors

278
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,450
and number three is the devs.

279
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,419
And basically, if you're not in one of those three groups, you can,

280
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:32,380
you can just go away

281
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,619
like you don't matter.

282
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,059
You have no say you have no like you, you have nothing to offer to put it bluntly.

283
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,630
And

284
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,750
the, the Devs have

285
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,710
in many cases a lot more power than they should.

286
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,630
Yes.

287
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:50,229
Good. You're segueing for me into the next thing I want to talk about.

288
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:54,070
-- That's exciting.
-- And what's interesting is so, and the miners have a lot more

289
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,349
power than they should, but not as much as they would like.

290
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,140
Because ultimately, the devs,

291
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,559
-- how do I put this? The devs are usually smarter than the miners.
-- Uh It's complicated.

292
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,630
A lot of the miners are just running mines.

293
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,900
They don't have the talent to actually understand like

294
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:10,450
what's going on at a very deep level,

295
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,940
right there. A lot of them are kind of get rich quick artists.

296
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,830
Like if you watch the youtube documentaries on them,

297
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:19,770
a lot of them, like because the way they're building these things and the, you know,

298
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,010
it's pretty clear that they're not super technical and sophisticated

299
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,609
and you don't have to be right

300
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,799
because it's the wild West

301
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:29,049
or it was, it's, it's settling down now.

302
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:32,320
Um But the Devs have a lot of power because

303
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,979
uh they can, yeah,

304
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:35,619
they can roll out updates and changes

305
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,090
that um very fundamentally change the landscape.

306
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:38,760
OK.

307
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,039
Now, on the topic of Devs having a lot of power, which in theory,

308
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:46,760
they don't because the whole idea behind all this Cryptocurrency,

309
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,239
right was consensus and all this.

310
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:48,679
But

311
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,520
so I'm going to start by reading a tweet

312
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,619
and then we're going to transition into that.

313
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,270
I've been hacked

314
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,900
all my apes gone Oh

315
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,200
-- yeah, this
-- one

316
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,630
now now so

317
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,469
-- no, but
-- you got to read the reply to that tweet. It's even better.

318
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,070
What was that? Which reply? There's like

319
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,690
-- the
-- reply that was,

320
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,169
can you please change your profile picture since

321
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,030
you don't technically own that picture anymore?

322
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:09,450
That

323
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:09,869
one?

324
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,150
Ok. I want to explain what's

325
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,669
this is really funny.

326
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:18,724
I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh. That's I'm sorry, this is like it.

327
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:20,505
No, no, there, there's an important part of it.

328
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:20,544
I,

329
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:23,465
I literally don't care about the NFT and what they're

330
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,825
worth and the value and some people will say it's,

331
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:26,705
it's too high.

332
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:29,655
It, whatever. I don't care. That's not the point. Pet rocks.

333
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:34,025
I, I agree. I agree. Look, someone thought this was a good idea.

334
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,594
People are buying it whatever.

335
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:36,544
Now,

336
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:40,494
here's what makes it so interesting though. So I kind of to fill you in there is this

337
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,219
NFT market where these things,

338
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:47,309
they're called board apes and they're just pictures of monkeys and they're worth

339
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,659
obscene amounts of money now, like

340
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,270
millions of dollars

341
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,609
in

342
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,359
aggregate

343
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,909
-- the board ape, yacht club, right?
-- Whatever.

344
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,559
So

345
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:58,719
the point is though.

346
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:02,200
So this person had a bunch of these apes which they

347
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,440
bought obviously before they were worth millions because I mean,

348
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,760
it reminds me of the art market where things go up for seemingly no reason and every

349
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,419
like, I don't get it but whatever,

350
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:12,510
-- money
-- laundering

351
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:13,869
straight up like there's

352
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,630
this how the CIA invented, like modern art,

353
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:18,320
we're gonna get murdered.

354
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,669
If we go down that path, we're just going to leave it be right.

355
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,859
-- You're gonna
-- fall out a window.

356
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:22,460
That's right.

357
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,940
I accidentally hit myself in the back of the head with a hammer 16 times.

358
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,570
But

359
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,859
so the thing is this, these apes got stolen

360
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,489
from, I think it was a phishing scam

361
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:33,989
and, and whatever.

362
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,340
Right, like that happens, this was a, a valuable item this person had,

363
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:39,619
it was taken away from them.

364
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,859
It was a theft. Now in the Cryptocurrency universe,

365
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,590
if someone steals your stuff like this, it should be gone

366
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,940
except

367
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,349
the people who run the NFT marketplace,

368
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,260
they, they froze

369
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,799
the NFTS, the Apes like what

370
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,760
that's literally not supposed to happen.

371
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,640
Ok. So if I steal your wallet,

372
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:04,520
I now have control of those coins nfts whatever

373
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:04,849
crypto

374
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:07,109
tokens. But for example,

375
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,380
a large exchange can blacklist those tokens and not

376
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:12,640
handle them.

377
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:17,369
And the funny thing is the same thing used to happen with physical cash, right?

378
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,179
People forget physical cash has serial numbers.

379
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:21,940
That's right. And

380
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,659
for example, when you were paying a kidnapping,

381
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,280
they would photograph every bill and send that list of numbers to all the banks.

382
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,020
That's

383
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,309
right.

384
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:29,619
Yep.

385
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,750
Right. And obviously that's not going to work like a physical scale because,

386
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,900
well, you'd have such a huge list of, you know,

387
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,140
these dollar bills were involved in crime.

388
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,940
So don't accept them.

389
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,580
But with technology with electronic stuff that

390
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,619
absolutely is very easy to implement.

391
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,669
And this is also for,

392
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,570
for anyone who's seen in the movies they talk about small unmarked bills.

393
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,530
That's what this is supposed to be, is untraceable cash.

394
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,419
Well, it's not untraceable. It's too much effort to trace.

395
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:57,109
That's,

396
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:00,979
and that's, that's, and that works right. Like it's, you know,

397
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:04,084
the cops can't spend $10 million tracing $50.

398
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:10,243
Well, not anymore. Now it costs like a nickel Computers. So, but anyway, go on.

399
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:13,685
So anyways, yeah, I mean, that's the thing. We all, all these places,

400
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:15,295
you know, the whole crypto

401
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:15,614
bros.

402
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,584
And I'll use that term. It's derogatory. And I mean, it,

403
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,983
the crypto bros thing of like, you know, the, like your, your keys, your wallet

404
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:25,064
cool until like, yeah, something goes wrong.

405
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,743
You delete them accidentally or it gets stolen.

406
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,229
But the reality is no, your keys, your wallet. But

407
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,369
you, you still have to find exchanges willing to traffic in your stuff

408
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,229
and you can very easily get your stuff blacklisted.

409
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:44,199
Well, and I mean, the other thing I think is so someone steals a painting

410
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:45,650
in the real world. Right.

411
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,430
There's, I know there's a handful of paintings that are still like,

412
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,670
being looked for.

413
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:53,650
Like if someone steals a painting, you can't show up at an auction house and be like,

414
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,890
oh, here I'd like to sell my painting, they're gonna be like,

415
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,150
you literally stole that.

416
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,849
Like you can't sell this

417
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:02,709
or no, no or it's, it's probably a fake because the real one was stolen.

418
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,900
-- Right.
-- That could be too. And in the case of something

419
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:07,385
like these NFT Apes,

420
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:10,084
there's a very small number of them,

421
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:13,364
like who's going to buy an obviously stolen? Ape.

422
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:13,655
Well,

423
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:16,064
and what's interesting is so one argument

424
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:17,935
for stolen art is that somebody can commission

425
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:20,454
a piece of art to be stolen so they can possess it and look at

426
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:24,084
it. Right. There's, there's a million heist movies with that trope.

427
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:28,175
But with NFTS, like, I think it's to quote Keanu Reeves, like, do you mean that thing?

428
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:29,564
I can just right click on and say

429
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:30,785
-- that's
-- right.

430
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,689
So, you know, like, if, if you want to go look at an NFT,

431
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,550
-- well, you, yeah, it's digital. You know
-- what makes it really funny though too?

432
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,170
Is there some people who I don't think understand that there's

433
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,319
a,

434
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,890
uh, death vegetable, one of the CDC people

435
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,489
was picking on someone at one point where he,

436
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,709
he changed his profile pic to someone's NFT.

437
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:52,119
And then the person was accusing him of stealing the NFT.

438
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,729
And it was really funny because the death Veggie was

439
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:56,890
going along with it and pretending like he'd stolen it.

440
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,329
And the person clearly had no idea what was going on.

441
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:02,329
And part of me was like, this is really funny and part of me is like,

442
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,469
please stop picking on this

443
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,410
person.

444
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,369
And that's the thing like crypto is hard.

445
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,089
Crypto tokens and currency are even harder because

446
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,550
so like uh the private key is not exposed but the public key is exposed.

447
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,709
Sure, that kind of makes sense for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

448
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,989
But with NFTS, the dirty secret is

449
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,329
the

450
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:26,260
object. The NFT is typically not on chain.

451
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,719
It is just like a JPEG floating around the internet somewhere.

452
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,489
And then there's this like piece of metadata that says, you know,

453
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,170
Kurt actually owns this file with this Shaw 512 sum.

454
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:37,760
But

455
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,479
well, I I've even written articles on this 20 years ago.

456
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,199
You remember we had for a brief period,

457
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:45,329
there was software that was designed to control

458
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:48,959
access to files so that you could send a file to somebody.

459
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:51,939
And for example, they could only print it but not modify it or save it.

460
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:55,760
-- Uh Those
-- still exist, I think you could get PDF S that work like that.

461
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,599
You can generally break them. But

462
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,439
yes, well, PDF S and, and there's,

463
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:03,099
there's actual like software where you have to download and install it and then it,

464
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:06,920
you know, it tries to, you know, have this magic box that prevents shenanigans.

465
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,959
But fundamentally people can, you know,

466
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,800
retype stuff in or point a camera at the screen.

467
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:15,130
Like that's one thing I have to do with my son.

468
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,869
He, he likes to take screenshots of stuff in Netflix on the ipad,

469
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,140
which has like copy protection.

470
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,790
So it just takes a black screenshot. So, well, he, he has an iphone,

471
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,579
he's breaking the law. Kurt, your son is a criminal.

472
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,670
You know, he just,

473
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,760
he likes to have the title cards of the stuff he likes

474
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,160
to watch because it helps him communicate what he wants to see.

475
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:33,489
Right. Right. Right.

476
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,229
So, anyways without getting into an argument about, you know,

477
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,869
making things more accessible.

478
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,900
The point is,

479
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:45,050
I think a lot of people seriously think NFTS somehow give you magic.

480
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm gonna use this word carefully control over that NFT

481
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,819
and it does not give you control over that NFT.

482
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,880
It gives you a record of ownership within and I don't even

483
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,560
know what to call it a name space within an organization.

484
00:20:57,699 --> 00:20:58,119
Like

485
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,989
to put it simply if I choose not to really rec like

486
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:05,060
I have to recognize yacht club's authority

487
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,150
to then take those NFTS seriously.

488
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,469
And I suspect that's actually where the NFT market is going to go

489
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,599
is to this sort of model of

490
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:15,689
like this is a Gucci NFT. Whereas this is like a Walmart NFT.

491
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:20,219
I mean, maybe, you know, there will be these higher end NFT organizations that have,

492
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,040
you know, like certificates.

493
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,229
Remember back in the day when you know that the the certificate makers were like, oh,

494
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,989
we charge more for our certificate because our

495
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,949
web certificates are better and it's like they're not

496
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,989
what

497
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:31,910
-- I
-- mean,

498
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,010
it was just as trusted as this other cheap one.

499
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,130
Well, they, they might have been, they might not have been,

500
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,069
-- but it didn't matter at the end of the day,
-- you know, and this is the exact same market,

501
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,780
-- like basically web certificates are NFT si
-- mean, kind of,

502
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,219
I want to tie this all together

503
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,900
now that we're coming to the end because I think you kind

504
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,180
of brought up an interesting point just now where you mentioned,

505
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:51,630
people don't know what this stuff is.

506
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,719
And I think this is true from the Norton perspective, from the NFT perspective,

507
00:21:57,729 --> 00:22:02,430
from the perspective of a guy who got his ape stolen, which is still like, I'm sorry,

508
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:05,560
I keep laughing in my head every time I say that because it's just, it is very,

509
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:09,770
I feel very bad for this person because they, they genuinely lost a valuable item.

510
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,689
But there's a lot of misunderstanding.

511
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:14,979
My suspicion is the Norton leadership doesn't really understand what's going on.

512
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,300
I think normal people don't understand NFT SI think there's tons of confusion.

513
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,819
And I think what happens

514
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,250
is when you have these environments

515
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,170
that are ripe with confusion

516
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,410
and, and quite often the information is impossible to,

517
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,410
to figure out because there's so much of it on, on every side of the equation,

518
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,180
you end up with scammers,

519
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:39,180
right? Because they know they can take advantage of confusion.

520
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:44,079
They know they can do like pump and dump. Actually, I just listened to uh uh Vice.

521
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,780
Vice has a motherboard podcast called Cyber.

522
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:49,859
And this morning there was an episode, they talked about,

523
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,180
remember when the people tried to buy the constitution,

524
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:55,069
but through the Ethereum, smart contracts,

525
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:57,449
I forget, I forget what they call it. It has some fancy name,

526
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,689
but basically what ends up happening is it doesn't happen.

527
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:02,589
Most people can't actually get their Ethereum

528
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,189
back because there's all these high fees on

529
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,880
it and the amount of Ethereum they put in was less than the fees.

530
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,619
And so they literally planned on a pump and dump scam

531
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,560
to make their coins, their, their people

532
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:17,084
coins, they were called worth more. So they could like, not lose money.

533
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:17,885
I mean,

534
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:21,584
what? Well, dude, if all my money is invested in like Brix,

535
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:23,145
I'm for sure when Brix

536
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:25,525
starts to crumble, I'm going to be like, no, no, no things are fine.

537
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:26,415
And by the way, I have some bri

538
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:27,454
X stock to sell you.

539
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,125
Yeah, I mean, it,

540
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:34,439
-- it's like the story of humanity, I guess is I
-- have something really valuable here.

541
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:35,089
You want

542
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,369
-- it.
-- There's always,

543
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,329
there's a small number of people who if presented with the opportunity will take

544
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:46,170
advantage of another person even if it ends in that other person's demise.

545
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:48,510
-- Absolutely.
-- I mean, and

546
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:53,750
it makes me sad, but this is, I guess that's part of it too. None of this is new.

547
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,430
There have been grifters, there have been con artists, you know,

548
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:00,300
snake oil salesmen, carpet baggers, the

549
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:03,839
Cryptocurrency space. Everybody's like, oh, what about this new thing?

550
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:04,359
And I'm like,

551
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,380
yeah, we did that in the.com boom, like 20 years ago. Like we did exactly that thing.

552
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,770
But it was like with cat litter instead of, you know, crypto tokens.

553
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:13,780
Right.

554
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,290
Like,

555
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,459
you know.

556
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,319
Yeah,

557
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,579
I, I don't even know what to say.

558
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:22,680
-- Sometimes it's
-- probably don't invest in things you don't understand.

559
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:26,400
But then the problem is a lot of people think they understand these things and, well,

560
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,280
it turns out they don't.

561
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,599
Well, you, yes. Yes.

562
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:32,599
And this is one of the challenges is there's the fear of

563
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:35,479
missing out people who want to get in right away because this,

564
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,199
someone said this is valuable.

565
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:42,030
I, I'll never forget there was, I knew a guy who is always one of those,

566
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,469
this, this one thing like this is it. We're all gonna get rich. If we do this,

567
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,989
I'll never forget. He calls the,

568
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:50,119
he calls the house.

569
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,219
I was living in looking for a, a friend of ours who was a, he was a lawyer,

570
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:57,109
he went to college at my university and then he graduated and became a lawyer.

571
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,380
And he's like, oh, I'm looking for this guy.

572
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,270
Like I'll let him know when I see him next.

573
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,989
I saw him at a bar a couple of days and I'm like, oh, so and so is looking for you.

574
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:04,172
And he looked at me and said,

575
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:09,253
I would rather throw my money into the street than give any of it to him.

576
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:13,133
And I'll never forget just how serious and, and blunt he was about it. It's like, oh,

577
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:14,973
I get it, you know,

578
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:17,223
you know, anytime this person calls you,

579
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,973
it's, it's a complete waste.

580
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:20,032
And so you get some of that,

581
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,873
you have people who think they know what's going on and they maybe don't,

582
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:24,916
maybe they can confused, maybe they were lied to.

583
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:26,076
I mean, it could be anything.

584
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:26,365
Well,

585
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:30,765
there's also if you hop on the bandwagon soon enough and get in on that ground floor.

586
00:25:30,786 --> 00:25:31,595
Yeah, you can

587
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:32,605
put your money

588
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:32,806
in.

589
00:25:33,276 --> 00:25:34,456
I don't think that's true though.

590
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:39,196
My suspicion is the people who make a lot of money on this kind of stuff.

591
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:40,635
They know how it works.

592
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:43,715
They know how to talk about it in a way that's confusing

593
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,410
and you know what I mean? Like they're getting in

594
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:50,329
well before any of these other people, they know what they're doing.

595
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,050
So, a perfect example of this is,

596
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,430
and I need to assign a GSD for this because it's like a new,

597
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,160
it's, it's like a combination of scam and technical issue.

598
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,569
We'll put a link to the Tweet where the person explains it better than I can.

599
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:01,540
But basically

600
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,119
a few hours ago, a promising token called Dollar Sign Year was air dropped.

601
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,979
So airdrop means literally they send these tokens out free to people

602
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:12,380
supposedly because they like somehow help the token come to be or

603
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:13,380
whatever

604
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:13,979
anyways.

605
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,130
It was set up as a year in review of

606
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,339
your Ethereum transaction history less than an hour ago,

607
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,290
that turned into a painful experience for buyers of the token.

608
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,459
Here's how they pulled the rug in under six hours and

609
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:25,260
the, the basic long and the short of days you got this year token

610
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,319
and then

611
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,599
to kind of really exploit it, you had to buy

612
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:34,369
another Cryptocurrency that wasn't very liquid and it was through

613
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,739
a smart contract that had some shenanigans in it.

614
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,959
So basically this contract started out unverified, like all Ethereum contracts.

615
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:44,819
Then it got flipped to verified people basically looked at it, quasi,

616
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,479
audited it and said that looks fine.

617
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:49,239
Yeah. And it, there was a, there was an issue in it

618
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,380
that was intentional. A back door basically.

619
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,400
And so essentially they locked up all the money

620
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,780
sent to this contract and then liquidated it and,

621
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,910
and took the money and ran.

622
00:26:58,979 --> 00:26:59,469
Wow.

623
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,410
And

624
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,589
you know,

625
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:02,880
this scam,

626
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:06,949
uh probably took weeks to set up and plan

627
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:07,329
for

628
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,729
six hours to execute

629
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:09,530
and

630
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,689
like it's gone now,

631
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,770
I mean, this is one of my complaints about Ethereum smart contracts.

632
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,770
The Ethereum smart contract language is turning complete

633
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,219
-- well and it's not only is it turn complete but it's not well understood.
-- No, I

634
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:22,560
know.

635
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:27,329
And so the ability to hide backdoors in it or even just accidentally put bugs in it is

636
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:29,319
it's, it's too difficult

637
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:31,439
and there's no way you can when, when

638
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,359
a, when a computer language is turned complete,

639
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:38,280
we currently lack the ability to do formal verification on that language.

640
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,439
Well, see, I think it's worse in a way because the theory contracts tend to be short.

641
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:43,910
People tend to think that they actually understand them

642
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,800
and then say, yeah, this looks good to me, you know, seal of approval and

643
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,939
you can have something very simple with a very subtle, very bad flaw.

644
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,180
No, I, I agree.

645
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:56,959
And I've read horror stories of people who've made subtle mistakes that

646
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,719
vanish tons of Ethereum because they, they,

647
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:02,640
it was like off by one type errors and stuff in their smart contract.

648
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,439
It's, it's, it's fascinating

649
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,640
and then worse, you have, you know, like the Obfuscated Sea Contest where

650
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,140
I love how there's always sort of two types

651
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,979
of general entries to the Obfuscated Sea Contest.

652
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:14,390
There's the ones that look like the line noise and you're like, how,

653
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,800
you know, how, how does this work? Right?

654
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,229
Like literally, you look at it and it's like this, this is, this is line noise,

655
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:22,219
you know,

656
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:23,989
and then there's the ones where it's like,

657
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:24,729
no, that's a,

658
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:28,449
that's a perfectly normal looking implementation of Hello world in seven lines

659
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,079
and, and then it like eats your computer or, you know, play the star

660
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:36,420
-- spangled banner
-- also more impressively. There's the underhanded C program

661
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:36,739
that

662
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:37,449
I was thinking of,

663
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:41,979
but the Obfuscated is good to be the underhanded was David Wheeler pointed me

664
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:42,890
where

665
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:44,119
it, it, this,

666
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,969
this is code that looks like it does one thing and

667
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:49,680
you can make it do a completely different thing and it is

668
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:54,329
amazing. But again, this is c is turning complete c can do literally anything

669
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:54,660
but

670
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,630
c at least we theoretically have a history of it and understanding of it.

671
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,410
E thee and solidity is pretty new

672
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,329
and there's very few experts in it.

673
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,410
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, we should,

674
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,390
we should call this before we, we go down this rat hole.

675
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:11,349
I think that's what the problem is, is who are the experts in the crypto space?

676
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,540
And the answer is like, I don't know.

677
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,609
And I track this space and there's,

678
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,319
there's definitely people that are knowledgeable

679
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,449
but some of them I'm definitely suspicious of because they're, you know,

680
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,270
like Bitcoin or Ethereum maximalist.

681
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,199
So their, their motives are

682
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:23,969
little bit dodgy.

683
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,719
-- Well, I mean, look,
-- this is, here's how I want to end this.

684
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:33,319
What you just described is exactly what the banking system looked like 100 years ago

685
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:37,560
where there were tons of dodgy people, there were tons of people doing crazy things

686
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,800
and it had to be regulated.

687
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:41,869
And this is the thing I think about

688
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,280
the Cryptocurrency space is everyone always talks about,

689
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,219
oh, it's deregulated.

690
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:46,430
We can do whatever we want.

691
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:48,079
The government can't stop us.

692
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,930
If a large world government decides to crack down on crypto,

693
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,180
they're gonna do it and there's nothing you can do about it

694
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,969
because the places that won't like

695
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,380
as soon as uh like Europe or the United States or China

696
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,540
says no more crypto,

697
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:03,729
the price is going to crash and it's going to

698
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:05,780
become useless because you can't do anything with it.

699
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,319
And that's just the reality of it,

700
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,500
the black market. But yeah, basically,

701
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,459
yeah, but I mean, even with a black market, the value is going to be so low,

702
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,739
it's not going to be that useful. Right?

703
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:17,550
I

704
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,609
mean, that's just the reality of it. That that's how this stuff works.

705
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,719
I'm actually more worried about Bitcoin's deflationary

706
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:24,550
spiral that's built into the protocol.

707
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,699
That's another story. But again, the developers can fix that if they want to.

708
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,199
I don't know,

709
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:30,489
I

710
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,609
don't know the whole thing. I just,

711
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:35,280
here's what I keep coming down to.

712
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,869
What's something truly useful I can do with cryptocurrencies and people are like,

713
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,599
oh, you can buy stuff in like countries without paying fees and it's kind of like,

714
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:43,569
yeah,

715
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:46,319
kind of sort of, but not really.

716
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,630
I know.

717
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,280
