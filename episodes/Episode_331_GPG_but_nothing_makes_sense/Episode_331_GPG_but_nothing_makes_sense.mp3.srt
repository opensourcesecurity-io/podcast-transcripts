Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,029
Kurt Siefried and my partner in doing things far more

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,500
complicated than they ever needed to be Josh Presser.

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:17,530
Yeah, that's an understatement for sure. I don't, I don't think you realize

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,010
exactly

5
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:23,110
the Pandora's Box. We are going to open today. Kurt. You really don't.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,290
I remember how bad mine was.

7
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:29,520
So we're talking about PP keys and of course, us being not normal people, we,

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:29,850
we didn't,

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,209
we weren't just satisfied to have a P GP key because one does not simply have

10
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:33,474
a

11
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:34,025
PJ

12
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:34,224
PKI.

13
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:35,645
I had one,

14
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:37,694
I had three root keys that then signed it

15
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,805
like an intermediate key that then signed my key.

16
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:42,764
And for the life of me, I don't remember why it doesn't even make sense.

17
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,805
Well, because they're all stored on the same system

18
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,645
-- that
-- whatever, whatever. All right. So what we're going to do today,

19
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:50,314
gentle listener

20
00:00:50,494 --> 00:00:53,215
is this is something Kurt and I have talked about for a long time

21
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:54,115
is

22
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,630
I, we want to explain the insane setups we had for our GP G keys in the past.

23
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:05,349
And the reason we can do this now is we have both revoked our keys

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,110
and we have no intention of generating new keys.

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,540
We've

26
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:11,839
-- given up. And
-- even if I did, I wouldn't do it anything like this anyway.

27
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,690
So I'm comfortable talking about all of the ridiculous things I did

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,059
to protect and I'm using air quotes when I say protect to protect my key.

29
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:21,985
I even have a hardware P GP key thing from,

30
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,065
I bought years ago from that German company like, oh,

31
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:26,745
-- I've been through
-- several of those are, we'll get to those.

32
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:29,324
I just, I've straight up, I've given up on P GP.

33
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,504
I, I'm not too proud to admit it.

34
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:32,504
We have

35
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,504
-- many
-- episodes where we have complained about

36
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:38,305
P GP in G BT.

37
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,464
So I don't think we need to rehash

38
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:42,985
the many, many, many

39
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:44,105
shortcomings

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,040
of, of GP G.

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,330
I would say it. It's

42
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,919
I, I view it like

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,000
Star Wars episodes 12 and three where Anakin was supposed to be the chosen one,

44
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,480
but everything was just terrible.

45
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,580
-- And that was all
-- I think I not, you know,

46
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,089
it's funny because I'm just thinking about it and

47
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,180
I, to be clear, I think end to end encryption is important for some things,

48
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:04,930
but I think end to end encryption where you make the user

49
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,889
do all the key management is probably not the way to go.

50
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,899
And I think that's one of the challenges with a lot of cryptocurrencies and NFTS is if

51
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,100
the whole, you know, not your keys, not your crypto blah, blah blah. But like,

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,240
I don't want normal people having to do key management. That's insane.

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,779
And, and this is why I don't think encryption is ever caught on

54
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,830
at scale. Ok. Anyway, before we, and the topic is not

55
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,770
anything about encryption. It is

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,899
about the fact that we are lunatics.

57
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,820
So I will let you explain first because I have a strong

58
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,729
suspicion that your story isn't anywhere near as complicated as mine.

59
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,929
My setup was reasonably sane. Originally, I had

60
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,619
ki and then I kind of realized if I lost it or revoked it, that would be a chore.

61
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:44,139
So

62
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:47,149
I set up basically three root keys and like they,

63
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,250
I don't remember if I had like an intermediate signing key. I think I did.

64
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:52,440
And then I had like the key I actually kind of used on the daily.

65
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,720
The idea being if that daily key got compromised, I could very easily revoke it,

66
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,089
set up the new ones and you know,

67
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,869
my root keys were actually pretty well signed because, well,

68
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,929
I went to like there was a key signing party

69
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,929
once at CCC 999 outside Berlin where fun fact,

70
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,279
I actually helped Philip Zimmerman set up

71
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,179
the B GP VPN because it was broken on his laptop.

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,660
And like the guy

73
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:15,979
like any VPN client back in the day especially, they were garbage.

74
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,779
Like they just did not work without black magic.

75
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,639
And I'd actually caught that thing to work at some point

76
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,300
and I could not get it to work on his laptop.

77
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:22,729
It was just broken. And that's,

78
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:24,089
yeah. Anyways.

79
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,490
Yeah.

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,139
So I basically had three root keys,

81
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:29,330
maybe an intermediate key of memory serves and then, like, kind of a daily driver key

82
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,669
and I just sort of gave up on that and then I

83
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:34,630
just basically went to one key and I used to religiously sign

84
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,639
all my emails and I did a lot of email to like,

85
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,710
oh, is that security and stuff?

86
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,139
And like the CV assignments

87
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,759
and like straight up, nobody cared.

88
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,309
I just stopped signing it one day and nobody complained.

89
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,860
And what kind of drove it?

90
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:45,350
Like, what,

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,220
what started to crack for me is I remember

92
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,830
Sousa sent out a security advisory that was signed improperly

93
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,490
and

94
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,610
I replied to, you know, I think it was Mark or Tom

95
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,729
saying, you know, hey, I like,

96
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,220
I don't think you've been spoofed but like this is not signed properly, like,

97
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,770
what's going on?

98
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:01,880
He's like, oh, we,

99
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,009
we'll reissue it.

100
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,169
We made a mess, whatever, made a boo boo and they reissued it and a week later,

101
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:07,690
I'm like,

102
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,100
yeah, I'm really curious, like,

103
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,130
how many people complain? He's like, you and one other person,

104
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:15,089
I'm like, oh, I'm like, did any of the certs or anything complain?

105
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,019
He's like, nope, the

106
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,339
whole point of signing this email is that if it's not signed, it's not me blah, blah,

107
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:19,738
blah, blah.

108
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,869
And nobody cares.

109
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:22,609
That's it.

110
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,410
-- That's all you got pretty
-- much. That's, I just, I,

111
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,859
and then I remember and you can find these emails, but I tried,

112
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,309
basically, I manually sort of generated some funky signed email where I was like,

113
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,660
cutting and pasting the footers and the headers and stuff.

114
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,029
And depending on like,

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,750
how you did that Thunderbird would show it as

116
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,190
a correctly signed email when it was like,

117
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,119
totally not

118
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:40,260
like,

119
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,570
like I'm talking like repeating blocks and like the logic to sort out what part of

120
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:47,850
the message is signed and is not signed is like super broken and still is.

121
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,690
And and that's another thing is just

122
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:51,760
this,

123
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,690
this stuff doesn't work reliably.

124
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:58,149
So like ignoring all the security properties of it, it just does not work reliably.

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,070
Like as we've seen

126
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,910
every single secure messaging gateway system now is like

127
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,149
here's a link

128
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,829
like we're not sending you the email.

129
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,350
So

130
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:07,470
it's just,

131
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,450
but you click this link and like log in with user name and password and read the email.

132
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,220
It's like, yeah, cool. Like,

133
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,619
yeah, like I said,

134
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,239
end to end encryption is really hard and especially in

135
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,510
a

136
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,429
Federated system like email,

137
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,570
I'm gonna go with,

138
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,700
it's impossible. And I'm going to say that confidently because

139
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,489
we still don't have it.

140
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:27,619
-- It's 2022 and we don't have it.
-- We,

141
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:30,170
we might not need it. It's part of the part of this also.

142
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,929
I mean,

143
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:33,850
it's, that, that's probably a topic for another day

144
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,299
and if you do it, you lose spam filtering, which I kind of like.

145
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:41,079
That's true. Anyway. And, and I will put in a

146
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,730
link to the XK CD comic

147
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:46,070
that talks about P GP, signed

148
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,350
males.

149
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,489
It's top notch anyway. All right. All right. Buckle up, Kurt.

150
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,549
Here we go.

151
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,750
All right. I'd write this down just so everyone knows because

152
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:59,149
there was a lot to remember

153
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,149
and

154
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,329
I dialed this one up to an 11. All right. All right. So

155
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,649
this is not a made up story. I want to stress that this is literally real

156
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,350
and this is who the person I used to be.

157
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,630
And I'm, I'm, I

158
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:16,739
like to think I'm far more pragmatic and sensible now.

159
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:20,540
-- But like this is all real. You know what,
-- realistically,

160
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:20,980
I,

161
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,079
I think if you know people in the infosec

162
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,720
community there is that niche subset that is just

163
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,820
like over engineers and over complicates things to some absurd degree.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,220
That is, this

165
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,489
is

166
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,910
this? All right. All right. So here's how we start, right?

167
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,910
I have to generate a

168
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,200
P GP key.

169
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,910
And so what I would do and this is the whole,

170
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,149
how are you going to generate a key in a manner that is secure?

171
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,209
I had a laptop

172
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:54,390
that I literally used for P GP operations. It was an old laptop, like very old laptop

173
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:56,700
that I took the hard drive out of.

174
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,630
And I would only boot it from a CD, like AC, a CD R, right?

175
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,100
I would burn a Linux distribution to this. I would boot it

176
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,029
and then I would do what I needed to do.

177
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,970
So in the case of the first time I generated my, my P GP key, I used this machine.

178
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,829
No network,

179
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:20,200
-- no hard drive, booting off a CD R. Stupid
-- question. What was your entropy source?

180
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:24,170
If there's no hard drive or network activity to see the kernel stuff back in the day,

181
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:25,600
the keyboard and stuff.

182
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:26,839
-- I was using X
-- windows.

183
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,070
Oh So you little, I,

184
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,209
I guess this was back in the day where literally P GP would say like mash your,

185
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,019
like roll your face on your keyboard for a bit.

186
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:34,760
That's right. That's right.

187
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,730
Yep. Yep. Exactly. That. And so,

188
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:38,959
so we have entropy.

189
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,869
I had my entropy.

190
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,420
I generated my key and of course, when you generate the key,

191
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:48,239
the hip thing to do is you generated the, what did they call it?

192
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,299
Was it the master key and then the sub keys. I forget the exact terminology.

193
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,440
Now it's been too long,

194
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,250
but basically I generated like the master key

195
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,350
and then I always generated the three sub keys.

196
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:00,670
Now, mind you, I only generated things a couple of times.

197
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,670
So it's not like I did this a lot.

198
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:05,190
But because I was a freak, I literally kept this computer like in the closet.

199
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,510
It was a very old laptop whose only job

200
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,589
was P GP. And I'll explain why I actually needed this multiple times

201
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,230
in

202
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,399
a

203
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,750
little bit because I, I did things with this key on, on, we'll say every year or so. Ok.

204
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,329
So I generate my key right

205
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,339
now. When you generate your P GP key,

206
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,790
it asks you for a password, right?

207
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,649
How are you going to protect

208
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,450
your super secret and sensitive P GP key?

209
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:32,450
No password managers right back then.

210
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,070
Not that not that I would have trusted a password manager.

211
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,349
So what I had to do was find a way to create an extremely long,

212
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,630
extremely complicated password.

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,869
Oh God. Were you one of those people that picked a book and typed in a page of it?

214
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,270
Yes. Yes. Actually not

215
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,109
a page. Not a page. Not a page. Ok.

216
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:53,169
No, no, I thought about the fact that I could take a book and,

217
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,409
and type a paragraph or a sentence or whatever.

218
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,969
And I realized that there are different editions of a book

219
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,489
and so you can't necessarily trust the text

220
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:05,489
of the book. So in my case, Lord of the Rings was the book I picked.

221
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,210
So you're worried about like your house burning down, get a new copy of the book.

222
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,849
-- You can't access your pass phrase or
-- like the,

223
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,229
the NSA breaking into my house and stealing my

224
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,669
copy of Lord of the Rings so they can feel

225
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,880
them, you know, like, like whatever, whatever Right.

226
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:17,729
So

227
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:21,849
I feel like we're, we're getting close to the territory where I should be like

228
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,530
advising you to seek professional help and medication.

229
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:28,750
I told you this is all like, like that whole XK CD like, oh no,

230
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,929
he's used like quadruple whatever encryption,

231
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,580
like take this wrench and hit him with it.

232
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:39,530
Like I, yeah, I was, I was the first panel in that comic 100%. And so anyway, what I did

233
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:40,369
was,

234
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:43,984
and I spent an enormous amount of time trying to figure out how to do this in the the is

235
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:47,534
it the index? I don't even know what it's called.

236
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,125
Like the thing at the back of the Lord of the Rings

237
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,734
where they like explain a lot of the lore and stuff.

238
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:55,905
The Hobbits in the Shire had their own calendar.

239
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:59,195
And so I used the 12 months of the Shire

240
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:01,965
calendar which I'll put a link in the show notes,

241
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:05,025
but I'm going to read them because I can because they're really weird.

242
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,565
There's uh after ye

243
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,585

life. Wed Math

Heath. Winter filth, which is my favorite one.

252
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:22,039
Black Math and for

253
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:22,200
you.

254
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,659
So you use just those 12 months written out.

255
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:28,700
Ah ah Here, here is where it gets interesting.

256
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:34,219
Yes. And I can't tell you if there was punctuation or spaces

257
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,659
between any of the words.

258
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,239
-- And so every
-- because honestly, that sounds like a classic, you know, like,

259
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,340
what are his hobbies?

260
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,840
Ok. Like use those dictionary lesson. They like, assuming.

261
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:44,659
Well, yeah, if you just type the words in straight up,

262
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,109
it would obviously brute force.

263
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,159
Not too, too long.

264
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,080
-- They
-- weren't,

265
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,960
there was something wrong.

266
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:53,880
It wasn't just the words because every time I had to unlock this key,

267
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,549
it took no less than 20 tries because it wasn't

268
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:00,429
just the words. I had some spaces and some punctuate.

269
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:01,294
Like

270
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:04,825
so some of the letters were capital, I don't remember anymore what it was,

271
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:06,945
but I know it was very, very, very complicated.

272
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:13,025
And in fact, when I had to at first, Kurt suggested we, we revoke our keys like,

273
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,405
like on the podcast.

274
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,265
And I'm like, no, because I have to type this password in.

275
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:20,645
And it's literally going to take me an hour to type it in. You get the point, right?

276
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:22,625
Obviously, when I revoked this key,

277
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:25,705
it took me like an hour because I had to remember how to type the password in.

278
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:26,784
Now, I will say

279
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:32,450
I unlocked the key on a network attached computer which literally

280
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,929
that key had never seen a network before.

281
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:38,929
But anyway, ok, we're just getting started though. Lucky for us. Ok.

282
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,869
So I've got my offline computer,

283
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:45,049
I've got my ridiculously long password and then

284
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,359
I have to figure out what am I gonna do with this key?

285
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,289
Now, storing the key on anything

286
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:52,369
was unacceptable to me. Right?

287
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:55,280
So the key, what I did was I bought.

288
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:58,960
So there were you mentioned that the, the hardware, whatever key,

289
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,590
hsm I don't know what to call them.

290
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:05,000
I went through what, 1234 of these over the life of my key,

291
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,280
I started out with a thing called an E token.

292
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,960
And then I moved to something called the crypto stick and the crypto stick.

293
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:13,039
I still have the crypto stick. The funny story about that

294
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:17,580
is a friend sent it to me and crypto stick was like some hardware.

295
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,039
Yeah, some nitro key people.

296
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,380
Yeah.

297
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,400
-- It was that like red little thing.
-- It was red

298
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:27,239
and I had like one of the early, early, early versions. It might have been in the beta

299
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,700
testing phase.

300
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,380
But anyway,

301
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:32,789
I still have the crypto stick in my bank vault

302
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:33,909
because

303
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,059
I can't erase it for whatever reason I couldn't get the key off of it.

304
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:42,140
-- You
-- know what that I vaguely remember having trouble with mine as well.

305
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,729
And, and because I'm a nut,

306
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,349
I was, I, I didn't feel like just smashing it was acceptable.

307
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,900
I had to actually make sure it was in a safe place.

308
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,739
I could, I could check on it every now and then and make sure it was still there.

309
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,880
So now actually next time I go to the bank I can

310
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,679
take it and just throw it out because the keys revoked.

311
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,520
-- I don't
-- care or just smash it with a hammer

312
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,380
because I'm pretty sure the NSA is not going to run

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,830
a, a hardware level

314
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,580
-- chip recovery
-- and, and the best part is

315
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,929
nothing I ever did was particularly exciting. Like this key had no value.

316
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:12,239
So anyway,

317
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,869
I had a crypto stick and then I went to actually the FSFE,

318
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,619
the free software foundation, Europe.

319
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,969
Uh, the, the, what they call the GP G cards,

320
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,460
-- right where you got a little smart card.
-- Those were awesome.

321
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,159
-- Yeah, they were very nice. And I had one of
-- those with the

322
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:27,289
Gemalto card reader.

323
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,219
Yep. Yep.

324
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:28,820
But well,

325
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,539
so what I did is I actually found a keychain like a reader that

326
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:36,099
used the whatever the mini SIM size was because you could punch out the,

327
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:36,859
the chip

328
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:41,099
and I had one I put on my keychain and then I would because part of part of the,

329
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:44,109
the goal of this was the key also was with me at all times.

330
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:48,099
Like I didn't do things without my key. If I traveled, the key came with me

331
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,979
when I left the house, the key came with me.

332
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,609
So it had to be on a keychain, right? It had to be with me,

333
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:54,869
right? You're, it's no one can see this.

334
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,520
But Kurt's looking at me as if there's something wrong with me,

335
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,479
which we know like this bringing it with me is the least weird thing I've done so far.

336
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:01,979
Like, come on.

337
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,840
-- So anyway, I remember I, I had a couple of those and those.
-- How did you back the ski up?

338
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:08,599
We'll get to that.

339
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,390
So,

340
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,599
so we put it on that and then I ended actually with the UI

341
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:12,869
key

342
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,960
because not everyone knows this, but you can use a UI

343
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:16,669
key.

344
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:17,960
It has

345
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,510
uh you can, you can upload like different

346
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:23,979
what they call them applications or something. I forget the exact term they use.

347
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,219
But basically, you can turn your UI

348
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:25,869
key

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,679
into a UI

350
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,830
key slash P GP smart card basically.

351
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:34,840
And so that's actually where, where my story ended was, that was my final one.

352
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:36,409
But anyway, this is why

353
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,039
I needed to

354
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,460
get the key

355
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,400
and

356
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,599
unlock it on a, on a regular basis because I went through these different tokens.

357
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,299
And so every time, like for example,

358
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:49,539
I needed to load my key into the next hardware module.

359
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,000
I had to take my,

360
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,320
my laptop dedicated just to this key.

361
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:58,969
Put my burn a new CD R because I couldn't use the same CD R twice.

362
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:01,690
For, for whatever reason, I, I don't know why that was like,

363
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,140
I had to burn a brand new one.

364
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,969
And as soon as I took the old one out,

365
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:09,530
-- I had to destroy it
-- probably because the old CD RS like bit rot and like,

366
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,109
-- like I literally remember burning C DS
-- and just this was in,

367
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:18,205
in case an attacker somehow burnt my key onto the CD R

368
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,684
but just put a read only drive in the machine.

369
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:21,364
-- Uh,
-- I

370
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:26,164
didn't have a read only CD drive because it was an old laptop. It, it didn't,

371
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,804
actually, it might not, it might not have been able to burn CD. Si, don't remember.

372
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,385
And that laptop is long gone now

373
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,500
because that, that is actually a good reason to boot like a secure system off of a CD R

374
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:40,320
because if it has a read only drive, then it by definition, like,

375
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm not going to say you can't store state on the system at all because there's

376
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,580
like network cards and stuff or bits of ra M in the bios and stuff.

377
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,390
But it's really hard.

378
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,250
Actually, I'll

379
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:49,750
trying to find the link to it when,

380
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,570
when Gr Glenn Greenwald destroyed the laptop, that specific

381
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:54,849
notice,

382
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,390
they, they told him, like, you need to drill in these places on your laptop and,

383
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,690
and the assumption is

384
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,979
those were the locations of, of memory.

385
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:04,669
But,

386
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,890
and like, we don't, we don't exactly know, someone might have done an analysis.

387
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,919
-- It wasn't me.
-- Well, there's a lot of stuff that is flash ram in it for bios

388
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,169
and for firmware now. And like,

389
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,969
like your printer, your, and in your computer,

390
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,409
I mean, in a, well, as we discussed previously, like a computer now has like,

391
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,109
10 computers in it, like the

392
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,969
management engine and your network card and your sound card and your blah, blah.

393
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:29,994
Yep. Yep. Exactly. Exactly. Ok. Ok. So now

394
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:35,354
I've got my key on my laptop. I got to get it off. So, what I actually did

395
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:39,554
is I put the key onto a USB drive

396
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:43,344
that then went to the bank. So that's not too crazy for backups. Right

397
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,265
-- now. I kept,
-- uh,

398
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:46,875
that's actually pretty reasonable.

399
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:50,034
Yeah. II, I thought so. I kept two USB keys.

400
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,039
One

401
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,659
was in the bank and the other one I kept, what did I do to this?

402
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:59,609
Oh, the other one was an encrypted, like, like I encrypted the file system with a,

403
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,849
another password.

404
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:02,989
I don't remember exactly what it was,

405
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,530
but it was basically just an encrypted flash drive.

406
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,439
I kept in the house and I assume the two layers of encryption

407
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,689
were probably acceptable

408
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:12,469
in terms of keeping people.

409
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,140
I don't know, whatever th this one,

410
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,160
this one's a little more dodgy now that I think of it,

411
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,939
but obviously the one in the bank will say was fine.

412
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,118
And in fact, when I revoke my key, I had to go get the freaking thing out of the bank.

413
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,969
Well, you know, one thing I've not to say away too much,

414
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,250
but one thing I've always wondered

415
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:26,785
is how many

416
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:29,334
times because it's got to happen at least once a year.

417
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,135
But, you know,

418
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:33,635
various law enforcement government agents get some sort of like secret warrant

419
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:37,655
to go into a bank safety deposit box and, you know, like

420
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:39,604
they pick the lock and like rifle through the

421
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:41,805
stuff in there because that's got to happen.

422
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,750
I mean, it has to. Right.

423
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:49,060
-- You'd
-- think so. I mean, and, and you can get warrants that basically tell the people.

424
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:53,420
Right. Right. Right. Right. That you can't say, which is the whole canary thing,

425
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,410
which I still laugh at because I assume if you have a canary on, like,

426
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,439
-- your website they're gonna be like, you're gonna keep on using the
-- canary,

427
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,199
you can update it, but then you go to Federal

428
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:05,255
well, or, or you don't update it. Right. That's the point of the,

429
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:08,324
you're saying, oh, I haven't received a FISA warrant

430
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,145
and then one month I don't put that up and they're like, did you receive,

431
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,805
they would put a writer in the warrant because I feel like they're on to that.

432
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:17,114
I, I would, I would be shocked if they aren't like,

433
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,094
you're gonna keep updating this or like we're throwing you in federal prison and,

434
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:22,574
and you're gonna have a bad time.

435
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:24,214
So, anyway,

436
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,640
anyway, anyway. Ok.

437
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,910
So now I've got my computer,

438
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,199
I've got my single use CD RS.

439
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:37,030
I've got my key generated. I've got my key on the HSM.

440
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:41,219
And now it's time to actually try to be a functional citizen

441
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,189
of the internet with my keys.

442
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,109
You

443
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,280
can laugh. It's fine.

444
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,239
-- You know what?
-- Actually, you and I are pretty functional citizens of the internet.

445
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,219
-- We've done some, not terrible things. I do my
-- best. I do my best. Right.

446
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,829
And so now is where

447
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:58,589
when you generate your, your, your sub keys, you don't have a key, right?

448
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:03,209
You have a signing key, you have an encrypting key and I had an SSH key.

449
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:04,969
And so

450
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,689
I literally couldn't anytime I ssh, I had to plug in

451
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,449
this USB device

452
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,689
which would then

453
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,410
use my SSH key on the device and let me go somewhere then.

454
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,280
So why not? Just do what I did, which was have a

455
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,739
SSH keys and just don't put a passphrase on them.

456
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,500
So when you type SSH space host name, it just works

457
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,660
because that's what I've been doing for like 20 years and it's, it's glorious.

458
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,199
All right folks.

459
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,310
So if you, if you break into any of Kurt's accounts,

460
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,750
you know that he has unprotected SSH keys all over the place.

461
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,589
-- This sounds super safe
-- and in fairness, I have like, actually, no,

462
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,290
I just decommissioned one of the systems today.

463
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,020
There's, there's the pie in my basement and two test systems at the CS A.

464
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:46,229
That's all I can say to anymore.

465
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,829
Well, I guess technically the GSD digital ocean droplets. But

466
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:50,930
yeah, that's true.

467
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:52,569
That'll be gone soon. I hope.

468
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:53,189
Yeah.

469
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,400
-- But anyway, anyway,
-- a

470
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,410
long time ago I gave up on security over convenience.

471
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,390
I, I don't blame you necessarily. Now, I will say the, the thing that really

472
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,510
pushed me over the edge to get rid of these keys

473
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,390
was when I could use my,

474
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,170
my uh uh

475
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,489
but the Fido

476
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:12,750
tokens. What is it? U two F? I forget exactly

477
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,410
what they're called. But I've got like one of the, the Google Titan keys and I have UT

478
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,479
and you can

479
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,729
use them. So what happens is like, I have an, an SSH

480
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,609
key file thing on disk that has like the key

481
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,430
but SSH sends the encrypted key into the UB key.

482
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,199
I hit the button, it decrypt it and then it lets me ssh.

483
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:37,150
And so I still technically have an SSH T and a hardware device.

484
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,489
It's just a far more user friendly devices

485
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:41,180
that

486
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:42,160
level

487
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,640
-- of friction
-- now. But there's, there's two ways to do this.

488
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,359
You can have like all of the key material on device or you can separate it where like

489
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,050
the key lives on disk and it has to send stuff to the device.

490
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,829
And that's the option I picked because I feel like if it was all on device,

491
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,329
if someone has my device and they know what to look for,

492
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:03,140
like they could SSH around and I can, I, yeah,

493
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,660
I've got a couple of public machines I can ssh into.

494
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,479
Well, that's how I got like popped, like seared.org got popped ages ago where

495
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,530
uh there was wordpress vulnerability on a Friday and I'm like, oh, I'll fix it,

496
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,180
Monday, whatever.

497
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:13,540
And then

498
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,380
I didn't

499
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,675
fix it till later.

500
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:19,275
And there was also a local Linux kernel issue that again, I'll fix it. Monday

501
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:20,395
somebody got in

502
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:21,405
and I had, you know,

503
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:23,094
unrestricted trust between the host so that I

504
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:25,234
could like r sync stuff back and forth and

505
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:28,155
they, like, popped all my systems and it was like, yeah, whatever

506
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:28,635
it was

507
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,125
cre.org, like, yeah,

508
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:31,285
I'm not a bank.

509
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,810
But anyway, anyway,

510
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,520
and so obviously I had those three keys. I kept them safe. I also,

511
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:42,050
one of the other annoying parts is to use the,

512
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,750
the SS or to use the GP G keys for things like authentication and,

513
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,260
and signing in and other stuff.

514
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:54,030
You had to obviously copy around your dot G new PG folder to all my devices, right?

515
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,510
And, and

516
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:57,430
shockingly, it worked fine across like Linux

517
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,680
and Mac and Windows when I would put it in all the strange places which I mean,

518
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:02,229
that's really cool, good, good job guys.

519
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,670
That's not easy to always get right.

520
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,380
But then you,

521
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:06,969
I also had to set up the, the SS,

522
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,030
was it no GP G? There's a GP G agent process you had to run

523
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,589
and enable the SSH agent mode.

524
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,189
It's still completely broke uh pin entry,

525
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,910
it's still completely broken all the time on like ubuntu LTs running on Windows,

526
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,729
subsystem for Linux

527
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,709
version two.

528
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,510
That could be, I've actually never had a problem with pin entry

529
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,260
on any of the systems I used it on, but I was always,

530
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,459
I wasn't ever running in like WSL or anything.

531
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:34,369
I was always running like native OS X Windows or Linux

532
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,439
and,

533
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,689
and like that always worked.

534
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,500
But the, the agent

535
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,550
was always flaky for me where sometimes it would work.

536
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,170
Sometimes it wouldn't work and I have to kill it and then restart it.

537
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,260
And it was, it was unpleasant, we'll say to keep that going. But,

538
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,699
but basically, yeah,

539
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:52,650
and then,

540
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,949
and then what I would do, so I had all this set up every couple of years.

541
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:01,869
I would double check everything right. When I would load my new key into my device,

542
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,790
I still have most of my devices at the bank, I think.

543
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:05,670
And

544
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:11,390
yeah, that's pretty much my story of, of how I took care of all this stuff and it was,

545
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,459
it was pretty bananas now that I say it.

546
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,050
Well, yeah, I mean, I, I

547
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,630
this is part of why

548
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,729
I've gotten big into threat modeling and risk modeling is

549
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,829
so that I take an appropriate level of response.

550
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,790
Exactly that, you know, like a great example would be, my car has four wheels,

551
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,989
one of them may go flat.

552
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,150
So I want a spare tire

553
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,109
and so I did a quick bit of research

554
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,430
and the little turkey tire with the kit

555
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,579
is like 200 bucks. And I'm like, whoa, that's kind of the cost of a full size spare.

556
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,109
Might as well just get a full size spare.

557
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,949
So I did

558
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:46,060
and

559
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:49,989
most people don't bother buying a full size spare because a it's expensive. In

560
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:52,959
this case, it's the same cost as the little turkey tire in the kit.

561
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:55,339
And number two, because where do you keep the damn thing?

562
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:58,969
And in my case, my car actually has a full size spare tire well

563
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:00,640
in the trunk, right.

564
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,900
Which, like if I didn't have a spare tire, man, I could, like,

565
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,520
I could keep snacks in there or something.

566
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,390
I don't know, like it's a lot of snacks, so I have like a full size spare tire because I,

567
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,900
well, not so much now, but like I used to do some road trips outside the city and,

568
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,500
you know, having a real tire as a spare tire is

569
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:17,599
infinitely better than that little 5050 donut.

570
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:19,349
I feel like the car is gonna tip over whenever

571
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,099
I see somebody driving on it on the highway.

572
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:21,650
I mean,

573
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:22,569
so,

574
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,420
well, but basically,

575
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,359
but a great example of this is I don't bother having a

576
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:29,579
carjack in my car unless I'm going on a road trip.

577
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,939
Because if I get a flat tire in the city, I'll just call Amy

578
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,420
and they'll be there in like 20 minutes.

579
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,229
Well, and, and ok, so it,

580
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:38,510
it's funny you bring this up because I think you're exactly right where.

581
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,380
But if I go on a road trip, I do pack a car jack,

582
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,670
obviously because I don't want to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere.

583
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,469
-- I literally
-- don't. Well, ok, we'll get to that.

584
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:48,229
I'll, I'll talk about this in a second. But you're right. Like if you looked at the,

585
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,270
I guess

586
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:54,479
the, the whole like realistic threat model slash attack surface of what I was doing,

587
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:56,589
Josh, dropping his laptop in a bathtub.

588
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,189
That's the most likely scenario.

589
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:02,109
-- If someone
-- stole that key, what could they have really done virtually nothing?

590
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,410
Right. The key had minimal value.

591
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,040
And I mean, obviously in my head it was super important and,

592
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,109
and like the Russians or someone who was going to come get me.

593
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,660
But the reality is

594
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,900
it, it had minimal value. And I obviously,

595
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:18,770
I, I created an elaborate ridiculous process for myself that granted,

596
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,900
I only did this every other year or so.

597
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,920
-- So it's not like it ate an enormous amount of my time.
-- Well, companies do this too.

598
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,780
Like, you know, we're gonna get attacked by XY and Z.

599
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,459
It's like, no, you're not,

600
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:28,920
you're gonna get ransomware by somebody who's

601
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,939
like attacking every IP address on the planet

602
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:36,229
-- right,
-- right now, kind of tying that back to your, your tire model. Right?

603
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,430
So

604
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:40,229
in the, the little electric car I bought, right.

605
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,930
It has a range of 100 and 50 miles.

606
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:45,449
There's nowhere I'm going.

607
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:48,829
Like basically anywhere I go is in civilization with that car,

608
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,729
I drive it around town.

609
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:50,589
That's what it's for.

610
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:56,040
So I do not have a jack or a spare tire in that car. It has this like weird

611
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:59,439
chemical thing you can like inject in it and it'll like,

612
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:01,560
oh, the foam pump thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

613
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:04,359
It's like a one time use because it'll screw the valve stem and you have to,

614
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,839
-- I assume,
-- I assume the tire is trashed. Like

615
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,839
the rim might even be trashed.

616
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,660
No. No, no. It's actually really clever.

617
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,010
It's basically, it's like spray foam and compressed air

618
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:18,640
and it air cures. So, basically it'll, like, go into the crack cure and actually,

619
00:26:18,969 --> 00:26:20,880
like, unless you have like a blowout, it'll,

620
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,890
you'll be fine. Like you can go for a while on that.

621
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,910
The problem is that gunk gets into the valve stem and it may

622
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,069
basically re the valve stem in your tire and have you have to replace that.

623
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,109
Oh, I'm sure

624
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:33,250
you, you replace you, you gotta replace your

625
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,719
stems every time you get your tires anyway. Like

626
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,599
you don't do that.

627
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:39,599
I have no idea. Like I just, I bought,

628
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,859
I bought new tires, like

629
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:43,810
I bought new tires like three days ago and they

630
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,119
didn't mention anything about valve stems on my winter tires.

631
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,530
I

632
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,079
don't know.

633
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,729
Look, I, but although you change your tires a lot,

634
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:52,150
like I get new tires like every five years,

635
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:54,319
-- like
-- every six months because we have winter and summer

636
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,560
and there are two very distinct states of being here

637
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,599
where I live.

638
00:26:58,609 --> 00:26:59,390
I get new tires like,

639
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,560
every five years I just get the all season because I live in the city and I don't care

640
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,020
that

641
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:03,709
work

642
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:08,439
and I get, I just, they, they replace my vel stamps. It's like $40 and I don't care.

643
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,119
And it's fine

644
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,069
anyway. Anyway. Right.

645
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,359
But, but I think this is exactly the point is now when I drove

646
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,150
our minivan

647
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,859
out to Mount Rushmore, which was pretty freaking like I had,

648
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:24,609
there were many times I didn't have cell service on that trip and there were times

649
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:26,849
I didn't see another car for hours while

650
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:28,989
we were driving around in the middle of nowhere

651
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,079
in the, you know, western

652
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,989
part of the United States.

653
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:34,250
Now,

654
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,729
I wouldn't dream of driving around there without a

655
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,469
spare tire because if you got a flat,

656
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,810
you could literally spend

657
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,609
a day or more.

658
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,130
You know what I mean? Without, without seeing humans. And that would be terrible.

659
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,260
Yeah.

660
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,829
No, when I go on car trips I take up like a full sled jack because I'm like,

661
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,489
I don't want to be

662
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,329
ding around that stupid little like

663
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,739
tints, chintzy,

664
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,180
you know, looks like it's going to collapse and can barely hold up a cat,

665
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:58,050
let alone my entire

666
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:58,739
whatever.

667
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,780
It'd probably work. It'd probably be fine.

668
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:01,079
But

669
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,160
-- also
-- with the sled jack though, it's just so much faster. Right? You're like chunk,

670
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:04,560
chunk, chunk.

671
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:05,300
How

672
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,609
often? Ok. How many times have you had to replace a flat tire in a road trip?

673
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:11,900
Uh Not on a road trip, but I have done it twice in the city.

674
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:13,020
In the city.

675
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,359
We got some pretty impressive potholes. Fun fact. Um, the Mercedes run flat tires.

676
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:21,619
My sister and brother-in-law have like a nice Mercedes, you know,

677
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,780
with the run flat tires.

678
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,469
Yeah. No,

679
00:28:24,189 --> 00:28:28,449
there are potholes big enough here in Edmonton that they, like, killed their tire

680
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:29,920
that

681
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,449
anyway anyway.

682
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,170
-- No,
-- I've been to rim once.

683
00:28:34,189 --> 00:28:37,219
Like, no, seriously. Like, I hit a pothole in the dark and

684
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,219
impressive. I've been to rim,

685
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,989
I've never have I ever been to rim. I don't think I've ever been to rim.

686
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,030
It sucks because it's expensive.

687
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:47,770
Rims are tires are expensive, man.

688
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,930
Rims are meant to be sold in four packs.

689
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:51,155
So when you ask for one,

690
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:52,505
they give you a dirty look and they quote you

691
00:28:52,515 --> 00:28:54,385
some obscene price because also what are you gonna do?

692
00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:55,064
Not buy one?

693
00:28:56,905 --> 00:29:00,915
That's fair. That's fair. You gotta get some gold plated spinners on that sucker.

694
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:05,905
Yo. Anyway. Anyway. Alright. So yeah, I I guess

695
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,020
I don't know if there's a lesson here.

696
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:12,489
I know there is, I think the lesson you mentioned about having like realistic risks.

697
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,790
I've got a really good parallel.

698
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,329
There's a guy on Twitter talking about Os N and about not

699
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,209
like basically scrubbing your social media

700
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:20,969
profiles of yourself and all your workers

701
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:23,250
talking about like what kind of technologies and stuff they're into so

702
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,489
that the Attackers don't know what kind of technologies use at work.

703
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,060
And my reply was

704
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,089
instead of spending time like not like literally

705
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:31,760
spending effort to not talk about stuff,

706
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,050
maybe just like patch it and do an inventory.

707
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:36,910
I look,

708
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:38,650
my take on that II,

709
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,819
I saw that too and I don't remember if you're the person who sent me that

710
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:45,069
tweet or if I sent it to you or if we found it on our own.

711
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,109
But I, I do remember that. And

712
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,199
so my first thought was

713
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,989
if, if you're a moderately sized business,

714
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,819
you have all the tools

715
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:56,339
they have windows,

716
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,300
right?

717
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,560
Don't tell them

718
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,410
they'll never know.

719
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,300
Yeah. And they might have an iphone.

720
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,589
But, but more importantly,

721
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:06,869
I feel like

722
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,410
this is one of those situations of,

723
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,359
if someone knows the tools you're running and that puts you at a disadvantage, like,

724
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:15,229
I think you're doing some other things wrong.

725
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:19,420
This is, this is like security through obscurity. We know it doesn't work.

726
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,510
I'm not saying you should, like,

727
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,619
put a list on your website of all the tools you're running.

728
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:26,349
There's the thing people forget. It only works if

729
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,739
you can know that it's no longer obscure.

730
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,640
And you, you can't, like, by definition,

731
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,000
you can't know if something that is

732
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,000
confidential is no longer confidential unless someone,

733
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,040
like prints it on the front page of the Times.

734
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:38,849
And then the second problem is

735
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,239
you have to be able to swap that

736
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,550
secret out.

737
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:45,890
And so that's kind of why passwords sort of work is because like, oh,

738
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,719
my password's compromised, I will change it

739
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,839
all done. But like, you can't,

740
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,589
like if using Windows

741
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,420
version X

742
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:59,030
is a, is a, is a problem. Like, you can't just switch it out real fast for, like, limits

743
00:30:59,869 --> 00:30:59,989
and,

744
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:00,660
and that's,

745
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:03,010
that's what people get wrong about security through obscurity

746
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,859
is that for security through obscurity to work,

747
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:08,489
you have to know when it's no longer obscured and,

748
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,739
and that buy in of itself is pretty much the nail in the coffin that kills it.

749
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,329
But then that second factor of being able to swap it out

750
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,920
outside of passwords and certificates.

751
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,060
You can't

752
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,459
like, oh, we'll just use a different web parson library. No, no, you won't.

753
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:24,680
That will be your web does, will hate you.

754
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,010
Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's true.

755
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,000
I, I think that makes a lot of sense and I like that and I think,

756
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,750
and I guess that's just you have to deal with that. Like, that's the reality.

757
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,380
Make sure that's not something that's gonna take you down.

758
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,560
It's, that's like even I was,

759
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,250
I read a quote, a quote from someone that was basically something like

760
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,270
if I click a link and it damages our business,

761
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:47,140
like the problem isn't me clicking the link.

762
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,410
It's the fact that your security team is incompetent

763
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,569
is bad

764
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:55,910
if one person, like that's what always gets me with these ransomware attack is

765
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:59,859
so one person clicked one link and now your whole system's down in ransomware,

766
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:00,810
right?

767
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,520
Ok. That's

768
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:05,510
what if you had a malicious insider? Like how much worse. Is it gonna be

769
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,329
right?

770
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:09,729
Or somebody gets paid a bribe or,

771
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:12,270
or just some random clicks a link

772
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,930
and so, well, maybe put this in the journal notes. But like I literally have a github

773
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:20,250
repo called CS A Dash It Dash Operations where I'm like brain dumping

774
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,920
what I do for the new people and it's a public repo,

775
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,050
I'm OK with that.

776
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,890
I love putting this kind of stuff in public

777
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,050
because I think for one thing when you know,

778
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,410
people can look at your stuff, I think you do a better job

779
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:32,489
and, and just the fact is

780
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:35,640
this is not, this shouldn't be sensitive information.

781
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,619
Like if you're relying on this, you, you, you're doing other things wrong.

782
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:39,989
Yeah,

783
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,819
like obviously I'm not going to put a list of who uses windows

784
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:45,530
at the CS A because there's like a handful of us that do.

785
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,930
But, you know, like we just,

786
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:49,930
I ran one of the people through like how we're gonna handle

787
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:53,250
finna. Like here's, you know, first you see Glossy, the dog talking about it.

788
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,520
So he's a reputable source.

789
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,849
And then you see, well, MS RC and if MS RC says it's a vulnerability,

790
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,209
it's a vulnerability because

791
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:00,849
they don't do this for fun,

792
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,329
you know, and Cisa says it's a V and it's a phone because again,

793
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:05,819
Cisa very boring people, they tend to tell the truth

794
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:06,880
and, you know,

795
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,420
and here's the workarounds and they're lovely because

796
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,510
it's easy and it works and blah,

797
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,000
blah, blah,

798
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:12,800
you know, this is like a nice little public document and he's going to walk

799
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:13,719
up

800
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,050
the other window user at the CS A through fixing the system,

801
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:19,040
you know,

802
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,250
and yeah, so like there's like three, I,

803
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,939
I want to say four but I know for sure three of us using windows at the CS A.

804
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:27,359
Yeah. If knowing that leads

805
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,780
to us getting hacked.

806
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,989
Yeah, it's time for me to quit and become a part.

807
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,239
You suck.

808
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,099
You'd probably be a bad plumber just for the record.

809
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:37,790
I'm actually a reasonably

810
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:42,410
ok plumber because I use shark bite fittings and I actually read the manual and like

811
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,790
if I hired a plumber and they were using shark bite fittings, I'd be like,

812
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,000
you have a good day.

813
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,369
I'm going to call someone competent who isn't using shark bite fittings in my house.

814
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,880
Dude. I am so over. It's a better technology than slaughtering.

815
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,859
No, it's not, it's not at all. No

816
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,319
inferior

817
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:01,829
because it's like $20 a joint.

818
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,300
Yeah. But

819
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:07,569
again, we had this discussion, remember with the, um, with the marts versus the, um,

820
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,810
oh, what's the one from Europe called?

821
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,560
I'm spacing out.

822
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:12,090
But the thing is if you're paying your plumber hourly,

823
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,399
that shark bite fitting will pay for itself.

824
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,860
I don't know. I don't know about that.

825
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,379
I guarantee it won't.

826
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:20,958
Pex fittings are, are definite. I'm not getting into this right now.

827
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:23,858
-- We have to end this show. It's dragging on too long. Shark
-- bite.

828
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:27,079
-- Works on copper as well as pecs.
-- I know it does, it works on them all.

829
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:31,438
I've, I've used it to join copper to pecs in the past. Like I've done this.

830
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:34,958
But I'm still saying if I hire a plumber,

831
00:34:35,428 --> 00:34:38,717
I don't want them using shark bite like I can do shark bite. Right?

832
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:41,059
-- I'm hiring you because you're not me.
-- We

833
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:42,868
were talking about, remember Marts versus

834
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:45,478
Wago connectors. And the thing is a Wago connector saves so much time,

835
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,418
especially commercially. It just makes sense to pay more for the

836
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,580
Wago connectors, snap the wires together

837
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,300
and,

838
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,540
and that's, that's like another topic and I do like

839
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:58,260
Wago connectors. But anyway, I'm ending this, we have to go this time.

840
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,260
Thank you everyone for listening to this horrifying tale of bizarre

841
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,780
-- GP G key handling.
-- Maybe we could make GP G key revocation parties a thing.

842
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,040
No, I'm not doing that.

843
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:11,459
No. Like having like

844
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,530
just letting go of the past.

845
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,419
It just, just do it. You don't need a party. Just do it anyway. All right.

846
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,260
