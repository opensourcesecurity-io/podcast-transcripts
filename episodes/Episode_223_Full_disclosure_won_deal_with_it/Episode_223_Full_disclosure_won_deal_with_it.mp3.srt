Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast.

1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,510
I'm with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,439
software.

3
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,120
-- No, never mind fraud.
-- I don't know. What do we call this?

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,379
No, no, no, no, no, no, not now that I work with the financial industry.

5
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:22,520
-- Crime is ok, but fraud is not. Ok. Oh, that's fair.
-- Ok.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,649
Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast with myself.

7
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,389
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought crime. Josh Pressers.

8
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,319
So, what makes you think? I'm going to take out the first intro.

9
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,720
You did that talks about crime and fraud.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,490
I'm fine.

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,630
-- We'll
-- see, we'll see.

12
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:39,200
-- I stand by my
-- work anyway.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,080
Well, speaking of crime. Yeah. No, it's good. It's good. It got above zero.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,119
So all the snow melted.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,470
I'm wearing shorts today because it's going to be a lovely day.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,950
And if I can wear shorts in November, I'm doing it. So,

17
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,330
yeah, I'm not quite that aggressive. It's only six degrees outside.

18
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:58,060
That's pretty cold.

19
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:59,409
Sure.

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,419
I mean, look in comparison,

21
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:09,699
I'm used to 15 to 30 ish Celsius right now and I'm not ready for cold yet.

22
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,769
-- It's coming. I acknowledge
-- that. Oh,

23
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:13,139
winter is coming

24
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,540
hate winter, the winter of my discontent card.

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:16,839
Oh,

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,599
man, this is just going to be brutal. Everybody cooped up inside.

27
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:21,690
I'm not going. No, we're not.

28
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,910
Let's talk about something way more fun than, than the horribleness of winter.

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,639
We'll talk about full disclosure.

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,839
-- Yeah.
-- Well, it's, it's,

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,540
yeah, I mean, the first thing that always gets me is that

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,239
everybody seems to think Attackers are somehow incompetent and

33
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,980
unless they are given details of security flaws,

34
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:39,940
they somehow won't

35
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:41,529
find and exploit flaws.

36
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,830
And it's kind of like, well, number one, finding security flaws isn't that hard.

37
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,940
Number two, the skill set to find security flaws is actually pretty widespread now.

38
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,730
And a simple data point would be.

39
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,480
What is it hacker announced months ago that they've

40
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,930
paid out over $100 million in bug bounties.

41
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,620
You jumped right into the deep end of the pool today, didn't you? Yeah.

42
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,220
Well, it's just like I'm so frustrated with these people that just ignore reality.

43
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,160
Ok, let's start at the very beginning. Cart.

44
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,470
And I decided we want to talk about full disclosure.

45
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,039
And the reason we did this is because Google projects

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,570
released a lot of details about a very serious security issue.

47
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:22,429
Well, not just details. They released a proof of concept exploit

48
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,119
that triggers it and in fairness like

49
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,009
it's,

50
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,380
I don't want to say it's a simple bug, but

51
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,820
-- it is a simple bug. It's an integer overflow,
-- right?

52
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,740
-- You just give it a big number and it
-- poops.

53
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,740
There's no patch for Microsoft and there's people have started flipping

54
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,630
out and saying you shouldn't release this information,

55
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:45,389
but they did release it because this issue is actively being exploited

56
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,720
on the internet

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,720
right now

58
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,039
in the wild as it were.

59
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,880
And if there's something we've learned is that if we ignore

60
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,589
-- infections in the wild things will be ok.
-- That's right.

61
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,320
If you just pretend it's fine, it probably is.

62
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,929
Don't tell people about it, it'll be fine.

63
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,949
Let's go back in time before we start this because you're, you're clearly fired up.

64
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,419
-- Well, I just, the reason I'm so like,
-- hang on. No, no, I know

65
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,009
we all know

66
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:13,580
this is lovely.

67
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,279
So let's go back in time and just talk about what, what does full disclosure mean?

68
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:24,229
And, and how did we kind of get to the fact that this topic even exists?

69
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,710
So the way it works is back in the olden days and I mean, like,

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,830
not just 10 or 20 years ago, but even over 100 years ago,

71
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,630
companies don't like being embarrassed

72
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:39,410
and companies have a history of shipping unsafe products

73
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,179
or products that make claims sometimes around security,

74
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,460
sometimes around safety

75
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:45,699
that are just not true.

76
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,679
Uh You know, and some extreme examples of this would be like Ralph Nader,

77
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,520
unsafe at any speed with car safety.

78
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:51,179
Sure.

79
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,330
You know, like literally we had cars, they like, oh,

80
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,520
you got a little minor fender bender and you're dead

81
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,500
because, you know, your steering wheel impaled you

82
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,669
or, you know, the concept of safety glass in cars.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,940
I was kind of,

84
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:06,419
I just assumed we'd gone to safety glass a lot sooner

85
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:07,220
than

86
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,539
the industry did.

87
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:09,380
Sure.

88
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:09,960
You know.

89
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,679
But no, anyway, so

90
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,460
companies obviously want to

91
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,459
not have people pointing out that their products kill and maim people,

92
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,309
especially in ways that are

93
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,500
often not that hard to fix,

94
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,079
you know.

95
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,920
Well, I mean, my favorite is there's this one product,

96
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,869
I'm not going to get into the specifics of it.

97
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,739
Um, but

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,750
essentially back in the day,

99
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,500
it would have cost 10 cents to properly fix the mechanism.

100
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,529
That's a safety issue.

101
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,010
And now because they've shipped millions and millions and millions

102
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,440
of these products and decided not to fix it,

103
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,089
you've got this huge sort of installed base of unsafe products now

104
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,000
and of course, retrofitting them would be horrendously expensive.

105
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,859
But, but you just proved the point, Kurt,

106
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:52,260
because you won't tell us what the company is and what the 10 cent part is.

107
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,179
It's a gun thing,

108
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,429
it's a gun thing. Ok. But regardless, you get the idea.

109
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,579
So here's

110
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:03,760
my take on this is there's always been this historical struggle between, we'll say,

111
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,709
organizations making a thing

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,130
and people finding out there's something wrong with the

113
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,850
thing and you can go to the organization and say

114
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,079
I found this problem, you should fix it.

115
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,269
And I would say in the vast majority of outcomes,

116
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,049
the organization says go away you annoying pain in our butt.

117
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:22,500
Well, or they just threaten to sue you and they threaten legal action.

118
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,290
-- Well,
-- that's step two,

119
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,835
-- that's quite a common outcome.
-- And, and yeah, it happens a lot actually.

120
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:28,805
And I mean, this is,

121
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:30,756
uh, well, I'm sure we'll get to it, but, like,

122
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,716
this is one of the cool things about having a

123
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:35,216
bug bounty is you're basically saying I won't sue you.

124
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:36,135
But now,

125
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:38,316
so what happens is you end up in this

126
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,805
situation where you have some sort of researcher,

127
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,566
you have some sort of company,

128
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:46,455
the researcher knows what the company is doing is flawed for a variety of reasons.

129
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,851
And now you have to decide the company told me to stuff it.

130
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:53,231
What do I do with this knowledge and information I have?

131
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:56,441
Well, and one thing too is there, there's subtlety to this because for example,

132
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:57,842
some flaws are clearly

133
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:01,152
somebody made a decision at the company and accepted this risk and said,

134
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,342
you know what this is ok.

135
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:03,872
We know about this problem.

136
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,802
You know, we know cigarettes cause cancer, but we're going to sell them anyways.

137
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:10,532
And then there's other flaws where it's kind of like, oh, wow, we, we just,

138
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,002
we didn't really understand metal fatigue well enough

139
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:13,842
or

140
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,190
you know, the fact that like windows in planes need to be circles, not squares,

141
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,450
you know,

142
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,209
-- because the stress points at the corners
-- did

143
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,399
they ever have square windows in planes.

144
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,670
-- I don't know,
-- there were a couple of British models that did, but they crashed a lot.

145
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,089
-- Oh, well,
-- because the windows would fracture.

146
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,850
You'd have an explosive decompression and everybody dies. Yeah.

147
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,390
And that seems like a minor problem.

148
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,250
So, but anyway, the point is

149
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:36,684
I'm a researcher. I have information.

150
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:39,765
What do I do now in the context of computer security?

151
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,684
Which is where we're going to frame our discussion.

152
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:44,635
Basically back in the day, you could go to a company and say, oh,

153
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,295
I have this and like researchers going to

154
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,364
them saying I found a problem with the company

155
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:51,625
being like, yeah, if you tell anyone we're suing you go away. Right?

156
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:54,404
And it was, it was horrible. And so what would happen quite often

157
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,630
is people would find something and instead of even going to the company,

158
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,750
there was a mailing list called Full Disclosure, which I mean, this was literally,

159
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,589
its job

160
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:07,029
was so people could mail it with information like this and just say here it is

161
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,140
good luck.

162
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:12,510
Generally speaking, it was pretty wild west for sure.

163
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,320
Well, I mean,

164
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,690
it kind of had to be because I remember seeing a lot of people making

165
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,040
good faith efforts to go to these companies and try and work with these companies

166
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,829
and yeah, the companies were not having it.

167
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,470
No, it was, it was very difficult to report security issues.

168
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,869
And the other thing too is is. And people forget this.

169
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,380
If I have a faulty product,

170
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,019
I always have a way to fix it because if nothing else I can choose to stop using it.

171
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:43,220
Right. And that's something people forget is, especially with software, there's

172
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,910
often a compensating control I can put in.

173
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,709
Oh, you know, this thing has this security flaw. Ok. Let's

174
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,260
add a web application,

175
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,760
firewall rule or let's do some configuration change to minimize it or

176
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,579
least let's let's log and see if anybody exploits

177
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,200
this issue and then we can deal with it.

178
00:07:59,209 --> 00:07:59,559
Right?

179
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,119
And so that's what I'm trying to say though,

180
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,420
is there's this whole full disclosure thing.

181
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:06,660
It's not just about the researcher counting coon getting their name out in public.

182
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,899
It's actually

183
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:11,529
there are often things people can do to protect themselves if they want to.

184
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,230
Well, and I think that's part of the discussion today.

185
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:18,040
I think back in the day, I mean, unless you were someone like the loft,

186
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:20,970
you weren't putting your name on a lot of this stuff.

187
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,480
You were hiding behind handles and pretend groups. Yeah.

188
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:25,959
So you didn't get sued, right?

189
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,619
They were going to come after you and they were going

190
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,739
to make your life miserable if you did this stuff.

191
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,239
And even even people like cult of the dead cow in the loft, they were

192
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,929
constantly under fire from Microsoft. It's just

193
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:40,440
they were phenomenal at manipulating the media to basically get their point

194
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,179
across and the way they wanted it across and made kind of,

195
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,309
you know, people like Microsoft and Oracle and Friends look like the bad guy,

196
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,469
which you could argue maybe they were, but

197
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,320
they

198
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,219
totally

199
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,260
were,

200
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,780
let's say full disclosure,

201
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:54,840
that's the story.

202
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,940
But you know what they got better.

203
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,299
But OK. Right. And so now let's fast forward to today.

204
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,049
So Microsoft is actually pretty good and I would say they

205
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,409
are potentially the poster child

206
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,659
for handling security vulnerabilities correctly.

207
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:12,690
And so now we have this instance where Google project zero finds a problem.

208
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,010
They figure out it's being exploited in the wild. I don't know how they found this.

209
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,890
I mean, it is Google, they have access to enormous resources.

210
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,359
So I know Chrome has a bunch of telemetry built in to spot crashes

211
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:28,179
and so weird crashes get reported back to Google and a lot of security issues,

212
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,140
especially some of the nondeterministic rates.

213
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:33,159
I type ones tend to cause a lot of crashes and you can.

214
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,369
And same thing Microsoft had a blog post about this years ago where they got

215
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,890
telemetry and some Microsoft engineer decided to

216
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,359
look at the telemetry and you know,

217
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,219
found a zero day.

218
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:44,520
Yeah, from a single crash report, which is, that's a crazy,

219
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,280
I'll try to find that I'll put it in the show notes.

220
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,460
-- It's a fascinating story.
-- Yeah.

221
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:50,520
So I mean, and I suspect that's what happened here is Chrome,

222
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,320
something affected Chrome

223
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,109
and

224
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,809
you know, and then Google obviously kind of looks at it, you know, maybe

225
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,489
the organizations contact Google, I don't know.

226
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,530
But the point is Google found out about this, you know,

227
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,729
they kind of have what you call a wide install base.

228
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,719
And so they were able to,

229
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:11,080
then I'm assuming Google also has like sort of active threat hunting, you know,

230
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,280
with honey pots and stuff

231
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,570
and yeah, they were able to find this thing out in the wild, figure it out,

232
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,169
you know, provide a proof of concept exploit code, which is, you know,

233
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,909
it's a simple like 3040 line script that

234
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,159
basically just shoves it creates a crypto device and

235
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,820
-- shoves a large number into it and you get to watch it kind of
-- go blue.

236
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,969
I think we're getting ahead of ourselves again. So here's the question,

237
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,729
does Google releasing basically full details about this

238
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:35,169
issue before there is a fix for Microsoft?

239
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:39,710
Is that giving, is that an advantage to the world or by keeping it secret?

240
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:43,309
Would they be helping the world by not telling people what's going on?

241
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,270
And here's the argument.

242
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,229
So before you respond, I want to explain there, there's two sides

243
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:48,619
on one side

244
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,840
you have and I'm not going to lie. Like I am 100% pro full disclosure.

245
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:57,049
-- I know Kurt is also, I
-- I would say I'm definitely 100% full disclosure,

246
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,849
but I would like for people to try and

247
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,140
-- give the company a chance first because
-- that's different.

248
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,210
That's not full disclosure though.

249
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:03,640
This is, this is different and,

250
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,250
and we're talking about embargoes so we can discuss embargoes in a minute.

251
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,520
But let me explain the arguments here.

252
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,049
So you've got full disclosure,

253
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,000
we should send all of this information out into the world.

254
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,906
Then it gives the defenders an opportunity to

255
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,437
study what's happening and defend against it.

256
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:18,997
Essentially on the other side,

257
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:22,036
you have people saying by releasing all of this information,

258
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:27,567
now you've given potential Attackers all the tools they need to mount attacks.

259
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:32,437
-- Whereas assuming they couldn't somehow figure this out on their own prior to
-- this,

260
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:32,557
there's,

261
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:33,437
they

262
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,817
-- have
-- and I know has the proof.

263
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:36,877
-- Well, right,
-- in this instance,

264
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:38,304
I agree 100 percent.

265
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:40,804
Well, it's a bit to what I was saying earlier, I would say,

266
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:42,044
try and give the company a chance,

267
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,703
like because some companies do the right thing and they will move quickly.

268
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:48,773
Some companies are capable like Microsoft's obviously capable of change

269
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:49,953
because at some point in the last 20 years,

270
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:53,323
they went from basically full evil to pretty damn good, you know, and in past,

271
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,414
they would have definitely thrown a tantrum over this and now they're just

272
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,073
like quietly beavering away and saying we'll have it fixed next week,

273
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,994
right? You know, I mean, and they're going to have it out on.

274
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,981
Yeah, they're sure for a Microsoft patch, Tuesday,

275
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:05,291
it sounds like they're not going to do an out of band one for this.

276
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,491
I think it's important to also every single one of these is so different.

277
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,570
Like the fact that Google has proof this is actively being exploited in the wild,

278
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:13,830
right?

279
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,690
If I discover a vulnerability,

280
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,370
I have no idea if it's being exploited in the wild,

281
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,270
we don't. This is where the discussion, I think you get more interesting.

282
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:26,370
So let's assume you find a critical security vulnerability

283
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:31,080
-- and let's say you report it to Microsoft. Here's a
-- simple one.

284
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,299
My first vulnerability I ever really found and reported was that stupid

285
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,679
izzy.com file being world readable,

286
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,090
which is a problem because it contained a password.

287
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:41,299
So anybody on the system could read that password,

288
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,510
connect to your ice cuzzy system and read all the data in my mind.

289
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,039
I'm like this is, it's kind of a bad issue, but it's not that bad because, you know,

290
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,599
ch model fix it and then you just change the

291
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:52,630
password later if you think somebody read it and Cisco who

292
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:56,356
that open source package freaked right out and just

293
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,796
did not want me going public with this.

294
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:00,997
And I'm like, you literally just read the file like there's no, you know what I mean?

295
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,247
Like you read a file with a password in it. It's world readable.

296
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:04,887
It shouldn't be world readable. That's it.

297
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,637
And, and, you know, conversely to now where

298
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:09,877
I would like to think they'd be a little more mature about it.

299
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,336
Let's use this as our example because I think it's,

300
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:15,077
it's a super easy one for everyone to understand in their head.

301
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,127
So let's say

302
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:17,617
you go to Cisco,

303
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:18,586
you say I found this

304
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:19,073
and,

305
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:22,133
and Cisco says, please don't tell anyone about this.

306
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:25,153
We're going to fix it and release the security update. Now, let's say

307
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:30,073
Cisco releases a security update that basically says it's possible a local

308
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,953
attacker could figure out your password for your I scuzzy system.

309
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,914
Please update the package. Now,

310
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,434
if I'm an attacker and I read that,

311
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,473
what is the first thing I'm going to do?

312
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,604
I'm going to compare the old and the new packages

313
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,713
and in about 10 seconds,

314
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,901
you're going to see a file.

315
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,551
-- I'm going to know exactly what's, what's happened,
-- right? A very concrete case.

316
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,031
You know, IFC pushes out DH C PE D and bind and all that stuff.

317
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:56,330
And they're famous for not giving super

318
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:59,281
super details on uh bind vulnerabilities because,

319
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,390
you know, they kind of want to

320
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,310
keep the internet stable. Literally, every time they would release a bind update

321
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:06,901
with a security fix and a whole bunch of other stuff.

322
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:10,870
So, you know, the, the file diff would be on average about 50 to 200 k

323
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:12,870
of text, which is a lot

324
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,409
and it took me on average about 1015 minutes to find the security flaw.

325
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,679
Yeah, I mean, and that's, that's with source code.

326
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,239
People do this without source code with windows patches, all the time. Oh, yeah.

327
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,609
Yeah. Bin

328
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,929
-- Diff. And then all the DB G and off you go. So
-- here's the thing.

329
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:31,349
Your adversaries have the knowledge and the tools to quickly figure out

330
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:35,369
what has changed between two releases and to know exactly what's happening.

331
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,770
And more importantly, they have not just the incentive to do this

332
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,995
but an ongoing incentive to do this in the form of, for example, bug bounty. So it's

333
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:45,056
the, the thing is this is something where

334
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,705
it's, it's like exercise.

335
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:50,135
You, you have to kind of keep doing it and keep fresh because there's new techniques,

336
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:51,656
new exploit chains,

337
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,435
you know, new defenses that you have to overcome.

338
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:56,366
Like remember when return oriented programming suddenly became

339
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,085
a thing and like all these previous defenses,

340
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:01,495
we had just gone overnight, right, Rob just

341
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,856
stomped all over them.

342
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:04,286
So that's part of it too.

343
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:08,471
Is these Attackers now are not just, you know, coming up with one attack a year,

344
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,841
they're keeping their skills sharp by participating in bug bounties.

345
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:12,702
I mean, sure,

346
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,502
but they were always keeping their skills sharp because it's what they do.

347
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:16,711
Well,

348
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:19,682
-- I'm saying now that they get directly paid
-- well and you could

349
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:23,322
argue that takes away some of the pressure from the whole,

350
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:26,822
you know, attacker defender concept because now instead of attacking,

351
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:28,911
they're in theory doing bug bounty work.

352
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:31,901
But, but here's the thing, if you're defending

353
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,909
and

354
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,710
oracle just says,

355
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,950
install this patch

356
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,349
because it's gonna

357
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:41,739
somehow prevent a local attacker from accessing your files.

358
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,479
You're gonna be like, what do I do? Now?

359
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:46,250
If you're in, in any sort of corporate environment,

360
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,780
you can't just install updates whenever you want because right, you're gonna,

361
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,969
you're gonna be looking for a new job on day three if you do that.

362
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,219
So the question becomes, well, what do I do with this? How serious is this?

363
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:59,432
What you, what, what am I looking for? What should I be doing? And you don't know

364
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:03,992
the Attackers know exactly what's going on. You have no clue what to do.

365
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:08,861
Now, if oracle says the problem is that this file is world readable.

366
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:10,221
You can be like, oh, well, crap, I can just

367
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:13,312
-- on this thing and I'm done. Right. Well, and
-- so that was my ration.

368
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:15,802
I'm like, literally, I'm just like, tell everybody to see mo

369
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:18,012
you know, right. O minus read, right, execute.

370
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:23,124
And then if they want to be extra paranoid, change the path work, which is a chore,

371
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:23,833
but that's it.

372
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,333
Then you're, then you're good, you're done,

373
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:25,713
right?

374
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:28,174
You don't need to ship an update for this.

375
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,374
-- I mean, you
-- should, you do but

376
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:32,763
right. Exactly. And, and this is the thing is

377
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:33,874
when

378
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:36,434
you don't have all of the details,

379
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:39,294
it is difficult to understand what's happening around you.

380
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:42,314
But it's also more importantly is you also have to wonder

381
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:45,273
what do the Attackers know about this particular problem?

382
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:48,835
-- How do you do risk management if you don't know what the risk is.
-- That's right.

383
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:50,075
You absolutely can't.

384
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:54,335
And I think part of this part of this conversation is what do Attackers

385
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,526
know and what do Attackers have is definitely something you need to think about.

386
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:00,695
And obviously you could just say, oh, we'll just assume the worst.

387
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,176
But what is the worst?

388
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:04,375
-- I don't even know
-- the problem with assuming the worst

389
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:06,656
though is then you end up with inflated threats.

390
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:09,605
So a perfect example of this assume the worst is the way the NVD, the

391
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,978
vulnerability database scores CV S scoring for CV S

392
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:18,248
because they have to take the tact of what like we're not sure about X.

393
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:19,738
So we have to assume worst case.

394
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,758
And so they end up with these inflated CV S scores because also

395
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:23,906
they can't

396
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:27,416
sort of say or guarantee is the software being used safely.

397
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:29,078
So for example, like, remember at Red hat,

398
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:34,037
we kind of had the official position of SMB uh SAMBA file services

399
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,180
uh

400
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,760
run on local networks only, you don't expose it to the internet.

401
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,900
If you're exposing it to the internet, you're too bad.

402
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,719
And I would tend to agree with that,

403
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,859
you know, you don't expose it directly to the internet.

404
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,910
But for example, the NVD dealing with the US government, as I understand it,

405
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,339
the US government is what you might call a

406
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:52,859
large organization without super centralized control and configuration.

407
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,939
-- That
-- is
-- an accurate statement.

408
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,000
They kind of have to assume this worst case scenario.

409
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,020
And the problem is you end up with a lot of,

410
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:03,099
well, is this really an issue or a non issue? And it takes a long time to

411
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,199
the wheat from the chaff.

412
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:08,660
It is, it's really hard, especially at scale when you're, you know, at Red Hat,

413
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,170
we as a vendor, we're dealing with thousands of security vulnerabilities a year

414
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,400
and we're a single vendor.

415
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,099
So by definition, the US government is dealing with, well,

416
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:19,199
-- pretty much the majority of the CV database,
-- all of them, right?

417
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:23,790
They're dealing with literally every security vulnerability released ever.

418
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,050
Yeah, like the fact that the US government, I remember that one group there,

419
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,780
the big group used to care about PHP a lot

420
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,939
more than I would have thought that they would.

421
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:31,359
Ok?

422
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:34,260
I guess they, a lot of PHP apps like, because what else are you going to build them in?

423
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,540
Everyone used to have a lot of

424
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:38,140
now. It's all. No Js, it's the same problems, new language.

425
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,069
But

426
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,979
so that's the thing, right? Is this,

427
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:43,800
there is a cost to crying wolf.

428
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,500
There is a cost to, you know, on Microsoft patch, Tuesday as an individual user.

429
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,900
Yeah, I just slam all the updates on reboot and like cross my fingers.

430
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,219
Same thing with Apple, you know,

431
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:55,219
just hit that reboot and hope to God the system like

432
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,410
I've had and I've done it where it's just like,

433
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,339
oh, that like a major Os update and I, my system, like,

434
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,000
just got stuck

435
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,229
and I had to actually recover it from time machine.

436
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:04,550
That's

437
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,130
exciting.

438
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,640
That happened once on my laptop and I was, like, whatever,

439
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,410
thank goodness for time machine because I got everything back. But,

440
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,380
you know, same thing, like with my ipads, you know, we have a spare ipad.

441
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,750
I run that one first. If it doesn't break, I'm like, cool kids.

442
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,410
-- You're going next and then mine.
-- That's not the corporate file server.

443
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,300
Well, exactly.

444
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,459
And, and in a corporate world where even worse, a regulated industry,

445
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,439
like say healthcare, like our MRI machine

446
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,609
-- just never update that thing or
-- your pacemaker

447
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:30,849
-- never update those
-- or you know,

448
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:35,369
-- your scatter control system that runs the power grid for the city
-- also never update.

449
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,489
But anyway, anyway, so, right. I think you've hit on all the, all the

450
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,109
important points. But I think so there's

451
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:45,329
the argument here obviously is there's the aspect of,

452
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,810
let's not give people all the details. Let's tell them the potential output.

453
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:55,369
Let's say we say that if you, if you're using Samba on the internet,

454
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,949
a remote attacker who doesn't need to authenticate, could paw your system like,

455
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,520
is that enough information to

456
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:04,310
-- tell someone without giving them all the details?
-- I would say it's a set of slides

457
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:09,204
and the, the thing is the values have changed in that 20 years ago while number one,

458
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:11,834
there just weren't as many Attackers numerically.

459
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,574
Right. With the internet hadn't connected up the world yet.

460
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:18,824
Uh Number two, the Attackers weren't as sophisticated or,

461
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,074
you know, the tooling. I was looking it up the other day, Medis

462
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:22,954
was only released in 2003.

463
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:23,875
What

464
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:28,130
I know, hey, I always thought it was like older than that and I'm like, no, it was 2003.

465
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,839
-- I feel like it's been around forever.
-- Well, it, 17 years. Is it

466
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,630
almost old enough to vote? Right?

467
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,760
-- Like, no, seriously. Like, but, ok.
-- Ok.

468
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,900
No, no, I'm going to, I want to disagree with you though.

469
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,400
-- I would say
-- that these, these sliders have changed. No,

470
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,339
there's no slider.

471
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:44,699
I don't think there's a slider.

472
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,459
Well, no, no, no,

473
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:47,900
in the sense of Attackers are much more

474
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,329
competent now and they need much less information.

475
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:54,119
Like I remember back in the day when somebody knowing what Bin Diff and

476
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:57,280
Ali just knowing what those tools were was amazing.

477
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,800
And now it's just like, yeah, whatever those are things people buy and use.

478
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:02,650
-- But
-- there were still plenty of people who understood those.

479
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,849
I don't, I don't think a slider ever existed.

480
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:09,290
I think sliders is a lie we've told ourselves and they never existed.

481
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,599
-- Well,
-- look at Bug Bounties.

482
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:15,449
Bug bounties have created a market for people who actually either part or full time.

483
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:18,689
But no, that's, you're changing the subject that has nothing to do with sliders.

484
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:22,800
What I'm trying to point out is the, the sliders on the values of

485
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,829
how much information really benefits hackers.

486
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,920
And the answer is like,

487
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,560
Attackers don't need nearly as much information as they used to.

488
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,400
They don't need any, they don't need any information.

489
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,880
-- And
-- conversely, defenders are dealing with such a fire hose of stuff.

490
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,719
-- Now, defenders actually need a lot more details.
-- I agree completely.

491
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,920
And I think, but I think this has always been true.

492
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,089
I think we just managed to lie to ourselves for a long time.

493
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,599
-- Heard of it is
-- no, no, no software updates used to be like a quarterly thing.

494
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,739
And now,

495
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,699
I mean,

496
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:56,319
I could be installing software updates literally daily across all my devices.

497
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:59,920
Well, sure, but it's still quarterly at a lot of organizations.

498
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,339
Well, yeah, with, except for the things that matter where they have to deal with it.

499
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:06,369
Now this is where that goes into that extended detection and response.

500
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,380
So for example, you know, OK, we know, for example,

501
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,040
this attack requires the creation of a cryptographic, you know,

502
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,660
essentially device driver so we can monitor the

503
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,040
for creation of that device because to be blunt,

504
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,060
creation of that device should be pretty rare, especially from your web browser.

505
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,859
It probably never happens is my suspicion.

506
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:28,750
Like I remember reading this one account of uh they detected a pen test

507
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:32,180
because they had the windows machines locked down to not allow use of powershell

508
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:35,900
because the only people that should be using Powershell was like the five admins.

509
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,699
-- And so this is the stuff you can do with details as a defender.
-- I agree completely.

510
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,699
And

511
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:44,849
this is, I mean, so one of the challenges obviously is people will say,

512
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:47,640
oh just you should disable Powershell, but of course,

513
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,390
there's Attackers can do other things.

514
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,910
Well, no, they didn't disable Powershell. They monitored for use of powershell.

515
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,349
-- Well,
-- no, I, I understand that I'm saying but, but what I hear then is people will say,

516
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,989
oh, just, just disable Powershell in all your systems and then you're safe

517
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:00,609
and it's like,

518
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:00,910
you

519
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:01,209
know,

520
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,310
you're not

521
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:02,989
and

522
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:04,270
that's broken.

523
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:06,260
You get the idea is there is,

524
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,290
it is very difficult sometimes to understand everything happening around you.

525
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,969
-- And
-- that's the point is there's a lot of

526
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,209
security

527
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,770
compensating controls, people would like to take,

528
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:20,770
but they're very risky and could very much break stuff in very

529
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:22,939
obvious or very subtle ways.

530
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,380
And that's where these, you know,

531
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,489
where you really want to have the information and understand it

532
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,040
so that you can do things like, ok, well, if we monitor for creation of this device,

533
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:34,410
yeah, that it may or may not create a flood of events.

534
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,750
We don't know until we turn it on and for all

535
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,569
I know it's like it never happens or it's daily.

536
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:42,380
But the point is now you can feed that into an automated

537
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,329
system and you can look for other indicators of compromise such as,

538
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:46,959
oh, you know,

539
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,280
this happens on this system and then the system starts talking to an IP in Russia.

540
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:54,579
-- Totally fine.
-- OK. Well, now somebody needs to go reimage that system.

541
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,819
Yeah. Yeah. And I think

542
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,920
this is one of the really interesting things I

543
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,390
feel like is starting to happen is historically,

544
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,229
we were obsessed with stopping bad things from happening.

545
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,390
Yeah, prevention. And now

546
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:09,829
I feel like

547
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,569
the monitoring aspect is hugely important,

548
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:14,989
especially with automation because now you can just say, OK,

549
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,109
I know I have this problem.

550
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,319
I know this is going on.

551
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,989
I'm going to watch this system.

552
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,839
And if I see this behavior, then I know a bad thing is happening.

553
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:24,660
It also gives you the ability to detect new stuff.

554
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,199
Perfect example is there's, you know,

555
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:29,560
there's IP addresses that are known to be command and control servers

556
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,709
and to put it bluntly if any of your systems ever talk to any of these IP

557
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,949
they're called,

558
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,510
it may be a newer version of whatever Trojan Malware exploit thing of a jigger.

559
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,339
It is which then gives you a chance to learn something new and maybe

560
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,810
send it off to your A V company to create a new detection.

561
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,939
And I guess this is part of that full disclosure conversation

562
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:52,800
as well is let's say you've got a bank of ips.

563
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,030
And

564
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,260
now you could say, OK, if I, if I give this to the world,

565
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,280
the bad guys are going to know we found them.

566
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:58,839
Right.

567
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:03,010
But if I keep it secret, then I can only give it to some people and,

568
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,329
and here's my argument here is if you, if you tell the world, yes,

569
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,489
it is very true that the bad guys will find out.

570
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:11,300
But the reality is

571
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,829
if, if you think you're keeping a secret,

572
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,709
you're potentially not, they may know and just not care

573
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:22,310
or it's conceivable that they've already moved their infrastructure and

574
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,829
they're just pretending to make you happy and think they've,

575
00:25:25,095 --> 00:25:28,595
you know what I mean? When you do not know what your adversary knows,

576
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:30,956
it is a very different situation.

577
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:31,956
Whereas if,

578
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:35,916
if you know what your adversary knows because you literally told them what,

579
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:36,595
you know,

580
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:37,715
now

581
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:40,125
the conversation is very different and the things

582
00:25:40,135 --> 00:25:41,546
you should be doing are very different.

583
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:45,326
And so like my, my example is you could focus on specific IP S

584
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:46,375
or you could say

585
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:50,845
this is what traffic to a command and control server looks like,

586
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,952
which is going to be more useful long term than

587
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:56,462
-- saying I'm just going to watch these six IP
-- S.

588
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:56,702
Yeah.

589
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:01,251
Well, it's some of these IP S are very long lived or some of them are, you know,

590
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:06,121
the bulletproof hosting sites in Russia and some of the crazy spin off countries.

591
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,021
And that gives you that chance to, to, you know,

592
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:11,021
monitor traffic to those IP S and then look at the traffic and go, ok, you know,

593
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:11,391
this week,

594
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,371
they're using like weird DNS packets or this

595
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:15,462
week they're using weird http S or whatever.

596
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:16,901
And the thing is though,

597
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:23,839
the other aspect of this is this isn't work that scales, it needs to be automated.

598
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,969
And so part of that automation is

599
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,359
that the tool makers and the tool vendors and the service makers and vendors need

600
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:34,319
to learn like they need to find out about this and they do share this information

601
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,800
so that they can just bake it into your A V or Microsoft Defender or whatever,

602
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,119
you know, I was downloading, what was I trying to download?

603
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,719
I was trying to find a replacement program for something. Uh

604
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,300
and I downloaded an app to Windows

605
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:49,670
and Microsoft Defenders. Like there's like there's some wonkiness in here.

606
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,469
So I ran it through virus total and it was two out of 56 detection engines, found it.

607
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,560
And I'm like, yeah, no, not using this one.

608
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,180
It was a thing hosted off of Source Forge.

609
00:26:58,189 --> 00:27:00,390
Yeah, ironically it was a threat modeling tool.

610
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,380
Yeah.

611
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,119
But anyways, the point is like,

612
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,500
I'm glad somebody shared that with Microsoft and Microsoft defender, you know,

613
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,010
was like, this is kind of wonky looking.

614
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,859
You sure you want to open this.

615
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:11,119
I'm not going to let you open this unless you like make me and I'm like,

616
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,630
-- I don't think I want to make you do this, which
-- is cool.

617
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,939
-- I mean, that's, that's a powerful feature for sure.
-- So

618
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,540
I,

619
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:19,859
I just, I keep coming back to the fact though that

620
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:24,760
the Attackers no longer not that they ever really, really needed this information,

621
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,630
but nowadays they especially don't.

622
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,449
And like I said,

623
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:31,310
defenders absolutely need this information because we have a fire hose of issues.

624
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,069
I can't deal with this.

625
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,589
But hopefully my Microsoft defender or my vendor

626
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,550
does deal with this issue and add something

627
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,040
or,

628
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:38,849
you know,

629
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,010
some other layer of security that I have

630
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,410
kind of gets a compensating control for this,

631
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,790
you know, for the next week while Microsoft is busy fixing this,

632
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:52,810
even if you wanted to make the argument in the past, that full disclosure was bad,

633
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:55,130
which I won't agree with.

634
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,209
But I would say you could at least honestly make,

635
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,930
I think the world has changed in such a way

636
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,770
that you can no longer make that argument

637
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:08,060
in a, in an honest manner because I think

638
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,040
it's just

639
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,300
the people defending and there are and there's also a lot

640
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,689
-- more people defending and we're
-- defending a lot more important stuff.

641
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,069
-- Everything is digital now
-- and there are tons of

642
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,900
vendors that are doing this sort of work.

643
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,410
And I feel like imagine a world where you had a company like let's, I'll,

644
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,900
I'll pick on Sneak just because we talked to them not long ago.

645
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,780
Let's imagine sneak is finding security flaws in open source

646
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,060
and they're providing special secret patches.

647
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:37,420
And they're saying if you run our product you get our special secret patches,

648
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,060
patches and you're open source.

649
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:39,890
Well, I mean, that's a,

650
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,160
that's a business model for these various

651
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,099
network layer protection software and services.

652
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:47,329
It kind of is and it's madness.

653
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:48,780
Well, but on the flip side though,

654
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,979
every single one of those vendors I know and have worked with or actually worked for

655
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:57,430
specifically their business model was we find and buy exploits.

656
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,640
We give you ways to block them and we immediately go to the

657
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,750
vendor and try to get them to fix this as quickly as possible.

658
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:07,869
And so the value you get is you get

659
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,939
faster coverage

660
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,589
-- through us.
-- But imagine they didn't bring it to the event

661
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:17,286
and that would be a nightmare. It would be ridiculous to be clear.

662
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:20,556
That's so strongly frowned upon. Like the company I worked for.

663
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:22,566
It was funny because it was the first company to do this

664
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:24,836
and they didn't make it super clear that like, yes,

665
00:29:24,845 --> 00:29:27,676
we buy exploits and then we immediately tell the company

666
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:29,566
and people were just beaten on us and I'm like,

667
00:29:29,576 --> 00:29:30,755
we tell the company they're like, are you sure?

668
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:31,196
And I'm like,

669
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:33,985
yes, I'm sure I worked there. Like I've seen these, like,

670
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:35,442
I've seen us trying

671
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:37,862
and the best part is this is back in the day, like

672
00:29:38,021 --> 00:29:40,371
trying to contact these companies and get them to, you know,

673
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,651
take this stuff seriously and fix it hard.

674
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:43,921
Yeah, exactly.

675
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,552
So, so anyway, anyway,

676
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:49,881
I, I feel like, obviously this argument is like the anti

677
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:52,452
full disclosure argument to a ridiculous degree.

678
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:54,421
-- It's
-- people arguing with the tide.

679
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:58,760
-- I'm sorry, the tide's
-- coming in and you know what? That's how we should end it.

680
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,930
Yes, you're absolutely right.

681
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,569
Full disclosure one.

682
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:03,670
That's all like

683
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:04,949
you can argue this.

684
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,310
Who cares? It's not

685
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:06,930
like

686
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:11,989
it's too bad. Right? You get your broom, sweep the water, you lose.

687
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,030
And I guess that makes me happy. Let's just say that

688
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,709
of all the things to make me unhappy in the world.

689
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,380
This one doesn't

690
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,000
so good job. Full disclosure. That's it. That's all I got.

691
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,560
Awesome. All right, man. I'm calling it. So I guess. Thank you, Kurt.
