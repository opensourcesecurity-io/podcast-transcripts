Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 120 with myself,

1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,680
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:17,409
Now, 100 and 20 is a number I can get behind as it's a multiple of six

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,510
also 12, which is a multiple of six.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:20,969
Yep.

5
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:21,430
Those supers.

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,110
Right.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,389
That's right.

8
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:25,309
That's right.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,909
Oh, man.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,759
So today we are going to talk about the super micro, I would call it a kerfuffle,

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,990
but I don't think that's

12
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,799
near, near descriptive

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,750
enough. It's like a dumpster fire on top of a tire fire in like a nuclear waste zone

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,470
except it's not real

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,680
-- and it's full of stinky poo.
-- Right. Right. And that's the beauty of it. Right.

16
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,799
There's, there's so many layers of

17
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:52,729
it probably is.

18
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:56,360
It is, but it isn't. And it's just

19
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:58,110
all right. Let's start at the beginning

20
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,619
to, to unpack this one.

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,599
And do you want to do the honors of explaining what Bloomberg did?

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,440
Well, I'm not going to lay this on Bloomberg.

23
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:08,239
Um

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,269
They

25
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:10,029
publish it.

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:10,769
But,

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,849
well, that's OK.

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,819
This is meta, but I think it used to be a lot of these news organizations used to be a lot

29
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:20,730
more selective and professional than they are now.

30
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:23,110
Like, if you look at Bloomberg, you kind of have like a,

31
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:27,430
they, they provide like a blog platform for random people's opinions as well,

32
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,809
right?

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,540
But um anyway, so two reporters, Jo uh Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, uh

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,790
who, and if you look at their uh publishing history of Bloomberg,

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,860
these guys have done

36
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:42,870
quite a bit of legitimate tech and tech security reporting,

37
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,629
like they both have over a dozen articles a year to their name.

38
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:45,849
And,

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,510
you know, and like you said, these aren't like these little sort of cut and paste,

40
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,580
you know, Buzzfeed style things, but these are some proper, you know,

41
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:52,889
investigative,

42
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,160
uh you know, effort was made and it probably took several weeks, you know, you know,

43
00:01:57,169 --> 00:01:58,379
for some of these articles.

44
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,970
Um So these guys definitely come across as professional journalists.

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,839
And so I guess what happened is

46
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,270
they found this story talking about hacked super micro hardware

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,399
and they apparently managed to get a whole ton of uh confirmation and uh and,

48
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,100
and supporting evidence from people.

49
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,869
-- So, I mean,
-- look, if you want the evidence, you need to take a picture of a board

50
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,570
and say

51
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,830
that's it,

52
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:28,369
right?

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,070
Because according to this story,

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,289
the the layout of the motherboards was modified and extra chips were added.

55
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,809
So,

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,559
and see this is one of those classic things where

57
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:40,869
it's kind of like, uh

58
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,570
it's one of those things where if you show me the proof and describe it properly,

59
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,270
it's relatively easy to validate, especially, you know,

60
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,339
if you're Super Micro or Apple or something

61
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,889
and more to the point, Super Micro and Apple, for them to deny the story,

62
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:57,259
this is not something you can deny.

63
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,830
And they'd be like, oh, oops, you know, we sort of misunderstood.

64
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:03,190
No, they've issued a flat out very strong denial.

65
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:07,119
And if somebody gets a hold of one of those motherboards at a later date and, you know,

66
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,550
takes it apart or uh photographs it or x rays, it or whatever,

67
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:13,850
you know, that that evidence is very, very strong, right?

68
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,009
This isn't something you can sort of like fake the evidence after the fact easily.

69
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:24,330
And the way Apple and Super Micro have and Amazon was implicated in this also

70
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,690
and the way they have denied this, it is pretty clear

71
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:30,589
that that denial made it through lawyers and marketing,

72
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,800
which which leads me to believe this isn't one of those. Oh ha ha.

73
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,240
No, no, no, it's Wink Wink. Right. This is like

74
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:40,029
-- this is the real deal.
-- Their denials at first were kind of like

75
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,440
reading between the lines. It sort of sounds like they're being very specific like,

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,070
no, I did not murder him at 12 o'clock with a pistol,

77
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,320
you know,

78
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,389
you know,

79
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,740
but their later denials were very emphatic and no,

80
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,869
this is not real Bloomberg is wrong.

81
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,889
So, so basically the story is, is that, you know, the

82
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:03,440
supposedly the Chinese got some extra hardware put into super micro motherboards

83
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,860
and, and I love that, you know, on Twitter you were like, oh, you know,

84
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:06,899
wouldn't the engineers notice?

85
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,259
And then I sent you that video of that guy touring a PC B factory in China. And it's like

86
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:13,860
they get the design, they tweak the design,

87
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:16,000
they make sure it works and then they produce this thing and like,

88
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,559
yeah, it would, it looks from judging from that video,

89
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,989
the supply chain security is such that, that if that company were malicious,

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,100
they could easily add an extra component or two.

91
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:28,980
Well, it, it,

92
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,549
yes and, and so actually, I've been thinking about this a lot and,

93
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,140
and I still agree with you that it's totally doable.

94
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,119
I, I guess there's, well,

95
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,450
the trick is would super micro then be validating the

96
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,250
boards when they come back as part of their Q A

97
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,010
in, in. There's the, there's so, so there's a couple of pieces to this.

98
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,220
There's first of all,

99
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:52,559
uh super micro does the design, they send the design to the, the PC B manufacturer in,

100
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,540
in China in this instance, right.

101
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,869
And

102
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,250
that group definitely could make modifications without issue.

103
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,369
I'm I'm 100% sure of that now.

104
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:03,850
But then also like,

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,260
I'm skeptical the same factory makes the P CBS as assembles things.

106
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:09,970
So now you have two factories,

107
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,480
you have to essentially subvert management which

108
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:14,040
which I don't think is unreasonable.

109
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,420
-- What do you mean
-- two factories?

110
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,269
So you have to subvert the PC B manufacturers and then you have

111
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,850
to subvert the second company that's putting the chips onto the P CBS.

112
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,579
-- Right. Those are probably two different companies.
-- Oh,

113
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,429
not necessarily,

114
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,890
maybe. And, and so anyway, but regardless, then, then in theory Super Micro,

115
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,829
-- it's definitely possible to subvert both.
-- Right. Right. It's, it's, I

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,910
think it's probably already done

117
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,890
regardless of this story.

118
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,609
Do you think some guy at the PC B manufacturer

119
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:45,339
won't take $100,000 to tweak the design files slightly?

120
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,730
I would take $100,000 to

121
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:51,670
be like, I'm not asking questions. I'm taking your money.

122
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,109
Don't even tell me what this is. I'll do what you say

123
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,119
anyway.

124
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,540
And, and,

125
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:57,769
but then Super Micro gets it back and I would

126
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,170
hope they would notice if there was something different.

127
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:00,690
However,

128
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,529
the one thing I don't know and this is something

129
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,140
if someone out there listening knows the answer to this.

130
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,820
If, if you are someone manufacturing something like say a motherboard,

131
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:10,899
would it be expected for it to come back

132
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,269
with alterations and even possibly new chips just depending

133
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,290
upon what sort of supply existed or the people

134
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:19,220
you were working with and what level of,

135
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,779
I guess ability they have to do this sort of thing.

136
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,260
Like, I don't know the answer to that.

137
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:23,769
Yeah.

138
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,600
So one interesting thing is, uh I've been watching a lot of Luis Rossman,

139
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:29,679
he's this guy in New York that does component level repair of like apple and,

140
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,040
you know, other devices.

141
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:33,089
So, like, he'll, you know, open up your damaged mash

142
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,260
and like, find the burn

143
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:35,019
out chip or

144
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,250
the thing that, you know,

145
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,850
I didn't spill water on it. And he's like, and look at this water damage, you know,

146
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:45,079
and in that case, he pulls up these schematics, Uh I don't know where he gets them

147
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:46,589
and they,

148
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,369
the schematics definitely have a physical mapping to the actual physical board,

149
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,670
right?

150
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,709
Like where the chips are in the schematic, you know, the,

151
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,029
they're not just some random sort of layout.

152
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,250
Um but at the same time that he spends a lot

153
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,750
of time swearing at these things trying to find chips.

154
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,239
You know,

155
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,459
what, what's interesting to me too is like Apple has, you know,

156
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,839
they've relatively well compared to most manufacturers, they have like

157
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,200
seven product lines,

158
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:17,649
you know, like compared to somebody like, uh, well,

159
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,410
the Android phone ecosystem where there's like 10 million different devices.

160
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,619
And even within that, you know, there's major changes to products,

161
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:25,950
you know,

162
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,790
that are labeled as being sort of the same product and even almost the same version,

163
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,329
you know, like the boards will change a bit or whatever.

164
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,540
And so

165
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,570
I, my question would be, is, is, you know, is super micro Qing boards that come back,

166
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:42,130
are they, you know, taking a photo of the board

167
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,600
and comparing that to the chips and saying like, OK,

168
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:46,420
that chip is that chip on the schematic?

169
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:49,350
And is that, that says the right number? Ok, check that one off you go.

170
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,140
OK, right below it. You know, we have

171
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:51,420
a,

172
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:55,404
is that OK? That's on the thing. Yep. That looks right. I doubt they're doing this

173
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:59,644
in, in all seriousness. I don't know if I would do that.

174
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:04,195
I would have sort of functional testing where I like plug the board in

175
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,644
-- and I make sure things happen.
-- Exactly.

176
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,484
Well, and the thing is that the factory, they're supposed to have done this with,

177
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:12,355
you know, with that again, that video of that PC B factory where

178
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,170
they make these PC DS and then they have that, like, essentially

179
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,440
automated multi meter machine,

180
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,799
-- I guess is what you would call
-- it.

181
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,640
The connections essentially.

182
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,019
Yeah, it pokes all the circuits and, you know,

183
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,779
runs current through them and make sure they're,

184
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,760
you know, not, uh connected to ground and that they're correct and everything

185
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,280
I would assume also that those sort of audit results are sent back to Super micro,

186
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,489
you know, to some degree.

187
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,719
Um, because quite frankly,

188
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,840
the cost of Super micro validating every board would be obscene.

189
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:41,799
I,

190
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,679
I wouldn't work with that manufacturer if I had

191
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,950
to get them all back and validate them myself.

192
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,729
I mean, just, no, absolutely not.

193
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,849
And more to the point. Yeah, if it plugs in and works well,

194
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,200
-- probably. Ok,
-- everything's fine

195
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,010
if it, if

196
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,890
it builds its chips. Right.

197
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:03,150
So, anyway, so, yeah, so there's this supposed

198
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,609
chip added to the boards, you know,

199
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,849
and, and this chip could be embedded inside the PC B layers, you know,

200
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,049
at PC B manufacturer.

201
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,570
And, yeah, good luck spotting it and, or,

202
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,369
well, you wouldn't be able to remove it, you know,

203
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,960
without destroying the board basically.

204
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,669
Right. Well, from my understanding, reading the, the report

205
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,429
is, it's, it's literally a chip on board.

206
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:29,419
It's not like hidden in any way from the way it was

207
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,919
literally just another component stuck on the board,

208
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,349
which seemed to be my understanding and I must say, like,

209
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,539
if you're going to go after the supply chain, that's a really stupid way to do it.

210
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:38,919
Right?

211
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:42,190
You want, you want to get inside the silicone, you don't want to be like,

212
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,840
just a chip sitting there.

213
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,039
-- I, I
-- don't know. I think it would work because quite frankly, it, it,

214
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,780
it's one of those attacks where, yeah, once it's noticed you're blown.

215
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:53,820
But how long is it going to take to notice

216
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,890
forever, you know. Yeah. I mean,

217
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,400
but anyways, let's, let's assume for a moment that

218
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:03,169
let's just thought experiment and assume that this is actually real for a moment

219
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:04,070
because let's

220
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:05,940
before we do that,

221
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,330
we should, we should talk about the fact that this probably is real

222
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,549
because

223
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,849
you have to think how many chips and how many devices are manufactured in China?

224
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,539
Right.

225
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,979
The NSA was running, what was it?

226
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:22,969
Uh, the NSA upgrade factory, remember where they were

227
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:24,979
uh hardware chipping

228
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:26,729
devices, you know, there's,

229
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:30,520
-- or there's a photographs of this
-- and we should also clarify.

230
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,520
I'm not blaming China for this. Every country does this.

231
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,700
Right. They're not the big bad wolf.

232
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,669
Well, every country I,

233
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,140
my government better be doing this if they're halfway competent.

234
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,450
No, seriously. Right.

235
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,229
This is like having a military nowadays. This is,

236
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:48,479
you know, this is like in the olden days where you'd have, you know,

237
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:51,650
coal and steel plants because those are strategic resources

238
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,719
and that's fair.

239
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,359
Silicon and hardware is very much a strategic resource.

240
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,099
That's fair.

241
00:10:58,109 --> 00:10:58,349
I mean,

242
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:01,179
any weapon system beyond your rifle is going to

243
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,669
probably take a battery and some computer chips.

244
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,530
Not only that there's so many chips in this gear.

245
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:11,580
Now there's, there's, I would guess that a modern laptop probably has hundreds of,

246
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,719
of microprocessors inside of it.

247
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:14,909
Right. There's, there's ac

248
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:15,864
we always think of,

249
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,724
but like the freaking battery has more than one microprocessor in many instances.

250
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,934
-- Now,
-- those hard drives with the built in, you know,

251
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:25,085
basically equivalent to ac pu thing where

252
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:28,085
you remember the guy was hacking them and reloading the firmware

253
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:30,424
and having it hide data on the hard drive and,

254
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:31,594
and do literally

255
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:32,724
who knows what

256
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:37,929
exactly. Exactly. And so I guess from a supply chain perspective

257
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,960
you could probably attack any one of those chips.

258
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:44,330
And I'd be shocked if it hasn't been done by some

259
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,809
organization

260
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:47,049
somewhere.

261
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:47,969
Right.

262
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:48,010
I,

263
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,159
I think claiming that you have hardware that hasn't been compromised

264
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,239
in some way is probably a fairy tale at this point.

265
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,530
Yeah.

266
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,260
Well, and some manufacturers are directly dealing with this now, you know, apple,

267
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:00,809
with their,

268
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,859
the security chip in the new max can and it looks like at some point will be enforcing,

269
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,070
you know,

270
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:11,969
the replacement parts having the correct cryptographic signatures in them.

271
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:13,049
You know. So when you wanna

272
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:16,530
add a, a new video card or add a new uh

273
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,770
whatever,

274
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,419
you know, it better be a correct

275
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:24,390
OEM part that has the approved cryptographic signatures in it.

276
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,349
You know, they're doing this for phones already with you, remember the screens

277
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,140
and they get so much crap for this though because people freak out because they

278
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,700
-- want to like go to the dodgy place at the mall to replace their
-- screen.

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,020
Apple will probably tell them too bad.

280
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,580
I think Apple is mostly back down at this point, haven't they?

281
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,489
They keep trying to do this

282
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,789
-- and I feel like they keep backing down
-- the thing

283
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,859
is they keep pushing the line forwards and they keep

284
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,070
gaining an inch or two.

285
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:59,010
So, you know, it's kind of like we, we, we take two inches, give one back. Oh, ok.

286
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,229
Well, we'll slow down on that

287
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,369
and in fairness, right?

288
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,130
This is, this was tried in the auto industry and they got um, well, the US Congress,

289
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,559
you know the right to repair bill

290
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,520
for cars. But what about the whole John Deere tractor thing going on right now?

291
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,020
Right. John Deere tractors.

292
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:12,440
Uh,

293
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,780
you need this very specialized software just to diagnose

294
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:15,950
what's wrong with the tractor and you know,

295
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,309
farmers are pissed about this because,

296
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,869
and rightly so this one guy was like, I,

297
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,690
you expect me to load my tractor up onto a flatbed trailer,

298
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,849
drive it five hours to the nearest dealership

299
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,359
so that they can tell me like this,

300
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:27,900
you know,

301
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:31,700
electronic module or component is broken and swap it out for like five grand.

302
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,330
No, I want a guy to show up in my field with a laptop

303
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,969
at a park, right?

304
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,859
And that's reasonable because these tractors

305
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:39,669
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

306
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,929
Oh yeah, they're crazy.

307
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,880
And I read somewhere that these farmers are now

308
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,989
downloading like uh uh pirate firmware from the Ukraine

309
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,390
and

310
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:48,859
their track,

311
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,130
which that's great.

312
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,359
Yeah.

313
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,510
Well, we had this discussion with the self driving cars and you know,

314
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,669
will people be allowed to modify their self driving car firmware?

315
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,130
And the answer is I hope not because

316
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,479
man, I want to be crazy about it.

317
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,039
Um But back to this. So, so is this

318
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,500
type of attack possible? Absolutely. 100% guaranteed.

319
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,219
Yes, this is possible and it's been done now, this specific instance of it

320
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,650
did it actually happen and it's looking like the answer is no.

321
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,080
And I would say that based on one simple

322
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,239
fact that the evidence that there has been none released

323
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,119
and worst,

324
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:24,840
the sort of the, the additional claims and the additional sort of backpedaling

325
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,940
has been in some cases really

326
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:32,099
bad. Um, you know, talking about, uh, like Ethernet

327
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,919
Jacks, like the physical Ethernet Jack that's like in your computer, right?

328
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,349
And how, like people are hiding, you know, evil chips in there. Yeah, absolutely.

329
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:40,840
Possible.

330
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:43,919
Again, this is something that is possible, not just in theory,

331
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:45,909
but in practice has it happened a lot?

332
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,520
No.

333
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:48,760
And the problem is then they're saying things like, oh,

334
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,650
these Ethernet Jacks had metal,

335
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,059
uh, enclosures, meaning that they were hacked and it's like, what, like,

336
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,219
no, like that's,

337
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:58,659
well, you know how

338
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,950
Ethernet Jacks can be plastic or metal

339
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,000
and the better ones are metal because it gives a bit of shielding.

340
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,270
Yeah, exactly. And they're like, that shows that it was hacked and it's like,

341
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,250
and then they're like,

342
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:10,309
exactly.

343
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,000
And then they're like, oh,

344
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,140
but these Ethernet Jacks wouldn't have enough room physically inside of it for it.

345
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,320
Well, and then, so the problem is the other side is like, oh,

346
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,030
an Ethernet Jack wouldn't have enough room inside

347
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,219
of it for a chip that does anything.

348
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:19,659
It's like,

349
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:24,179
-- no, it absolutely does. These things are huge and
-- it probably does,

350
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,739
you know,

351
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,260
so that's part of the problem is both sides have, um

352
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,510
the sort of the peanut gallery making a lot of bad and spurious and wrong claims,

353
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:37,270
you know, like on the one hand, people claim, no, this is impossible.

354
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,919
And it's like, well, wait, no, we have proof that this has happened in the past.

355
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:43,419
So this specific case though, here's my question.

356
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:46,719
So these two journalists who appear not to be idiots because

357
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,609
they've done a lot of good work in the past,

358
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,909
you know, they, they both have track records of at least

359
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,820
uh about 100 articles each just on Bloomberg

360
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,099
going back, you know, a decade or so.

361
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,099
Um

362
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,580
Yeah, what the heck happened here?

363
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,859
Like, was this some sort of false? Like, is this something

364
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,940
like getting metaphor?

365
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,340
Is this something the Chinese government did

366
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:09,320
to discredit future legitimate stories about this?

367
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:11,780
Yeah, I doubt that. Is this simply like they

368
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:15,059
somehow Murphy's law fucked it up badly.

369
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:19,869
I, I don't think that's possible either because these guys seem professional.

370
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,369
So like, how did this story come about and get so screwed up?

371
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,559
I don't know. I've been thinking about that a lot actually. And, and I guess there's,

372
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,650
what is, is it, is it Hanlon's

373
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:30,489
Razor

374
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,530
says

375
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,630
the most obvious answer is, is generally the right answer.

376
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,539
That's all comes Razor. Hanlon's

377
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:37,419
Razor is never

378
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:39,530
maliciousness. What can be explained?

379
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:40,280
OK.

380
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,039
Both,

381
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,299
both

382
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:41,700
of them

383
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:42,849
two

384
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,989
things. Thank you.

385
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,880
Right. I have a feeling that

386
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,030
these guys are,

387
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,830
they, they don't totally understand what they're talking about.

388
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,219
They don't, when they're making comments about Ethernet Jacks,

389
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:55,520
metal versus plastic.

390
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:55,640
It's

391
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,299
like

392
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:57,059
that's fair.

393
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,309
But sorry, that's, I've had both for decades.

394
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,679
Right.

395
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,319
However, II I have a suspicion.

396
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,770
Somebody led them astray somewhere and I don't know if it was on purpose.

397
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,329
They apparently had multiple sources though.

398
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,189
So, is this just a giant troll? Like a bunch of guys? Ha ha.

399
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:17,400
-- Like
-- I

400
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,500
go,

401
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,170
I'm skeptical. that's even true.

402
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,489
I also wonder how many of the sources were, is this possible?

403
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,449
And like, oh yes, it's totally possible,

404
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,239
right?

405
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,439
Versus this is actually what's happening and here is the chip

406
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,430
that's being used and here it is on the board,

407
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,410
which is what they should have demanded.

408
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,699
Well, so

409
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,599
from what I heard, they had a number of sources that, you know, quote unquote,

410
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,449
confirmed this

411
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:48,819
-- and my understanding of confirmed is not. Is this possible? Yes. No. You
-- know,

412
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,810
I don't know, does does confirmed have like a legal,

413
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,349
I don't know that it has a legal meaning, but I assume it goes beyond just.

414
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,589
Is this a possibility? Yeah. Ok. Good enough. We're going to run the story.

415
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:00,380
I don't know. It just, it definitely

416
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:05,040
is a giant mess regardless if it's true or if it's not true,

417
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,560
doesn't really matter at this point.

418
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:07,949
And I guess

419
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:09,040
here's,

420
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,439
here's the real thing I want to talk about today

421
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,270
and it's even less about is this story true?

422
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,800
Is this story not true. There is,

423
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,060
there's the attitude in

424
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,219
insecurity of assume compromise, right?

425
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:23,510
Where you have to design your infrastructure to

426
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,890
assume you have an attacker on the inside

427
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:30,329
and, and you can do a lot of things to even if somebody attacks you,

428
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,140
you can protect a lot of your assets.

429
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,280
And so I guess we need to bring it to another level and say,

430
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,510
how do you build your infrastructure when you

431
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,150
assume the hardware running your infrastructure is compromised?

432
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,859
Yeah. And I was reading about this and they were talking about how,

433
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,060
you know, some of these.

434
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,790
Well, so the what is it, what was that router firmware that's been hacked?

435
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,939
And now it's being counter hacked by a guy who's actually fixing it.

436
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:54,319
-- I want to say microtech,
-- oh, I heard about that.

437
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:56,660
I don't know what brand it is but yes, I heard that

438
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,380
I think it was microtech anyways.

439
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,560
The point being though for something like a home router you can very easily spot.

440
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,420
Oh, look traffic to China. That's naughty.

441
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,750
But for something, you know, for example, hypothetically speaking,

442
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,130
a server running part of uh you know, Amazon web services infrastructure.

443
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,430
Oh, look that server wants to talk to China. Well,

444
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:18,880
yeah, maybe there's people running stuff on Aws that does that like,

445
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,869
you know, at a certain scale, you can't

446
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,069
easily

447
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,069
this Chinese company is sending all of its traffic to China.

448
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,349
Like what's up with that?

449
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,530
Yeah, exactly.

450
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,250
You can't you know, it's one thing, um, what was that,

451
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,339
that defense company that got hacked and sent like a terabyte of data to China.

452
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,969
Ok. That, you know, you probably shouldn't have a workstation

453
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,430
on a, you know,

454
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,170
on a secured land, being used to do military work,

455
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:47,170
sending a, a huge amount of traffic to China. That's probably not good,

456
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,390
but

457
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,180
a server running at AWS sending a couple kilobytes of traffic to China every day.

458
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,750
Hey,

459
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:59,979
maybe, I mean, it, so the thing I keep thinking of here is

460
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,150
depending upon what you're using the system

461
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,609
for because there's also varying levels of,

462
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,410
well, here's the thing,

463
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,760
Aws isn't necessarily using the system. It's their customers. Same with Apple.

464
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,579
-- Well,
-- and so that's part of it. Right? Is,

465
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:14,660
is what

466
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,079
Aws, for example, I'm going to pick on, they have something called GOV

467
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,170
cloud where they have a special cloud,

468
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,579
they set up just for the United States Federal government and

469
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,130
there's all these crazy rules before you can even use.

470
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:27,760
And that makes sense.

471
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:31,119
Uh, you need, you don't need clearance.

472
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,760
There's, it's crazy but there's a bunch of rules. So anyway,

473
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,180
I

474
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:35,890
have

475
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,050
to

476
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,760
deal with certain countries, for example.

477
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,410
Right. Right. Right. Right.

478
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,040
So, anyway, anyway, the point is like that cloud

479
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,900
should have different rules to the, just we'll say regular Aws infrastructure.

480
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,020
Well,

481
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,040
the funny thing is you could easily do this with existing

482
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,439
run of the mill Aws and that you could have,

483
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,900
for example, on your VPC, on your virtual,

484
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:58,344
you have a cloud set up,

485
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:01,755
you could have egress firewall rules saying,

486
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:02,494
you know, don't.

487
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:04,545
Right.

488
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:06,395
Right. You should have,

489
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:10,234
I mean, so this is part of the example you can have for example, your VPC set up,

490
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:14,194
do not send traffic anywhere outside of the VPC except for say one mode

491
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:18,619
and like that traffic that leaves, you should be paying attention to that traffic.

492
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,890
Right?

493
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,300
You should be logging it in some meaningful way and,

494
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,689
and the days of just like ignoring everything I

495
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,339
think are officially over is what it means.

496
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,949
Like you need to pay attention.

497
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,739
Well, I, I wouldn't say that so far, but for example, I'm,

498
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,650
I'm redoing my VPC so that they can connect out

499
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:35,569
but only through the elastic load balancer

500
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,810
and to,

501
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:39,609
you know, essentially get OS updates.

502
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:44,449
Sure. And then you, but you can also like pay attention to that right.

503
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:47,050
In, in your case, you may not be dealing with

504
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,170
sensitive enough to really care.

505
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:51,969
Right. Right. Exactly.

506
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:55,430
But let's say it is sensitive, you should be paying attention to what's going on.

507
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,020
And if all of a sudden you see traffic at

508
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,209
midnight to some weird obscure IP address in some,

509
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:04,050
you know, country you don't normally deal with.

510
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,449
Like

511
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:05,670
that's weird

512
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:07,650
products that just do this,

513
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,869
right? You can just buy off the shelf products that handle this, right.

514
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,449
There's all the intrusion detection systems and intrusion protection systems.

515
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,000
Most of them have pivoted

516
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,069
to also do that, you know, information in the letter

517
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:22,520
to do that information egress of.

518
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,119
Yeah, you know, all of a sudden this server is like talking to China a lot,

519
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:27,640
you might want to look at that

520
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,699
-- or whatever,
-- right?

521
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:33,000
And, and this is, I mean, this is something we have like with elastic search,

522
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,800
you can obviously log all kinds of stuff and then

523
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,959
you can even do correlations where you can say,

524
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:38,819
all right, you know,

525
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:42,270
like this A P address started talking to Russia and it started with she

526
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,550
also it did these things and it logged into these other computers and then,

527
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,540
you know, you can start like following things around your architecture

528
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,390
and and

529
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,329
that's what people need to be doing now.

530
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:54,579
And if you're not doing that and you have sensitive anything, which let's face it,

531
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:57,920
we all do because if we didn't like why are people paying us?

532
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,390
-- So
-- the CS A is working with True Star.

533
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:05,550
And so one of the things True Star does is allows you to correlate stuff but not just

534
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,089
your stuff, it allows you to share your information securely within the system. So

535
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,979
when you say, hey, my machine is talking to this weird IP address, True Star is like,

536
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:17,349
oh yeah, these other 10 people reported that starting, you know,

537
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,689
yesterday at 2 a.m. as well.

538
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:20,630
In which case

539
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,010
now, now we have a problem,

540
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,530
right? And and that's kind of my point.

541
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,359
There are a lot of products that do this stuff out there. Right. I mean, uh,

542
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:30,609
find one and use it

543
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,849
is basically where we're at at this point. Right.

544
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:37,930
-- Because, I mean, even Aws can do this, can't it?
-- Um, Aws.

545
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:41,540
Uh, I know, for example, if you do a port scan from an Aws service,

546
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,209
you get a grumpy email from them within five minutes saying please explain

547
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:47,709
this uh network activity from your host.

548
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,910
Uh or we're giving you the boot, totally respect that, you know,

549
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,270
-- and
-- actually I've seen emails come in like from Aws and Google that are saying, oh,

550
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,670
you know what's up with this?

551
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,979
It's like, oh crap, like

552
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,650
we,

553
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,589
we better fix.

554
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:03,614
And so, and that's the beauty is, you know,

555
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,385
I was talking with an Aws guy years ago and he

556
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:10,275
was pointing out that Aws cannot look inside of a client's

557
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:13,805
machine. CPU and memory. They just can't or what's on the hard drive, right?

558
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:16,714
Because that would be such a gross breach of trust.

559
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:17,795
But

560
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,935
uh and, and you also don't want to be like, actually like

561
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,555
maybe doing deep packet inspection of their network traffic. But at the same time,

562
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:26,255
you don't need to because

563
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:29,954
just the, the sort of profiles of network activity. And

564
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:34,150
he was saying even just the CPU and RA M and hard drive activity, not

565
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,030
the content of what's going on, but just sort of the usage patterns

566
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,449
they were finding was enough to generally. So, for example,

567
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,089
you know, openshift.com has this problem where people keep trying to

568
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,689
sign up to openshift.com

569
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,780
to use it to do crypto

570
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,180
mining.

571
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:47,300
Well,

572
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,670
that's really easy to spot because you have some stupid

573
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,790
little thing that tries to peg the CPU to 100%.

574
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,770
I'm sorry. No, that's not allowed.

575
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,030
Um

576
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:03,380
So there's a lot of things you can do with even very simplistic rules based systems.

577
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,640
Not even machine learning or not even anywhere close to A I is needed

578
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,550
to spot sort of this anomalous naughtiness

579
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,000
and, you know, 99 times out of 100 it is naughty, anomalous behavior.

580
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,280
And then that one time in 100 the customer will go like, oh, no, no,

581
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,989
we do this weird thing.

582
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,099
Can you please let us do this weird thing? Oh,

583
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,560
-- ok. Sure.
-- Whatever.

584
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,189
Right. And, and you can get permission to do that as well. And, and I guess

585
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:28,219
here's the other side of this coin also

586
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,479
is we're talking about looking for, say, anomalous behavior in,

587
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,280
in bizarre network things.

588
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,329
But the reality is if like if you have an infrastructure set up and you

589
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,060
have it installed patches and you're not like

590
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:42,630
logging your things to a centralized location,

591
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,060
you don't, don't do this first.

592
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,599
This is like step seven, right?

593
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:50,270
And, and that's part of it too is there's,

594
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,469
I see so many organizations that are just like you're talking about logging your

595
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:59,589
network traffic and you have a computer running like windows 95 serving web pages.

596
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,510
You need to fix this.

597
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,020
Well, realistically, though that might be a business requirement.

598
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,530
-- You know, and I've seen things like it
-- never is.

599
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,099
The number of times it's a legitimate requirement is very, very small.

600
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,109
Most of the time they just haven't updated

601
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,469
the systems because nobody wants to touch it.

602
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,069
But in fairness,

603
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,800
I would say that also some of these larger companies do

604
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,050
do the more exotic things before they do the basic things.

605
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,010
Because quite frankly

606
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:26,890
with the way their networks and organizations are set up,

607
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,920
sometimes they can't do or force the basic things,

608
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:33,420
but they can, for example, have the network group tie down the network, you know,

609
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,140
but you can't force people to upgrade.

610
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,239
There may be instances where that's fair and I'm not going to disagree.

611
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,189
And I guess this is one of those cases where everyone has to look at

612
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:45,619
what they have and what they're doing and figure out what's best for them.

613
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:49,469
And, and I feel like we, we often get lost in the weeds.

614
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:51,459
In fact, I just published my blog post about this.

615
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:54,650
I was talking about general advice versus targeted advice and like

616
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:58,910
we love assuming China's hacking us when the reality is, you know,

617
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,619
you have a machine with no login credentials set up over there in the corner.

618
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:04,619
And it's like

619
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,890
you need to figure out like where is the line of

620
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,530
things we should care about and where's the line of things?

621
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,150
Like, just you can talk about this after work at the pub. But

622
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,810
-- no, we're not spending money on this stuff. Right.
-- Yeah. No, I agree.

623
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,609
It's, I think it goes back to the,

624
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:21,459
the sort of maturity model that

625
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,989
doesn't really seem to exist very strongly in most organizations.

626
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,469
I agree with that.

627
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:30,150
You know, that's something I'm, I've been working on.

628
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,959
Hopefully we'll make some progress. But

629
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,420
I think by and large

630
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,060
going back to this,

631
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:39,229
what really gets me weird is both sides have sort of dug in their heels,

632
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:43,699
you know, with Apple and Amazon saying absolutely no,

633
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:47,329
this has not happened in Bloomberg saying, yep, this totally is a legit thing.

634
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:51,280
But back to a tweet, I sent a few days ago, you know,

635
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,949
extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

636
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,319
And in this case, we don't even need extraordinary evidence.

637
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:58,760
We just need a photograph

638
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,780
or

639
00:27:59,900 --> 00:27:59,910
a

640
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:03,699
single board to which this happened or,

641
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:04,319
you know,

642
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:08,859
is there some guy at Apple, you know, who's going to tweet us being like, oh yeah,

643
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:10,329
you know, last month we uh

644
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:14,670
they had us pull like 100,000 server boards and set fire to them in the dumpster.

645
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,849
You know, I feel like if something like that happened,

646
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,410
somebody would have spoken up by now.

647
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,459
-- You
-- know, I think you're right. I think

648
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:25,515
you can't hide the truth like this. Somebody would leak this.

649
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:28,494
They're claiming tens of thousands of boards were compromised

650
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:31,074
and not a single one of them has somehow

651
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:34,694
somebody got a photograph or smuggled one out and, like, showed it.

652
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:38,194
-- I wonder, I wonder if you can buy super micro boards off ebay.
-- Yeah.

653
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:39,474
So,

654
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:43,555
you know, so, yeah, basically I, until I see

655
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:45,895
some evidence of this, I,

656
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:49,380
is this type of thing possible. Absolutely. 100%. Yes.

657
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:51,300
Is this specific instance of it

658
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,550
correct? And did this happen? I,

659
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,520
I have not been shown any credible evidence, right.

660
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,560
I'm I'm leaning towards no at the moment.

661
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:00,550
However, if I was unscrupulous,

662
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,920
I just saw you can find many super micro computers off ebay,

663
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,540
you could acquire one and, and we'll say, uh

664
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,030
take some pictures

665
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,420
and gain quite a lot of notoriety by making certain claims about

666
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,599
exactly

667
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:14,550
the other thing, you know,

668
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,209
where would I get the board level specs for this thing to actually

669
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,250
match up, you know, this component. Yeah, this component. Yeah, this component.

670
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,849
-- Yeah, this component.
-- Where did that come from? We probably can't,

671
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:29,369
but I would hope Amazon and Apple asked Super Micro for the schematics.

672
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:31,079
Oh, they wouldn't have to ask, they would I,

673
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:34,420
I assume the conversation would go like send us the board specs.

674
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,050
I'm not even going to say or else.

675
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,130
Yeah, that's probably fair.

676
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,930
I have a suspicion

677
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,209
that Amazon and Apple

678
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,670
uh there was also if you notice before their very strong denial there was a pretty,

679
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,140
there was a couple of weeks there.

680
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,479
So I have a feeling they did some real work in that time span to do some verification.

681
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,010
Well, this again, if this boils down to, if you say no, and it's true

682
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,290
and somebody shows the evidence that it's very easy to validate that truth,

683
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,930
right? This is kind of like a hashing algorithm

684
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,209
generating the evidence is not super easy but

685
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:11,880
validating The evidence is generally not rocket science.

686
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,680

-- Yep.

687
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:13,560
That's right.

688
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:20,040
Anyway, anyway, so I guess how, how do we want to end this one? Uh Stay afraid,
