Hello and welcome to episode 119 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:12,560
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:15,840
Oh, man, we haven't talked to each other in forever.

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,299
And I love how through the magic of podcasting

4
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:23,180
it appears we had a chat last week even though it's been like two weeks.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,079
And I love how anytime we do this, we cut our last recording

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,149
and then the whole world lights on fire.

7
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:32,520
Oh Well,

8
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:35,520
it always reminds me of like

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,560
just all these things like the Middle East or Russia where it's like,

10
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:39,720
and then it got worse.

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,360
Like,

12
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,680
II I remember doing this reddit comment where the

13
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,599
history of Russia can literally be summarized in one sentence

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,319
and then it got worse,

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,000
you know,

16
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,409
and that, that's the thing with Ted, right? Like

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,220
it just like I'm dealing with a GDPR troll. We'll mention that later in the show

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,599
and, you know, it's just,

19
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:57,509
I'm not,

20
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,380
yeah, I don't know what to say. Like,

21
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:01,200
like this Google plus thing is like

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,779
just such a cluster

23
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,419
on so many levels,

24
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:07,879
you know.

25
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,830
Um or, you know, like, let's face it neither of us are ever going to work at Facebook.

26
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:12,839
So I'll say it, you know, my,

27
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,839
my favorite Reddit comment was talking about the Facebook data breach.

28
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:19,599
Well, why is it a data breach? Well, because they didn't pay for the data.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,279
Right.

30
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:23,279
What, what, what's, what do you mean? They didn't pay for the data.

31
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,279
Facebook, one of Facebook's core business things is to sell

32
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,550
your data to people. Right.

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,319
Right.

34
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,300
That's kind of, isn't that a data breach?

35
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:36,639
Technically, when they give all your personal data away to somebody for money,

36
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,050
but I gave it to them.

37
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,720
Well, no, it's not because then they sold it and it's,

38
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,819
it's under contract. That's OK.

39
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,040
But you know, when somebody takes the data for free, oh, that's a breach. That's bad.

40
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,010
-- Right.
-- You know, it, well, that's the thing that gets me right.

41
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,360
Like, like all these companies that have exposed people's data, it's like,

42
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:59,440
except that company's core business model is selling that data,

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,000
you know, like, uh what was the one Equifax experience? All those guys

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,569
that had these data breaches.

45
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,100
Well, their, their core business model is selling that data to other people.

46
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:09,889
Yes.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,169
Yes, it is.

48
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,220
And then once it's out to those third parties, it's not like you can control it.

49
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:21,039
Well, I actually, so it is a data breach from the,

50
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:25,880
from the, well, we should have relativistic data.

51
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,449
Uh That's, that's the answer.

52
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,949
But you think from the perspective of Facebook from their reference point.

53
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:35,149
It's a data breach because they didn't sell the data from our perspective. It's

54
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,759
pretty much the way everything else works with Facebook,

55
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
a

56
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,889
third party

57
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,380
data from Facebook.

58
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,229
Right.

59
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,309
And I didn't tell them they could have it. Oh, wait, that's, that's everybody.

60
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,789
And this is what I find so offensive about Google Plus.

61
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,360
Now in Fairness,

62
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:54,589
Google plus wasn't again technically a data breach because Google

63
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,110
claims that nobody really maybe sort of got affected,

64
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,789
but we should back this up and explain what the

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,889
heck is going on just because it is conceivable.

66
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,669
When, when future historians review our podcast, they'll be like what happened?

67
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,270
Well, more to the point which Google plus breach,

68
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:13,210
you know.

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,020
Anyway,

70
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:19,839
-- so, ok,
-- well, let's start start with explain what happened at Facebook,

71
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,750
let's say first.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,699
Oh, well, so Facebook, well, again,

73
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,360
which data breach are we talking about the

74
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,440
-- most recent one with the like feature
-- thing?

75
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,639
The View

76
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,860
a

77
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,639
breach.

78
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:32,029
So, so Facebook had this feature called View

79
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:32,820
Oz.

80
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:39,130
-- It,
-- let me look at I could, for example, look at my profile as Kurt,

81
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,460
right? Well, so, so what happened was from my understanding is

82
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,509
they have a feature that I could for example, say what does my profile look like?

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,250
If, if Kurt is looking at it

84
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,729
and the way they accomplish that is they basically

85
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,929
built a URL that had like Kurt's a token

86
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,770
to like kind of log in as Kurt to load the page and then some people found out.

87
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:02,490
Well, hey, we can just reuse this token and do other stuff as Kurt. That's neat.

88
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:03,919
And it is neat.

89
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:04,509
Yeah.

90
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,949
Yeah. So, yeah.

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,880
And it turns out at first it was maybe 500 million now, it looks like only,

92
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:15,149
only air quotes, 30 million people were affected by this.

93
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,309
-- And
-- this is part of the beauty of it is. I just read 50

94
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:19,415
earlier today.

95
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,545
They have no

96
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:22,494
effing clue.

97
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:22,904
We

98
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:23,065
see

99
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:24,204
this.

100
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,535
Well, I'll talk about a bit this later, but in theory, these,

101
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:30,005
these blank is a service companies and Facebook is a blank.

102
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:33,894
You know, it's Facebook is a service, right? It's a, it's a online application

103
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:35,609
in theory,

104
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,279
they could have logs of everything and actually

105
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,839
be able to trace down their data breaches.

106
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,519
But in practice, well,

107
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:41,239
I mean,

108
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,440
they generally don't have logging as great as they should and

109
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,230
expensive. Well,

110
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,730
yeah. And more to the point. Why bother. Right.

111
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,640
Because you have a data breach, you move on.

112
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,339
Right. Because really what's ever happened from a data breach?

113
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,279
Has anybody ever had a massive fine yet?

114
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,709
Not yet? Maybe it'll happen.

115
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:02,500
So, here's what I love and then there's the counter argument. Um,

116
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:07,200
so moving along, Google plus had a sort of quasi breach

117
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,290
here. Let me just read this

118
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:08,690
very

119
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,200
polite

120
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,690
way.

121
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,500
Google says it discovered the bug was part of an effort called project Strobe,

122
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,350
which was launched to quote review

123
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,049
of third party developer access to Google account and

124
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:20,049
Android device data and our philosophy around apps,

125
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:23,000
data access unquote according to Ben Smith, blah, blah, blah blah blah.

126
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,809
So the idea was basically is that, you know,

127
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,500
like when you're in Google Drive and you want to say edit a PDF, well,

128
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,679
Google Drive doesn't do that.

129
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,480
So you can

130
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:35,640
go to this like one of these online application providers that provides PDF editing

131
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:38,589
and it's like I need access to your entire Google Drive to like,

132
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,609
edit your PDF and you're like you click, ok,

133
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:42,880
which is a terrible thing to do and it should be sandboxed.

134
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,950
But I digress.

135
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,350
Um, you know, it's like whenever like you,

136
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,859
you log into something from Twitter or Facebook and it's like,

137
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:51,420
I will need access to all your Twitter history and the ability to

138
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:53,510
post as you on Twitter so that you can log into this.

139
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,010
And it's like, nope, not doing that.

140
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,510
Actually, I had an app. I found the other day that wanted

141
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,859
the ability to post as me on Facebook.

142
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,220
And then it said, like, we promise never to do this.

143
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,700
We need this law that,

144
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,130
you know, is, it's a terribly written law, but we promise not to enforce it.

145
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,510
No, that's not how that works.

146
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:18,459
So

147
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,480
anyways, I, I think so, Google Plus had this thing and

148
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:23,670
here's

149
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,720
the biggest problem around this is that

150
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,299
they covered it up.

151
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,420
Yeah. Right. Exactly.

152
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:32,410
Right. They, they found some problems and then they covered it up. So

153
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,959
that to me is, is a cardinal sin like lying.

154
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,109
Like, you know, I'm teaching my kids, like, if you break something, tell me,

155
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,829
you know, but if you lie about it, I'll be super annoyed.

156
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,859
And they found this what in May?

157
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,260
And we're talking in October and I think they, they,

158
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,940
they acknowledged it in September.

159
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,579
Right.

160
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,690
Right.

161
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,850
-- Yeah.
-- And see what I find really offensive is Google. Plus we were all opted in.

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,570
Remember

163
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,109
when it just showed up one day?

164
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,230
II, I wanted to be part of Google Plus because I thought, oh, this sounds neat.

165
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,230
And then I looked at it and I'm like, man, this sucks.

166
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,299
But that was,

167
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,380
that was way back in the day,

168
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,089
man. That was a long time ago. But yeah, Google Plus never went anywhere.

169
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, you know,

170
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,299
and then they had that real name policy debacle where they

171
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,989
exposed a bunch of people's real names where they probably,

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,299
you know, wanted some privacy.

173
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,380
Um But

174
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,910
so anyway, so Google Cardinal and number one, the cover up, right? Because,

175
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,350
you know, you can do bad things.

176
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,109
But when you start doing bad things and lying about it,

177
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,750
see, now, I'm forced to wonder, what else have they covered up

178
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:37,970
and not got caught doing right? Because we know for sure they tried to lie to us once

179
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,130
every company does that

180
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:43,649
I'm, I'm gonna, I'm not gonna pull them too

181
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,649
in in high esteem in that respect.

182
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,690
Well, but it, but the problem is and then it got worse. So for example, here I love,

183
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,809
I love so one great part of this,

184
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,019
we made Google plus with privacy in mind and therefore keep

185
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:59,450
these this A P I's log data for only two weeks.

186
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,450
This means we cannot confirm which users were impacted by this book.

187
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,170
Thanks.

188
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:08,279
So, you know, I love that as part of their statement. You know,

189
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,359
they basically say blah blah blah blah blah.

190
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:13,320
Our privacy and data protection office reviewed this issue,

191
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,200
looked at the type of data involved

192
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,839
whether we could accurately identify the users

193
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,839
to inform whether there was any evidence of

194
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,429
misuse and whether there was any actions a developer or user could take in response,

195
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,579
none of these thresholds were met in this instance.

196
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,769
Now, number one, we don't know what the thresholds are,

197
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:29,200
right?

198
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:30,920
And we don't know what this means like,

199
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:34,530
like because they also just said that we only have two weeks of log data.

200
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,080
So we don't know if anybody got popped.

201
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,919
So they're literally are they literally saying, well,

202
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,599
we don't have the log data.

203
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,179
And so we don't really know if anybody got affected by

204
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,929
this and there's nothing really they can do about it.

205
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,159
So, you know, we feel like we don't need to tell them

206
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,400
because that's what I'm reading.

207
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:53,640
Oh man, I've been in conversations just like this,

208
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm sensitive to this problem. But I feel like

209
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,609
at the end of the day, you probably need to just say it happened,

210
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,520
right?

211
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:08,049
-- You
-- know, because we're going through this with the CV E for cloud services, right?

212
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,359
And

213
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:09,940
we, you know,

214
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,130
we we finally figured out why we're having so many arguments on

215
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,669
these calls because we actually haven't defined what is a vulnerable.

216
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:19,400
So in the classic CV, for software case, we have a trust boundary is violated

217
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,289
as the gold standard for, you know,

218
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,380
whether or not this is a vulnerability or exposure.

219
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,039
But in a cloud context,

220
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,619
you know, this is a bit more difficult.

221
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,530
So a great example is one of the major vendors is like, well,

222
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,570
we do keep a ton of logs and in a lot

223
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,250
of cases with these sort of cloud breach type things,

224
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,260
you know, we'll have a researcher come to us and say, hey,

225
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,250
I found this like wiggly little problem

226
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,390
um looks like a security flaw, you know, the vendor confirms it and says, yeah, oh,

227
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,450
wow, thanks, you know,

228
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,239
and they fix it

229
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,659
and then they go through their logs and telemetry

230
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,979
and in some cases can conclusively say 100%

231
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,979
this was never exploited or used,

232
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,979
right? Just full stop,

233
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:56,719
right?

234
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,919
So in that case, you know,

235
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,750
was there a vulnerability?

236
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,460
Well, there sort of was in the,

237
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,599
in the physics sense of like a vulnerability was observed,

238
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,690
you know, because that's the thing with software, right?

239
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,710
You have a vulnerability and you don't know if it was exploited or not because,

240
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:10,820
you know,

241
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,489
people run software on premises and half of

242
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,820
them forget that they even have it installed,

243
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,950
let alone have proper logging or firewalls or whatever.

244
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,169
So, you know, but with a service in some cases, you can

245
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,570
very

246
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,359
confidently say

247
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:28,849
we can prove the negative. Nothing bad happened. End of story. Right. We're good.

248
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:30,469
Right. Right.

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,369
And so in a case like that,

250
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,090
well, does this need to be treated as a vulnerability?

251
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,630
Now, in the case of Google, I would say yes,

252
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,659
it needs to be treated as a

253
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:42,109
vulnerability because there's so much uncertainty wrapped,

254
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,400
you know, wrapped around it.

255
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,729
There's two weeks of logs. So

256
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,799
like you said, this was floating around for several months.

257
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,799
No, it's, it's been around since like 2015.

258
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,710
They learned of it in May.

259
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,239
Oh yeah. No, no, no, I mean, yeah, sorry.

260
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:57,690
I mean, yeah,

261
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,710
the flaw has been present for years and but Google's only been aware of it, you know,

262
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:04,559
in that again, in that physics sense, you know, the observation

263
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,840
of the thing makes it

264
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,200
exist in a way, right? Because

265
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:11,479
all security flaws exist

266
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,719
while they exist.

267
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:16,640
But you know, if nobody knows about that security flaw, does it exist?

268
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,799
Well, for all intent and purposes? No,

269
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,320
you know,

270
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,880
there's, well, no, there's been, for example, Linux,

271
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:26,510
there's been Linux kernel flaws that were fixed and

272
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,659
only later found out to be security problems,

273
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,390
you know,

274
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,719
that happens a lot. Yeah.

275
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,409
Yeah.

276
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,450
So in a service, you know,

277
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,429
this gets a little messy because sometimes we can

278
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,530
say with certainty that this was not exploited or

279
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,679
uh this feature was not enabled for more than a few people or whatever.

280
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,969
But like I said, in this case,

281
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,900
I think there's enough uncertainty wrapped around this

282
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,500
Google thing that they should have come clean,

283
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,489
but they didn't want to.

284
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,409
Because where was that lovely quote?

285
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,390
Here we go.

286
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,619
According to the Wall Street Journal,

287
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,820
it was fear of regulation that led Google to not disclose it.

288
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,969
Google exposed the private data of hundreds of

289
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:59,830
thousands of users of Google plus social network.

290
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,969
Now in fairness,

291
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,770
this would have exposed everybody's data,

292
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:06,830
whoever tied in an application to Google Plus,

293
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:09,169
right? And uh

294
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,969
and then opted not to disclose the issue this past spring

295
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:16,510
in part because of fears that doing so would draw regulatory scrutiny

296
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,049
and cause reputational damage according to people briefed on the

297
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,500
incident and documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

298
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,309
Yeah, this is way better. Yeah.

299
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,380
Well, this is, this is the problem I have with cover ups. They don't work

300
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,200
right by and large cover ups

301
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,900
-- get leaked
-- seriously.

302
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:37,080
It's I tell my kids this like you nothing is a lie forever, right?

303
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,789
You might get away with it for a little while.

304
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,940
But like the the truth comes out sooner or later and

305
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,419
I know, that sounds like very high and mighty ish.

306
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:49,440
-- But I mean, for real
-- well, especially when you document it and send emails around,

307
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,599
right? I mean, if you're going to do a conspiracy in a cover up,

308
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,020
-- don't write memos about it.
-- It's true.

309
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,940
Do it, right, guys. Come on,

310
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:58,099
you have, you know,

311
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:01,419
you have physical conversations with your lawyers in the steam room,

312
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,200
you know, to make sure nobody's recording it.

313
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:05,380
You don't send out

314
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,400
when you start sending out memos saying

315
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,520
we're afraid of the legal consequences of doing the right thing here.

316
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:14,859
Yeah.

317
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,630
Yeah,

318
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:19,239
you lost, you know, it's like the diesel emissions, stuff like.

319
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:20,489
Yeah.

320
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,059
Uh huh.

321
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,799
Yeah. Good. You know. Nice paper trail. So,

322
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,630
this is what gets me, I mean, they documented this. They, I'm,

323
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,070
I'm surprised it took this long to come out.

324
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,030
Um, but less than six months. That's not bad.

325
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,909
I, I guess, I don't know how they got it.

326
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,630
It, it wouldn't shock me if there's more than this even that they've,

327
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,070
they've hidden away.

328
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,510
Well, see, that's the problem. They've, we now

329
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,270
know for sure that they've tried to lie to us once.

330
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:51,700
Right.

331
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,830
-- We have proof.
-- I'd be shocked if this is the first

332
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,750
that we found out Google lied to us.

333
00:13:58,289 --> 00:13:58,479
I'm pretty

334
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:00,219
sure there's others. We just don't care.

335
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,679
But in past we could have pretended like they weren't lying to

336
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,270
us because we didn't have proof that they have lied to us.

337
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,489
Yeah. There's probably some of that,

338
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,700
you know, and that's what I keep trying to explain to my Children is that

339
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:12,219
if you lie

340
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:15,299
more than a few times people will think you're a liar

341
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,140
-- because
-- that is the definition of being a liar.

342
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,210
Yeah. Exactly.

343
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:24,659
And that is, you know, that's the, with these corporations and organizations,

344
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,049
especially with these data breaches.

345
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,830
Yes. You know, the majority of them I don't trust at all anymore.

346
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,340
So going back to this, I mean,

347
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,820
on the one hand, I suspect it wasn't widely exploited. I suspect that actually

348
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,659
all things considered probably not that bad.

349
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,130
The problem is how Google handled it.

350
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:43,669
Yes.

351
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,270
Now, now let me ask this,

352
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,909
should we still trust Google and Facebook to be things like our oath

353
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,989
providers for our logins?

354
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,979
You pose this question like we actually have a choice.

355
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,729
You can pretend you have a choice.

356
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:02,359
I mean, most websites have their own user name and login form, right?

357
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:03,530
So

358
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,020
I need email, I need calendaring, I need documents.

359
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,979
What are my choices? Google Microsoft. No, I'm serious. Like, what are my choices?

360
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,609
I think Amazon technically has some solutions wrapped around this,

361
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:16,599
but it's not great

362
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:19,960
and there's a bunch of third party solutions and quite frankly

363
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,909
getting all my data properly out of Google and into one of these other things,

364
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,590
it would be really hard.

365
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,200
Doesn't sound like a lot of fun

366
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:30,950
and more to the point are they going to do a better job than Google. Probably not.

367
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,630
Nope, definitely not. Are they going to lie to me about data breaches?

368
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:35,690
Probably.

369
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,760
And, and that's just the reality of it, you know,

370
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,070
-- are my utility companies jerks now and going to try and, like,
-- now

371
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,549
they've always been jerks.

372
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,070
Yeah, exactly.

373
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,349
I just had the experience of, you know, getting a quote for a water heater and the guy,

374
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,880
like, it'll be, like, 75 bucks a month and I'm like,

375
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,400
what do you, what, like, what, what does that number mean? Right.

376
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:58,590
Like, don't, I just pay for it and he's like, no, no, no, you can rent it from us.

377
00:15:58,599 --> 00:15:59,080
And I'm like,

378
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:04,700
no, no, because, like, I get renting certain things makes sense.

379
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,179
Like a car if I'm traveling or something. But,

380
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,440
ok, so I rent this hot water heater from this company.

381
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,340
Can I get a bigger one for the weekend? I'm having a bunch of people over. Well, no,

382
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:17,130
you know, there you're guaranteeing you'll fix it with some sl a Sure.

383
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,380
I believe that. Uh huh. Yeah. Sure.

384
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,059
Um,

385
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:21,669
but that's,

386
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:23,179
that's the thing, do we,

387
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,340
you know, with Facebook?

388
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:27,849
I have a Facebook profile because I, you know,

389
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,309
people use Facebook and if I want to talk to them and communicate with them,

390
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,640
I don't really have a choice.

391
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,869
I can be that guy who doesn't use Facebook and then I don't learn about things,

392
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,229
family events and whatnot.

393
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,630
That is true. You know, same thing for linkedin.

394
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,630
Do I want to have a massive linkedin profile?

395
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:45,969
-- Not especially do I need to because I'm a, you know, it worker. Yeah.
-- Oh,

396
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,869
man, I,

397
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,205
I just got an email from linkedin today

398
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:51,875
that said I can add my phone number to

399
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,195
linkedin and then router recruiters can call me directly.

400
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,044
That sounds fantastic.

401
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:59,885
Yeah, let me, how fast can I nope out of this.

402
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:00,765
That's the

403
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:00,984
last

404
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:04,564
-- I have enough problem with that.
-- Well, and that's a great example. Remember,

405
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:08,444
remember when Facebook was like, 02 fa put your phone number and I'm like,

406
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:10,464
I'm going to regret this, but I did it anyways

407
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:13,218
and now they use my phone number for tracking.

408
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,398
I don't think I ever did that.

409
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:19,828
They, they know so much about you already and, and I guess this is,

410
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,468
this is one of the things I,

411
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:24,578
-- but
-- again, it's kind of that they lied about it, you know.

412
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:24,898
Well,

413
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,348
you're an idiot if you believe them. I'm sorry.

414
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,328
Well, that's what I mean. So fundamentally with Facebook,

415
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:34,718
are they going to sell my data or accidentally give it away to people?

416
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:35,808
Yeah, that's kind of,

417
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:36,318
that's

418
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,269
what they do.

419
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:37,548
Well,

420
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,788
that's like I saw another news story where someone was saying

421
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,848
there's voter information available on the dark web for the,

422
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,188
the upcoming election in the United States

423
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:51,848
and, and, but here's the best part is, people are like, you know,

424
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,558
you can get this for free if you just

425
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:57,418
like the state and, and some, there's some group

426
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,050
that,

427
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,520
that has this data and most of them give it away if

428
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,459
you ask for it and some of them charge a nominal fee.

429
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:04,209
So it's like

430
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,380
whoever is selling this on the dark web,

431
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,530
probably like legally obtained the data and then slapped a

432
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,400
huge price tag on it and put it out there.

433
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:16,130
I love it. It's just like what?

434
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:19,290
-- Yeah. Anyway,
-- I don't know the whole thing.

435
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,329
I, I think this,

436
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,010
how do I put this nicely?

437
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,089
I think the whole notion of data breach is flawed in the sense of

438
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,699
how can you have a data breach when the company's whole raison

439
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,069
D

440
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,030
Etre is to sell your personal data to third parties and they do so

441
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,969
well. No, no, we didn't have a data breach. Facebook had a data breach, right?

442
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:41,969
That's what I'm saying is how can we call what Facebook

443
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:45,239
did a data breach when fundamentally their whole purpose in being

444
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,520
is to sell your personal data,

445
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,040
right? And it's basically the same thing with Google plus, right? Where, where?

446
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,800
Yeah, like Google done made a mistake, but let's face it there.

447
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,079
They are almost certainly

448
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,010
sharing and selling this data already.

449
00:18:59,229 --> 00:18:59,739
Right.

450
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:04,819
-- Well, that's their business. Right.
-- Exactly. And, and we, we give it to them.

451
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,719
So I

452
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:11,229
guess in summary, there was no data breach as far as we're concerned.

453
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:13,439
It's just business as usual.

454
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:17,290
Yeah, you gotta love it man.

455
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,229
Well, and then, you know,

456
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:22,920
the whole GDPR thing comes in and this is what frustrates me with GDPR.

457
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,510
The,

458
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,069
I, I like the intent of GDPR but

459
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,319
I would say it's a,

460
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,290
it's not a well written law because I'm

461
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,790
currently dealing with the GDPR troll effectively.

462
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:34,290
So uh

463
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,209
the distributed weakness filing thing, you know, CV, stuff,

464
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,979
uh I need you to

465
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,959
MC WF, needs you to accept the CV terms of use so I can use your data, right?

466
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:45,390
That's just a standard part of how it works, you know,

467
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,729
it seems fair.

468
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:51,170
So I people fill out the form, the form is public, the form is labeled as public

469
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:54,969
they put in, you know, the CV details, their email address, I email them

470
00:19:55,339 --> 00:20:00,569
saying, you know, here's the CV terms of use. I need you to type in I accept and reply

471
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:05,369
and this artifact, this copy of this email will go into this G

472
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:07,449
repo at this URL,

473
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,020
right?

474
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:11,260
You know, it's, it's informed, it's as informed consent as I can get,

475
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,520
you can't accidentally miss click.

476
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,949
I've even had people type I accept like they deleted

477
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,719
the subject line and put I accept and I'm like,

478
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:19,069
no, you need to put it in the body like the email says

479
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,369
um

480
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,489
and then one guy did that like three times and then he typed, I accept this blah, blah,

481
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,410
blah and I'm like uh close enough, you know.

482
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,339
Uh but anyway, so this guy

483
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:31,050
submitted, used his email address,

484
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,660
submitted this and then now a year or two later is gone.

485
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,400
He emailed me and saying I want you to remove my email address.

486
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,709
My response was I'm sorry.

487
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,119
But no, and he's like under GDPR, I'm invoking my right to forget.

488
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,949
And I'm like, yep, still sorry. No, because

489
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,810
I think for a valid business purpose, I need this email address

490
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,910
and for technical reasons, I can't actually remove it,

491
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,300
remove it because it's in git,

492
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,660
right? Like without rewriting git history and like rolling it back and

493
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,650
doing all sorts of funky things, you can't actually get rid of your data.

494
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,219
It's like, well, you can just like hide it and that's good enough for me.

495
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:01,810
And I'm like, well, still sorry. No, because

496
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,099
you gave me really like informed consent

497
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,209
and you know, GDP R's right to forget is not absolute right.

498
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,510
You can't go to your local tax authority and be like,

499
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,890
uh I know I owe you money but I need you to forget all my personal data

500
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,349
or you know,

501
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,939
you go to the bank and you're like that million dollar loan I have with you.

502
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,180
Yeah, I want all my personal data redacted from that loan,

503
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,339
right? The bank's gonna be not, they're not going to do that. So

504
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:28,979
there are for legal and technical business and business reasons that you know,

505
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:30,810
the right to forget is not absolute.

506
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:31,060
So

507
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,140
he then went and complained to

508
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:33,599
github,

509
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,000
which, and github, I suspect their sort of GDPR plan,

510
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:44,000
like many companies was where possible, just whatever, uh, pass it on and, you know,

511
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,699
if you don't play nice, we'll boot you.

512
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,640
Right. Which is fair. Right. As a company, I don't want to deal with these jerks,

513
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:49,900
you know,

514
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,780
totally.

515
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,750
And so that's where we are now, we'll see what github

516
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,439
says.

517
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,420
But, um, I'm just realizing now,

518
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,280
so what constitutes personally identifiable information under GDPR?

519
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,160
Well, email address is for sure. But you know what about URL S? Right?

520
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:08,079
Uh I used to have my personal blog at kirk.cried.org, which obviously is my name,

521
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,530
you know,

522
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:15,359
uh your name is pi I your phone number, your address, uh national ID numbers,

523
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,020
things like that.

524
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,599
But I'm thinking of all the software out there, for example, with copyright notices

525
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,810
or your email address is in there somewhere because, you know, you're one of the,

526
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:24,770
one of the authors

527
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:31,000
or URL to your blog or something or where you posted about it or

528
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,199
you put something into a

529
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,010
github issue

530
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,170
or, you know, so it's not even in the source code but maybe it's in a github

531
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:36,689
issue.

532
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,859
And I'm realizing this is a problem for, you know, not just github, right?

533
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:42,979
But for all these other places that sort of allow essentially an, I

534
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,890
don't want to say anonymous, but, you know,

535
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,329
pseudo anonymous or anonymous data upload of just random stuff.

536
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,780
And yeah, I'm curious to see how it turns out. Right.

537
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,030
I've, I've left the ball in Github's

538
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,390
Court because quite frankly, they need to decide,

539
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,000
are they going to do this overly broad interpretation of GDPR,

540
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,500
you know, to sort of just, we don't want to deal with it either.

541
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:00,939
You,

542
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:02,719
either you do what this person says or we boot

543
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,459
you because we don't want to deal with this complaint,

544
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,300
you know,

545
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,530
or do they start doing something a bit more intelligent and selective and you know,

546
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,040
we'll see.

547
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,219
So if the DWF disappears from github, well, now, you know why?

548
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:13,420
Uh

549
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,020
-- but
-- like I said, I'm going to put my money on TWF disappearing

550
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:18,250
if I was,

551
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,489
if I was going to be.

552
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,219
Well, and the other thing too is this,

553
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:23,579
this email address was in there for a couple of years,

554
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:27,020
right? So the email address was also given pre GDPR.

555
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,180
That doesn't matter though. That's irrelevant.

556
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:35,219
No, it doesn't matter. But I just from the point of you had two years to ask for this.

557
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:37,500
Now, only finally, are you asking for it,

558
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,839
man? I,

559
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,000
I understand this.

560
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:44,510
I, I feel like it weakens the case.

561
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:50,729
It, it kind of, but the point is, I mean, so the intent of GDPR is to basically avoid,

562
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,609
we don't even know if this guy is in Europe.

563
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,170
I don't know. That's complicated too. That doesn't always matter

564
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:02,689
like I was just in Europe, right? So obviously that affects now, now I fall under

565
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,319
the rules of GDPR while I'm there.

566
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:09,339
It's so, anyway, anyway, I guess here's the thing though,

567
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,500
the, the intent of GDPR is to basically avoid the,

568
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,560
the disaster that like Google Plus and Facebook have created

569
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:18,500
and,

570
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,260
and like, obviously Google solved the Google Plus problem by killing it.

571
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,819
Well, the problem though is, is even if you have the right to be forgotten,

572
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,619
you can't

573
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,449
realistically

574
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,349
to, to use these services like Facebook and Google Plus, fundamentally,

575
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,890
you ha you are forced to give up personally

576
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,359
identifiable information,

577
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:41,150
right? And in some cases, they have real name policies now where they

578
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,300
want ID or a great example being, you know, Facebook to sign up for Facebook.

579
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,910
Now you have to give them a working phone number.

580
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,270
Well, ok. No, no, but here's the thing,

581
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,069
the,

582
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:53,349
there's the intent of GDPR,

583
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,619
there's always the intent of the law and the letter of the law and the

584
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,140
intent of GDPR is to empower users to have some control over their personal data,

585
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,859
which let's face it.

586
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,530
We've completely lost control. Right. Full stop.

587
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,300
I don't think anyone's going to disagree with that.

588
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:13,150
GDPR wants to give some of it back, but it's, it's not well written, it's very broad

589
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,069
and

590
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:14,780
we,

591
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,689
we need to refine it over the next couple of

592
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:19,040
years and here's one of the issues you run into.

593
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:19,770
Well,

594
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,910
actually it's much worse than that because

595
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,790
here's a trick question who enforces GDPR?

596
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:28,790
Oh, my goodness. The answer to that is like a seven hour podcast.

597
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,829
My understanding is that it's any

598
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,790
one

599
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,069
of the data

600
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,920
regulatory agencies

601
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,109
-- in any of the countries that fall under GDPR. So for example, you
-- can,

602
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:43,260
all of the countries can have different rules and regulations around them.

603
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,109
So you could end up under the in Poland or you

604
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,160
could end up in the Czech Republic or the German.

605
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:48,739
You know,

606
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:53,550
we all have very different data regulatory systems and

607
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:55,859
cultures and enforcement

608
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,869
and capabilities even, you know,

609
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,119
one guy was pointing out that one of these countries had something

610
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,680
like 17 people working at the agency and that was it,

611
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,260
that'll scale.

612
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,020
But so, so anyway, here's, here's kind of my point,

613
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:14,979
we know GDPR is broken and I'm certain Europe knows GDPR is

614
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:18,560
broken and there's things like trolls abusing it like in the,

615
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:20,680
in the kind of the context you're seeing

616
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,819
that's obviously not the intent of the law, but it's the letter of the law.

617
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:30,219
And so how we deal with that really becomes kind of the, the question for the future.

618
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:30,900
And of course,

619
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:35,959
companies don't want to deal with it because like their goal is to make you go away.

620
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,520
And if look, if you're moving your email address, makes, makes them go away.

621
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,760
Great, do that, right. Get rid of them, don't care.

622
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,280
And, and you have a different incentive than github does.

623
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,900
And, and so I don't know how it's going to work out,

624
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,880
but I know it's definitely not the first or last instance,

625
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,489
we're going to see something like this and it's

626
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,390
going to take years unfortunately for this to shake up

627
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,959
until we know what happens.

628
00:26:57,969 --> 00:27:00,959
Yeah, because I had some questions around, you know, enforcement of this.

629
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:03,849
My first question, this person requesting this takedown,

630
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,010
all I have is the email address.

631
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,810
I, I don't know where this person is. Are they in Europe?

632
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,040
And then I was actually asking some people, you know, at

633
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,050
what point do I become a subject of GDPR?

634
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,810
So for example,

635
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:17,030
if I emigrate to Germany and become a permanent resident or whatever,

636
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,500
the equivalent of that in Germany is clearly I fall under GDPR, right?

637
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,680
Uh What if I'm there on a student visa?

638
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,579
I probably fall under GDPR.

639
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:26,290
Well

640
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,800
as a Canadian, I don't need a tourist visa to go to Germany.

641
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,310
So what if I'm a tourist in Germany?

642
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:33,459
Am, am I is my data now subject to GDPR?

643
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,839
Yeah. Yeah, it is

644
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,900
that that's clearly defined, they call it. Uh what is it European persons?

645
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,800
I think it means a European person is just a human in Europe

646
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,339
or a European somewhere else.

647
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:50,239
It's quite, it's, it's pretty broad and it can affect nearly everyone.

648
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:53,640
So then when I receive a GDPR request for the sake of argument,

649
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,449
how do I have you prove that you're a European person

650
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:59,199
without ironically giving up a whole bunch of personal data,

651
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:01,680
I don't know if that's defined in the law. We, because

652
00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:06,645
I, I mean, for example, I deal with some of this at elastic is we, we don't care,

653
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:09,824
we've just taken the attitude, we're not going to ask you to prove anything.

654
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,244
If, if you make a request, we're going to,

655
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:15,525
to at least listen to you and deal with it as best as we can.

656
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:16,515
We don't care where you live.

657
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:19,094
-- And
-- to be honest, I think that's actually the correct way to do it

658
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,045
right? To be generally, I'm not

659
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,564
against the right to forget,

660
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,000
but it does seem like it was

661
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,829
not well written and that trolls can definitely use it to cause a lot of problems.

662
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,800
And I've actually thought about this.

663
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:37,760
You know, I have um my email address is in a huge

664
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,599
number of email archives.

665
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:42,819
Like look at me, we have a freaking podcast, right?

666
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,119
There's so much information about it.

667
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:48,750
So for example, let's say I ask

668
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:52,439
all the emailing list archives to remove my personal information,

669
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:53,880
right?

670
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,760
Because I posted the things like bug track and full disclosure. It's in

671
00:28:58,219 --> 00:28:59,770
millions of places.

672
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:04,680
Oh, seriously, man, we have, I'm sure thousands of messages in,

673
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,819
in like what is the mark.info mailing list archives sites?

674
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,229
I'm, I'm in there

675
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:14,680
probably in the thousands of times for my emails to

676
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,520
goodness knows how many lists over the last what like 30 years.

677
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:23,319
And that doesn't even count like my fake names. Right.

678
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,739
Yeah. Well, and for example, you and I were both assigning CV S.

679
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,109
Well, if you take away that

680
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,469
information, it kind of,

681
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:31,140
you know,

682
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,339
those archives really become a bit broken in that a fundamental

683
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,540
piece of an email archive is who sent that email.

684
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:37,680
Uh

685
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,359
Sure. And, and of course, in the context of, of you and me, like we don't care.

686
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,300
But yeah, I, I think the trolls are trolls ruin everything, right?

687
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,420
That's kind of the, the moral of the story and, and I'm sure there's some,

688
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,089
some European privacy people shouting at their computer right now over us,

689
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:55,650
which is fine. I don't mind.

690
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,050
Uh Right. Anyway,

691
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,489
I don't know, man, I,

692
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,890
this is one of those things that it's going to shake itself out in time and

693
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:08,089
I, I guess the one thing that always fills me with, with comfort is

694
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:12,329
even badly written laws usually get fixed,

695
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:17,699
right? And we know GDPR is badly written and it's going to get fixed.

696
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:18,449
All right.

697
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:18,810
Anyway,

698
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,479
we should probably call this one and we've

699
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:22,670
rambled on long enough about Facebook and Google.

700
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,369
So I guess in summary, uh yeah, there you did not have a data breach.

701
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,040
Facebook and Google had data breaches.

702
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,579
Your data is still being sold just like it was before.

703
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,829
No, that's interesting. Let's rent data.

704
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,689
Well, you know,

705
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:39,790
we promised to get rid of it at the end of the week when we are done renting it.

706
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,569
Oh, I'm Sure. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't copied it off to a spreadsheet that

707
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:43,810
never

708
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,119
happen.

709
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,099
And I'm storing in a Google Drive.

710
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:50,959
Oh, man. All right, sweet. Any last thoughts, Kurt,

711
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:53,050
you know, II,

712
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:54,280
I don't know anymore.

713
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,619
It's too late to opt out of these things and it's

714
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,520
not like you can opt out of your credit score.

715
00:30:58,849 --> 00:30:59,319
So

716
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,800
I guess go live in the woods

717
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,069
-- that
-- even, that won't help. Look, we, we've lost control of our data.

718
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,910
GDPR wants to help get it back.

719
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,000
I hope they do, but I'm not totally convinced they will.

720
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,349
I mean, that's the reality of it.

721
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:13,160
So anyway.

722
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,449
All right, man. Thank you. Thank you very much for listening.

723
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:18,969
