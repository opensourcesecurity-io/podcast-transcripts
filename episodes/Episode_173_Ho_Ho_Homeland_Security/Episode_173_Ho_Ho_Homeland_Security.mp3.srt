00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,190
-- We're going to call it the Christmas special.
-- Whatever you wanna call it.

1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,630
Christmas special doesn't sound grand enough to me.

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,879
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

3
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:19,719
The Christmas spectacular episode with myself,

4
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,399
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

5
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,319
Santa Claus.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,229
Ho

7
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,340
ho ho

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,280
-- wait, wait. No ho ho homeland Security. Yeah.
-- So um sir, did you pack these bags?

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,430
What did sir? Did you pack these bags?

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,150
No, I'm Santa Claus. I don't pack my own bags. All right, sir.

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,240
-- Do you know, do you know the contents of these bags?
-- Presents for good girls and boys?

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,689
-- Who? It sounds like you're not on that list? Uh
-- Are, are these presents wrapped?

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,380
-- Some are
-- wrapped?

14
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:51,540
Uh I'm gonna need to unwrap them and examine them before I can let you in.

15
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:52,740
What?

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,680
That's what it says on the Canadian government website,

17
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,430
traveling with gifts.

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,659
If you are traveling with gifts, do not wrap them before crossing the border.

19
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:04,388
If a gift is wrapped. A BS O Border Services officer

20
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,480
may need to unwrap the gift to examine the goods you are bringing into Canada.

21
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,150
Because what if you're trying to bring kinder eggs?

22
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,349
No, wait, we are allowed, we're allowed to have kinder

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:11,629
eggs.

24
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:12,510
-- You guys are
-- allowed to

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:12,809
have,

26
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,919
what? Can't I bring to Canada?

27
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,760
I mean? 000, you want, you want, you want that list?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,940
Firearms and weapons, food plants, animals and related products, explosives,

29
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,769
fireworks and ammunition vehicles,

30
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,360
vehicles. What?

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,180
Oh.

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,610
And consumer

33
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,430
products.

34
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,279
The taxes that could pose a danger to the public.

35
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,139
Eg baby walkers and security beans that are often found in art or bead work

36
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,000
are not allowed to be brought into Canada.

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,910
What's

38
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,440
I had to look it up? It's like this weird.

39
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,440
It's a bean

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,269
like that. They put on jewelry. It's like this.

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,459
-- And
-- what, what's wrong with the bean?

42
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,160
Aris precatory, commonly known as J

43
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,730
security bean or Rosary pea is a herbaceous flowering plant in the bean family

44
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:56,309
facia. And I apologize for my pronunciation.

45
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:58,750
It is a slender perennial climber with long

46
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:03,080
pinnate leaf flitted leaves that Twines around trees, shrubs and hedges.

47
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,349
Oh, so it's like an invasive plant?

48
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:08,309
Oh, yeah. I don't imagine they do well here in winter though.

49
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,690
You never know, man. Some of these invasive plants are amazing. This is what they do.

50
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:15,820
Equatorial.

51
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,479
-- So
-- OK, that's fair.

52
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,710
I was, I was not expecting that to go there.

53
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,649
Nor could I stay in character for any period

54
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,539
of time given how absurd the questions were.

55
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:24,020
But

56
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,809
-- so
-- these are, these are actually like things I've been asked.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,440
Uh No, I, I agree. You do get asked them.

58
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:31,820
But at the same time, luckily,

59
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,570
Santa illegally crosses the border so he doesn't care.

60
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:34,600
So

61
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,839
I just assumed he was going to be going

62
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,220
under diplomatic immunity with like a diplomatic bag.

63
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,630
I know

64
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,559
that's a good point. But let's before we go on,

65
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,529
we will,

66
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,289
the, the, the topic of this year's Christmas episode,

67
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,710
which is always my favorite episode of the year is the,

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,110
the border security implications of Santa Claus,

69
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,419
which I know in the past we've talked about all kinds of crazy

70
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:59,690
stuff and it's actually getting harder and harder to come up with ideas.

71
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,190
So if anyone has good ideas, always let us know. But

72
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,639
-- the border implications of Santa Claus.
-- Well, and also the, um,

73
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,750
the transborder, you know, monetary movement stuff because

74
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,779
I know for a fact some people do get, you know,

75
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:15,820
cash or cash equivalents for Christmas, you know, gift cards.

76
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,419
Let's lay that down, right. You've got people get guns for Christmas.

77
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:22,729
I'm sure people get drugs for Christmas. People get beer for Christmas.

78
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,570
People get money for Christmas. People get fruit for Christmas.

79
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,759
People get plants for Christmas people get

80
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:29,660
and animals for Christmas.

81
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,910
Basically, every single thing you're asked at crossing a border

82
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,750
someone is getting for Christmas,

83
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,699
not counting the fact that this man drives a flying sleigh pulled by farm animals.

84
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,309
-- Are
-- they
-- farm animals? I thought they were wild reindeer. Are they wild?

85
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,520
I don't know, they're not wild. They're named you don't name wild animals.

86
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,389
-- Yeah, you can name wild animals.
-- No, you don't name what they're pets or farm.

87
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,500
I don't know. Is,

88
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,940
is the north wall a farm? That's one of the questions I would argue.

89
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:01,289
It's a reindeer farm and a slave encampment.

90
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,679
-- But I'm sure it could go either way.
-- Ah, reindeers are not fully domesticated.

91
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:09,880
-- Well,
-- not in the wild. This is Santa Claus. He can do whatever he wants.

92
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:10,919
No, nowhere.

93
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,520
What would you be? Nowhere

94
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:13,520
-- you're
-- telling me

95
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,600
domesticated, what does that mean?

96
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,134
It means they're part domesticated.

97
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:19,793
No.

98
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:23,033
Look, man, according to this ridiculous narrative,

99
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:25,593
Santa Claus has domesticated reindeer.

100
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:27,794
They are named, they can fly

101
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:32,834
-- and they pull a sled.
-- Well, and one of them has an atomic glowing nose to lead the way.

102
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:33,783
Right?

103
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:35,653
And that one you could maybe argue is,

104
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:39,753
or isn't canon depending upon what you want to do and copyright law and whatever.

105
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:40,114
But,

106
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,674
right. Anyway,

107
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,489
no, I, seriously, they're, they're easily domesticated and I have no doubt

108
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:52,230
if you had a cart being pulled by reindeer and you tried to cross any border,

109
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,709
-- they would not let them in.
-- Uh, I don't know. I'd, I'd wanna

110
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,390
maybe between Finland and Russia or vice versa.

111
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,829
Any border with people paying attention to those crossing.

112
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:08,109
No, I'm just wondering, this guy's customs declaration would be a mess.

113
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:12,290
There's obvious it doesn't have a custom declaration because Santa Claus

114
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,429
is illegally crossing borders.

115
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,950
You figure when he's on the border between, say America or United States and Canada.

116
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:24,369
He's not just only staying in the United States and then going back to Canada. Right.

117
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,730
He's got to do some up and down action here.

118
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:26,910
See,

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,970
I've never understood that because everything I've seen generally

120
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,589
says that he goes in some sort of alphabetical order

121
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,130
-- or like door to door.
-- What,

122
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:38,739
what do you mean? Well, I door to door, chimney to chimney,

123
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:39,920
chimney, chimney.

124
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:43,309
And if you don't have a chimney, then whatever, too bad. Right.

125
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,829
But I've also seen movies where he's going in alphabetical order.

126
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,542
Well, I've never seen the delivery in alphabetical order. His list is clearly in

127
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:51,863
alphabetical order

128
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,733
given every movie ever seen.

129
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,872
Just the fact that you have to organize people in some meaningful

130
00:05:56,882 --> 00:06:01,263
way and alphabetizing their names seems the most reasonable thing to do.

131
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:04,062
Maybe Santa has quantum computers.

132
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:04,942
I didn't

133
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:06,072
-- this last
-- year.

134
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:06,493
That

135
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:09,502
one way to anneal the traveling salesman problem

136
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:11,622
maybe. Or

137
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:11,993
use

138
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:13,822
magic, which is the easier

139
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:18,075
for every problem of, oh, magic does it. It's fine magic.

140
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:20,385
Maybe he's responsible for global warming. Right.

141
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:24,096
Because if he's traveling through the night at like mach 1000 or whatever,

142
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:24,906
infinity, million

143
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:25,776
MPH,

144
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:26,256
no,

145
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,895
global warming is the cause of humans

146
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:31,126
releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

147
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:31,496
And

148
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:33,096
while you're joking,

149
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:34,455
I don't want that to catch out.

150
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:37,895
Sadly. True. Yeah, I guess we do.

151
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:41,055
Yeah, that and, and vaccinations are good for you in general.

152
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,769
So I

153
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,730
probably go with your flu shot folks. Even if it hurts for a day.

154
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,290
-- It does.
-- Good day, man. I was sick for like, three days but whatever. Got it anyway.

155
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,570
-- They're good to get.
-- I think that's just our immune system.

156
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,779
Like, like, I remember being sick as a kid and it wasn't a big deal.

157
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,119
Now, I get like this, like, I've had this head cold for a week.

158
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:00,570
I hear you. It's getting old sucks. It's dumb. Don't get old kids

159
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,279
don't do right. Anyway,

160
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,089
Santa Claus Crossing borders.

161
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:04,929
So,

162
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,929
no, I, I was, I was thinking about that

163
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:08,929
when any of us cross borders,

164
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,630
we get asked all these crazy questions and it occurred to

165
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,709
me that literally Santa Claus violates every single one of them.

166
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,470
-- Absolutely.
-- And that's,

167
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,950
it's kind of wild if you think about it.

168
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,549
I'm still not clear like why prohibited consumer products, baby walkers,

169
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,970
infant self feeding devices, which again,

170
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,290
I had to look up what that was because I've never heard.

171
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,049
What does that count?

172
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:33,149
As, is that like one of those cups they can hold or is it something else?

173
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,230
Um,

174
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,190
like a fork, fork is a self feeding device.

175
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,089
It's uh it doesn't,

176
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:39,260
I,

177
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:43,410
I'm actually not able to find a good definition of what an infant's

178
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,040
self feeding device is and I was googling it for a while.

179
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,220
They all mention it,

180
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,890
but it's like banned.

181
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,290
But yeah, like I, I can't actually like if you, like, if I search Amazon for it,

182
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,619
obviously I'm going to get like a whole bunch of random

183
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,899
stuff that I don't know if that's correct or not.

184
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,899
It wouldn't shock me if it doesn't have like a real definition

185
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:03,299
just because

186
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,839
there's, there's so much that happens on border control.

187
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,609
It's like airport security where

188
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,350
you don't even know what's going on half the time and

189
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,859
the rules are not clear and I have a feeling they're,

190
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,459
they're ambiguous on purpose

191
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,190
because it gives

192
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,500
that agent

193
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,529
kind of more discretion and power over the people they're having to deal

194
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,799
with which and I'm not going to say it's right or wrong.

195
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,100
It just is what it is.

196
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,160
Well,

197
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,410
if you go down the aisle of like trying to actually define every single illegal act,

198
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,780
you know, to quote Charles Strauss, you end up with laws like, you know,

199
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,460
operating a segue aggressively in a residential neighborhood after 8 p.m.

200
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:40,587
You're right.

201
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,419
Yes. And I mean, that's the intent behind a lot of the

202
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,729
just law

203
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,690
in the western world is there's that kind of interpretation aspect of it, but

204
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,690
whatever, we're not going to talk about law today because that's boring.

205
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,700
We're talking about Santa Claus illegally crossing borders.

206
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,299
Well, so I'm going to assume he's going to go through like, you know,

207
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,460
those uh portable like truck, X ray scanners, you know,

208
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:05,739
they have like the big truck with the boom that comes out.

209
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,460
-- No,
-- he's not going to go through anything.

210
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,549
He legally crosses the border, Kurt. He can fly. He doesn't care.

211
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,229
So, I mean, seriously, let's break this down. Ok.

212
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,489
You've got, now, where is the North Pole?

213
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,599
Does the North Pole have a jurisdiction by country?

214
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,510
I don't think any country owns a North Pole, right.

215
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,429
Uh, so magnetic North Pole is in Canada.

216
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,059
Actual geographical North Pole is, it's a block of ice.

217
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,700
-- Yeah,
-- it's over the ocean, right?

218
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,010
For now. It's a block of ice.

219
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,830
Give it a, give it another decade. And

220
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:35,080
-- that's
-- right.

221
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:35,830
That's right.

222
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,280
So, ok, so we all know that Santa Claus lives on the geographical North Pole,

223
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,039
not the magnetic North pole.

224
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:45,159
So he is

225
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:51,869
in a region that has no allegiance to a country. So obviously Santa is a rogue nation

226
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:55,969
that violates countless laws every single Christmas.

227
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:59,659
Well, probably outside of Christmas as well because I, I imagine he travels

228
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,340
outside of that.

229
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,330
Maybe.

230
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,830
Well, no labor laws don't apply when you're a rogue nation cart,

231
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,809
you can do whatever you want.

232
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,409
So, enslaving those elves is probably technically not illegal. Although

233
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,210
I have a suspicion once you bring your goods into another country,

234
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,409
there are certain laws and regulations you have

235
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,330
to follow many of which he's no doubt.

236
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,630
-- Breaking.
-- Wait, is any of his stuff ul tested or listed?

237
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,090
It has stickers on it.

238
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,530
What does that mean? Well, no, no, no.

239
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:27,400
Like if it's underwriter, like is all,

240
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,530
all the electronic stuff he makes and all the batteries

241
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:32,609
he makes are those actually safety certified and tested or is

242
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:36,130
he just some random guy making millions and billions of batteries

243
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,429
every year that hopefully don't catch your house on fire?

244
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,929
Well, that's the question. Right.

245
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,530
Is there also massive IP theft occurring here

246
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:47,960
where Santa and his band of enslaved elves

247
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,679
are copying something,

248
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,510
someone else made and duplicating it to the point that the forgery has

249
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,440
the UL stickers and prints on all the products in the boxes.

250
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,200
I don't know.

251
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,049
Let's assume for the moment we will ignore that particular

252
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,229
facet of this because I think the intellectual property theft.

253
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,140
Yeah, I, well, the IP theft, it's

254
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:11,880
uh

255
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:12,270
at

256
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,780
least he's not making money doing this.

257
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,890
-- So there is that sort of moral side of it like he's doing this as a charity,
-- right?

258
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:24,000
Is it? I don't know what's the purpose behind it? I don't know what the angle is here.

259
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,489
-- Do
-- I
-- have to cut Santa check? Now? Is that something I've been missing out on?

260
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,719
That? Sounds like a heck of a deal.

261
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:31,549
But I don't know. We'll, we'll ignore that.

262
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,099
Although, no,

263
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:36,260
I believe the historical purpose of Santa was

264
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,960
a benevolent person who would reward the good

265
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:42,849
and in, in some, some cultures,

266
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:46,330
there was a partner who had punished the bad where obviously you've

267
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,890
got uh Krampus who is the best bad guy at Christmas ever.

268
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,609
-- So,
-- yeah, for those of you wondering about Santa's sidekick.

269
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,239
We've discussed him on previous podcast.

270
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:00,200
But needless to say there's a lot of these old cultural tales were not

271
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,330
terribly sensitive. Shall we say?

272
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:03,080
Krampus?

273
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,619
Krampus is a wholesome character. All he just what eats the Children?

274
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,809
It's fine that I'm, I'm comfortable with that.

275
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,169
I can get behind that.

276
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:14,229
I know a lot of kids that I wouldn't complain if a monster ate them. So I'm fine.

277
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:16,830
It's fine. It's fine. Krampus. We can live it anyway. Anyway.

278
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,909
Yeah, exactly. Some days I wish he'd eat my kids, but some days

279
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,489
-- we've all been there.
-- Does he? Politicians?

280
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,750
-- Uh
-- oh, man, that'd be so nice. That would be so nice.

281
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,950
Send Krampus to Washington DC and it would fix all of our problems,

282
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:32,710
you

283
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:33,820
-- know,
-- when you left,

284
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:34,969
right,

285
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:40,030
you probably have a bad case of politician indigestion like poor krampus.

286
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,950
It was a good effort anyway. Anyway. Ok.

287
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,849
So we're going to assume Santa has no

288
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,690
claim to any one nation,

289
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,229
which also means Santa Claus can't have a passport.

290
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,169
Right?

291
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,809
If he's, well, he could be a stateless individual. Yes.

292
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,460
And, but if you're a stateless individual, how does that work?

293
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:04,659
I, I don't understand that.

294
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,849
So if you're a stateless individual,

295
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:10,409
you can get like an emergency passport from a variety of countries.

296
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:14,760
It's, I forget what color is. I want to say yellow. I know diplomatic is white.

297
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,729
Regular is blue. I think it's, oh, gray, sorry. I think gray.

298
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:21,349
Is the kind of the emergency one. Anyways you can get,

299
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,599
if you are a stateless individual,

300
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:27,010
you can get travel documents because this actually happens more than it.

301
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,849
Well, should, I mean,

302
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:32,000
some of it is people get their citizenship revoked and they only have membership,

303
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,650
you know, citizenship of a single state or in some cases.

304
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,380
Well, I mean, uh uh, what's his face?

305
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,229
-- Uh, Tom Hanks the movie where he lives in the airport for a while,
-- the terminal.

306
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:41,479
I think

307
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,650
I never saw it but I'm familiar with it.

308
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:48,570
There have been cases where, like, I'm a, you know, I'm a citizen of a country that,

309
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,320
whoops, it stopped existing

310
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:52,489
and I didn't get any new paperwork.

311
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,359
Ok. That's fair. Well, actually I didn't know this, I looked this up a while back but

312
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:56,700
I,

313
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,500
I don't know if other countries have this but I could denounce

314
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,200
my US citizenship and become not a citizen of the United States,

315
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,299
-- but you can't do it for tax purposes.
-- No. Right. There's,

316
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:08,510
-- yes,
-- they figure that one out.

317
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,479
Yeah. Good for them.

318
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,190
I know.

319
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:15,400
And funny enough that's not why I looked it up but now that you say it,

320
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:16,929
I chuckle at that because I,

321
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,950
I was talking to some friends about such things where

322
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
there's obviously countries with the tax rate is really high.

323
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:23,320
And I was like, well, can't you just, like, pretend to move to some other country?

324
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,039
And they said, oh, no, they they have that figured out like you can't,

325
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,299
and there's all these protections they have around

326
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,510
not pretending to move somewhere else and become a different citizen.

327
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,429
-- Just so you don't have to pay high tax,
-- how many days of residency and so on.

328
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,239
That's right. That's right. Exactly.

329
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,190
Anyway, ok, so let's even if he has a travel document,

330
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,289
well, in fairness,

331
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,549
he doesn't necessarily need a travel document because for example,

332
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,520
the Queen of England does not have a passport.

333
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,280
No, Kurt, he doesn't need it because he's illegally entering all of these countries

334
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:51,109
like that.

335
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,280
But let's let's pretend for a minute

336
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,090
that Santa Claus

337
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:59,960
is going to try to legally enter a country from where he is, right?

338
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,320
So first of all,

339
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,460
you have to enter at a, a port,

340
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,510
you can't just go in wherever you want, right?

341
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,109
And there's obviously certain places you can enter in certain places you can't.

342
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:15,299
So if he's coming from the North Pole into basically any country,

343
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,909
you're going to have to fly out over international waters first

344
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:19,909
and then

345
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:21,690
enter the country

346
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:22,969
at some port

347
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,919
and I don't know the rules, but I have a suspicion,

348
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:30,669
an unknown aircraft can't just enter the airspace of any country they want to go to.

349
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,070
They generally frown upon that. Like I know

350
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,580
there's a lot of internal flights within Canada that go to Toronto,

351
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,929
obviously being the heart of Canada.

352
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:44,044
And you know, Toronto is pretty much to the South and sort of surrounded by the US on,

353
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:45,244
well, 2.5 ish, it's

354
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:46,794
kind of like dips down

355
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:47,135
the

356
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:47,484
leg.

357
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:48,635
And so

358
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:53,205
those flights that go through, they go through American airspace,

359
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:56,145
they have to send the passenger manifest, you know, to America.

360
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,565
So there's people that have been refused

361
00:15:57,945 --> 00:16:01,354
boarding on a flight because they're on the US, no fly list.

362
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:02,755
Even though they're flying from

363
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,580
a Canadian city to another Canadian city.

364
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,020
I didn't know that was a thing actually because when I,

365
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,580
I fly from Detroit a lot to different places and like, when I fly Detroit to Boston,

366
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,020
we're totally going over Canadian airspace

367
00:16:15,469 --> 00:16:16,640
-- most of the time
-- we

368
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,059
relaxed about these things.

369
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,679
Interesting.

370
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,960
I didn't realize that that's why I, I suppose that sort of makes sense because

371
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,239
you figure if you're flying from,

372
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,840
say Detroit to Boston and you have a problem over the top of Toronto,

373
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,390
you're landing there.

374
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,659
Right.

375
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,150
Well, more to the point

376
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,520
they've quasi

377
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,619
entered America.

378
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:39,159
It's, it's one of those things where, you know, it's like a legal fiction of like, ok,

379
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,049
you're entering America.

380
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:41,770
So we're going to have, you know, some interest in it.

381
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,380
But we also acknowledge from like a rational sane perspective,

382
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,190
we're obviously not going to enforce border

383
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,859
controls because you fly through our airspace because

384
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,679
to fly around our airspace would add, you know, 1015,

385
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,280
20 minutes to the journey and just generally be a pain in the butt.

386
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:55,809
Right.

387
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,080
So,

388
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,159
yeah, I mean,

389
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,880
I, I get it, you know, it's, it's,

390
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,359
the world is complicated, you know, not all

391
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,700
everything's

392
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,439
-- squiggly lines.
-- So,

393
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:06,160
so,

394
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:07,680
problem number one

395
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:12,439
is Santa Flies. He's going to have to find a way to not fly

396
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,520
to a port of entry in the country.

397
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,880
Well, he's also violating airspace rules, all sorts of, I mean,

398
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,909
what, what's this craft classified as? Anyways,

399
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,878
a sled? Like, is it a small engine or is it a multi engine?

400
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:29,038
-- Like there's what, how many Reindeer
-- Reindeer multi engine? Eight plus one? Yeah.

401
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,318
So,

402
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,389
yeah, it's a nine engine craft and I'm pretty sure that, you know,

403
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:36,788
-- like does he fly under visual flight rules
-- is a reindeer an engine?

404
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:38,168
Well, I don't know, I mean,

405
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:41,909
what if I want to take my, my horse drawn carriage to Canada?

406
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:44,609
What, what does that count as a vehicle? Can I?

407
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:48,019
Well, if your horse and carriage fly, I feel like, you know,

408
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:48,680
now

409
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,520
is going to want to have words with you?

410
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,979
I mean, that's fair too.

411
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:56,000
You can't write like I'm gonna just wheel my airplane across the border, right?

412
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,819
-- They're gonna be like, no, you're, you're not doing it.
-- I don't

413
00:17:58,829 --> 00:17:59,140
-- think
-- you can

414
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,540
put a land crossing in a Cessna 172, like put, putting along.

415
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,130
I wonder, that's a good question. I bet it's,

416
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:07,319
I bet it's never been done before.

417
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,170
I feel like they're gonna have a lot of pointed questions for you.

418
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,750
I would hope so, but that's the least,

419
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,650
that would be the least weird question just for the record.

420
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:18,109
Ok.

421
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,969
So, ok, so let's assume Santa Claus can somehow get to

422
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:28,030
the customs on a port of entry coming from international,

423
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,689
something right out of waters, airspace, whatever.

424
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,930
-- Yeah. Well, you could just land at an airport
-- and

425
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:38,199
can you though, can you just radio? Does he have a radio? I don't know.

426
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,479
I will assume he does.

427
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,810
Well, he's got,

428
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,250
he's got radios as gifts. Right. I mean, people get radios as gifts, you know,

429
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,050
aircraft radio.

430
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:47,829
I'm sure,

431
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:49,770
I'm sure somebody does.

432
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,489
Somebody does. That's right.

433
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,609
And his right, his intellectual property thieving factory could just make one.

434
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,520
So we'll assume he has a radio.

435
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,390
Why not?

436
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,170
So, I wonder how that works.

437
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,849
Can you just, like,

438
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:05,140
-- be an aircraft and show up and say I need to land at your airport
-- in an emergency?

439
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,270
That happens all the time, right.

440
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,849
Like you divert to an airport and it's like we're landing here now,

441
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,989
except this wouldn't be an emergency. All right.

442
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,359
So we're, we're, we're rat holing ourselves.

443
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,839
Oh, maybe what if the, one of the reindeer has to go to the bathroom?

444
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,069
We're 20 minutes in and we haven't even entered a country.

445
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:23,880
This is a nightmare.

446
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,829
So, well, I mean, the thing is he's going to land at an airport

447
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:30,979
and, you know, like they're going to send out a customs agent to

448
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,189
have

449
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:31,329
a

450
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,989
-- chat with him. Great.
-- Let's say he lands at an airport.

451
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
That's just easiest then you have, right?

452
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,280
Customs people are going to show up and be like, what's the deal?

453
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,000
Yo, fat man with a bunch of reindeer.

454
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:43,880
And so the way I see it,

455
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,660
imagine filling out that customs form.

456
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:48,219
When we fill out a customs form,

457
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,359
you're supposed to list like every individual thing.

458
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,079
I mean, what does Santa write? Like Christmas gifts, like,

459
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:56,739
you know, estimated value infinity. Pretty much

460
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:57,479
it's

461
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,579
more money than you have. I,

462
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,170
I

463
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,500
mean, in all seriousness,

464
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,170
I bet the worldwide share of Christmas gifts

465
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,130
share in a value equal to most countries.

466
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,709
GDP.

467
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,569
-- Si suspect that's safe to say
-- probably,

468
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:16,609
I bet if you move down probably to number 8 to 10 on the list of GDP,

469
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,010
that's probably the amount of money we're talking about, which is,

470
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,209
which is kind of nuts if you think about it worldwide. Of course, for Christmas. Ok.

471
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,209
So Santa gets at an airport,

472
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,770
customs people come out,

473
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,489
they're going to, I guess first of all, what you're going to

474
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,520
potentially need a visa because I assume

475
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,689
if you're traveling on country list documents,

476
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:39,140
even if you're just transiting, right?

477
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,770
Like uh for example, you know,

478
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,609
Americans will fly to Vancouver to get on in on a cruise ship.

479
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:44,439
Well, you,

480
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,619
you know, from my,

481
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,560
from my binge watching of, you know, Canada border controls

482
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,229
if you're inadmissible to Canada.

483
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,930
Because for example, you have like a criminal history or something.

484
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,130
Yeah, tough. We're not letting you get on that cruise ship.

485
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,949
You're, you know, getting bounced back.

486
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,550
Well, yeah, I mean, I would totally expect that even if you're getting on a boat,

487
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,349
it still counts as entering the country,

488
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,630
regardless of whether he's staying or just transiting.

489
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,189
He's, yeah, they're, they're going to want to see a visa or something,

490
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,180
you know, I, I imagine a piece of paper with, I am Santa.

491
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,510
It is allowed, is not going to cut it for them.

492
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,530
I have a note for Mrs Claus.

493
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,410
Right. Right. Exactly. So, now you've got nine deer.

494
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,150
Oh, they're going to need to be quarantined for, uh,

495
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,209
I think horses are quarantined for a week or two.

496
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:34,180
Yeah. Right. You can't just bring animals into a country for fun. I know my,

497
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:39,310
my brother used to live in Europe and he had some cats and he looked into

498
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,180
what it would take to bring them back to the United States and it was,

499
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,219
it was bonkers what it took to.

500
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:45,290
I mean, it was honestly,

501
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,380
it was cruel and unusual because they basically were

502
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,979
locked up in a cage for like a month.

503
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:49,359
Yeah.

504
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:52,920
It's funny because my, my sister's cat is American and actually he,

505
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,900
he's been across the border probably at least 50 or 60 times because she used to

506
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,640
work in the US, but, you know,

507
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,349
travel back to Canada a lot and so she'd take her cat back and forth with her.

508
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,060
And honestly,

509
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:06,280
she would bring all the paperwork for this guy with all his shots and everything and

510
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,050
they really didn't mind that much.

511
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,079
It's a cat in Canada, like these are nine deer

512
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:14,500
that can fly.

513
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:16,229
That's true. Reindeer are not just deer.

514
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:16,439
Oh,

515
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:18,400
we might have to put some of them down and examine

516
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,930
their brains to make sure they don't have that wasting disease.

517
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,939
Chronic wasting disease,

518
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,609
chronic wasting disease is a huge problem actually where I live

519
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,400
in

520
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,280
it's becoming really bad. And, yeah, I mean, that's completely fair.

521
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,780
I would not be shocked at all if you can't even transport deer

522
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:37,069
across a border right now. Just because of all the disease.

523
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,150
I imagine it takes a lot of paperwork,

524
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:42,949
uh, maybe. And, but, but the thing is you said you might have to put some of them down.

525
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,670
You could have 30 deer

526
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,390
and you could kill half of them and test them.

527
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,030
And that says nothing about the other half

528
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,569
because that's just how that disease works.

529
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,180
It's spread in bizarre ways.

530
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:52,839
Ok.

531
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,589
So

532
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,599
this is harder than I thought this is really hard.

533
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,280
All right.

534
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,959
So

535
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:03,829
we'll assume he can land. We'll assume you could fill out the right paperwork.

536
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,069
We'll,

537
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,660
we'll say that the customs officials might be willing to turn a blind eye

538
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,449
to the fact that it is Santa Claus and they're familiar with his deer

539
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:13,189
and they aren't going to stay

540
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:13,949
ok.

541
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:19,069
Or I guess if Santa was smart, he would build animatronic reindeer.

542
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,150
We could have the cyber deer. We'll call them

543
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:22,489
-- cyber
-- deer. I can work with that.

544
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:23,400
Yeah,

545
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,349
that way you don't have to worry about getting them into the country.

546
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,459
But even then

547
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,569
you have to think

548
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:32,760
there are countless things you can bring into one country and not another.

549
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,599
Like you said, Canada,

550
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:37,459
obviously you can't have firearms like we have in the United States.

551
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,170
Well, no, you can import firearms and ammunition. It's just you're going to need

552
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:41,709
a paper.

553
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:41,925
So

554
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:48,155
there are firearms you can't own in Canada, I can.

555
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:52,484
-- Oh,
-- well, yeah, there are, well, there's, there's nonrestricted, restricted,

556
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:53,104
prohibited.

557
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:57,165
And then, yeah, then there's a bunch that are just straight up, completely illegal,

558
00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:01,755
right? And, and Europe is another example, there are tons of places in Europe.

559
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:03,814
You can't own handguns,

560
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:04,405
right?

561
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:05,265
And,

562
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:10,915
and you figure so, so Santa is going to have to put some, it's, it's,

563
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,560
I guarantee

564
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,800
you can't plan a delivery route that would drop off certain goods

565
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:20,250
in certain countries because like, obviously you could say, oh, well,

566
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,239
just go to America first and unload the guns.

567
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:26,140
But then you can't have things like your giant bag of dope you're giving to your

568
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,329
friend for Christmas or which in Canada that he even in parts of the US,

569
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:31,189
that's legal, right?

570
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,630
-- Just some places it's
-- not at

571
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,040
the state level.

572
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,875
Well, and as we're calling constantly reminded, in Canada, you know,

573
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:39,295
even if you're flying to a US state where it's legal,

574
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,295
it's not legal at the federal border.

575
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:42,505
And the same thing for Canada, right? Uh,

576
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:45,234
marijuana is legal federally

577
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,055
in Canada.

578
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,295
But you, you, uh for example,

579
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:51,854
as an American driving to Canada still can't bring pot with you.

580
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:56,655
So actually funny you say that is, I was recently in Toronto for a meeting

581
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,430
and the, the Canadian customs people asked me if I had any marijuana,

582
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:03,349
the American Customs people did not.

583
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:06,030
So I was coming from the place where it was

584
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,000
illegal being asked by the people where it's legal if I

585
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,680
have any and then going from the place where it's

586
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:12,810
legal to the place where it's illegal and they're like,

587
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,829
whatever, don't care

588
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,589
anyway, which I did not smuggle dope across the border.

589
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,349
-- That's exactly what a smuggler would say. Or
-- Santa.

590
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:23,040
That's right. That's exactly what a smuggler. Yeah, man. You know,

591
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,640
the

592
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:28,959
potential cost of doing that is sky high. It would be,

593
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:30,469
it would be foolish

594
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:33,180
anyway. Anyway. Ok, because you think about it.

595
00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:35,119
So, uh, kinder eggs are my favorite example.

596
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,650
Kinder eggs are legal in the United States,

597
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,369
which I think is the dumbest law in the world

598
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,640
because kinder eggs are like my favorite thing ever.

599
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:43,939
The, the law is back to 1920 it's, you can't have

600
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:44,209
a

601
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,160
food object covered.

602
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:45,839
Don't care.

603
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:50,020
I want kinder eggs then they should, they should amend the law to say,

604
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,400
except for kinder eggs.

605
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,910
I have some bad news for you. Kinder eggs.

606
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,630
I mean, I've bought them over the last few years and the toys in them are terrible.

607
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:55,920
Now,

608
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,479
they're getting worse. But I don't care because I don't have them.

609
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:02,150
So they're like, they're, they're the, they're the chalice.

610
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,079
I can not quite reach, I want them. Right.

611
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:07,709
And if I had them I'd be like, yeah, they're not that good and I'd probably

612
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:08,420
buy them,

613
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,420
but because I can't have them, I want them more than anything.

614
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,790
That's fair.

615
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:14,310
I know. Hey,

616
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,260
that's like me with certain things that in America you can buy at the

617
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,270
corner store and here are very hard to find or whatever wheat grits.

618
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,329
I cannot buy wheat grits in Canada. Reasonably corn grits. Yeah. Absolutely.

619
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,579
But like, just like a box of an

620
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:29,599
Mima wheat grits.

621
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,140
Seriously,

622
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,270
dude, you can't find him.

623
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,780
And it's so funny once I remember there was a

624
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,770
Toronto Raptor from the US and they were interviewing his mom

625
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,550
about, you know, what do you think about life in Canada because she moved up with him.

626
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:39,989
Right.

627
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,369
Because he's like a young kid or whatever. And she's like, can't find wheat grits.

628
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,719
Like we have to buy them in Detroit and bring them back with us.

629
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,829
And I'm like, are you kidding me? Like,

630
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,540
yeah.

631
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,579
And, and it's not like Canada doesn't, you know,

632
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:54,520
grow and export a ridiculous amount of wheat No, we just don't have wheat grits.

633
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,920
It's the weirdest damn thing ever because I love them.

634
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,449
I'll mail you a box of wheat grits. Like,

635
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,640
yeah, just make sure you declare what they are.

636
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,989
Can't you buy them off Amazon or something?

637
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,160
Well, yeah, but, you know, they won't, uh,

638
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,430
typically they don't ship food stuff to Canada without

639
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,949
it costing a freaking arm and a leg.

640
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:11,979
Oh,

641
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,260
really? Oh. So, like

642
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,010
-- Amazon? Canada doesn't even sell them
-- wheat grits. $15 for a box of, yeah.

643
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,040
-- No, I'm not paying 15 bucks for a box of
-- grits. I bet I can buy that for like a buck.

644
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,329
And then my next choice.

645
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,180
My next choice is Palmetto farms.

646
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:30,020
Yellowstone ground grits, two pounds, non GMO, $67.

647
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,709
Holy crap.

648
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,520
-- So it can be.
-- This is like, this is my future calling.

649
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,079
Kurt is smuggling wheat grits into Canada.

650
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,739
That's already a thing with Trader Joe's.

651
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,719
There's a bunch of Canadians that drive down to the US,

652
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,760
buy a whole pile of stuff at Trader Joe's.

653
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,099
Bring it back up to Canada.

654
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:48,040
You know, they declare it, pay tax on it, whatever and then mail it around because

655
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,160
there's a whole pile of products you just cannot get in Canada. That

656
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,239
nutter butters.

657
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:56,449
I dare you to try and find a nutter butter in Canada.

658
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,609
Seriously. They're not even that good.

659
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,089
No,

660
00:27:59,410 --> 00:27:59,459
I need

661
00:27:59,560 --> 00:27:59,760
to get your

662
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,949
from Nutter Butter fan. All right. Anyway, anyway, we're,

663
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:07,369
this is a hard topic because it's so easy to rat hole here. All right. So,

664
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,410
I guess

665
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:09,989
we're, we're,

666
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,930
we're running ourselves out of time and I don't want to

667
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:16,489
spend two hours talking about the bizarre nature of border control.

668
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,109
But I think fundamentally

669
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,410
so it's safe to say

670
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,829
if, if Santa can get himself legally landed,

671
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,359
he's gonna struggle. There's no way he can get all of his items

672
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:29,069
through a country's

673
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,239
border, border control. And

674
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:35,109
he, he's going to have to stay within certain regions.

675
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,739
Let's say he makes multiple trips back home to refill with, with illicit materials,

676
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,880
given where you're at, you'd have to make multiple trips basically for, well,

677
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,479
I should say multiple trips, but you have to make like one trip per country,

678
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,520
right? Because every country is going to have different enough laws.

679
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,750
Well, but also by state and by, well, once you get into the Schengen Zone, you're OK.

680
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,670
That's true by state

681
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,699
actually by states even crazier because you think

682
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,930
if you are, if Santa Claus, let's say, has to enter the United States

683
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,900
and he's got a huge bag of weed that he's got to deliver,

684
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,719
then you've got, you can't get in obviously with that because no,

685
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:11,609
no customs official is going to let you in.

686
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:15,339
But then even if you were in, there's states like Colorado, for example,

687
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:19,180
which is marijuana is legal, but all the surrounding states are illegal.

688
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:21,829
So there's like there, there's physically no way

689
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,719
that Santa Claus could get to Colorado with his giant bag of Christmas weed

690
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:29,089
and get that delivered without breaking federal law.

691
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:30,579
Well, and state laws

692
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:32,010
-- and
-- state laws. Yes. Exactly.

693
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,239
Yeah.

694
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,569
I'm pretty sure the state trooper is going to want to pull somebody over with,

695
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:36,770
you know, 11,000 pounds of weed or whatever.

696
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,489
-- He's
-- flying. You can't, you can't pull him over. He's flying. It's fine.

697
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:42,209
So, ok, so fundamentally, we've, you know what,

698
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:44,489
I think we've proved that there is no way for

699
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,689
Santa to legally operate within the jurisdiction of a country.

700
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:53,380
He has to be like a rogue smuggler that only operates under the cover of darkness,

701
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,310
which explains everything.

702
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:56,810
Yep. Pretty much.

703
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,130
There we go.

704
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,189
Also by, by GDP,

705
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:08,599
just alone in the US. So the US spending on, on Christmas is just a bit over 700 billion

706
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,890
and that alone would put it at the number

707
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:13,359
18

708
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:17,410
-- for GDP
-- globally. And I, I bet the worldwide

709
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:19,939
-- Christmas spending is probably double. That is my guess.
-- Yeah.

710
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:23,410
And that would put you around number 10 or 11

711
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,609
for GDP.

712
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,650
Like, basically that would put you ahead of Russia.

713
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,900
Yeah, that's,

714
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,589
that's crazy. And he's got that in his sleigh which flies once a year. That's right.

715
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,819
Once a year. That's, wow, that's madness. I didn't realize it was that high now.

716
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:38,119
Although, although at the same time,

717
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,540
Santa isn't delivering all of the presents because

718
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,160
obviously there's certain gift exchanges and whatnot So

719
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:47,329
I bet we could probably assume at least half of that is not Santa gifts,

720
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:50,300
maybe more, maybe less. But I bet half of it.

721
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:53,760
So, yeah, that puts us at what 18 in GDP is what Santa is delivering.

722
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,829
So there we have it. All right. So things we have decided on this podcast,

723
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:00,750
Santa can't possibly enter a country.

724
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,489
It was

725
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,469
Santa is, is clearly a criminal

726
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,530
and that is all right.

727
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,079
Yep.

728
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:12,199
There's literally no legal framework under which there's literally nothing

729
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:15,000
you could do under any framework to pull this off.

730
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:17,170
There's, there's no way he could be compliant.

731
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,670
We should all write

732
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,979
our government representatives and demand

733
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,329
that they, they pass a law legalizing

734
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,869
Santa's Christmas time

735
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,670
illegal border crossing night of Terror.

736
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,510
-- That is what we should do. Like
-- a 24 hour window where he gets off scot free.

737
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:36,910
Right. It could be like that Star Trek episode.

738
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,229
Remember the Arcon where there's like the one, once a year they have their festival

739
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:45,030
and everyone goes crazy for 12 hours.

740
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,689
I forget the name of their festival. It might just be called Festival.

741
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,810
But with Landrieu the computer, which is one of the, and that's some,

742
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:52,069
someday we'll talk about that.

743
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,050
But I love the old star Treks where Captain Kirk outsmarts computers

744
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,930
a lot

745
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,699
just as no one knows.

746
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:58,989
Yes.

747
00:31:59,439 --> 00:31:59,890
That's right.

748
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:05,949
And it always explodes, which is marvelous. I love that. But anyway, anyway. Ok.

749
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,369
All right, man. I,

750
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,420
I don't even know what to say. I feel like this started

751
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,420
-- harder than I expected.
-- I feel bad that we killed Santa.

752
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,660
We didn't kill him.

753
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,479
We just proved he's a criminal,

754
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:21,290
which I think we all suspected deep in our hearts anyway.

755
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:21,989
So

756
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm comfortable with this. Right. Like it's, there's obviously something wrong,

757
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:29,420
at the very least the amount of IP theft going on is astronomical.

758
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:34,300
Not counting the fact that he clearly has slave labor doing all of this work.

759
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,290
And he's,

760
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:39,050
I don't know if his reindeer are trapped or not, but whatever,

761
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,040
-- whatever
-- doesn't matter.

762
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,250
-- Well, they are animals. That's tough. That's being a cart horse.
-- Right.

763
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,209
Well, you didn't, you just say you can't domesticate a reindeer.

764
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:49,140
-- No,
-- I said they're semi domesticated. I don't even know

765
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,020
-- what that
-- means.

766
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,020
So, for example, zebras are so fundamentally ill tempered,

767
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:57,630
even with selective breeding, they cannot be domesticated.

768
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,959
-- They are just such utter and complete nasty animals.
-- Oh, I see. So, like

769
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,089
I,

770
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:05,579
-- a semi domesticated could be like they live in a fenced area.
-- Yeah.

771
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:07,319
And you can get them to, like, pull a cart.

772
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:10,329
But, you know, I feel like it's not like a horse where you can have, you know, uh,

773
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:13,260
we went to the, the, what is it, the nights table thing in Vegas.

774
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,030
And I mean, they had a couple of horses there that,

775
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:18,469
wow, like the tricks those horses were doing, you know, they made dressage

776
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:19,800
horses look like drunks

777
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:21,790
-- and
-- I don't know a lot about horses, but I know, like,

778
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,439
when you get them to walk sideways and stuff like that, that's a big deal.

779
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:24,479
But

780
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,339
when you get them to prance sideways

781
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,719
in time to the music.

782
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,390
Yeah. Right. Right. Well, it probably just looked like it.

783
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,020
Maybe they adjust the music to match the horse. I don't know. Anyway. Anyway.

784
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,979
All right, I'm gonna,

785
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:40,979
we have to end this because we're terrible people. And

786
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:45,739
-- that's the moral of the story we fit in well, in the security industry
-- and Children.

787
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,130
We didn't actually Santa's real. This is all just been a terrible dream.

788
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,010
-- Go back to sleep. We,
-- we've said nothing that

789
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,175
would ruin

790
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:54,875
the Christmas Magic Cart.

791
00:33:55,104 --> 00:33:57,454
I'm, I'm comfortable with this episode.

792
00:33:57,464 --> 00:34:01,655
This, this does not need a spoiler tag at the beginning for small Children.

793
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,494
Anyway.

794
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:06,625
Yes, kids. But go ask your parents where babies come from. So,

795
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:07,415
thank you.

796
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:12,679
I did not, I do not endorse this man's views.

797
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,319
I'm comfortable with this.

798
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:16,069
All right, cool.

799
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,708
Thank you, Kurt. Thank you ever for listening. You can go to open

800
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:22,697
source security podcast.com. I don't even think we have shown nuts for this.

801
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:26,878
We'll figure something out. You can use the Found Os S podcast hashtag

802
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:31,079
to hit us up on social media. You are welcome to let us know we are terrible people.

803
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:32,819
We are well aware of this.

804
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:36,998
So I guess Kurt have a fantastic rest of your day.

805
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,878
You too, everybody. I'm sorry.

806
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,188
Thanks, everyone. Have a great Christmas. Bye bye.
