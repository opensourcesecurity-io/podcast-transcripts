Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:12,699
Kurt Siefried and my partner in not writing legislation.

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,239
-- Josh Pressers,
-- were those pauses on purpose or they just weird

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,049
slammed into a brick wall and I was like,

4
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:23,190
what is this called again? I'm like, I should know this, but

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,440
-- apparently I don't.
-- It's fine.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,250
Yes,

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,940
we're going to talk about the exciting topic of legislation

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,009
today which I'm sure all of us are riveted for

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,110
and more specifically the E ID

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,250
A

11
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:34,889
S

12
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:38,029
and E ID, which are separate things.

13
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:43,720
So E ID A S is like the UK thing. E ID is the European Union thing,

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,680
but they're basically the same thing. The idea is

15
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:46,409
no, the,

16
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:52,840
the Mozilla website says the recent changes to E U's new E ID A

17
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:55,709
S regulation will dramatically expand the capability

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,240
of eu governments to surveil the citizens.

19
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:02,970
So basically E ID is the digital ID, the thing and the EIE

20
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,760
ID A s are the services.

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,470
-- OK. Right.
-- So a perfect example here in Alberta

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,510
and in Canada,

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,830
um in Alberta, we have a uh my digital ID that we can use with the government,

24
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:20,970
for example, to renew our drivers or to update our driver's license information.

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,230
Uh renewal is done through a registry of which is a private company typically.

26
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,019
Um But more importantly, for example,

27
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:27,779
my health link I can access through that so I can

28
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,000
see all my test results and like my prescriptions and everything.

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,730
It's quite lovely.

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,940
And so for example,

31
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:36,889
because it's the provincial government providing this and doing this,

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,440
they piggyback off of either your driver's license,

33
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,800
Alberta identity card or passport.

34
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:45,339
And then they send you a pin code in the mail

35
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,779
to make sure you actually live there and you know,

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,099
boom, you got your digital ID.

37
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,839
Interesting.

38
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:52,040
And so for example, at the federal level, when I interact with revenue, Canada,

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,080
they use the banks.

40
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,800
So for example, when you go to revenue Canada to log in,

41
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,150
you get a choice of a of a essentially a trusted authentication partner.

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,830
And it's like all the banks, there's like 20 banks

43
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,319
with the assumption that if they go to TD and are

44
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,419
like this person claims to be curtsey free date of birth X

45
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:10,679
is this

46
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,830
and I logged into my TD bank account and say, you know,

47
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:17,729
approve the authentication request that the bank has done their uh KYC,

48
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,089
they know your customer regulations.

49
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,910
And so TD is essentially a trust ID entity because they're a regulated bank

50
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,100
and they can say that yes, this is indeed curtsey free date of birth

51
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,229
after that very long explanation.

52
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,750
-- What are we talking about?
-- So, the idea is this all sucks.

53
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,149
This is terrible because what you really want is something like Estonia

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,009
where you have a card with a smart chip and that's you.

55
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,630
And here's the clever thing Estonia did. That is so beyond brilliant.

56
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,869
When they originally set all this up, they made a rule.

57
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,009
The government can only ask you for

58
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,320
that piece of identification or information once

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,449
and once they've asked you another department that wants it can't.

60
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,850
So they have to share and it forced all their

61
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,440
systems to be compatible and to share and to interoperate

62
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:02,970
with.

63
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,279
Because how many times have you gone to a government

64
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:08,029
office and had to refill all your information every time?

65
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,309
All right. So what is Europe doing?

66
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,589
I'm not super, I only know about the Mozilla website that I'll put in the show notes.

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,190
But so the problem is E ID

68
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,800
as an idea I think is good. The problem is

69
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:24,270
they slipped something into the legislation

70
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:30,350
that is worrying to say the least. And that worrying piece is, is that they can force

71
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,559
vendors like browser vendors

72
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,309
to install a root certificate, whether they like it or not.

73
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,809
Now, ostensibly this is so that for example, they can have, well,

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,179
if you look at the root certificate list that is widely accepted, you know,

75
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,750
the one that's

76
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,389
all over the place. Let's start at the beginning.

77
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,070
So Europe wants to create one electronic ID for the entirety of the EU.

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,350
Is that an accurate statement?

79
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,600
That is part of what they want?

80
00:03:59,059 --> 00:03:59,520
That's,

81
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,610
that's the tip of the

82
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,050
iceberg.

83
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,630
But now the reason we're talking about this is

84
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,399
there is a website that I read from Mozilla

85
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,770
talking about

86
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,490
the, this

87
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,360
A,

88
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,520
I don't know how to pronounce it. E ID A S

89
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,029
law

90
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,048
that no one has seen yet

91
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,149
because it's not written

92
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:18,070
well. OK.

93
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,290
But we know it's going to include some sort of language talking about

94
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,339
a magic route C A

95
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,290
that would let the European Union

96
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:32,070
Regulators basically de decrypt any browser traffic

97
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:36,399
-- they want. Is that all accurate so far?
-- No

98
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,640
ish sort of kind of, it's, it's one of those,

99
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:40,779
technically, it's potentially true, but

100
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,239
-- it's very complicated which is show content where they
-- can't decrypt it,

101
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,309
they have to man in the middle of it.

102
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
Right. Yes, exactly.

103
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,670
Ok. Ok. Well, basically

104
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:54,940
they would be able to force root certificates into the browsers and devices

105
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,660
normally the way it works is you have to ask nicely

106
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,010
and it

107
00:04:59,149 --> 00:04:59,220
takes

108
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,690
what is a root certificate?

109
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,510
Why do we care about this?

110
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,190
So the way web browsers work is we have public key encryption.

111
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,720
Cool.

112
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,589
-- Right.
-- How do I know this thing from walmart.com is, in fact

113
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,450
walmart.com and not a man in the middle presenting a certificate they signed.

114
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,510
Does walmart.com?

115
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:20,450
Well, we have a trusted third party sign it

116
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,750
and that trusted third party has a certificate that they,

117
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,700
you basically, I'm going to grossly simplify,

118
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,940
but the trusted third party has a certificate

119
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,859
that is the public key is registered with your browser.

120
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:34,859
You know, in trust Faris, sign all the usual suspects

121
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,329
and then they use their private key

122
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,750
to sign certificates. Like let's encrypt us. Right. Let's encrypt. That's

123
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,019
right.

124
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,140
It's not a root C A and this is where things are complicated. Like let's encrypt is a,

125
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:47,600
not a root certificate authority.

126
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:49,779
They're, you know, hanging off of a root authority,

127
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,859
but they're allowed to assign their own certificates.

128
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:52,459
So

129
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,940
there are a number of governments like uh I know Taiwan, I forget the rest.

130
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,350
I think Denmark

131
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,980
have government root certificate, authorities

132
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,269
that have a root certificate

133
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,859
widely accepted in, you know, Safari, Firefox edge brave

134
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,829
all domains or only certain domains.

135
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,829
OK.

136
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,869
So you're asking so in theory,

137
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,980
a certificate can have what are called restrictions placed on it.

138
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:20,019
And quite commonly,

139
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:23,380
the restrictions that are placed on it are like this can only sign web certificates,

140
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:28,619
this can sign email certificates, this can only sign code, signing certificates.

141
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,579
And there is the potential for restrictions based on domain

142
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,309
and I think there's one or two that use it. Oh, so not very many. OK.

143
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,140
-- Well, by not very many, I mean, there's, I think one or two
-- and how many certificates,

144
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:44,059
how many root certificates are in

145
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,880
-- a typical browser trust store?
-- About 100 and 40 to 100 and 50.

146
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,040
That seems like a lot.

147
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,720
No, it's actually not a lot because the thing is there are an unknown number of

148
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,170
entities like lets and

149
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:57,890
crypt

150
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,010
that are able to sign certificates. See, normally if I go to

151
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,350
Verisign and I say I want you to sign

152
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,029
cre.org,

153
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:08,290
they sign the certificate for seared.org and that certificate is limited to just

154
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,100
being

155
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,359
creed.org http S basically,

156
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:13,920
or I can use it on my email server for,

157
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:14,410
uh,

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,290
MTPTLS or whatever.

159
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,170
And I cannot use that certificate to further sign other certificates because

160
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,049
those

161
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,559
clients would look at it and be like, you're not allowed to do that.

162
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,679
I'm going to ignore this. Right. That's right.

163
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:32,000
And, but there are, I, I, I've heard numbers somewhere between maybe six and 8000

164
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,839
certificates floating around that can be used to sign more certificates

165
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:38,420
and some of them like l

166
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,480
encrypt are well known and very well behaved and are, like,

167
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,890
straight up if all the certificate, authorities could behave like LS and Crypt,

168
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,250
uh, we'd be much better off

169
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:50,529
well. And this is like when you use Amazon web services,

170
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,690
they can host TLS traffic for you.

171
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,010
They have this ability.

172
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,929
Yeah, they sign, yeah, exactly.

173
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,760
Yeah, they can,

174
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:57,880
yeah, they,

175
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,929
they can sign, uh, same with cloud flare. Cloud flare.

176
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,160
They

177
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:01,350
don't,

178
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:06,079
they don't have like cloud flare and Amazon don't have root certificates. Right.

179
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,350
-- I don't think so. They're, they're
-- ok.

180
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:11,040
Let's pretend they don't, for the sake of this conversation.

181
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:13,200
I think they're intermediate certificates.

182
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:16,359
Now, then there's a concept called the root of trust

183
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,239
where I say I have Kurt's certificate

184
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,779
that's signed by

185
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,790
Verisign certificate and that's signed by this other

186
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,910
certificate and that's in the root C A.

187
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:26,510
Yeah.

188
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,329
Or in this case, far

189
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,320
sign is the root

190
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,769
-- is one of the old granddaddy root. The
-- idea though.

191
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,340
And so that's the chain of trust.

192
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,510
So, having,

193
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,349
see the problem though is, is to get a root certificate in, takes like two years.

194
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,140
So that's,

195
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,070
and, and you're not guaranteed to, I mean,

196
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,299
-- you're pretty much
-- unless you pass a law that tells the browser manufacturers,

197
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,460
you have to include their certificate

198
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,880
and to be clear,

199
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,229
the number of people that fail to get

200
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,950
their root certificate in is quite minuscule and

201
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,809
they have to be grossly inadequately insecure like

202
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,739
two of the ones that got booted were

203
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,340
-- you've pointed this out in the past and it's hilarious
-- and like,

204
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:06,049
like this one was using a,

205
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,760
they were doing DNS lookups using a who is service that has on their front page.

206
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,919
Do not use this for anything that matters for security.

207
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,760
They were using a third party,

208
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:21,000
right? Or another one was signing certificates for

209
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:25,210
like you're only supposed to sign web certificates for host names

210
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,919
like cer.org or brester.net or whatever

211
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,330
breast.net. Sorry.

212
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,270
And they had signed certificates for IP addresses, which is very much a no, no.

213
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,969
And they have signed certificates for like, like words.

214
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,200
Awesome. Like, just a word.

215
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:41,919
Yeah.

216
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,669
Yeah. If you go check this, we can link to the cert.

217
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,609
I, I honestly, I was involved in the cert DB stuff on the mailing list and stuff again.

218
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:52,799
I was involved, like, 1015 years ago and I tried getting involved again a year ago

219
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:54,280
and I gave up again

220
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,000
because it's just so fundamentally broken.

221
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:58,479
I cannot

222
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,520
fix it or change it or have any.

223
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:00,760
And,

224
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,599
and the best part is like when uh there

225
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:06,429
was another researcher from an academic institution that like essentially

226
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:09,960
God to c A booted out because they were so insecure and bad.

227
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:13,039
And people are like, why did you do that? Why are you so mean to that company?

228
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:13,630
And it's like

229
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:18,349
we're not the bad guys here, like they're the bad guys anyways,

230
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,530
let's talk about what a

231
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,780
European Union

232
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,809
root certificate

233
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:29,059
kind of means for security and privacy of everybody.

234
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,039
-- Not just European citizens,
-- it means they can do whatever they want.

235
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:34,130
That's not.

236
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:38,500
-- Well, and this is where things get. So here's let me qualify
-- that.

237
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,539
-- OK. All
-- right.

238
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:43,140
So here's the thing we've already encountered this problem, right?

239
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,789
Remember we did that show with uh I want to say it was Kazakhstan,

240
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,169
the

241
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:46,619
man in the middle.

242
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:47,789
Yeah.

243
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:48,570
So

244
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,330
funnily enough.

245
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,179
There are a lot of nation states that have been trying to do this.

246
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,200
Well, not trying have been doing this for 1015 years.

247
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,719
And so there's a bunch of technologies to help prevent this. So,

248
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,349
so there are protections I can do, for example, I run s.org

249
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:09,200
and even if you as a client have a malicious certificate from, well Kazakhstan,

250
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,890
let's pick on them

251
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:14,119
I can use, for example, something called like essentially C A pinning where I say

252
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,510
the seared.org certificate should only ever be signed by these root certificates.

253
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,400
And I want to say it's like Komodo and something else,

254
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:24,289
it's whatever cloud flare uses because I use cloud flare.

255
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:26,080
And so even if Kazakhstan,

256
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,909
you know, does a man in the middle

257
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,400
signs a fake certificate for

258
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,460
cre.org

259
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,849
in theory, the browser should be like, hey, whoa time out

260
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,119
like the c.org,

261
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,250
it's signed by

262
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,119
Kazakhstan.

263
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,289
Not,

264
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:37,929
you know, Komodo,

265
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:40,530
that's bad. I'm not gonna let you go there.

266
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,849
-- And
-- I know like I think I believe Google does this as well and

267
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:43,919
a

268
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,239
lot of vs

269
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,010
do big companies.

270
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,489
Yeah,

271
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,919
it's not, I remember looking into it.

272
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,830
Uh and not a lot of people do it, but it's,

273
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,940
it's becoming more and more common because it's kind of,

274
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,650
it's like kind of like DNS se where

275
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,820
in cloud floor, at least it's like a button you push and it just works.

276
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,429
Right.

277
00:11:59,599 --> 00:11:59,869
Right.

278
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,020
But it has to be that button that works, it doesn't

279
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,169
break.

280
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,830
So what this means

281
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:07,070
for

282
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,750
people on the internet is if the eu and my understanding is

283
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,950
this is like the typical we need to protect you from yourself,

284
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,979
sort of nonsense.

285
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:19,729
Right. No, no, no, this is legitimately. We need digital ID and I support digital.

286
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,460
How does digital ID have anything to do with

287
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:25,409
-- installing a root certificate in the browser
-- store?

288
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,109
How do you validate the digital I DS

289
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,429
in a web browser? How do you use them?

290
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:31,049
What

291
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,099
you don't need a certificate in the, in the root trust store to validate a digital ID.

292
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,419
Well, not

293
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:43,390
if I want to validate your digital ID. I need some way to get to the root

294
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:45,590
that signed your digital id.

295
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:46,700
And

296
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,549
the problem is I can always manually install that certificate,

297
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,650
but the government doesn't want to deal with that.

298
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,150
So they're like, we just want it jammed in there.

299
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,590
And that's,

300
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,710
that's literally why a lot of these

301
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,320
root certificate authorities that are not commercial.

302
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,869
So let, let's broadly break this up.

303
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,409
There are two kinds of certificate authorities at the root level.

304
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,520
There's commercial ones who want to sell certificates like

305
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:06,739
Verisign and Komodo.

306
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,869
And I'm also going to lump the service providers

307
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,900
in there like Amazon and cloud flare where they like

308
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:14,039
want to sign certificates, you know, for money purposes.

309
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:15,340
-- Ok. Hold on.
-- And then

310
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,690
there's the

311
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,179
government

312
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,320
stop, stop, stop.

313
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,020
-- And
-- see that's part of the problem is they technically don't need to do this.

314
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,200
Hold on.

315
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,559
If they put a certificate in the root store of my web browser,

316
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,919
all TLS traffic could be essentially the chain of trust could end up there.

317
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,789
So someone could man in the middle of me, right? With this root store

318
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,820
as opposed to, can't they restrict a certificate for only

319
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,020
signing data, for example,

320
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,469
although I guess this is signing data when you're doing that.

321
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:44,510
Oh

322
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,030
-- I hate all this stuff.
-- See, it gets complicated. This

323
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,989
is so stupid.

324
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,539
So the problem is fundamentally

325
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,900
the reason they want this is it will make their life slightly easier

326
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:00,000
and it will make the rest of our lives vastly probably, maybe not worse.

327
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,780
-- But maybe
-- my understanding from reading,

328
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:05,460
this is this was partially about being able to decrypt web traffic,

329
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,239
not solely about having the ability.

330
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,085
Well, there is a little, a bit of that. Yeah, there's a little bit of that

331
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,984
and, and look, 00 my goodness, this is so stupid.

332
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:16,664
This is even dumber than I thought it was.

333
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:17,054
Well,

334
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,825
it's the thing is if you have a nice piece of

335
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:21,594
legislation going forward that talks about digital identity and certificates,

336
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:25,015
why not slip in that little extra bit, you know, for law enforcement to kind of

337
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,424
have a look with the person

338
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:27,505
idiotic.

339
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,640
Ok.

340
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,030
So here's the problem for anyone who's made

341
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,859
it this far over this nonsensical journey of stupidity

342
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:35,780
is

343
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,020
if an entity

344
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,630
that will say has nefarious intent,

345
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,239
has access to a root certificate or that

346
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,400
-- certificate gets stolen because that does happen
-- and,

347
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:46,760
and well,

348
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,859
that will happen that 100% will happen in

349
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:51,140
this instance because the government is just there,

350
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,260
we've talked about this at length about like backing encryption technology,

351
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:55,760
it

352
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,640
is going to get lost or stolen or some other dumb thing is going to happen

353
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,960
where the key in question is going to make it

354
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,229
into the hands of someone who shouldn't have it 100%.

355
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,349
Especially because the traditional process is you have

356
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,640
to jump through a whole bunch of hoops,

357
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,349
get a security audit, blah, blah, blah.

358
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,630
And, and speaking of that, that's all garbage because for example,

359
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,059
there was one auditor who appears to be an

360
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,679
accountant who doesn't have any technical knowledge who signed

361
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,270
off on a whole bunch of these that were then later found to be run so badly,

362
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,390
they had to be booted out.

363
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,773
But for example, if you look at

364
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,172
finding out who audited these people and approve them,

365
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,953
number one is difficult and number two,

366
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:32,843
there's no way to verify the auditor even in Canada,

367
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,263
they had a registry of the auditors,

368
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:37,213
but then they kind of took it offline and hit it after an incident.

369
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:40,163
Of course they did. So that's the thing is like it

370
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,403
means any government of the, what is it?

371
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:45,763
I want to say, 29 countries, 27 countries, I always forget how many are in the United.

372
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:51,793
But any of them can use this. If this law passes as it is suggested, it will and it

373
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:52,606
formatted

374
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:53,606
they, you know,

375
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:56,406
some brand like Denmark or France or Germany

376
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,885
could be like here's a root certificate,

377
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:58,085
OK?

378
00:15:58,096 --> 00:15:59,526
Browsers put this in or else

379
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:01,406
and there's no audit controls.

380
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,286
-- There's like we don't know if that certificate is protected. I
-- mean,

381
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,546
OK, but we're still not

382
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,005
talking about

383
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:09,765
the importance of this.

384
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:14,666
If this happens, let's say you've got a certificate put into the trust store

385
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:16,226
and the key leaks.

386
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,926
And now you have a nefarious individual with the certificate,

387
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:24,140
it gives them the ability to man in the middle web traffic

388
00:16:24,469 --> 00:16:24,979
in a

389
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,659
mostly transparent way.

390
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:28,900
I know there's things like certificate pinning and all that kind of stuff,

391
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:30,000
which is important.

392
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:31,890
But this is,

393
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,109
this is just beyond dumb because it's the same thing as backdoor

394
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,369
like all of the encrypted chat programs which we, I know we did that show about it,

395
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,729
you cannot

396
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,900
backdoor and this is functionally a backdoor into the web browser.

397
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:49,799
You cannot backdoor technology

398
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,049
in a way that doesn't just make it insecure for literally everyone

399
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:57,090
or a new government comes along in four years and decides

400
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,809
that we really need to make sure everybody's not buying cigarettes online

401
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,450
or whatever governments change.

402
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,410
And so yeah, I mean, the problem is this is

403
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,118
a grossly

404
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,810
negative externality and the government's like, yeah, it's,

405
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,608
but it's not our negative externality.

406
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:15,489
Well, and so that's, this is what I've been thinking about

407
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,368
for the last couple of hours

408
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,199
is

409
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,209
this is completely

410
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,689
somebody else's problem.

411
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,890
Right. If I am a government and I,

412
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,410
first of all get to tell the web browsers you have to do this. That's not my problem.

413
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,579
Then

414
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,780
if a user gets popped because of my key leaked,

415
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,010
well, that's not my problem because it's the user's problem. And like

416
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:44,510
this is just uh uh this is like a giant freaking circus of not my problem.

417
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:47,280
Do me a quick favor. I've got an iphone, sadly,

418
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,880
go into certificates and remove one

419
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,060
fun fact.

420
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,380
Fun fact. No, no, it's better.

421
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,000
So in most web browsers like Firefox, Microsoft and Explorer,

422
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,859
you can go on market certificate is untrusted.

423
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,219
You can go manually essentially remove trust from it.

424
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,439
And if you do this for like 80% of the certificates in there,

425
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:07,369
you will not notice because like, I'm pretty sure here's a fun fact.

426
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,939
There's like over half a dozen

427
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,359
Turkish certificate authorities. That seems good. And I'm like,

428
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,589
I'm pretty sure if I disable them all, I will not notice.

429
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,050
-- And the answer is, yeah, I did not notice.
-- That would be interesting.

430
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,660
I should see if I can track the certificates. Like I actually hit,

431
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,349
ok, we can talk about that.

432
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,869
Uh The guy, the, the academic researcher out of Calgary has done that and

433
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:29,469
you can sort of track um activity in your cert database.

434
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:32,959
There's some ways to do it in Linux, for example, with um pie notifying anyway,

435
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,170
I've actually gone through this with somebody. So yes.

436
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:38,619
But long story short in newer versions of I OS, you can't,

437
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:41,829
the Trust store is the trust store and you cannot edit it.

438
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,540
I mean,

439
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,790
what are the legitimate reasons people have to edit the trust star

440
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:49,130
-- because I don't trust all these weird certificate authorities
-- in to.

441
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,000
But I'm saying like

442
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,430
-- the vast majority of people
-- but why take that away from me

443
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:58,609
because it's Apple Cart, you're holding it wrong, you do it their way.

444
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:04,579
-- Or else like it's not a debate
-- and there's also no easy, good way to kind of like

445
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:07,229
you can sort of do this on windows through group policy

446
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:11,050
objects and you can do certificates at the Os level,

447
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,560
but like Firefox and safari kind of do their own thing.

448
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,329
And so it gets

449
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,079
the long and the short of it is

450
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:20,390
saying to people remove the certificates you don't trust or blah, blah, blah,

451
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,150
that's not a solution anymore.

452
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,479
It's just not

453
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,479
that ship sailed and sunk.

454
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,359
So

455
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,180
the reality is this makes the government's life

456
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:31,510
a little bit easier for handling digital identity

457
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:33,869
and it makes it a lot easier if they want to do,

458
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,270
like I'm gonna say lawful intercept as the phrase uh that has been used for 20 years,

459
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,739
you know,

460
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,130
and, and,

461
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,150
and like, how is this?

462
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,250
Why wouldn't they,

463
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,989
if you're a government, why wouldn't you do this

464
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,069
-- because
-- you're going to make the world worse?

465
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,609
-- So again, why is the government would I not do this? But
-- no, no, no.

466
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:58,589
This is the difficulty of security and public policy is

467
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,729
the nuance behind it.

468
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:03,589
I'm sure we got loads wrong and by all means like

469
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,530
at Kurt on Mastodon and tell them all about it,

470
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,729
but like, I'm sure we got loads wrong

471
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,589
and

472
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,579
we're definitely more technical than probably most lawmakers.

473
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,900
I'm co I'm comfortable saying I am more technical than 99% of lawmakers.

474
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,579
-- It's probably higher than that. But trick
-- question, who

475
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,500
is the most important person in the certificate world?

476
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,540
-- There's a very simple answer.
-- Is there a person

477
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,130
-- Kathleen
-- Wilson who

478
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,180
-- is? I don't even know who that is.
-- Exactly.

479
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,760
She is the person at Mozilla that runs the root C A program

480
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:41,060
and Mozilla's Root C A program is essentially what everybody else piggybacks off of

481
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:46,130
and uses. I mean, it's technically now its own separate entity or TV, for

482
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,640
thing, but fundamentally

483
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:52,709
like she is the load bearing support beam in that XK CD Comic.

484
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,670
Um

485
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,939
And like straight up like she's been the person doing it for like going on 20 years.

486
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:00,069
But

487
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:00,650
I,

488
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,699
that's nuts.

489
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:03,640
Who's gonna do it?

490
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,109
And she's done a good

491
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:05,380
job

492
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,609
and to be

493
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:07,500
with

494
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:07,699
us,

495
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:09,910
she's done a good job. But it's, it's

496
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,599
what's wild to me is like, this seems like something that, you know,

497
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:16,560
a government should maybe spend a million bucks a year on funding.

498
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:19,790
-- But
-- look at how much, how much infrastructure

499
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:20,810
you look at,

500
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:25,280
you've got like open source runs the world. No one's funding that

501
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:29,556
you've got Mozilla, he handles the root C A is the time zone guy.

502
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,936
Like, there's so much stuff that's like

503
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:36,156
that, that I, so I, I took the, I, I'll, I'll put a link, I'll just put a link,

504
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,656
I'll maybe put it on as something.

505
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,235
But

506
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:38,745
I

507
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,235
think I gave a presentation

508
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,806
about like the state of open source to uh

509
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,576
I, I forget who it even was now.

510
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:51,432
But anyway, I took the XKC comic and I was like, you've all seen this comic, I fixed it

511
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:54,771
and I changed it from like the one thing on the side to just

512
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:59,452
one long line of like single package maintainers because that's really what it is.

513
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:01,312
Like all of this stuff is

514
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:02,352
there,

515
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,901
there's so many things that if the right person got

516
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:08,342
hit by a bus society would collapse and that's horrifying,

517
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:09,621
it wouldn't collapse.

518
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:10,871
But it would be one of those things where it was.

519
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,871
Here's the thing, let's say,

520
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,832
certificate proms happen and everybody wastes, oh,

521
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,739
-- 60 seconds a day.
-- Ok. Anyway. All right. I wanna, I wanna pull us back to the,

522
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,569
the point I was trying to make about policymakers in all this, right?

523
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:29,979
The policymakers behind this don't understand what they're doing.

524
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:33,920
-- That's just the reality of it.
-- Well, they have a view of the world that

525
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,319
-- may or may not be correct.
-- It doesn't matter.

526
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,699
They need someone to explain to them what's going on

527
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:42,479
and you can't explain this to normal people.

528
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:45,079
You just can't, we, I don't think we're getting most of it right.

529
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:47,160
And we're definitely not normal people.

530
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,150
And so the challenge becomes,

531
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,599
how do you possibly see something at this technical detail end up in law, in the law,

532
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,520
not be utterly trash.

533
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,680
And I have a suspicion. You can't.

534
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,719
So it's funny, I was just reading.

535
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:06,699
Um, so number one is there's prescriptive versus outcome based legislation.

536
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:08,989
So prescriptive legislation would be you

537
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,310
have to transport tomatoes at this temperature

538
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,869
to make sure they don't go bad.

539
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,719
Whereas outcome based would be like you need to

540
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:17,040
transport tomatoes appropriately so they don't go bad.

541
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,900
How do you do that is left up to you?

542
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,140
And so for example, here, this is very

543
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,699
prescriptive in the,

544
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:25,530
the brown

545
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,239
have to allow a root certificate like that's,

546
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:32,500
that's pretty invasive. Like prescriptive tends to be invasive. It, it's a,

547
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:37,209
it's, you have to do something like the law says I have to stop at red lights.

548
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,250
That is very prescriptive as it should be.

549
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,500
And in this case, they could have gone with outcome based.

550
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,569
But like, again, that negative externality, it's not my problem.

551
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:49,329
Plus there's the side effect of like, hey, these law enforcement people are like,

552
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,969
really happy with it now

553
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,969
and my national spy agency is like saying, you know, good job

554
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,969
and OK, cool.

555
00:23:57,189 --> 00:23:58,550
And the reality is

556
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,979
the number of men in the middle attacks that are

557
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:04,469
going to be launched by governments against people is,

558
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:05,699
uh,

559
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,319
with most Western European governments probably not going to be that high.

560
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:12,229
Now, I say that and there's countries like Hungary where, you know,

561
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,790
if you read about what's going on there, it's been a bit ugly.

562
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,670
-- I mean.
-- Right. That's different though.

563
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,109
Well, but that's part of the problem is the government we have today

564
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,270
in four years might not be as

565
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:25,910
compassionate or forgiving about people who drive slowly

566
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:33,119
-- and maybe, you know, who knows
-- that is a dangerous path to take. You have to assume.

567
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,359
But the problem is now they have this capability is this capability can be abused,

568
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:38,520
will it be abused?

569
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:43,079
It will be abused not, can be. The reality is any time

570
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,369
a government entity has the ability to overreach they overreach

571
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:50,680
and even when they don't have the ability to overreach,

572
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:51,430
they overreach.

573
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:54,420
I mean, this is the perpetual checks and balances in democracy.

574
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,040
Well, I mean,

575
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,060
the challenge is government is people and some of them are nice

576
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:02,219
and some of them are jerks is this capability worth having.

577
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:04,699
So for example, I would say having a capability like the police

578
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,260
that can

579
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,849
to abuse is worth having because I've seen what happens

580
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:10,439
to countries where they don't have police and it's pretty ugly

581
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:13,140
now is having this capability a net benefit.

582
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,130
A net win, is it or does it fulfill some thing that solves an existential threat.

583
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,229
I don't think so.

584
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:21,780
I mean, and that's the thing, like, what is the benefit?

585
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,069
What is the po like if we don't do this,

586
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,030
what bad thing happens or what good thing do we miss out on?

587
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,839
And the answer is like, yeah, you can still do digital ID.

588
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,000
It'll be a little bit more awkward for the governments to implement.

589
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,160
They'll have to get buy in from the browsers like everybody else.

590
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,050
And they've already been like, like I said, Taiwan Denmark,

591
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:38,930
there's a bunch of

592
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,140
countries in there and post offices in there

593
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,719
for this exact reason for doing digital identity.

594
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,280
So it's

595
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,040
there, it's not like this can't be done the proper way.

596
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,780
They just want to short circuit it.

597
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:49,719
And

598
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,680
oops, we also got the capability for a national spy agency to spy on people.

599
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,349
Well, and there's,

600
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,140
I mean, how are they going to protect the keys?

601
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,170
-- How are they going to the way everybody
-- else

602
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,209
does you have hardware security modules and oversight,

603
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:02,670
blah, blah, blah.

604
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,380
They,

605
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:06,079
it's easy to say that but will they, I mean,

606
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:08,599
look, this is one of those instances where

607
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,060
if you just say, oh you need a private key, it's like, oh yeah, hey,

608
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:13,250
intern we need a private key.

609
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,839
Go make one.

610
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,135
It's like, oh dude on my Windows laptop while I run Steam play these G

611
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:18,744
like

612
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:22,655
you look at the DNS sec key signing and key generation ceremonies, right?

613
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,094
Where they went through all the theater,

614
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,814
you know, and I remember I loved watching that theater because they're like, oh,

615
00:26:26,824 --> 00:26:29,525
the, the surface of the, uh the safe is shining.

616
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:32,425
You could potentially see him putting in the code and so on and so forth.

617
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:35,854
-- And it's like this is security theater. It's fun to watch.
-- It's

618
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:37,035
not fun to,

619
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:39,155
it's fun to watch. It's stupidity.

620
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:40,324
Like, uh

621
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:41,525
anyway.

622
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:46,680
-- All right,
-- What I really love is how do we deal with major key compromises?

623
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,609
And the answer is

624
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,640
we ship a browser update basically

625
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:51,310
like

626
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:51,770
key

627
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,040
-- revocation. No, we ship a browser update,
-- isn't there?

628
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,239
What is the, there's a key revocation protocol, isn't there built into the browser?

629
00:26:59,250 --> 00:26:59,900
I forget the name.

630
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,839
The old one was CRL certificate, revocation list.

631
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,400
-- It's
-- just a static list,

632
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,719
OS CP,

633
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:08,030
online certificate, something protocol,

634
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:09,400
security protocol.

635
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,869
The problem with OS CP is, is that you, you did this, remember you and I

636
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,130
know

637
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,790
everything

638
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,099
because like half the like

639
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,900
Os C

640
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:24,020
OS CP responders couldn't maintain like 90% of the time, let alone 99.999 now.

641
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,439
And I remember, I think cloud

642
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:27,680
was doing some work here where they were going to host it and they're like,

643
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:28,260
we're cloud flare.

644
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,520
We can probably do a better job than all of you,

645
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,130
right?

646
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,150
But

647
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,609
then there's the privacy issue of whoever runs the OS C OS

648
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:40,920
CP or OC, whatever, whatever runs that knows. All the post names you're going to.

649
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:41,640
That's

650
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:42,670
all

651
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,589
I want to bring this

652
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:43,750
one

653
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:44,150
thing.

654
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,310
I don't,

655
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:49,479
I, I'm more confused now than when we started. I,

656
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,400
I would say

657
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,040
root certificates

658
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,989
that are trusted by

659
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:58,630
widely used browsers should be rare

660
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:04,270
and they should be so secure and wonderful and well run that.

661
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,680
Like there's never the chance of them being booted out

662
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:09,140
of the program because they're so bad and that happens

663
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:15,989
so clearly, this is not great, but like most things in security, it kind of works.

664
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,709
We're ok.

665
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:17,400
It does.

666
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,630
-- It mostly works. I mean,
-- you know, but my fridge is running

667
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:20,739
the

668
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:21,199
problem.

669
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:24,930
I see is if the eu does this in law and they get away with it,

670
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:26,449
everyone's going to freaking do this.

671
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:27,140
You know, that

672
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,410
every country will just pass a law that like, oh,

673
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,930
you have to also include our certificate because we passed the law.

674
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,310
Here's the only actionable thing I can take away from this. There is a website

675
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:39,550
from Mozilla

676
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:42,829
that I will put a link in the show notes too

677
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,400
and like go read it

678
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,109
and there's really, it sounds like there's not a lot we can do.

679
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:48,920
If you live in Europe,

680
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,739
you might be able to call your lawmakers and complain about this at least.

681
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,109
-- But even I, I don't
-- know, also a link to the eff they have an article on

682
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:55,199
it.

683
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,119
Of course

684
00:28:57,209 --> 00:28:57,739
it's uh

685
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:57,930
oh

686
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,439
my goodness.

687
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:05,790
-- Like the stupid, it burns. That's all I can say.
-- Well, you know, I,

688
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:08,920
the thing is this is this like this,

689
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,439
this is how the Certificate Authority World has worked for 20 years.

690
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,130
I've been involved in it. I've tried to fix it.

691
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,780
I've tried to get involved at various times

692
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,280
-- and I've given up twice now and I don't think I'm gonna be trying a
-- third time.

693
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,089
I don't know how this could possibly be fixed. That's the reality of it.

694
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:24,000
Anyway,

695
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:26,849
let's just put, let's encrypt in charge of everything. It's fine.

696
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,300
That is not the worst idea.

697
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,530
Probably until somebody takes.

698
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,380
But the problem is too, is there's, here's here. Ok, we're gonna end the show on this.

699
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:34,650
But

700
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,849
let's say you're not competent enough to get a root certificate.

701
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:40,430
Well, you can buy one, they're companies

702
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,449
-- and that has happened.
-- That's true.

703
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,290
-- You could just, the eu could just buy a company like it's fine.
-- Yeah.

704
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,550
And some of them are pretty small and weird looking and like are hard to find online.

705
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,250
You think they'd be kind of easy to find online

706
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,189
being that they are a root certificate in your browser.

707
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,670
I'm not even a little bit surprised. All right.

708
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:56,895
Anyway, I'm gonna

709
00:29:57,204 --> 00:29:58,915
basically, the more you look at this,

710
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:00,675
the worse it is.

711
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:04,114
I'm just gonna go cry in the corner for the rest of the day. Thank you, Kurt.
