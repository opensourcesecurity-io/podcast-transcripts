Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 74 with myself,

1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,729
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,840
After our episode last week about Santa and

3
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,719
leaving out, we'll say offerings to him by the Children.

4
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,629
I had a friend contact me actually today

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,559
and said when he was a kid, they left uh whiskey out for Santa.

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,969
And I'm thinking these people Irish.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,110
I know.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,290
Is he? No, I'm not Irish.

9
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,840
No, doesn't matter like I've been,

10
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,349
I've been missing out on this for all these years.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,049
And unfortunately, I suspect I,

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,770
I've reached a point where I can't change the rules now, but

13
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:47,110
I'm, I, I feel like

14
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:50,650
there's some grand conspiracy going on behind the scenes and I,

15
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,250
I've completely missed it and,

16
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,169
and I feel like a part of me is now empty and hollow because of it.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,750
Yeah, I'm gonna agree with you.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,139
Sweet.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,319
Did you think I was going to say something helpful?

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,949
No, I, I have no idea.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,870
So, so for those of you with either very young Children or no Children,

22
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,870
keep this in mind, it apparently is quite ok to leave booze for Santa.

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,510
So

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:15,709
do

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:15,959
you

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,239
know

27
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,750
the good stuff too, folks?

28
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,940
That's right. Santa doesn't like cheap booze.

29
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,889
So, anyway, I,

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,529
I do have one other bit of actually what I think is very exciting

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,269
news and I'm sure some people may or may not think it's exciting,

32
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,019
but

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,900
I have actually turned Bitcoin into money

34
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,709
-- like real,
-- you actually got it into your bank account.

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,330
It is not there yet.

36
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:39,860
It is very good.

37
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,010
So you haven't,

38
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:44,269
I'm comfortable saying it's going to get there.

39
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:44,830
And

40
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,309
so here's a crazy thing, right is I created an account on Coinbase.

41
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,650
I sold $50 worth of Bitcoin, which actually it's quite funny.

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,389
It took like six days for the transaction to go through because I, I submitted

43
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,949
my, my Bitcoin transfer

44
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,809
uh right before the Bitcoin price like went to the moon

45
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,610
and then the transaction cost like doubled from what I had submitted it as and

46
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:10,850
well, I could have done some trickery to maybe make it go through.

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,589
I was like, eh I'm lazy and I don't care.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,649
I'm just going to sit on this and yeah, it did, it went through eventually.

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,240
Well, it's really fascinating to me that everybody's like,

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,880
oh Bitcoin decentralized, it's super fast and fun to use.

51
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:21,460
And it's like

52
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,699
I've been reading all these stories about how transactions are

53
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,970
taking longer and longer and longer in like six days.

54
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:28,729
Well, you just have to,

55
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,050
if I would have made my transaction fee,

56
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:34,139
the same amount of Bitcoin I transferred but

57
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:35,720
then it would have gone through right away.

58
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,800
I know. Anyway,

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,089
I

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,000
-- feel
-- like that's not the right answer.

61
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:42,029
It

62
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,679
is the only answer though because the Blockchain is too small.

63
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,660
So, so anyway, I, I moved the Bitcoin to Coinbase.

64
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,339
I sell $50 for the Bitcoin, which is probably worth like $200 now.

65
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,360
But whatever it doesn't matter, sell $50. Then on a Sunday

66
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,199
I managed to open a savings account with my bank because I,

67
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,729
the only way to move it out of Coinbase was with it with a

68
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,199
bank transfer

69
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:07,110
and I

70
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,179
give

71
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,399
them a real account number.

72
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,589
Right. Right. Exactly.

73
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,380
So, anyway, I opened a savings account on a Sunday with my bank

74
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:19,600
and then I, I initiate the transfer and it is

75
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,419
Coinbase takes like five days to transfer the money,

76
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:25,610
which I assume they're probably pulling like an 80 P style stunt where they take the

77
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,529
money and they throw it in an interest bearing account for a couple of days,

78
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,839
you know, and gain like a couple cents or whatever and then they,

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,589
then they move it along.

80
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,179
But so basically it was a $1

81
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,309
for the sale of the coin.

82
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,910
-- Now.
-- Is that a flat $1 or a percent?

83
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,679
I believe it is

84
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,240
-- my, my understanding
-- is it's a

85
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,800
2% fee. That's, oh, wow. I want to get into that business.

86
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,710
Right.

87
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,100
So, my understanding is the flat fee of $1

88
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,869
no matter how much coin you sell.

89
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:52,889
And,

90
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,050
and so another crazy thing though is you can only

91
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:59,720
sell $10,000 worth of Bitcoin with Coinbase without verifying yourself.

92
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,380
-- And so I, of course
-- that would be the financial reporting laws.

93
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,169
Uh,

94
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:05,000
yeah. Sure. I don't know. It doesn't matter,

95
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,899
like you can't bring $10,000 into the

96
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,460
US in financial instruments without declaring it and

97
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,500
all sorts of paperwork you got, basically,

98
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,570
you have to prove where that money came from and that it's ok

99
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,040
and, and that's kind of. Right. Right. Right.

100
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,000
And

101
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,160
what they had me do for that is I clicked a button and they,

102
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,369
my webcam took pictures of my driver's license and then like,

103
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,119
an hour later they told me of, of my driver's license, not of me.

104
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,200
-- I'm not, I'm on the driver's license, but I'm not actually. No,
-- no.

105
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,079
But I mean, if it was me,

106
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,660
I would make people submit a picture of

107
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,799
their driver's license and of themselves so that,

108
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,359
you know, you could maybe make sure that they

109
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,600
sort of look the same.

110
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,359
That, that might be a good idea. I don't know. My guess is it's not legally required.

111
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,160
So why would you go above

112
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,339
and beyond? Right.

113
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,750
-- Like, never, never.
-- Mostly

114
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,079
because it would discourage bad people from abusing me and giving me grief. Right.

115
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,260
If that's a cost I can external, if I can basically

116
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,529
reduce fraud by Externalizing some costs like you have to

117
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,299
take 17 pictures of yourself holding up random number,

118
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:05,290
digits printed out on cards, using baloney and bananas to scale.

119
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:08,600
Then I would do that because, you know, people will jump through those hoops

120
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:10,079
and it doesn't cost me money.

121
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,200
Maybe I, I don't know, whatever

122
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,730
doesn't matter anyway. In, in like an hour I was

123
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:15,910
so

124
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:20,119
now I can sell or buy as much Bitcoin as I want.

125
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,130
So there we go. I guess. Uh

126
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:28,839
now I will say my suspicion is if you have say a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin,

127
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,049
you're probably going to struggle to get rid of that.

128
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,299
But in my case, I don't have a billion dollars.

129
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:35,200
So I think we mentioned this last week, but

130
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:39,029
I was looking into the amount of Bitcoin being traded

131
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,079
and a major portion of the Bitcoin transactions are the washing.

132
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,529
I, I'm not even

133
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,070
like they're not even, it's,

134
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,130
it's not like legitimate transactions of people buying stuff online.

135
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,450
It's,

136
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,489
it's the people wanting to wash their bitcoins to,

137
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,089
you know, make them harder to trace.

138
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,049
Sure.

139
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,609
No, I, I have no doubt,

140
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:00,529
no doubt.

141
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:04,950
And, and that, that's fair. It's going to be,

142
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:06,450
it

143
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,339
was fascinating to me for abuse is,

144
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,910
-- is
-- people who want to launder money.

145
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,070
If you told them,

146
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,350
you could perfectly anonymously launder your money and it's like a 5% fee,

147
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,859
they would laugh and say how much can we put through,

148
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:18,410
right?

149
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,339
Whereas normal people,

150
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,950
if you say you want to buy stuff online with Bitcoin and by the way,

151
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,600
there's a 5% transaction fee

152
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,010
that's not gonna fly.

153
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:27,089
That is

154
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:28,829
very true.

155
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,980
And in fact, now that you say that, no, I, I had about a

156
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,649
half a percent

157
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,869
is what my,

158
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:35,779
a

159
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,609
dollar on 50 is 2%.

160
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,170
Uh, no, no, no, I'm saying when I moved the coin I moved like,

161
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:44,390
at the time it was like 500 bucks worth and

162
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,760
I paid like three bucks a little less than that.

163
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,540
So,

164
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:49,760
so,

165
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:52,070
yeah,

166
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,540
that's not

167
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,470
bad. How does that work?

168
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,630
But, but of course, had I had, I, I tried to move the Bitcoins like an hour after I did,

169
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,510
I would have paid more than double that transaction fee.

170
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:04,399
So

171
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,320
I guess in a way I lucked out because I didn't care and I was willing to wait 60 days.

172
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:10,559
-- So,
-- there you go. I'm actually really curious.

173
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,640
I'm assuming the money will show up because coin base is

174
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,450
-- somewhat legitimate
-- from what I see, they're pretty legit. I'm comfortable.

175
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,799
In fact, I've, I've dealt with them on a, on a business level.

176
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,299
Not, not in terms of me buying and selling coins,

177
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,220
but yeah, they're like a real company and I'm,

178
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:30,809
I'm quite comfortable expecting my funds to make it into my bank account.

179
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,410
So, yeah, and then what do I do?

180
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,239
Then the real adventure starts because when I do my taxes,

181
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,970
I get to figure out how to claim $50 in Bitcoin sales on my taxes

182
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,049
because I,

183
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:45,450
I probably could get away with not doing it and I doubt I would get in any trouble.

184
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,910
But the way I see it is

185
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,190
my guess is at some point the IRS is going to light up

186
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:56,954
-- users with a spotlight. I mean,
-- Revenue Canada already did that with paypal. Right.

187
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:59,945
Where they demanded records from paypal for the last three years

188
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:01,434
for any business account.

189
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:02,154
Right.

190
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:06,755
In fact, Coinbase has been really clear in their fact, like they're giving the IRS

191
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:07,834
everything,

192
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,475
-- there's no escape.
-- What choice do they have?

193
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:13,274
Spend $10 million on lawyers and then give them everything.

194
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:13,954
Right?

195
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:17,234
I don't blame them either if I was, this is one of the situations they be like, yeah,

196
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:17,535
it's cool.

197
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:20,915
You guys do whatever you need. Like you just tell us what to do and it'll get done,

198
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:21,725
you know,

199
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,109
I get it

200
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,779
and, and at the same time this,

201
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,859
this intrigues me how this whole process is going to work.

202
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,410
I'm actually really excited I did at the

203
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:33,229
end of the year because I don't have to wait like nine months to file my taxes now.

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
Well, I mean, it's like, it's like that aspect.

205
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,270
I don't know if you're aware, but so, um

206
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,669
all banks internationally are now required to report American account holders to

207
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,150
the IRS.

208
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:48,440
-- They were always supposed to, aren't they? It's just
-- they, they, now it's,

209
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,549
if you don't, they won't let you

210
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,979
trade,

211
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:56,099
like they won't let you talk to the US banks.

212
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:59,700
And so, for example, for Canada, that's just absolutely not an option.

213
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,039
Right? Because it's like,

214
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,309
it's like something like 30% of Canadian banks business

215
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,169
is with the US and through the US.

216
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,630
Right? I mean, 80%

217
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,270
some

218
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:09,440
of our GDP is,

219
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:12,590
-- uh, I see Canadian Banks down here,
-- even with

220
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:16,369
the reason for that is simple. We had very

221
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,700
uh much more conservative laws around, you know,

222
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,179
cash reserves and what they could do with those uh mortgage backed securities.

223
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,179
And so the banks like TD

224
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:28,500
were essentially sitting on large piles of cash when the financial

225
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,320
crash happened and a bunch of us banks were about to

226
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:32,650
not doing so great.

227
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,940
And so they went on a buying spree because, you know,

228
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,090
stuff was cheap and they had money

229
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:42,159
in, in fact, I used TD is, is one of the banks. Um I I use and then I see

230
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:47,854
-- BMO Bank of Montreal branches all over the place everywhere.
-- The rule is in Canada.

231
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:49,804
I mean, you basically have three banks, you have TD

232
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,224
CBC

233
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:53,465
C I BC. Sorry and uh BMO

234
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:54,284
Bank of Montreal

235
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:54,484
I

236
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:57,525
BC. I don't know if I've seen them around here at all.

237
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,885
This is wonky red and yellow thing anyways

238
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,065
-- doesn't matter.
-- Um

239
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:07,520
But yeah, so I mean, essentially, so what's happening in a lot of countries now,

240
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,640
especially in China, for example,

241
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,119
is when an American goes in to deal with

242
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,380
their account and they realize you're an American,

243
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,590
they're like, your account is closed now

244
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,190
and they hand you your money and they,

245
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,150
because they don't like, I mean,

246
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:16,969
in fairness,

247
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:20,270
nobody really likes these reporting requirements because they're such a pain,

248
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:22,770
you have to go through all your accounts,

249
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,380
figure out who's American send all that data to the, I mean, just uh no,

250
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,349
but you know, if you want to do business with the US, you got to do that.

251
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,789
So some banks strategy is to basically, um,

252
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,640
you know, we took care of the problem.

253
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,719
Right. Well,

254
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,280
if you have a huge wheelbarrow full of money at that bank, they'll work with you.

255
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,919
But if you're, if you're a small change, I'd get rid of them.

256
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:45,419
-- No,
-- they won't because it's,

257
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:49,000
the reporting requirements are so onerous for most of these banks that they,

258
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:51,679
the cost and the privacy implications,

259
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,169
um,

260
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:53,929
are

261
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:54,150
such,

262
00:10:54,729 --> 00:10:56,479
yeah, it's, it's a real problem. I mean, because,

263
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,640
well, think about it, I mean,

264
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,570
there's one country in the world that charges you

265
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,409
income tax if you live outside the country.

266
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,630
Right. And that's the US.

267
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,539
You know, when I hear about that, I'm like, that's,

268
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:06,369
that's insane.

269
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,229
I know. But every now and then

270
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,330
I get tempted to try to maybe live outside the

271
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,520
country for a couple of years for work or something.

272
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,950
And then I remember

273
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,909
that I will lose all of my money to taxes

274
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:19,950
between

275
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,909
like us, taxes and foreign taxes and it's just

276
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:24,609
-- in
-- your

277
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:25,109
account.

278
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,530
Right.

279
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,880
But, uh,

280
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,609
well, and that sort of brings up a similar thing the whole, so

281
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,530
I think the biggest thing we're going to see in the next few years,

282
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:36,840
it's going to be amazing is the whole

283
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,859
facial recognition thing.

284
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,710
No, it's here now, man. Have

285
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,010
used,

286
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,260
yeah. But I mean, it's going to become ubiquitous and cheap. I mean,

287
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:48,099
we talked about Amazon web services, you know,

288
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,119
recognition with the mug shots and like

289
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:53,859
you can basically build an app to do like real time facial recognition

290
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,090
in like minutes,

291
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:55,739
you know.

292
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,049
Um

293
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,809
but I ran across a BBC

294
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,599
article from yesterday uh

295
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,260
about the Chinese facial recognition

296
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,719
stuff that they're doing with the government and the police.

297
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:11,739
And so the deal is they have something like 100 and 70 million cameras in the country.

298
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,299
Their plan is to deploy 400 million more over the next three years. That's crazy.

299
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:17,979
And

300
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,950
they basically did a demo where they took a

301
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,830
picture of the BBC journalist using like a smartphone,

302
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,739
the guy like crops it, you know, using like the little app on the phone

303
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,700
and essentially submits it to the system and flakes it like this is a, you know,

304
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,940
a person of interest like go arrest or talk to him or whatever.

305
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,390
And then the guy left the building and you know,

306
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,359
sees how long it takes for them to kind of track him down and deal with him and it was,

307
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,219
I think, seven minutes,

308
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,010
you know, and, and, but the thing is, it's completely automated, right?

309
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,219
Like there's all these cameras and

310
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:49,520
so, you know, it's every single person going through train stations,

311
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,479
every single person going through, you know, bus stations, all these,

312
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,659
you know, it always gets me, these privacy advocates are like, oh, you know,

313
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,169
just don't use a credit card, don't do this.

314
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:02,809
Great. But what about not using public transit or not using highways or not using

315
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,640
public streets?

316
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:08,559
You know, literally, you would have to go live in the woods under a tarp

317
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,400
so that the satellites can't see you.

318
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:15,239
So I remember when London deployed all their cameras because

319
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:15,950
the

320
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,760
ring of steel thing.

321
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:18,440
Yeah. Yeah.

322
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,080
And, and for those of you who don't know,

323
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,150
London has a lot of cameras in the city and basically,

324
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,640
if you are moving around London in any way

325
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,409
you're being watched. Well,

326
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,609
that's actually the common of all the British

327
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,570
towns now because it's cheaper than having cops.

328
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,130
You can have a central control room

329
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,250
and you can follow people using the cameras.

330
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,280
Well, but see, here's the point though is

331
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,900
I remember when this came out,

332
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:41,700
there was a website you could go to and

333
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,369
put in like where you're starting from and where

334
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,719
you were going and they would give you a

335
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:48,130
route that avoided the vast majority of cameras when,

336
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,039
you know, back in the day, my suspicion is today, you can't avoid them at all.

337
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:56,510
But I remember seeing this in the routes were as you can imagine, like the comical.

338
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,349
And I remember thinking that

339
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,359
nobody is going to do this.

340
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:01,469
And if you're doing this,

341
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,799
you're probably going to stick out more than if

342
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,460
you're just being recorded walking where you're going.

343
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:06,909
Right.

344
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,679
Well, and now, you know,

345
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,479
many western countries have passed laws like I know in Canada we

346
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:15,190
have a law that during protests you cannot obscure your face.

347
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:17,979
Like you can't wear a mask,

348
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,349
you can be arrested for that.

349
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,349
So, so in Canada, if I showed up with like the guy fox mask,

350
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,020
which seems to be the hip popular one,

351
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,190
they could arrest me for that.

352
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:28,650
Yeah,

353
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:29,809
that's crazy.

354
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:32,690
Well, not really. I mean, it's,

355
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,809
uh, Bill C 309. It was, it became law June 19th of 2013.

356
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,969
And, oh, yeah, it's up to 10 years in prison. So it's not like a little slap on the,

357
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,250
-- on the wrist. It's
-- like incredibly excessive.

358
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:45,880
Well,

359
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,530
it's one of those things where you kind of hope that they'll selectively enforce it.

360
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:51,479
Like, oh, you were wearing a mask and kicking in a window or something.

361
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,450
But realistically, I mean, if they decided to completely enforce it much,

362
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,640
like if they enforced speeding laws

363
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,179
across the board,

364
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:02,429
right? I mean, the first day would be a literal bloodbath.

365
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,349
They, they, that they may come in when,

366
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,869
well, it will, but the cars will be automated so they won't care. Just everybody

367
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,799
will be raging, going, ah, go faster and the car will be like, I'm sorry,

368
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:14,380
I can't do that.

369
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:14,799
Dave.

370
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,820
I, I won't care because I won't be driving.

371
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,140
I'll be reading a book in the backseat and it's going to be glorious.

372
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,260
That's what it will be.

373
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,210
-- So,
-- yeah, we'll, we'll put a link but it's,

374
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,909
it's actually now there's about a dozen countries with pretty,

375
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,750
some pretty serious laws against, you know,

376
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:34,309
obscuring your face

377
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,429
during protests or in general.

378
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:40,130
That is interesting. I

379
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:40,479
can

380
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:43,479
but the police have a history of, you know, videotaping who did,

381
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:44,280
what are these protests?

382
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,900
-- And then after the fact tracking them down dealing with it,
-- right.

383
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:50,760
Here's my take on this, right is this is one of those

384
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,469
tricky things. And

385
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,479
for example, let's say you and I go and protest net neutrality

386
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:59,320
and we decide to wear masks for whatever reason.

387
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,280
And

388
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,830
there are, I guess

389
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:05,340
noble efforts

390
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,429
you could say. And then there are

391
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:12,489
less wholesome like the KKK in the US comes to mind where these are

392
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,469
purposely obscured their face.

393
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,289
I misspoke. It's, it bans the Bill C

394
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,929
Bill C 309 in Canada bans the wearing of masks

395
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,669
during a riot or other unlawful assembly.

396
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:25,330
So if you're having

397
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:25,580
a

398
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,010
test and it's peaceful,

399
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,859
you're OK. But as soon as they do the riot act, you got to take it off.

400
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,989
I'm I'm comfortable with that.

401
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,030
I can, I

402
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,909
can live with that because I guess here's my,

403
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,989
here's my thinking on a lot of this stuff is

404
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,760
you can easily make the argument

405
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:41,640
that

406
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,359
this is for the good of society

407
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,320
and

408
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,070
in some of

409
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,080
this will make sense.

410
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm going somewhere.

411
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,840
So you can say this is for the good of society. Ok?

412
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,630
But the problem is there is good and bad happening in, in situations like this,

413
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,159
right, where you can have peaceful protests.

414
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:05,040
Now, in this case, obviously, that's not illegal, but let's just pretend it is

415
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:05,640
OK,

416
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:10,269
you might have a peaceful protest and you can have kind of a violent opposition

417
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,358
and those are not the same thing,

418
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,188
right?

419
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:14,108
But

420
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:14,868
what what

421
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:17,298
what I'm always torn by is

422
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,199
it is better to

423
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,920
let the the right thing happen

424
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,500
even though you know, some of the bad guys are going to get away with it too.

425
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,390
-- And like my, my favorite
-- example, it's very American viewpoint, in my opinion

426
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,660
-- and
-- it might be, but that's kind of the way I look at this stuff and I see this,

427
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,930
for example, like in,

428
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,790
in uh court cases where

429
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,689
you can, you know, people are guilty and they get off on technicality sometimes,

430
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:47,310
but it is better to have a robust system

431
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,770
that is going to make sure the innocent don't also get incarcerated.

432
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,599
And I know that's not always true and there's a little back and forth there but,

433
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,469
you know what I'm saying?

434
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:58,209
Yeah, I read a simple explanation of that in that if,

435
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:03,130
if being innocent is not a defense then, then people have no

436
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,229
reason to be innocent.

437
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:05,910
Right.

438
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,079
We fundamentally have to believe and behave like

439
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,459
being innocent is the correct thing to do.

440
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,689
So that ideally, you know,

441
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:15,069
people don't go around murdering each other for a pack of gum

442
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,530
and

443
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,089
yeah, I, I agree.

444
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,579
I agree.

445
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,739
And, but on the flip side

446
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,359
of society,

447
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,739
I don't know if you remember, but in Austria they passed a law.

448
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,040
Um and then there was a guy dressed as a, I want to

449
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:29,339
say

450
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,380
it was a shark for a store or something and he

451
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,130
had to take off his face mask or risk being arrested.

452
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,729
So apparently mascots are now illegal in Austria.

453
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,290
That's hilarious.

454
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,479
Uh

455
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,589
oh, sorry. No, it was an anti

456
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:48,699
Berka law that they passed. Uh saying essentially

457
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,410
you can't cover your face like that. And so yeah, some guy in a shirt costume.

458
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,040
He, oh, he actually got fined

459
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:54,500
a

460
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,319
poor little shark. You got fined 100 and €50

461
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,739
for wearing a not burqa

462
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,709
well for wearing a shark outfit.

463
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,719
-- Uh
-- I don't know, it is sweet.

464
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:09,910
So, so anyway, back to facial recognition.

465
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,989
So China is going to capture photos of everybody and they're going to do

466
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
they have a database of all citizens. Yes,

467
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,030
that's true they have it. However, this is one of those things that

468
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:26,030
I would love to say. Thank goodness that can ever happen in America.

469
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,359
It's

470
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:26,560
already

471
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,530
happening in Arizona,

472
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,229
Nevada,

473
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,109
Nevada.

474
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,579
Sorry,

475
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,189
they're like the same place, I'm sure. Right.

476
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,589
I mean, that's ignoring the ones that also require. What is it, the thumbprint now?

477
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,979
I,

478
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,709
because most prisons,

479
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,349
well, because, you know,

480
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,329
like fingerprints or something, police and whatnot.

481
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,510
So, anyway,

482
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:51,969
why don't you tell this story first?

483
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,310
-- And then also
-- simply put, uh, when you get a driver's license in Nevada now

484
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,989
and for some time,

485
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,900
uh, they run your

486
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:03,579
face, your picture against a database of like

487
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:04,890
known criminals and stuff.

488
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,530
And so they caught somebody who'd been wanted for 25 years or whatever.

489
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,540
Well, it actually sounds like, so it's even crazier than that.

490
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:14,260
Apparently, this guy

491
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,630
went in to update his driver's license, they take the picture of him

492
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,079
and they just ran it across their,

493
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:24,290
their existing database of driver's license photos and basically said, hey,

494
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,670
we've got a match with this other guy here.

495
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,609
A different

496
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,839
and then, then they did some police work and then that's when they figured this out.

497
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,420
I remember when they started capturing the thumb prints,

498
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,959
I think it was somewhere in the northeast.

499
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:39,079
And that was part of the argument that would like,

500
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,949
that turns out that there are people with

501
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,349
like six or eight licenses with different names.

502
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,310
So, you know,

503
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,359
that's a problem

504
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,729
and now facial recognition has gotten good enough in the last few years. Right?

505
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,989
Because it used to be the thumbprints and stuff, you know,

506
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,189
that was kind of poor man's recognition nowadays, we don't need that.

507
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,280
We'll just walk into our office. We know who you are.

508
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,709
I remember

509
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,150
I used to live in Indiana, one of the US States and

510
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,199
when I was there, they, they started

511
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,989
tracking, not tracking but, but making, using like facial recognition software

512
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,540
and you couldn't, when you took your picture you couldn't smile,

513
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,979
you couldn't have your glasses on

514
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:21,250
and like you had to have very, you know, a very clear view of their face.

515
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,400
And of course, this was way back in the early two thousands.

516
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,750
So it was, the technology was terrible and they, like,

517
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,670
wasted millions of dollars on nothing.

518
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:29,810
But,

519
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,180
yeah, I mean, I, I remember when, when this kind of all

520
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:35,109
because they built a database

521
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,989
going back

522
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,050
and the thing is now, if you're trying to hide,

523
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,109
-- you've got data going back 20 years,
-- that's,

524
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,750
that's exactly it. Right.

525
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,530
Is, is that it's easy to nay, say this stuff when it first starts.

526
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,030
It's like, oh, facial recognition. It's terrible.

527
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:51,469
Yeah, it is. But it's going to get better.

528
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,079
I'm sure people said the same thing

529
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,119
about credit reporting bureaus in the beginning.

530
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:57,824
But every anything ever, Kurt,

531
00:21:57,935 --> 00:22:01,145
everything ever has been, look at, look at the cloud. I remember the cloud came

532
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:06,214
out. I, I'll admit I was one of them. I was like, that looks kind of dumb, like it sucks.

533
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,444
Right. Who wants to use that? Now? It's like

534
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:10,925
-- everybody wants to use that.
-- That's

535
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:11,324
true.

536
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,994
Yeah, I, no, I fully agree. It's,

537
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:16,425
well, that's the thing. Like, I just got an Amazon, Alexa.

538
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:17,454
Alexa

539
00:22:17,614 --> 00:22:18,125
wake up.

540
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:18,494
Oh, it

541
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:18,795
doesn't.

542
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:19,375
But the

543
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:19,655
little blue

544
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:20,055
light. So

545
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:21,375
buy

546
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:21,675
a doll

547
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:22,454
house.

548
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:23,305
Sorry.

549
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:24,520
Oh,

550
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,119
there you go. Hey, Alexa,

551
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,630
how are you doing, Alexa?

552
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,729
Awesome. Uh

553
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,170
Anyways and my son was asking Alexa

554
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:34,640
things and also going like Alexa

555
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,520
chicken butt and poor Alexa is like, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

556
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,930
But you know, and as comically terrible as Alexa is, I would point out that,

557
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:46,880
that that little $200 device is somehow magically doing voice recognition.

558
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,479
-- Uh
-- It's magically recording everything.

559
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:50,459
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

560
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,160
It's in a room where uh

561
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,319
it's, it's a, it's like the workroom

562
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,250
but um

563
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,770
uh what's really cool is I can now tie it into my terrible

564
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,099
sky. Oh, this is the best vendor ever Skylink net.

565
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,949
Uh Google. It, it's like the entire security system is like Tuer

566
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,800
Bucks. It's so cheap and terrible.

567
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,560
This is all I'm gonna say

568
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,290
Sky

569
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,579
-- link
-- net.

570
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,380
I know. Isn't that?

571
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:15,739
It

572
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,469
didn't even

573
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,020
pretend it

574
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,540
isn't sky.

575
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,670
Like come on

576
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:20,270
guys,

577
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:21,010
I

578
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,660
put a little more effort into it

579
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,250
and I mean, this stuff is terrible.

580
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,540
I'm afraid to even security test it because I kind

581
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,900
of almost bricked it twice already by just using it.

582
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:31,750
Um,

583
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:32,439
but like,

584
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:32,979
I mean, they are,

585
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,329
-- so who cares?
-- They, exactly. They make a camera that is pen and tilt.

586
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:42,530
Uh, and Zoom has the whole IR thing for night vision,

587
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,209
uh, does Wi Fi does Ethernet,

588
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:49,959
uh, it's like 720 P or something. Like, so it's pretty high quality camera.

589
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,079
It's like

590
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,250
90 bucks Canadian. So, like, what is that? Like, 70 bucks us?

591
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:57,969
-- So, how do you power this camera? Does it use? You
-- plug it into the wall?

592
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:01,160
Just, just an outlet and, and then I assume it's wireless to.

593
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,040
Exactly.

594
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,890
Yeah, it can be wired or wireless.

595
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:05,650
Um,

596
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,359
basically you get

597
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:06,920
a nice,

598
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,459
yeah, you can, but I don't want to wire my house up. It's such a pain.

599
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,089
Um, and this thing, you have, you get a little hub that, like,

600
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,530
talks to all the wireless devices,

601
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,800
like a motion sensor is 20 bucks and they're honestly,

602
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,439
they're good to about 40 or 50 ft.

603
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:23,760
Like, I put one in a room where there's kind of like a long haul and stuff.

604
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:24,890
It can, it's,

605
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,400
it's a pretty good motion sensor for something that

606
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,290
cost 20 bucks and runs on a AA battery and

607
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:29,989
wireless

608
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,300
into facial recognition

609
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,349
-- and you're gold, right?
-- Yeah,

610
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:38,020
pretty much. And, you know, it's, it's just on the one hand I'm like,

611
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,660
uh, so, you know, I made sure the camera is kind of, it's in a public area of the house.

612
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,755
So, like where we don't do private stuff really, because I, I'm not super keen now,

613
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:49,255
the one thing I do like about this camera is there's no cloud service behind it.

614
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:49,625
That's

615
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:53,675
so it's local only unless I like poke a hole in my firewall so that I can like,

616
00:24:53,685 --> 00:24:55,535
remotely view what's on the camera and control it.

617
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:58,395
How, how secure is the wireless protocol?

618
00:24:58,525 --> 00:24:58,935
Yeah.

619
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,464
So what's interesting to me though is that it kind

620
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:03,854
of comes back to the dumb TV security argument but

621
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,484
in some sense,

622
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:08,895
the more secure home system is the cheaper dumber one

623
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:11,900
that doesn't have a cloud service, for example, to get broken into,

624
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:17,150
-- uh,
-- maybe. Now, now does this, does, does your Skynet system,

625
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:21,339
does it have the ability to, like, open it up to your,

626
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:24,119
your iphone or something when you're away from home?

627
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,400
It can send notifications when I'm outside the house. Yes. So it can,

628
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:31,349
there is a bit of a service but it's mostly the notifications.

629
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,949
It's not like the video and stuff.

630
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:36,209
So for example, you wouldn't know when my doors are open and closed.

631
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:39,939
Yeah, I'm not super, I'm still waffling on it.

632
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,849
But here's the thing, like, if I, if I want to go with a professional security system,

633
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:47,069
it's going to cost me a minimum of 20 or 30 bucks a month for monitoring.

634
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,170
That's, that's like

635
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:49,530
the

636
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:51,984
set up is crazy expensive

637
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:55,954
also. No, because they basically like you sign up for two or three years or whatever.

638
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:56,165
Right.

639
00:25:56,604 --> 00:25:58,545
It's like the way cell phones used to work,

640
00:25:59,104 --> 00:25:59,234
but

641
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:03,545
the phone is free, just sign this 12 year contract.

642
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:04,474
Exactly.

643
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:07,795
So, yeah. No, I mean, I'm not super keen on this, but essentially this,

644
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,915
this is sort of the least evil

645
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,510
system that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Like, I could certainly buy a

646
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,050
pretty secure system, but then you have to go somewhat high end with like,

647
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,290
really name brand

648
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,540
and also like,

649
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,579
Equifax is a name brand.

650
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,459
Well, exactly. Equifax is a pretty good name brand. Turns out, whoops.

651
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,119
We just sort of let some bad guy have everything, minor detail,

652
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:28,729
you know,

653
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,689
iii I don't know how long until one of these

654
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:33,250
major security monitoring companies gets broken into and like,

655
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,010
everything gets hoovered up.

656
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,439
So, yeah, I basically went with the dumb TV argument, which is whenever I buy a TV.

657
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,250
Nowadays I find the dumbest TV,

658
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,010
I can buy that doesn't have a camera built in on the premise,

659
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,489
-- but essentially it's a stupid monitor and
-- hopefully

660
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,180
won't be too

661
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:46,380
happy

662
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,300
-- anymore. Kurt, there's no such thing as dumb TV. S anymore.
-- Really? Oh, dear.

663
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:50,609
You

664
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:50,750
know,

665
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,270
from

666
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,329
X TV. You know, there aren't,

667
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,849
although I have a Roku TV. It's very nice.

668
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,010
I love it.

669
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,810
I don't need to plug anything into it and I can watch Netflix.

670
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:06,329
I find my concern with those devices is more that the software never gets updates.

671
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,780
-- Uh, and I've seen those smart TV and they take forever to turn
-- on.

672
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,780
Uh, yes, it takes 12 seconds to turn on.

673
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,839
And I know that because I have a harmony remote and I

674
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,300
have it designed that when I push the watch TV button,

675
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,180
which I still have a myth TV machine.

676
00:27:18,189 --> 00:27:20,760
I built like 12 years ago that's still running

677
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,979
basically the same hardware from 12 years ago.

678
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,020
Uh, I did upgrade it to Fedora 26 though. It took, I think four days,

679
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,390
I

680
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:31,719
will know I went from like Fedora 18 or something to like 26.

681
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:32,859
It was

682
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:35,020
starting at 18

683
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:36,079
and

684
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:36,550
run

685
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:37,000
up.

686
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,770
I kept doing this and part of me thought I should just reinstall and then I thought,

687
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,069
no, this is a challenge.

688
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,020
I'm going to do this

689
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:48,199
-- and it is surprisingly worked. Oh,
-- we got to put that video in the show notes.

690
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,949
But this guy upgraded from, I think it was D

691
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,170
OS one to whatever the

692
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:56,670
windows 1.0 to like windows seven or something. And it, it did work. Yes.

693
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,510
Uh Anyway, anyway,

694
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,949
it takes 12 seconds because I have a harmony remote and I, when the TV turns on,

695
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,829
I then want to tell it the like switch to this input.

696
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,910
And

697
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,189
I basically went, when I set up the remote, I had to do it right away.

698
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:16,160
It didn't work and I just kept adding a second until I got it. And it was 12 seconds,

699
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,239
which is

700
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,359
an eternity.

701
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,630
-- I want to watch my TV. Now, I don't want to wait 12
-- second.

702
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:25,040
Well, it's funny because you and I grew up with analog TV. S that you turn them on and

703
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,349
poop.

704
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:27,209
Like, it takes a 2nd

705
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,290
and 15 minutes later.

706
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,630
Well, when you change channels, especially on digital receiver boxes,

707
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,839
you change the channel.

708
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:37,130
It thinks for like, half, it thinks for a noticeable amount of time

709
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,209
and then starts displaying something, right?

710
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,650
Because it's got to buffer some stream and whatever, right?

711
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,630
Yeah, I can live with that because I have a guide, I have a guide card.

712
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,719
-- But
-- I, you know, I like that click, click, click, click, click, click, you know,

713
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,770
-- like the
-- knob

714
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:51,780
near. Yeah,

715
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:57,079
when you tell your little brother go change the channel like, yeah, pretty much

716
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,420
Sesame Streets on in 10 minutes.

717
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,680
-- You can't miss good
-- times.

718
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,479
And those were the crazy days.

719
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,699
But no, so I I,

720
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:09,109
one thing I'm beginning to realize is I think in some ways the

721
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,630
cheaper dumber products are probably just as insecure if not more insecure.

722
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,369
But because they don't have like this back end mothership service,

723
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,260
somebody would have to specifically target me to

724
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,390
break in versus I'm going to target the

725
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,760
backend service of some security monitoring company and

726
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,099
like get 5 million people on one go

727
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,380
uh sort of. So the your your your Skynet camera

728
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:35,810
is eventually going to develop a backend service.

729
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,180
It is going to happen someday

730
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,099
because

731
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:40,699
it'll become cheap enough

732
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:43,020
and there will be some demand in whatever.

733
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:44,339
And it

734
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:47,709
is, it is quite conceivable that

735
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,790
it's really only a threat today if someone targets you anyway. Because

736
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:56,469
let's say you're using a service, let's say you're uploading your camera to it.

737
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,319
-- Well, like Nest and
-- Google. Right.

738
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,709
Sure. Let's, let's say, and they say someone breaks in and steals it.

739
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,280
Now they have a 12 million hours of people's hallways

740
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,630
-- and, but
-- they also have Amazon facial recognition to run it.

741
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:13,989
But still,

742
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,430
I, I envision some level of targeting. I mean, don't get me wrong.

743
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:20,420
I don't want people stealing like my video camera footage by any means.

744
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,560
I'm not saying it's ok if this happens.

745
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:27,829
But I, I think there's still some level of herd immunity you can get away with

746
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,270
in, in some of these situations, right?

747
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,709
And, and let's face it. If you're, if you're being targeted,

748
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,609
you lose end of story. Right?

749
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:38,800
It doesn't matter what service you're using, it doesn't matter if it's cloud or not.

750
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,160
Like if you're a target, you lose,

751
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,430
you cannot beat them.

752
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:45,270
Generally. Yes. I mean, apart from living

753
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:45,869
in

754
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:46,030
the

755
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,459
woods under

756
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:46,589
the

757
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,420
teed, even if you live in the woods skit,

758
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:53,689
they're gonna just show up with a pickup truck, a tarp and a, and a crowbar and

759
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:55,800
they're gonna get you right. You,

760
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,869
if you are a target

761
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:03,000
of any sort of attacker with even modest resources you will lose, period

762
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,479
because they don't have to follow the rules

763
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:06,640
and they won't.

764
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,380
Well, see, in the second part of my thinking is,

765
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:12,369
is the cost to get a secure system is

766
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,859
like exponentially higher than this cheap junkie system,

767
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,040
like straight up.

768
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:17,719
Yes.

769
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:23,079
-- Well, is there a secure system on the market, like
-- whatever a bank uses or,

770
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,680
-- let's
-- say you had infinite money?

771
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,060
Oh, well,

772
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,380
then I would just hire some guys with

773
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,010
guns and give them really good medical benefits.

774
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,699
Ok. Let's dial it down to,

775
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:36,900
I've told you you can buy any security system off of Amazon with my credit card.

776
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,000
What do you,

777
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,150
uh,

778
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,250
one of everything?

779
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,619
You're, you're not helping.

780
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,500
-- Right. Like
-- this is no, I know what you mean.

781
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,849
-- Like there was, I mean, that we go
-- back to that

782
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:49,839
one. Right. I'm giving you my credit card and you can buy one, only one.

783
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,079
No stupid rules could stop being a monkey paw. Like, answer the question.

784
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:57,079
I'd buy the cheap one regardless.

785
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah. Right. Right. That's fair.

786
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,869
Well, you know, like I said, it also comes back to that, like,

787
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,869
paying 20 or 30 bucks a month for monitoring.

788
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,719
You know, that at, like, over the span of 10 years, that's thousands of dollars.

789
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:11,260
And that's hard to justify. Like, when I could spend 200 bucks

790
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:14,239
-- every two or three years.
-- Yeah. Well, not only that.

791
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,270
So, like, here's something to think about is,

792
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,319
let's say you're blowing 30 bucks

793
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,800
a month on monitoring, what are the odds

794
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:26,189
that whatever is stolen from your house will cost

795
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:29,020
less than the money you are going to spend,

796
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,459
assuming you even get broken into.

797
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:31,880
Right.

798
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,239
We also have insurance.

799
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,410
Right.

800
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,780
Exactly. And there's insurance.

801
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:36,979
It is

802
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,500
my suspicion is that if you did the Roia a

803
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,260
home security system, unless you live in a dodgy place,

804
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,630
which, in which case,

805
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,979
-- like your insurance is going to be sky high because
-- like they know

806
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,839
you are going to need bars on your windows.

807
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:50,660
Right?

808
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,380
Yes.

809
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:54,630
But I mean my my guess and this is kind of

810
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,160
one of those things I think this is like getting,

811
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,420
you know, device protection from Best Buy.

812
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:01,199
I am never going to

813
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,880
make as much money back in trading in broken garbage to

814
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,040
you people as I'm going to spend paying your extortion.

815
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,880
Well, that is one thing to remember for a lot of

816
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,829
alarm systems is that

817
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,510
the

818
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,540
they will lower your insurance premiums sufficiently to make it worth it.

819
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,209
However, when I was talking to my insurance company because we moved

820
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,109
and they're like,

821
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,339
you know, do you have an alarm system?

822
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:26,790
And I'm like uh yeah, we'll have like blah, blah, blah, you know, like door sensors,

823
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,790
motion sensors, blah, blah, blah.

824
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,099
And she's like, oh who monitors it?

825
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:32,219
I'm like, well, like, you know, we do a smartphone thing. She's like, ok, so like

826
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,589
subscriber monitor.

827
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,229
Like, they, they have that option in their soft point now to describe it because,

828
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,910
like, let's face it. Right. Anybody under the age of 30

829
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:42,010
they're not gonna spend like,

830
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,949
30 bucks a month on an alarm system when they can just

831
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:46,540
go drop 200 bucks on Amazon and be done with it.

832
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:49,150
And more to the point I want to go to my smartphone

833
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,489
anyways and I can even have it go to other people's smartphones,

834
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,160
you know, like

835
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,359
my parents or whatever. Um

836
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,619
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's clearly,

837
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,079
well, the future is here now folks and I'm sorry,

838
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:02,699
but it cost 200 bucks and it doesn't involve a third party company

839
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,609
charging a recurring monthly fee.

840
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:08,688
Not, not even that man, I mean, even even if you wanted a recurring fee,

841
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:12,020
the reason it costs so much is because humans generally deal with this

842
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:15,699
and I have a suspicion that A I is probably good enough

843
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:17,139
that you could,

844
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:21,310
-- you could be 80%. Ok?
-- You don't even need a I, I mean

845
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:24,399
like I'm looking at so it's ift tt and it's a

846
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,409
way to get devices and apps to talk to each other.

847
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,510
So for example,

848
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,020
I can have my skylink net system log everything to a Google spreadsheet,

849
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,168
-- just call it
-- Skynet,

850
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:32,929
right? Ok.

851
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,728
Um So I for example,

852
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,510
there's like a recipe to have this thing log everything to a Google spreadsheet.

853
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,010
So I have like an audit trail of like,

854
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,560
I know for a fact, for example,

855
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,918
like most police stations have that audit trail of like

856
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:45,159
every single door when it was open and closed,

857
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:45,540
who did it?

858
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,239
Which badge?

859
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,719
And I know back in the day,

860
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:51,139
what they used to do at the downtown location was have it go to a line printer.

861
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:51,958
So it was like a, a

862
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:56,000
right once read many unalterable copy and they basically just

863
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,070
fed this printer a box of paper every day.

864
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,840
So they had this unalterable log of, you know, door events.

865
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:06,929
So I, I have a friend who was in university way back in the day and,

866
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,989
and computing power was very expensive back then.

867
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:12,379
And this is like mainframe days, right?

868
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,209
And they had a, a printout log of the door.

869
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,350
And so, and you had it like everyone, a key cards and to get in to the mainframe room,

870
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,810
you had to scan your key card

871
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,189
and then it were printed off on the printer that was locked up in,

872
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,610
like the administrators room.

873
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,000
They figured out

874
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:27,909
that

875
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,929
the printer would go offline. Well, it would jam up right

876
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:35,050
on a pretty regular basis and they figured out how to make it happen.

877
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,050
And so

878
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:38,429
they would basically badge in

879
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,300
and then open and close the door like a whole bunch of times

880
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
and then badge out

881
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,139
and,

882
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:44,979
and generally if they did that a few times the

883
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:47,120
printer would then jam up and it would quit printing

884
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:48,870
things and so then they could come and go as

885
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,760
they pleased and use the computer all they want.

886
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,810
Because for some reason, apparently they didn't have like a log on the computer.

887
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,699
They only logged the door use, which

888
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:57,870
they literally build you by door time. I

889
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,120
think it was billing as much as like they wanted

890
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:04,280
to know who is around and who is doing stuff.

891
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,620
And these guys were obviously like, this was back in the day, right?

892
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:08,129
They, they were up to stuff

893
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:09,159
so they didn't.

894
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,850
But anyway,

895
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,389
it's like this is, this is crazy.

896
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:15,090
You got to love it

897
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,389
or, or wasn't it? I think Richard Stallman has a story of how they used to.

898
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,429
They, they kept like the computer was locked behind a door,

899
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,780
but there was a drop ceiling and you could just like climb over the wall. So

900
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,459
I've seen that before in multiple places with the wiring closets and

901
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,010
it's a new comp site building they built at the University of Alberta,

902
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,020
uh to future proof that they ran cable trays because you know,

903
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,820
whatever cable you run is going to be wrong in five years.

904
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:44,979
-- I know less than that.
-- Probably these cable trays though are exposed publicly.

905
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:47,860
And I'm like, what if somebody comes in here with cable cutters and they're like,

906
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,750
just please don't.

907
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,889
Uh But in all seriousness, I bet the threat there is very, very low.

908
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:56,040
I mean,

909
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:59,070
somebody tying into a cable No, it's not.

910
00:36:59,199 --> 00:36:59,370
No.

911
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:02,830
What I'd be worried about is some drunk guy hanging off the cable train, breaking it.

912
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,989
Exactly. Exactly.

913
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,510
That's like when you're in college you don't need fire,

914
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,149
fire drills because the people take care of that,

915
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:12,219
you get one every Friday night.

916
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:16,719
-- But
-- there's this ift tt stuff that, like, lets me, you know, tie.

917
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:17,949
So for example, I can,

918
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,550
you know, set up like a sleepover mode for my alarm system so that, you know,

919
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,979
say between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.

920
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:27,479
you can't open any of the external doors without the alarm going off or something,

921
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:30,899
but you know, movement in the house is allowed or you know, whatever.

922
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:31,899
Um

923
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,409
and but the beauty is you can tie multiple

924
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:39,590
systems like essentially if it talks ift tt

925
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:42,000
you can tie stuff together with a very simplistic

926
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,780
programming language and there's like these recipes floating around

927
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,530
do

928
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,860
stuff,

929
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,469
Alexa

930
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,709
will talk to my skylink net and that's I'm going

931
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,449
to be setting that up in the next few days.

932
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:52,010
Sweet

933
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,989
-- Alexa,
-- cancel.

934
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,590
What are you yelling at it for?

935
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,100
Because it's trying to talk every time I say that

936
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,629
words

937
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,449
pretty much.

938
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,260
Oh, see, that's funny. You can't talk about Alexa

939
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:07,429
without Alexa

940
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,449
flipping out.

941
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:12,530
-- At least
-- I think I can change the keyword. Yeah, I can change the keyword

942
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,129
just like with, hey Siri,

943
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,510
I've got it set up for the home link

944
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,620
button now because otherwise all my devices are like,

945
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,959
I'm going to be helpful,

946
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:23,820
exploded.

947
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,510
Oh man, I actually that would be really funny.

948
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,870
I wonder if you went into like a dense downtown area

949
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,739
and you were on a show

950
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,270
like, hey Siri or hey Alexa

951
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:38,189
Siri typically is somewhat tied to your voice.

952
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:41,790
Like you, you say it a few times recorded but my with the,

953
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:44,949
with the, with the, with the Amazon one,

954
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,870
um like my son could use it immediately and it was, you know,

955
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:51,929
talking and responsive to him, which, you know, for a home device makes sense,

956
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:52,030
right?

957
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,649
Because it's shared among multiple people

958
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:56,330
and you'd want guests to be able to ask what time it is or whatever.

959
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:57,810
Interesting.

960
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:58,860
I like it, it,

961
00:38:58,979 --> 00:39:00,479
-- it
-- isn't, it is,

962
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,620
it is very much weird and the future in that,

963
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,179
you know, should I be polite to this thing, should I say? Thank you.

964
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:08,659
I,

965
00:39:08,669 --> 00:39:12,850
I hear that all the time that people are saying their Children are being mean to Alexa

966
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,330
and they want to,

967
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:18,250
they want to add like a plug in to make them say please. And thank you.

968
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:19,040
Yeah.

969
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,360
You know, I kept having to remind Felix that it was not

970
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,399
a person

971
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:25,770
right

972
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,679
to him. It's a voice that answers

973
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:27,969
questions

974
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:28,479
on the

975
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:28,939
side.

976
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,310
You just open it up and they're in there. Right?

977
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:31,739
Yeah,

978
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,929
like the uh like in men in black, the first one.

979
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:35,889
Right.

980
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,370
Exactly.

981
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,300
Exactly.

982
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,080
So I, yeah, no, it's, it's part of it is I've decided to adopt some new technologies.

983
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,689
Uh I'm still holding off on VR and A R for

984
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,399
at least a few more years till my kids are bigger.

985
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:51,159
But uh no, I'm going to do some,

986
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:55,320
I've decided to bite the bullet and eat some of this home automation sandwich and,

987
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,600
you know, see how it works

988
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,389
because especially at this price point, like 200 bucks, it's just, it's so cheap.

989
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:01,679
I,

990
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:05,040
I looked into this probably five years ago and there was

991
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,260
like a bunch of Z wave gear and it was,

992
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,060
it was going to be super hacky and I bought some of it.

993
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,060
In fact, it's in a box on my shelf somewhere,

994
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:16,989
-- but like it was, it was more work than it was worth and I gave up.
-- Oh,

995
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:17,780
yeah, for sure.

996
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:17,949
Yeah.

997
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,540
No, the Skylink net stuff is pretty limited.

998
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,449
Um,

999
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,260
what I'm really looking forward to is so IKEA

1000
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,320
has some really nice stuff around light bulbs and light

1001
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,219
and I wanna see, uh, number one, will it play with

1002
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,760
the Amazon thing? I'm gonna have to change that keyword. That is super annoying.

1003
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,939
Now that you've made me do that

1004
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,129
great. I'm gonna have to, like, print out and laminate a card with a list of words.

1005
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:46,580
-- I'm not allowed to see in my, in front of my computers.
-- Just turn off your Alexa.

1006
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:50,709
It's way over there. Uh, there's no off switch. I don't think you have to unplug it.

1007
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,770
Really?

1008
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,290
Or maybe, well, maybe that's what the microphone mute button does.

1009
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,155
Yeah, that's what microphone

1010
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:56,014
does.

1011
00:40:56,514 --> 00:40:57,094
Um

1012
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,375
I haven't really read the manual or anything.

1013
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:01,594
Why read manuals, open it up.

1014
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:03,594
I can talk to it. That's right.

1015
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:07,104
How did it work to make it sync with Amazon?

1016
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:10,415
Did it, like, ask you to speak at it or did you use a computer or what you do?

1017
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,620
Uh you uh smartphone app?

1018
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,580
-- Uh OK.
-- And I it was very simple. Like, it took like 30 seconds.

1019
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,070
Gotcha.

1020
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,659
So it does like Bluetooth or something to your phone, I assume.

1021
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:24,459
-- Uh,
-- but basically you hop it, it open, it's,

1022
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:27,139
it's one of those classic things where it opens up an insecure Wi Fi.

1023
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:28,010
Ah,

1024
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,350
and you connect to that insecure Wi Fi and then

1025
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,489
the app does pokes at it and configures it to,

1026
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,570
I'm making air quotes here to be secure and set up.

1027
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,189
I have no idea what it did.

1028
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,459
Um, Magic. You know, I told it my Wi Fi password. Hopefully, nothing bad happened.

1029
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:44,510
It's connected to your Wi Fi now. Right.

1030
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,250
-- Well,
-- because it has, it doesn't have, well, as far as I know it doesn't have a plug in.

1031
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,530
-- It's Wi Fi only.
-- Right. Right.

1032
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,649
Sweet.

1033
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,409
So,

1034
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:53,459
uh, yeah.

1035
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,070
No, it's, but, yeah, I've decided to bite the bullet on some of the stuff,

1036
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,469
but one of my rules is I'm only going to buy the cheap stuff because

1037
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,580
I'm probably going to be disappointed at some point.

1038
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,310
-- So I don't want to spend a lot of money on this.
-- I don't, I don't blame you for that.

1039
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,129
Uh All right, man. I, I think,

1040
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:08,750
I think we've discussed Alexa

1041
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,510
and, and your home security system enough.

1042
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,949
I'm sure you'll have plenty of stories to tell us in the near future.

1043
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:17,939
Any parting words of wisdom or advice,

1044
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:20,540
be prepared for disappointment when buying technology.

1045
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:24,449
How about just in general? Right. Be prepared for disappointment in general.

1046
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,060
I, I think, I think that's good advice. All right,

1047
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:29,550
anyway. All right, Kurt. Thank you, sir.
