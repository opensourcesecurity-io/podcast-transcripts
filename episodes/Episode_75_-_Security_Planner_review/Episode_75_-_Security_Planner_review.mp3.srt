Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast episode 75

1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,460
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,680
What is New Kurt?

3
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:17,670
Uh, just getting ready for Christmas?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:18,700
Oh,

5
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,809
I should start getting ready for Christmas.

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,149
All I can say is thank God for Amazon.

7
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,129
Yes, I agree.

8
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:29,260
Amazon is amazing because you go into a store

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,569
and you spend an hour not finding anything.

10
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,310
And then by the time you walk back to your car you've ordered

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,060
the thing you went looking for.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,349
Amazon.

13
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,540
I've actually started doing that when I'm at Home

14
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:40,979
Depot and they don't have the thing I want.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,520
Seriously, man. I, I know exactly what you mean.

16
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:44,659
There,

17
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,659
there are a handful of items I really like to

18
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:49,299
touch and make sure I understand what I'm getting.

19
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,869
But for the most part, I've, I've given up, I just ordered off Amazon.

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,779
It's so much easier.

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:54,779
Yeah.

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,439
No, I just got a new mattress for, you know,

23
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,380
and they ship it via UPS and it gets here in like three days and

24
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:01,810
you have 100 days to sleep on it if you

25
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,259
don't like it because we're actually getting rid of.

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,699
We, we previously bought a mattress and it was,

27
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:08,419
it was just honestly too squishy and I love the reviews of all these

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,580
mattresses online because the people that bother to leave reviews it boils down to

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,900
49% say it's too squishy and they hate it.

30
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,620
49% say it's too hard and they hate it and 2% are like, it's ok.

31
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,830
So

32
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:23,580
we had this mattress for about a month and a half tried it. It just too squishy.

33
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:26,760
We got a different one and yeah, we're much happier with it.

34
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:27,860
Great.

35
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,910
Now, now, can you just keep it for like 90 days and then return it

36
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,879
-- and then get another one from someone else?
-- You know what?

37
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:38,120
You probably could because there's enough companies doing this now.

38
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,559
Uh, but the problem is that the refund takes quite a while to recycle.

39
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,709
So, like it's, you know,

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,099
I'm not going to get my money back for like a week or two or three.

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,819
Um, so you'd essentially be carrying the cost of like two mattresses at any time.

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,190
So, I guess you might as well just buy one.

43
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,110
Right. Right.

44
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,629
I suspect not only that the pain and suffering of having to

45
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,709
deal with changing mattresses on a regular basis is probably

46
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:03,669
not worth.

47
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,779
Here's the interesting thing is they have a charity come pick it up and the

48
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,169
charity is happy because now they get like a big pile of nice new mattresses

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,470
and I'm happy because I didn't have to schlep this thing out or like,

50
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,029
try to attach enough postage to it to send it back to wherever.

51
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,259
So, does it come in like a mattress size box or do they, like,

52
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,039
it's like vacuum

53
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:25,350
compressed and sealed? So

54
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,850
the new one came in a box. It's about a foot.

55
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:31,130
Uh, it's about a foot and a half by foot and a half by about 4 ft tall.

56
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,970
It weighs about 100 and 21 pounds.

57
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:35,100
So the poor ups lady was just end over end.

58
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,850
It was like good thump and then she'd, like, raise it up on its end and, like,

59
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,149
pitch it over a thump.

60
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,970
Right? Because it's just too bulky to carry. Right.

61
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,449
Unless you're like, Andre the giant.

62
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:44,339
Um,

63
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:47,169
but I was just thinking it's, it's interesting because, like I was,

64
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,419
I asked the mattress guys, like, have you seen a lot of these?

65
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:51,020
And he's like, yeah, we see about one a week. So

66
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,139
it's,

67
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,380
you know, it's a source of really nice mattresses for these charities, right?

68
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,619
Because there's absolutely no way you can ship this thing back

69
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,880
for less than like 1000 bucks, right? Because it's,

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,490
it's

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:00,729
a,

72
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,820
you know, it's a mattress,

73
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,110
you know. But, uh, yeah, so, no, I'm, I'm really, again, it's like, how do or not?

74
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:12,679
How, but why would anybody go buy a mattress in a regular store where you get to, like,

75
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,270
lie down on it for five minutes and then you,

76
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,639
you're expected to spend like one or $2000

77
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,610
and if it doesn't work out for you, you know, my experience with trying to uh

78
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:22,580
return expensive things to stores because I don't like them,

79
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:25,039
especially something like a mattress is a nightmare.

80
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:26,940
You know,

81
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,470
versus these online guys where you just send them an email and they're like, oh,

82
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,110
we're sorry,

83
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,490
like, and that's it.

84
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,360
That's literally the return process and then a guy comes and picks it up.

85
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:36,710
Right.

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,880
So,

87
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,330
but it got me thinking. So Christmas is coming.

88
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,580
And what's something much like Thanksgiving in the US?

89
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:45,610
What's something we all end up doing at Christmas?

90
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,940
Uh fixing all of our relatives, computers?

91
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,149
Yes. Right. Exactly.

92
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,580
Uh

93
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,559
So,

94
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,059
so with that in mind,

95
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,880
I came across this thing called security planner.org.

96
00:03:59,169 --> 00:03:59,589
Yeah.

97
00:03:59,600 --> 00:03:59,619
Uh,

98
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,789
it was actually mentioned on Bruce Schneier's blog

99
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,110
and his disclaimer was he's involved in it.

100
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,419
So he's obviously pro security planner. But,

101
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,710
um I opened up the website. I haven't tried it yet.

102
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:11,630
And so what we're going to do today is the, the premise seems to be,

103
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,570
improve your reading from the website here,

104
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,910
improve your online safety with advice from experts.

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,230
Answer a few simple questions to get personalized online safety recommendations.

106
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:20,160
It's confidential.

107
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,149
No personal information is stored and we won't access any of your online accounts.

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,880
Let's do it.

109
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:28,429
Um So with that in mind, Josh and I are going to walk through this

110
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,029
to see what the advice is. You know? Is the advice good. Is it ridiculous?

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,570
Is it actually useful?

112
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:34,290
Because

113
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:34,690
I,

114
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,519
I think we're kind of getting to the point where a

115
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:39,160
lot of people have computers that are reasonably well behaved.

116
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,140
You know, it's not like, well,

117
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,019
hopefully it's not like running what malware bites for six hours.

118
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:47,250
Um, but, you know, hopefully you've got some relatives who's,

119
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,209
maybe you can help them with their online security

120
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,089
maybe. Or we're going to get a good laugh because this site's maybe terrible.

121
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,970
-- Let's, let's find out. Right.
-- So I'm

122
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,709
clicking the orange button.

123
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,190
All right.

124
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,029
-- Oh,
-- ok.

125
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:02,440
Can I

126
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,950
choose all that apply?

127
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:07,140
-- I like this because it separates iphones and ipads from Android.
-- You

128
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:07,369
have

129
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,529
to

130
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,299
tell people what you're seeing. So,

131
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:10,869
the

132
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,670
first, the first, oh, I thought you were going to read, uh,

133
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,630
the first question is what do you use to handle your private information?

134
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,350
Choose all that apply? And your options are iphone or ipad.

135
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,329
Uh, next option, Android phone or tablet.

136
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:25,570
Next option, Mac computer, next option, Windows, computer, next option, email,

137
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,970
uh, next option, social media accounts.

138
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:32,500
-- Next option, online shopping and banking and next option, other. So my,
-- my question

139
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,239
that there isn't Linux computer on the

140
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:35,769
list.

141
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:36,929
Well, yeah.

142
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,029
Um, well, Android.

143
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,929
But, um, my one thought here is shouldn't like email and sort of social media

144
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:49,049
be like pre-elected because how, how does anybody avoid using email.

145
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:52,910
So, if I was going to guess, I bet

146
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,579
people don't associate social media and email is the same thing,

147
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:59,540
which is why they disconnected them.

148
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,029
Yeah.

149
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:02,260
Right.

150
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,309
So,

151
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,839
I'm basically selecting everything except for android phone windows and other,

152
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,390
-- I'm assuming others like PS four and stuff,
-- just click them all.

153
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,760
Kurt, click them all.

154
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,720
Ok. Clicking it all. And then you click next,

155
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,399
click all your top online security concerns. Choose all that apply.

156
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:23,959
Uh So your options are unauthorized. Access to my online accounts.

157
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,600
Yeah, that's definitely a concern.

158
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:29,309
Accidentally downloading viruses, malware or other harmful software.

159
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,309
Yes.

160
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,600
And to wit, I'm always shocked when I download a piece of software,

161
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:37,829
run it through virus total.com and I'm like the first person to have done.

162
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,119
So

163
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:40,750
I find that rather sad.

164
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:41,429
Um

165
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:47,149
You know, uh third option protecting my data if my devices are lost or stolen. Yep.

166
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,359
Uh number four, better privacy for my web browsing. And I like the icon.

167
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,540
It's a little laptop with like some window shades,

168
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,450
right? I was just gonna say that it's very nice.

169
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,679
Yeah, the graphics on this are nice, very accessible. Um

170
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:03,500
better privacy for my communications. OK.

171
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,100
Uh People around me can see my screen now.

172
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:09,339
This is literally my one nonconcern because I work from home.

173
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,230
-- No, no,
-- you, you work from home

174
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:13,989
but

175
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:16,029
you, you do travel every now and then

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,309
and

177
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:23,359
I, I travel a fair bit. So I got a screen protector not protector privacy filter.

178
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,260
I think they call them

179
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,269
because.

180
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,160
Right. Right.

181
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,670
And so you basically can't see my screen except if you're directly behind me,

182
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,880
which I know isn't perfect, but it doesn't.

183
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,000
Right.

184
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,579
So,

185
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,350
this is a reasonable concern, I think,

186
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,170
yeah, I've noticed on airplanes,

187
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,820
especially when people do have a good screen and even sitting next to them,

188
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:42,809
I can't see their screen.

189
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,690
So I would say that they do work because quite frankly, if somebody's like up

190
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,760
right in behind you being a creeper,

191
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,010
hopefully you'll notice.

192
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,970
No, they, they work great. It's definitely worth every penny.

193
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,589
Uh One here,

194
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,299
I'm not super clear on it says accessing blocked websites and I'm

195
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:02,700
assuming that's more for maybe people in other countries where stuff gets blocked

196
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,049
uh

197
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,260
could be,

198
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,049
I don't know. I'm gonna

199
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,070
tell

200
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,359
us

201
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,209
and then I'll click. I'm not sure because I'm not sure.

202
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,649
Oh, if you click, I'm not sure it deselects everything else.

203
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:13,200
So,

204
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,709
yeah.

205
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,420
So it's,

206
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,890
this is, this feels very,

207
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:21,269
choose your own adventure where I feel like we're going to have to go back

208
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,910
and do things again.

209
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,440
And hopefully we don't make the wrong decision and get uh you know,

210
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,149
killed in a landslide or something.

211
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,989
All right, clicking next. Finally are any of these statements? True.

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,750
Choose all that apply.

213
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,190
Number one, I would like information about being anonymous online. Yes, I would.

214
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,450
Number two, I am dealing with an urgent digital security issue. Ok.

215
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,299
I'm curious about that.

216
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:45,380
I assume that means somebody who's getting doxed, like, online or something

217
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,710
that's, or, or it could be a matter of like, like,

218
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:51,159
people know when their email gets hacked and then

219
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,799
they don't always know what to do about it.

220
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:53,840
In fact, I had,

221
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,479
I, I can't remember. It was, oh, it wasn't that long ago.

222
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:57,799
Um,

223
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,710
a neighbor calls me and it is basically telling me what's happened

224
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:03,010
and it's clear someone's taken over the computer and I said,

225
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,169
like,

226
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:08,590
just turn off the internet and turn your computer off and then I'll be over in an hour.

227
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,739
And, yeah.

228
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:13,229
So, so that, that might be good advice to, to have that option.

229
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:13,979
That's true.

230
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,909
Um, next option. I'm concerned about online harassment.

231
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,960
Yeah, I've been on the receiving end of that and it sucks.

232
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,080
I think we've given far more of that than we received

233
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:27,869
in our younger days. I will say I'm a reformed internet security bully.

234
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:32,130
So I've never been so rude that somebody got us or

235
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:35,390
that somebody sent a cease and desist letter to me.

236
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,010
That is,

237
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,030
no, that's a ridiculous bar.

238
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,979
If you have to wait till someone sends you a cease and desist,

239
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:45,140
like you're well past the point of being a giant a hole

240
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,940
anyways. Uh, I want to know more about how governments are accessing my data.

241
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,549
Uh That's a really good one because, like, remember, like, 10 years ago,

242
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,250
if somebody had brought that up like, oh the NSA and the CIA and blah, blah, blah,

243
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,450
we would have all been like, ok, crazy person go take, you know, go.

244
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:02,260
And

245
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,489
I remember when people would tell me I'm crazy when I

246
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,219
would tell them the NSA is basically listening to everything you do

247
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,469
and then snow didn't happen. It's like

248
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,630
I told you,

249
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,340
well, it's even better than that. It's not, the NSA is not listening to everything,

250
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,219
the NSA is listening to everything,

251
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,380
using a computer to transcribe it and shoving it into a database.

252
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:21,140
You know,

253
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,190
because I think part of the problem is

254
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,270
people think of old timey wiretaps where you're

255
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,359
like inherently limited by how many people you

256
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:28,559
can pay to listen to these things versus.

257
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,820
Well, actually in true lies, remember in true lies,

258
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,309
they had that scene where they're, you know,

259
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,780
the thing is automatically transcribing and printing it out and

260
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:36,760
the guy is reading it and punches a hole in something

261
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,140
and, and remember that was like crazy science fiction.

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,179
Now it's like

263
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:42,849
real.

264
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:43,700
Yeah.

265
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:48,969
Ok. Uh Fifth option I feel like I face additional risk because of who I am or what I do.

266
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,200
Ok, I like that.

267
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,229
And uh option number five is not.

268
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,219
So I think if I click that. Yeah, delux

269
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:56,500
everything. So

270
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,849
OK, there we go. Get results. Ok.

271
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:03,890
Oh I like this. Your top priority enable two factor authentication.

272
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:08,020
If that doesn't show up like for everything, no matter what you pick.

273
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,270
I don't know what else could be there.

274
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,169
Like that's a no brainer.

275
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,479
And just to warn people,

276
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,969
your action plan includes 38 tips to help you better secure your online accounts,

277
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,690
phone, browsing, computer, internet connection and connect with specialists.

278
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,099
So this

279
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,539
right? So

280
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:20,799
you

281
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,179
have,

282
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,419
how

283
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,039
many, how many did you say? 38?

284
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:29,440
38? So I clicked the, the two other options that did everything.

285
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,109
I forget what they are now even. And I have 19.

286
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:37,750
So I have a feeling the list has significant overlap.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,770
So,

288
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,729
uh so the number one is get two

289
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:43,690
factor authentication and I completely agree with that.

290
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
And, you know, people will argue like, for example,

291
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,140
phone based S MS authentication is not totally secure and it's not right.

292
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,859
People can hijack your S MS messages and they can hijack your phone and blah, blah,

293
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:53,340
blah, blah, blah.

294
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,400
But it significantly raises the bar from having to get your password of, you know,

295
00:11:57,539 --> 00:11:59,409
Mr Snuffles 2000

296
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,630
to, you know,

297
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,140
having to get that password and then hijack your phone or take off your phone or,

298
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:04,489
you know,

299
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,169
whatever this one

300
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:07,900
is,

301
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,429
if,

302
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,309
if you're using S MS as your second factor and someone comes after you,

303
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,429
it's because you were

304
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,150
specifically targeted

305
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,109
and if you're specifically targeted,

306
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,070
you're probably gonna lose no matter what you're doing.

307
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,080
And

308
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,669
that's a big difference

309
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,109
than drive by.

310
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,190
It might make a difference because with bank fraud, they will target you

311
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:34,630
but they will spend a reasonable amount of effort.

312
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,760
Only because quite frankly,

313
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,070
I'm not like you're not gonna spend 50 grand to rob

314
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,880
me because I don't have 50 grand in my bank account.

315
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:43,299
-- You know, and
-- that's fair.

316
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:47,530
I think there's, there's potentially some bars, but at the same time.

317
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:52,809
So my assumption is for like a bank, everyone has a form of two factor

318
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,150
oath.

319
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:58,140
Uh, most Canadian banks don't unless you count it. They have the secret questions

320
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,299
which are passwords, which are the same as

321
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,460
the primary form.

322
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:02,090
So, no,

323
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:06,419
actually a lot of Canadian banks don't have what I would call real to fa they have,

324
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,900
well, you have two factors but they're identical.

325
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,020
They're both passwords.

326
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,340
That's not two factor.

327
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,630
Anyway,

328
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:14,900
it has to be

329
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,130
two separate factors.

330
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,030
We

331
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,179
can,

332
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,000
we can,

333
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,250
we can revisit two factor

334
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:23,059
o another day because I know we could speak probably for

335
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,299
an,

336
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,140
we'll put

337
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:24,659
a link in the show

338
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,640
notes. There's a website. What is it two factor off

339
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:29,380
something that has a list of like all these banks

340
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,880
and online services that either do or don't enable to Eva

341
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,010
kind of how to go about enabling it, which is

342
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,049
quite useful.

343
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,280
So,

344
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,849
yeah, two factor

345
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,789
off.org

346
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,479
and it's like

347
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,450
thousands of services. It's awesome. So we'll put a

348
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:45,960
link to that.

349
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:47,669
Um

350
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:52,559
All right, I just lost the tab. There we go. So, uh now here's some stuff. Uh

351
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,780
Safeguard your online accounts.

352
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:57,890
Best practice. Learn to check suspicious emails,

353
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,640
learn how to protect

354
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,250
-- yourself from emails with harmful links and attachments, whatever
-- that,

355
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
that advice is.

356
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,049
BS.

357
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,299
Well, you can't do that

358
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,869
not reliably. Right.

359
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,349
Because at three in the morning you're going to get an email from somebody saying,

360
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,270
oh my God emergency,

361
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,590
please check the spreadsheet and you're going to be tired and you

362
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,229
think it's from your boss and you're going to open it.

363
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,859
Um, what I do here honestly is, I hope and pray that like Google's

364
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,929
email filtering catches most of it.

365
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,570
And then

366
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,239
because I have literally gotten an email from my bank in all caps back in

367
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,369
the day because they had some like

368
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,450
terminal based system that only talked capital letters

369
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,630
and I actually thought it was a phishing email because,

370
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,820
right, my bank had never emailed me before and it's all in caps and it looks all wonky

371
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:41,679
and I go into the branch and like, oh, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's legit.

372
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,280
And I'm like, oh, really?

373
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,099
You know what else I love is when a company uses some,

374
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,559
like third party domain to email you.

375
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,380
-- And it's like you can't do that
-- or better yet. They use a third party

376
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,450
service that's like, also used by a lot of other people.

377
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:57,940
You know, like,

378
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,400
it's one thing to run mailing lists on

379
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:02,150
mailchimp and announce new products and specials,

380
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:05,820
but like, don't run your, like, account recovery process through them.

381
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,320
Right. I've, I've seen stuff like that where it's like, literally,

382
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:13,080
you know, this is one of the problems I have with outsourcing,

383
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,859
uh outgoing email for services like mailing list is that,

384
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,700
um, I found a lot of them,

385
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,179
they use like a set of outgoing servers that

386
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,979
everybody uses so your reputation and stuff can suffer.

387
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:23,809
And more to the point,

388
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,539
you can't use things like sender protected framework or other, you know,

389
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:31,450
deacon to restrict who can send email because

390
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,260
a whole pile of other people can send email

391
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:36,419
unless that provider locks that down and not all of them do

392
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,010
it.

393
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,169
We're going to rattle ourselves. We can,

394
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:40,390
we

395
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:40,590
can,

396
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,099
I think we could turn everyone

397
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,739
one of these into a show.

398
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,010
Uh

399
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,150
The third one. Ok. The third one I like get a password manager.

400
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,559
Ok. So that one is my second one on my list.

401
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,539
But I agree if I was going to list like number one and number

402
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,979
22 factor off in password manager would be my number one and two,

403
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:02,219
unquestionably.

404
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:02,880
Well.

405
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,760
And even just for things like if I get hit by a bus, you know,

406
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,250
hopefully my family can get into my passwords,

407
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:09,150
you know.

408
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,200
So that's the other thing I see about password management is it's

409
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,500
not just about me managing my passwords to be more secure,

410
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,890
but it's about managing my passwords.

411
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,830
So there's actually

412
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,840
an accessible copy of them somewhere for my family.

413
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,070
Now, did you hear,

414
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,070
uh did you did you see Tavis found that

415
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,919
Windows 10 automatically installs a password manager for you.

416
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:32,630
And I guess it had a flaw that any website could

417
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,090
read any password you had stored in the password manager.

418
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:37,059
I'm not surprised.

419
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,609
This is one of those things that I have a suspicion.

420
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:44,090
Password managers will continue being crappy for another couple of years.

421
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,390
They, they're getting better and they're going to get better.

422
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,710
And, and really,

423
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,729
I think the problem is the password manager. That's a simple problem.

424
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,340
The password manager integrated with a web browser.

425
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,239
That is not a simple problem.

426
00:16:58,549 --> 00:16:59,000
Same thing.

427
00:16:59,640 --> 00:16:59,669
Yep.

428
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,900
No, absolutely. And this is actually where

429
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,699
having someone like Tavis,

430
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,618
like going to town and these people makes me happy because he's going to,

431
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,979
he's going to make them better whether they want to be or not.

432
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:13,260
And that's awesome.

433
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah,

434
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,118
I think this one's a no brainer. I don't think anyone's going to argue about it.

435
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,920
What else you got?

436
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,138
Uh, these are, uh,

437
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:27,029
get emergency support from experts and get specialized advice for high risk users.

438
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:28,609
And, um,

439
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:30,869
oh, wait, I'm

440
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:31,380
the

441
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:35,290
top two results from every category. There's more options that I skipped.

442
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,729
So we'll go through those sub options later or do you want to go through them now?

443
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,880
I don't think. Oh, you know what? Ok.

444
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,160
No, we're going to go through. So it's, uh, check your account privacy.

445
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,790
And so I guess what that's referring to is like a lot of websites, like,

446
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,660
say if you go to google.com/account, it'll, that's your account on Google.

447
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,060
Like once you've logged in and

448
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,599
they have like a security check up thing that will walk you through,

449
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,150
like where have you logged in from which applications can access your account?

450
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,329
And it's, I like that because for example, I do once in a while,

451
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:06,040
but once a year go through there and kind of clean out my,

452
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:06,910
like,

453
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,780
which computers are allowed to access that account because it changes over time.

454
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,959
You know, or I stop using a

455
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,770
machine or whatever,

456
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,189
um, or, you know,

457
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:17,310
online services that are tied into my Google Drive that I no longer use.

458
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:19,750
So I, I get rid of those so that if they get hacked, I don't.

459
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,979
But the problem there is is I have to go through, well, like, you know,

460
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,290
you'd have to go through linkedin Facebook, Google Drive,

461
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,910
like dozens of so like every social media and data storage website you use

462
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,339
and that just doesn't scale.

463
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,589
No, I, I know I, this is one of those things that I feel like

464
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,500
these, these large corporations are

465
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,099
that they're purposely taking more from you than they need

466
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:46,339
and you can dial it back

467
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,180
but you shouldn't have to

468
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:51,219
and, and normal people are never going to do this anyway.

469
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,819
My favorite example of this is Google Drive where

470
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,540
I want something to talk to my Google Drive,

471
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:58,880
but really only one folder

472
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,229
-- of stuff, not everything you can do
-- that.

473
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:03,349
Can you do that? Now?

474
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,339
I'm, I'm trying to.

475
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:07,449
-- So
-- I,

476
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,939
-- I
-- have Google Drive

477
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:14,410
but I know like for example, with, with Dropbox, I believe you can do that.

478
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,099
Ok?

479
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:15,719
Because I can't,

480
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:18,209
with Google Drive because there's a couple of services I'd really love to use.

481
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:19,140
But they're like, they just,

482
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,500
they need blanket access to my Google Drive and I'm like,

483
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:21,939
uh

484
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,420
no,

485
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,030
no.

486
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,339
Uh the second one is check your account security

487
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:28,890
and that falls into the same category as this,

488
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,910
check your account privacy, which again, I mean, they're well meaning,

489
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,130
but it would be super nice if there was like, I hate to say it,

490
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,550
if there was some standard to describe sort

491
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,609
of the account features and privacy features and then

492
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,010
maybe in my web browser or, you know,

493
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,069
something set my preferences and my web browser, for example,

494
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,640
could warn me when I go to linkedin and says, hey,

495
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,359
your account is out of sync with what you want.

496
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,770
Maybe that's OK, maybe that's not OK

497
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,359
because honestly,

498
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:55,859
I've looked through privacy features and like Twitter and linkedin and Facebook

499
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,079
and I think I've dialed them down and locked them down, but like

500
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,989
a, I'm not sure I've done it right.

501
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,400
And b every time they change something,

502
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,280
they have this tendency to reset everything.

503
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,699
Oh I hate that.

504
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,040
You know, you get that email saying we've changed our privacy settings.

505
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,400
You might want to go in and fiddle with them some more and,

506
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:15,060
you know, invariably they've wiped all the privacy protections I enabled.

507
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:15,880
Right.

508
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:18,699
No, I know. Or, or my favorite is

509
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,959
the, the Twitter app on Android.

510
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,420
I don't think it's doing it lately, but for a while there, every time they,

511
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,670
they updated the app

512
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,180
they would undo my,

513
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:31,300
quit bugging me with every freaking update that's going on on Twitter.

514
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,280
And then, you know,

515
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,479
I knew when the app was updated because it would start like doing all the crappy

516
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,250
little icons at the top and then I'd have to go back in and disable it.

517
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,869
And it's like, come on guys, you know what you're doing? This is not an accident.

518
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,640
I thought you could change those note anyways.

519
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:49,270
-- But
-- you can, well, actually what's really nice is in the newer version of Android,

520
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,910
which I'm sure.

521
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,989
I, I think I OS has had this for a while.

522
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,540
You can just like blanket block apps from doing any sort of notifications.

523
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,219
And basically,

524
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,589
and

525
00:20:57,969 --> 00:20:58,270
that

526
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,900
if, if I install an app and you give me a notification, odds are very high,

527
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,250
I'm just going to uninstall it.

528
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,839
But if it's something I kind of need, like Uber is a great example.

529
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,869
Uber loves telling me crap I don't care about. So it's like, no, you're blocked Uber.

530
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,060
If, if I need you, I'll go look,

531
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,319
I've noticed a lot of kids games,

532
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:18,969
uh, do this now, like a minion rush will randomly at like,

533
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:20,270
three in the morning and be like,

534
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,239
hello, blah, blah, blah.

535
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,959
-- And it'll, like, talk for 30 seconds to, like,
-- every game on the planet.

536
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,560
Does that when you install

537
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,069
even adult games?

538
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,719
Well, you know what it is, it's those games that want to entice you to play more

539
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,494
so they can have you buy their pretend money with real money,

540
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:35,435
buy.

541
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:37,555
Right. Whatever. I hate that crap. Anyway,

542
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:38,645
let's keep going.

543
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:40,954
Uh So the next one is get a security key.

544
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:43,925
Uh So what they mean by this is like something like a UB key or a two factor,

545
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,405
like a hardware token

546
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:47,905
for authentication. And I totally

547
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:49,645
agree with this because um

548
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:55,685
it sets the bar quite high in that you have to like come mug me for my key,

549
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:57,944
like my physical key ring in my pocket

550
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,390
at which point you can just threaten me with a gun or

551
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,579
a lead pipe and I'll probably give up whatever you want.

552
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,900
Um Secondly, they're super easy to use.

553
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,020
Now, I, I love explaining to people how to use a UB key because it consists of

554
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:10,780
you

555
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,829
uh plug it into your machine unless you got the newer one in which case,

556
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,280
just put it near your machine

557
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,790
-- and then you touch it. That's it. Like there's no step three.
-- Yep.

558
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,699
No, I know. Well, and I really like U two F for, for two factor

559
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,030
because U two F uses the web address

560
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:32,410
as part of the kind of key or I don't, it's,

561
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,709
I forget the name. Right. Right.

562
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:37,040
So basically if you're on a fishing site,

563
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,699
U two F will not work.

564
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,079
You have to be on the real website.

565
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,630
U two

566
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,479
F protects me from myself.

567
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,800
Which no, seriously.

568
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,510
And when it comes to like losing passwords,

569
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,949
I am my own worst enemy because actually this next one,

570
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,750
I do like add password alert to Chrome.

571
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,040
And what password alert is

572
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,239
every time you plug in a password to Chrome, it kind of

573
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,319
uh, it,

574
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:58,760
you know,

575
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,069
checks basically that you're not accidentally typing your password into like a

576
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,150
Google document or something

577
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,479
and like exposing it,

578
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:08,959
right. So it checks what you're typing.

579
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,819
I'm hoping it hashes it and then compares it to the hashed database, right?

580
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:13,800
So it doesn't have to like,

581
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,359
you know,

582
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,359
have access to your clear text passwords.

583
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,260
Um,

584
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:18,750
but basically, yeah, I mean,

585
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,270
and because there have been instances where I

586
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,800
cut and paste like the wrong password into something

587
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,040
and sometimes that's ok. Like if I'm logging into Google and I'm,

588
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,729
you know, accidentally log in with the wrong account, the password. Ok.

589
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,020
That doesn't matter so much.

590
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,089
But, you know, if I go to some third party service and use my Google password there,

591
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:34,140
then it's gonna be like, oh,

592
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:36,199
I need to change that right now.

593
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,839
You know, you know, this always reminds me of is, and,

594
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,579
and this is a great security lesson is

595
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,329
a million years ago, I worked at a little Linux company and for some reason,

596
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:49,619
they decided to give every workstation the same root password

597
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,160
and then they just gave that root password to everybody.

598
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,719
So we could essentially log in his root in everyone's computer.

599
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,449
And you can imagine the hilarity that ensued.

600
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,069
Right.

601
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,239
Where every morning you'd come in. It's like, I wonder what they messed up tonight

602
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,640
and, and we of course, play ridiculous practical jokes. But anyway, one time,

603
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:06,920
uh,

604
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,439
one of the developers accidentally pasted the

605
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,069
password into like the Debian channel on free

606
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,030
node and tell anyone for something like two days.

607
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,400
And also all the machines were internet connected

608
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,900
when we found out. Oh, my goodness. It was the wrath of the security goons

609
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,209
and we were really

610
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:32,709
well. Ok. No, no, here's the thing. It's, this is a double edged blade is on one side.

611
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:35,189
He was afraid to tell us because he knew we were going to do this

612
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:40,349
and by not telling us it, we made it much worse because then we were super angry.

613
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:40,849
The

614
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:42,349
whole data breach thing. Right?

615
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,390
It's the data breach thing is the, the,

616
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:46,589
the spilled can of coke on a rug.

617
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,290
Right. If I tell you I'll get in trouble.

618
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,660
If I try and cover it up with paper towels, I might get away with it.

619
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:53,800
Uh, you never get away with it.

620
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,130
That,

621
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,650
that's one of the lessons I've learned over all of my years is you never get away.

622
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,369
You might get away with it for a little while,

623
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,670
but you're never going to get away with it forever.

624
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,140
So, ok,

625
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,359
the next set of recommendations is around connect

626
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,500
to resources that can provide additional assistance.

627
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,479
Um And they are get emergency support from experts.

628
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,500
Uh get specialized advice for high risk users,

629
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,670
get help dealing with online harassment, learn more about an

630
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,939
anonymity, online

631
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,660
uh and check out transparency reports. And then if you click on the learn more,

632
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,630
for example, with online harassment,

633
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,280
you get coping with online harassment and oh

634
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,819
links to connect to specialists at online.

635
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:33,699
So ss which I assume is like some sort of

636
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:34,290
anti

637
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,300
cyber bullying thing.

638
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,459
Uh Check out a guide for staying safe online and get support from other survivors.

639
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:40,719
So that's cool. I like that.

640
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:42,630
And then, oh, tell someone, number two,

641
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,280
tell someone many forms of online harassment

642
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:45,089
can

643
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:47,479
consider reporting your issue to the police and or

644
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:49,030
someone you trust who can help keep you safe.

645
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,229
And

646
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,900
that's a perfect example, like honestly how much security advice

647
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:55,349
really boils down to tell an adult,

648
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:59,489
right? Which is the equivalent of 4911, like tell somebody who can help you.

649
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:00,010
Uh

650
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:00,579
Yeah,

651
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:03,609
you know, that's, that's generally good advice.

652
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,400
I'm always reminded of that Minecraft streamer

653
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,680
uh guy in Japan that burns his house down

654
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,520
and like at no point, does he like you see him calling 911 or whatever,

655
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,969
the Japanese equivalent of it is.

656
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:17,739
-- Right. He tries to put the fire out himself.
-- Right. Right.

657
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,339
And it got caught on video. Thank goodness.

658
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,150
And I think a lot of them anyways.

659
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,339
Um, so, yeah. No, this is good in that.

660
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:27,530
Like, that's part of the problem too is even if like,

661
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,579
if somebody started doxing me,

662
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,369
I wouldn't know what to do. I'd have to like literally Google search.

663
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,939
I am being doxed. What do I do?

664
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,739
-- No, like, because I have never dealt with that. Hopefully, I never have to.
-- I,

665
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,930
yeah, I know what you mean.

666
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:50,130
It's one of those things that I've never had to deal with, I guess at the same time,

667
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,390
this is also a reason I made a decision a long time ago to not hide who I am

668
00:26:56,739 --> 00:27:00,520
and finding various contact info on me isn't very difficult.

669
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,930
And I kind of did that with the thinking.

670
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:08,680
You can't, again, if someone is targeting you and they want to dox you, they will,

671
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:09,969
you cannot beat them.

672
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,030
And so I guess I, I kind of treated this as

673
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,310
let me help you out with that

674
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,229
and, and it's just something I don't

675
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,189
worry about very much, but it's also never really been a problem

676
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:25,339
and that works for some people for some things,

677
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,609
but for other people who maybe have a different, you know,

678
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:30,430
religious or sexual orientation or whatever

679
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,689
they, they don't have that option of being open about

680
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:32,880
it.

681
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,849
And, and you're absolutely right there is,

682
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,839
I acknowledge there are definitely reasons

683
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,500
to want a certain level of anonymity

684
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:41,260
and

685
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,660
I don't have many of them,

686
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:44,699
which

687
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,489
not that saying I'm anti

688
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:50,459
anonymity. Mind you, I think it's very important we're allowed to do that.

689
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,459
It's just I made the conscious decision to be lazy and not care.

690
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,000
So I, I like this because, you know, uh,

691
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,219
hooking people up to organizations if they're going through, this is definitely

692
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:04,560
needed because quite frankly, if somebody came to me and said I was being doxed,

693
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,810
I, I would have no idea what to do

694
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,449
or, you know, I'm being bullied online and let's face it being bullied online.

695
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,680
Oh, well, don't use Facebook. I mean, that's not,

696
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,369
you know,

697
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:15,540
that's not the most helpful of advice. Right.

698
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,270
-- You can rent my botnet and knock him off on it.
-- Right.

699
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,510
Yeah, exactly.

700
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,069
Um, you know, and I, I do worry about this because I have, you know, Children who are,

701
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,890
uh, you know, they're in grade school, you know,

702
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,449
and at some point they're going to get to junior high and high school and I assume

703
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,160
like all people that age group they're gonna be

704
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,050
with and around some people who are not so nice

705
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,089
and are bullies.

706
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,449
Uh, you know, and it's, yeah, I, I literally, this is all my,

707
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:44,170
-- to do list of things to learn about as a parent
-- sweet.

708
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,670
Now you got somewhere to start

709
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,729
this one I really like.

710
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:51,530
And, and this is one of those I know I, I harp relentlessly about.

711
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:55,290
You have to build it into the tools and expecting people

712
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,910
to be proactive and people to make their own decisions.

713
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:01,939
That is not an acceptable excuse.

714
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:02,660
In this case,

715
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,760
I think having this kind of information available

716
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,750
is quite reasonable and it is awesome.

717
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,369
So,

718
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,670
I don't even know, do they teach this in school now?

719
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,880
Because I, I think back to so in, in Alberta, there's this thing called Cal

720
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,060
10, Career and Life Management. 10 means it's

721
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,390
a, well, it's 1/10 10th grade course. Uh anyways,

722
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:21,250
and they taught us

723
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:22,199
uh

724
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,569
amongst other things like how to balance a checkbook.

725
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:28,010
And I remember thinking like this is so pointless because like the ATM tells you

726
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,969
what your balance is and it updates your like this is how old I am.

727
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,969
I actually had a passbook that I could feed into the

728
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,020
ATM and it would print on it and tell me like,

729
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,140
update your transactions.

730
00:29:36,229 --> 00:29:37,369
That was a thing

731
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:40,170
we're talking about 30 years ago.

732
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,410
How would you, how would you make sure it, it on the right line

733
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:47,119
or did I just print per page or something? This sounds like the dumb.

734
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:47,229
I

735
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:48,760
kept a record of where it was.

736
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,050
Anyways,

737
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,030
the point being is I actually had like a physical passbook

738
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,689
that showed me how much money I had in my account,

739
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,410
I remember having

740
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:54,619
little

741
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,640
books.

742
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,290
In fact, I still have one that I keep in, like,

743
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,489
the crappy little plastic checkbook they give me

744
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,790
because if I don't put it in there, the checkbook doesn't close. Right.

745
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:04,619
So I

746
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,640
leave, I never write in it, but it's always there.

747
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,770
But, yeah, so I'm, I'm hoping and assuming, you know,

748
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:14,150
courses like this in school are, are, they're covering some of this.

749
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,609
although grade 10 is a bit late.

750
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:16,660
Like by that time, you know,

751
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,699
-- you've probably had to deal with online
-- bullying already.

752
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:22,069
You know, here's the deal man is, I don't think they can

753
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,150
not because they don't want to but because the world is changing too.

754
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:28,234
I mean, so here's a great example,

755
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:29,285
let's say you were

756
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:29,564
going to

757
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:29,724
set

758
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:29,844
up.

759
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:31,944
Yes.

760
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:33,474
Ok. Yes, that is good advice

761
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:34,194
like that. But

762
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:36,285
you know, that's never how these classes work.

763
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:39,395
They get overly specific and if they made it today,

764
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:42,915
they would probably focus on Facebook and the, the youth today.

765
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,234
All the young people I know

766
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:47,449
Snapchat man, they love Snapchat.

767
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,140
And so you could focus on Facebook all day long when the reality is,

768
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,300
most of the young people aren't getting harassed on Facebook,

769
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,959
they're getting harassed on Snapchat,

770
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,579
right?

771
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:56,680
Yep.

772
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,250
You gotta love it. However, like you said, like, tell an adult talk to people,

773
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:03,910
like for example, it's not

774
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,660
really appropriate for randos to ask you for naked photos or photos of your drunk.

775
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,189
You would

776
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:15,180
and sending that to them, you may really regret it. Actually,

777
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,910
you've, you've put a thought into my mind, not because of that comment.

778
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:19,589
Uh

779
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,939
but that, that also added some thoughts. But anyway, the point being uh

780
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,189
telling like young people, for example,

781
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:28,770
it's OK to ask for help about this stuff is

782
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,660
similar to the many of the other problems of,

783
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,989
many people don't know who to ask.

784
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,270
They don't have anyone in a lot of cases because let's face it.

785
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,540
The world isn't teeming with security professionals

786
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,589
but like when they do know them

787
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,349
and this is true of saying an organization that has a real security team.

788
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,319
Uh A lot of people don't ask for help because they're

789
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:49,089
afraid to or they don't feel safe and let's face it.

790
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,339
This is the same with young people. If they don't feel safe, they don't ask for help.

791
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:53,969
This is

792
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,209
the

793
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:54,599
same

794
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:59,489
deeply personal embarrassing, right? Like I sent my photos to who I thought was

795
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,630
whatever, right?

796
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,150
Um

797
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,270
You know, this reminds me of two. I remember there was a long time ago,

798
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:07,819
I was uh

799
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:11,670
I was a Cis Edmund at a small company and

800
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,260
there was this 11 of the employees, the Cis Edmunds,

801
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:19,130
there were like four or five of us we really got along well with, with this one lady

802
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,239
and

803
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,780
I forget what it was, but one day she comes in and it's like,

804
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,219
is there something wrong with the email.

805
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:27,800
And we said, what do you mean? She said, I don't think some of my mails went through.

806
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,869
We said, oh, do you mean the one where you mailed out your resume?

807
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:32,410
And she got like white as a ghost?

808
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,300
Like, wait, we made that up. Are you leaving?

809
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,260
She really did. She was mailing out resumes from work email.

810
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,400
We're like, all right, number one,

811
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:42,589
we're gonna sit down and teach you how to not

812
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:45,290
screw this up because do not do this from work.

813
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,020
And of course, like, you know,

814
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,790
we were good sports about it all and we helped her learn how to, like,

815
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,189
she set up a Gmail account.

816
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,479
Well, I don't think gmail existed back then but you get the, you,

817
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:55,959
you get the idea like we set her up, we're like, this is what you need to do.

818
00:32:55,969 --> 00:32:58,640
Do not use work email for this and we're not going

819
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,160
to tell anyone what we just learned because we're nice people.

820
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:04,239
But, yeah. Yeah, it was,

821
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:07,060
oh, you gotta love it.

822
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:07,920
Yeah.

823
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:13,119
So moving along next area is keep your phone's data secure. And, and

824
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,790
I think this is something that's really

825
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,739
underappreciated because for a lot of people,

826
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,310
especially young people now that the phone is their computer

827
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,329
straight up. Right?

828
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:22,599
A

829
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,170
lot of people, like

830
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,530
my kids have tablets and it's funny because my one son calls the, um, the ipods, um,

831
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,410
baby ipads or he calls them iphones.

832
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,920
But he doesn't make a distinction.

833
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,099
And, you know, I, I don't think that they'll necessarily ever have, like, a laptop.

834
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:40,170
Like I had one where, you know, I loved it and cherished it.

835
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,130
They'll probably have a phone that is more powerful than my laptop.

836
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,449
Ignoring your kids.

837
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:50,300
If, if you gave me a choice of, of losing my phone or my laptop, take the laptop

838
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,530
in a second.

839
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:56,609
Yeah, I would put the laptop in the garbage disposal myself. If, if I had to, to keep my

840
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:56,760
phone,

841
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,459
like I would cheerfully sacrifice it.

842
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,290
So, what's the

843
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,699
advice?

844
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:06,680
-- So
-- number one is text and call privately with signal which, um, I, I, well,

845
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:08,409
we actually use it and actually,

846
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:12,070
I think a lot of people in the security industry use signal now because, well,

847
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,610
two reasons, one is secure and two, it's actually really easy to use it.

848
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,580
Actually, I, I've started using it with a bunch of nonsecurity people. I know

849
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,790
because I found in

850
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,780
it, it seems like I don't know why this is, but as of late,

851
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,320
I feel like sending text messages has become less reliable than it used to be.

852
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,938
And, and for some reason, certain people,

853
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,629
I interact with the text messages just aren't getting to

854
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,550
where they should be going for some reason or another.

855
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,040
Maybe,

856
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:37,600
maybe

857
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,060
I'm being spied on, I don't know.

858
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:39,969
But whatever,

859
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,929
uh, you,

860
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,188
you, I'll tell him, I say just download signal and put it on your,

861
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,728
your phone and then I'll use that to contact you and, and signals.

862
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:50,649
Even I really like signal because it also has the two little checkmarks.

863
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:53,050
So for example, I know if they got the message.

864
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:53,860
Yeah.

865
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,310
And so the one thing I love about signal and the one thing

866
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,189
I hate about signal is that it relies on your phone number,

867
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,949
which let's face it, your phone number,

868
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:04,030
especially now that we have number portability in most of the world,

869
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:06,310
your phone number is your

870
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,340
identity. Really? That's the best, you know, that's kind of the best way to,

871
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:10,989
you know,

872
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,780
push a text message to you to prove that you are who you are sort of claiming to be,

873
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,739
you know, online

874
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,750
uh and to hook up something like a hardware token to

875
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,189
your account or whatever.

876
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,929
Um And on the flip side, I hate, you know,

877
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:26,489
because I don't like giving up my phone number because, you know, if

878
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,729
somebody calls me at three in the morning accidentally wakes me up,

879
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:29,709
that's really annoying.

880
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,699
-- Um
-- That's why I just don't leave my phone near me at night.

881
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,520
-- Yeah.
-- Well, unfortunately I have kids so I have to, you know, and they don't

882
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:38,669
anyways.

883
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,909
Um, that's not an option for everybody.

884
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,030
Um,

885
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,370
number two here uh is protect your iphone's data with

886
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:48,530
encryption and what I especially love about that is it's basically

887
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,790
the default

888
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,179
and it just works.

889
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:55,199
Yeah. Apple's done a nice job with that and they keep it safe.

890
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:59,800
Yeah. And then the, just below that is protect your android data with encryption.

891
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,020
And,

892
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,040
sadly, I have no idea how that works and I'm assuming it's not the default

893
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,050
or is it?

894
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,469
I don't, I think you have to turn it on.

895
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:11,399
I don't, it might be default in some of the new phones.

896
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:13,229
Maybe the new Google phones, almost.

897
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,399
Certainly not like your, your $100 phone you're buying

898
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,310
from, from whoever.

899
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,260
Yeah, it's good advice though. I'm

900
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,909
uh uh yeah,

901
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:23,739
I buy it.

902
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,629
What else you got? Yeah.

903
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:30,100
And then the next one I'm gonna roll up again is protect or back up your iphone's data

904
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,780
and

905
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,820
also, you know, use Android's Google account backup. Yeah, for the love of God.

906
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,459
Back up your data, especially your account data

907
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:40,139
because I, I have been in the Apple store once or twice, you know,

908
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:42,659
like one time my ipad did something funky and

909
00:36:42,669 --> 00:36:44,879
turns out it just literally needed like a hard,

910
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:46,030
hard factory reset,

911
00:36:46,129 --> 00:36:47,469
which they wouldn't tell me how to do over the

912
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,709
phone and I forgot that you can Google it.

913
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:53,570
So I took it in thinking it was like hardware messed up. Did they charge you for this?

914
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,919
No, it's free. Ok. Ok. Anyways.

915
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:58,429
And so I'm sitting at the table, you know, I made an appointment, I'm sitting there,

916
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:59,629
I'm there like 10 minutes early

917
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,010
and there's this lady there

918
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,159
and so the guy has to reset like, hard, hard reset my ipad and he's like,

919
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:05,870
have you backed it up?

920
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:06,520
And I'm like, yeah,

921
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:09,939
like, when did you back it up last time, like, last night before, you know,

922
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:10,989
I brought it in or whatever?

923
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,320
He's like, ok, great. You know,

924
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:15,270
and this lady crossed the, the table is like, wait, how do you back it up?

925
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,800
And I'm like, uh, you

926
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:18,840
log into icloud and,

927
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,250
yeah. No, there's no step to

928
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,360
and she

929
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:26,639
had no idea and she had not backed up her ipad and that they

930
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:29,080
were trying to back up her ipad before they had to hard reset it,

931
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:29,469
right?

932
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,449
Because let's face it.

933
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:35,570
99% of tablet and phone problems are solved by turn it off and on or turn it off,

934
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,070
like with a hard reset and then turn it back on and refresh it.

935
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,169
Um, like, literally unless hardware is broken, that's, that will fix it. So,

936
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:46,389
yeah, I mean, she was just amazed at how

937
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,639
you could just back up your device so easily.

938
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:50,760
And I was like, and, and my first thought was like,

939
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,429
yeah, yeah. How did you not do that? But um

940
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,929
that's one thing I am glad to see is, and,

941
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:58,830
and that's another thing where I think laptops and

942
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,129
desktops have really fallen down is like by default,

943
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:04,570
backing up a desktop or a laptop is much more difficult than backing up a phone

944
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:05,689
in

945
00:38:06,129 --> 00:38:06,489
general.

946
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:06,820
I mean,

947
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,340
unless you have like a Mac and you just

948
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,620
log into icloud and it backs it up automatically

949
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,620
assuming you purchase enough free space, right?

950
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:14,370
By default, you get five gigs, which

951
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,729
is nowhere near enough for anybody nowadays.

952
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,360
And I feel like this is,

953
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:24,149
this is again one of those instances where telling people to do it isn't effective.

954
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,739
They just need tools to make it.

955
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:27,350
You need to make it,

956
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,030
you basically need to make it

957
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,929
not necessarily on by default,

958
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:35,570
but like you get prompted by default and it needs to be one or

959
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,719
I would say less steps to enable it

960
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:38,689
basically,

961
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:40,899
right?

962
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,939
Um And that's one thing I do like is that Apple has made

963
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:48,070
the the icloud experience kind of this cohesive whole

964
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,620
where I want to log into my icloud account regardless of the backups because it does,

965
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:55,540
for example, my contacts and everything get synced, you know, I get

966
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,780
my key chain synced. I get like all these actual benefits

967
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:04,050
that make my life easier, let alone the backups which I do really appreciate,

968
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,350
you know, when a device dies or when I buy a new device and literally the

969
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:10,199
you log in and then an hour later it's your device.

970
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:12,310
I know, I know we got to keep moving man.

971
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:15,500
So the next one I'll roll up again is track and protect

972
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,560
your Apple device and track and protect a lost or stolen Android.

973
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:18,719
And

974
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:19,840
um

975
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,760
again, these are, I know in the I OS world this is, you know, you enable,

976
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,919
find my iphone, uh, which is not enabled by default, but again, it's like one step.

977
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,000
Um,

978
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:30,020
and then,

979
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,179
uh what I especially like is you can't disable it without putting your password in.

980
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:35,510
So it's not like somebody can steal your device and just disable that.

981
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,729
-- Right. They'd have to have your passcode or whatever or, you know, your
-- thumb.

982
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,949
Well, I, I would envision this is less about

983
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,929
theft and more about, uh, I've, I've lost my phone

984
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,250
and I don't know where I left it and it's like, yeah,

985
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,510
-- it's at the grocery store and then you go that
-- ping function

986
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,510
where you can tell an iphone or whatever to make a ping noise

987
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,310
because one time my son helpful, you know, put an ipad away in a sock drawer.

988
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:00,939
Right.

989
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:01,300
And we just,

990
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,830
for the life of us we're looking at all the

991
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,199
usual places like in the couch and stuff and,

992
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:08,780
ok, you know, it's not working. Uh, it's still online. It still got lots of battery.

993
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,570
Thank goodness.

994
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,860
So, like start making it ping and it's like everybody should be quiet.

995
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,149
Right.

996
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:16,969
And you're like, slowly moving around the house trying to listen for this ping

997
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,919
-- noise. You know. That's
-- great.

998
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:20,870
All right. What else? Let's keep going.

999
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,389
-- Uh,
-- well, then that's basically

1000
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:22,590
it.

1001
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,790
That's it. That's it.

1002
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,110
-- That's
-- it. That's, I'm at the end of the list, uh, done with these.

1003
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,709
You could also better secure your browsing computer and internet connection.

1004
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,870
Ah, now there's a second set of stuff

1005
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,429
so browse more securely

1006
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,629
learn to spot a suspicious website. And that one

1007
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:39,100
annoys me a bit because,

1008
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,139
uh, well, some of it's simple, like paypal

1009
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,120
one.com

1010
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,600
or not having http si get that. But

1011
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,479
the problem is like, let's face it.

1012
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,629
Like with, let's encrypt,

1013
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:52,479
anybody can get an SSL C or a TLS certificate now for their website.

1014
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:55,679
Um, and trying to explain to people, you know,

1015
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:59,649
domain validation versus extended verification versus what's the third one?

1016
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:00,629
DVEV?

1017
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,580
I can't remember.

1018
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:05,679
So that's proof that it's kind of a pain in the butt to explain.

1019
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,290
It's, I agree again, this is where tools

1020
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:10,770
and I guess funny enough, uh,

1021
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,479
suspicious websites are less dangerous if you have a password manager

1022
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,540
that uses the URL and you're using U two F,

1023
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,219
if you put those two things together,

1024
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:24,340
you're going to cover like 99%.

1025
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:25,320
Yeah.

1026
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:26,820
Every single phishing,

1027
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,060
email and text spam phishing thing I've

1028
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,760
gotten goes to some website that's been compromised

1029
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:33,639
and is like

1030
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,679
the thing in Canada is the interact where there's like, oh,

1031
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:39,909
you have like a $27 refund from like a phone company

1032
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,469
because statistically like,

1033
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,639
that's like 30% of Canadians probably use that

1034
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:45,000
phone company because we don't have many.

1035
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:46,330
And so, you know,

1036
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,500
they go and they plug in their account details and their intact stuff, which is like,

1037
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,570
you know, that's a huge step forward to ripping somebody off bank wise,

1038
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,290
you know.

1039
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,610
Um, and one thing that helps there is, is some of the, uh,

1040
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,060
providers are better and when I say providers, I mean,

1041
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,050
like the credit card and debit card providers,

1042
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,469
some of them are pretty good and

1043
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:07,699
aggressive about shutting down these compromised websites,

1044
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:09,659
you know, talking to the provider and being like, hey, there's,

1045
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:13,389
you know, you have a compromised wordpress site serving out fishing blah, blah,

1046
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:14,510
blah, please.

1047
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,169
For the love of God, turn it off before anybody uses it, you know.

1048
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,659
Um, and that's, that's a pretty big thing now for some of these larger providers, um,

1049
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:24,659
of course, there's no way to know how well they are doing at this.

1050
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,179
So the next one is, uh, you'll love this, stop prying eyes with a privacy screen.

1051
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:28,929
So that's one of those uh,

1052
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:31,969
polarized filters that you put on your laptop. So

1053
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,939
you have to be like right in front of it to see the screen. And

1054
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,580
yeah, as we discussed previously, hopefully,

1055
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,659
then if somebody is like putting their head on your shoulder to stare at your screen,

1056
00:42:40,669 --> 00:42:41,520
you'll notice that.

1057
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,520
Right.

1058
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:43,620
Right.

1059
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,100
Um The next one.

1060
00:42:46,379 --> 00:42:50,560
So prevent tracking with privacy badger, uh privacy badger is a,

1061
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,679
an add on from the eff the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

1062
00:42:53,689 --> 00:42:54,120
Uh

1063
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,120
I like it

1064
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,360
but I have had it break one or two websites,

1065
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,040
uh, in a way that's

1066
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:02,469
painful to figure out because

1067
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,600
uh, like a lot of stuff on websites.

1068
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,439
Now you'll like,

1069
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,610
click a website and you get cycled through three or four year old

1070
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,959
very quickly before it kind of like logs you in or whatever.

1071
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,610
And it had privacy badger break that and to kind

1072
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,610
of unwind and figure out where it was breaking,

1073
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,120
took a little bit of effort.

1074
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,270
Um, now having said that

1075
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,270
it doesn't break too many websites.

1076
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,850
-- So I would say in general, the cure is still a lot better than
-- not only

1077
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:26,469
the, I know

1078
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:31,189
I've used privacy badger a little bit and you can easily disable it

1079
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:32,830
for certain sites.

1080
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,300
So if there is a site that it's super wonky with, you can just turn it off.

1081
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,709
However, I will say in nearly every instance,

1082
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,629
the sites it didn't actually work with,

1083
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,370
I didn't want to use it for real anyway because it's like, yeah,

1084
00:43:44,379 --> 00:43:47,129
I'm not going to this dodgy site after all.

1085
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:48,110
Yeah.

1086
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:48,709
No, I remember,

1087
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,909
I specifically had one website where the login went through sort

1088
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:54,610
of a third party website that it blocked and it broke

1089
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:57,250
inappropriately. And like I said, it was a pain to find out.

1090
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,639
But literally that was the only instance of a problem I've had with it

1091
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:04,570
and I've been using privacy badger basically since about a week after it came out

1092
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:06,520
in a few years now, I think.

1093
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:07,110
Yeah.

1094
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,860
Well, it, it works and it's minimally false positive and, and intrusive, you know,

1095
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:12,699
which is nice

1096
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,620
you know, it's like all these people that say use no script.

1097
00:44:15,629 --> 00:44:18,370
I just wanna like gouge my eyes out because using no script

1098
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:20,379
on a web browser in the modern role is so painful.

1099
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,459
-- I
-- I so want to use it but yeah, I I give up every time.

1100
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,189
Alright. What else?

1101
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,110
Yeah.

1102
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:31,659
Uh So the next one is install HTTP S everywhere.

1103
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,739
And again, that is a, I believe it's also eff did that one.

1104
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:38,729
Uh But anyways, it's a little extension that basically

1105
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,219
if a site has an HTTP S

1106
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:45,080
version, it'll like force your browser to use that. So it's kind of like

1107
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,620
using uh the HSTS Secure.

1108
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,239
It basically kind of implements HSTS security

1109
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,439
headers without the server actually implementing them.

1110
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,189
Um And so the nice thing is because like, for example, a lot of banks will have a

1111
00:44:57,669 --> 00:44:59,909
non secure and a secure website because they want to

1112
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:02,229
support older browsers or people who are not so savvy

1113
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,949
and just turning off HT TT P and you know,

1114
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:07,739
using HSTS and preload and all that would break

1115
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,649
everybody using windows XP or whatever, for example, you know,

1116
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:12,939
so all the grannies would not be able to bank online.

1117
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,250
Um

1118
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:18,550
And so yeah, this basically gives you the best of both worlds. Uh

1119
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:20,709
Yeah. Um

1120
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,030
Moving along, we have installed the Tor

1121
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:26,879
browser now this now we're getting to the part where well, no, no, no.

1122
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,760
Like because we clicked all the options, remember.

1123
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:30,760
So I'm assuming normal people don't get this.

1124
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:34,639
Um And so I'm assuming this is more, for example, with, you know,

1125
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,320
dealing with blocked websites,

1126
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,719
right? Because didn't you click an option?

1127
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:43,510
That was something about, uh avoiding censorship or what was it?

1128
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,899
I don't remember what it was called even.

1129
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:46,239
Yeah, basically.

1130
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:47,100
Um,

1131
00:45:47,229 --> 00:45:50,520
now in fairness, the Tor browser is really, I've,

1132
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,620
I've tried it and it literally as you download it,

1133
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:52,820
it,

1134
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,870
it is easy. I guess my, my concern with

1135
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,340
Tor always is

1136
00:45:58,669 --> 00:46:02,739
most people don't know what to r really is. They think it's magic.

1137
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,830
And in fact, I, I found a link uh last week,

1138
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,550
I think it was someone put a link up on Twitter where someone running a Tor

1139
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:09,580
exit node

1140
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:14,129
was sniffing plain text credentials and they had like a Twitch live stream.

1141
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,360
-- This is a live stream.
-- You

1142
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:17,709
watch

1143
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,560
them in real time and it's like

1144
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,679
people don't realize that

1145
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,189
Tor isn't magic encryption. It's just kind of,

1146
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,189
it makes it

1147
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:30,709
if you do it right, it makes it harder to track you if you do it wrong, it makes it much,

1148
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:31,629
much easier.

1149
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,449
I remember there was a bunch of Tor

1150
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,510
exit nodes that were doing things like for example,

1151
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,899
blocking port 443 but allowing port 80

1152
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:39,320
or you know,

1153
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,629
they were blocking the encrypted versions of protocols

1154
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:44,479
and allowing the non encrypted versions of protocols.

1155
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,000
Right.

1156
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,270
Now, the good news there is again, a lot of these major websites have,

1157
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:51,699
you know, gone to HTTP S and with something like HTTP S

1158
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,020
everywhere, you know,

1159
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:53,679
you,

1160
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,219
it wouldn't be as much of a problem.

1161
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,850
Um, but yeah, I would say in general, the, the main use case kind of for Tor

1162
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,469
is, yeah, you want to browse stuff and it's either blocked or you really, really,

1163
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:03,030
really,

1164
00:47:03,189 --> 00:47:05,290
you have like a hostile network or a nation state.

1165
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:05,600
Here's

1166
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,149
what I'm going to say to this.

1167
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:12,229
If you are say at the library and want to look at, I don't know, let's say Craigslist,

1168
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:13,739
assuming maybe that's blocked.

1169
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,110
OK. Tor browser,

1170
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,129
if you are trying to evade a nation state spying on you,

1171
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:23,250
uh you need to educate yourself and if you're relying on this website to,

1172
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,639
to give you advice, you're probably going to go to jail.

1173
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:28,330
That's

1174
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:35,219
uh well, it actually, I mean, it does talk about how the Tor browser is not AAA

1175
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,270
be all end, all

1176
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,070
right.

1177
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,050
Like it does talk about some of the downside, well,

1178
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,580
not downsides but the limitations.

1179
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:41,659
I mean,

1180
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:44,139
if you click on the learn more.

1181
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,149
Yeah.

1182
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:46,070
Uh

1183
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:47,729
So anyway, it's moving along.

1184
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:50,439
The next one is I like this install Chrome or

1185
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,590
-- Firefox.
-- I'll agree with that 100. Although

1186
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,179
this is one of those things too that, that kind of

1187
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,560
Firefox just had the incident where the Mr robot people paid them to put, you know,

1188
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,659
essentially spyware into the browser.

1189
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:03,469
And, and I mean, Chrome,

1190
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:07,979
I love Google for, for certain reasons.

1191
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:11,500
But let's face it guys at the end of the day, chrome is funded by

1192
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,139
internet advertising,

1193
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:14,260
right?

1194
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:15,219
It, it is

1195
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:16,610
probably,

1196
00:48:17,149 --> 00:48:18,439
well, so is Firefox?

1197
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:23,840
-- Firefox is
-- si mean, realistically, Firefox gets a big check from, you know,

1198
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,129
being Google the default.

1199
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:26,659
Yes,

1200
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:27,939
that's, that's fair.

1201
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:32,649
It's, it's one of those things that I, I think chrome is still on, on the side of good,

1202
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,020
but I'm always

1203
00:48:34,689 --> 00:48:39,030
ii I keep an eye on things because I, I have a feeling

1204
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:44,149
there these browsers walk the edge of a knife and now I will say also Google,

1205
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:44,790
not Google,

1206
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,030
Firefox, Mozilla,

1207
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:50,659
they did the right thing and undid their, their silly

1208
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:52,750
Mr robot thing.

1209
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,429
So that's good at least.

1210
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:58,060
But this is kind of one of those things we need to be eternally vigilant.

1211
00:48:58,739 --> 00:48:58,850
Yeah.

1212
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,409
Well, and what always gets me is when these cases do come to light,

1213
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:03,189
usually it's something really stupid and like,

1214
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,209
yeah, it's like that Mr robot thing.

1215
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:09,169
It was what it was replacing keywords or making it search or some,

1216
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,610
some ridiculous thing

1217
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,649
to do with the TV. Show to try and

1218
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,449
advertise it, I guess. I don't know.

1219
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:16,520
Um

1220
00:49:17,149 --> 00:49:17,979
moving along.

1221
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:22,500
So the next 10 I like this. Uh So they're labeled as a built in option.

1222
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,750
Uh oh I didn't notice. So on top of these tips, they have things like advanced or

1223
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,030
uh quick and easy. So like install Chrome or Firefox is quick and easy. But like,

1224
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:35,360
you know, using the Tor browser is labeled as advanced.

1225
00:49:35,669 --> 00:49:38,489
Um This one I like these are labeled as a built in option.

1226
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,929
So it's, it's using the data encryption in, in

1227
00:49:42,209 --> 00:49:42,590
uh

1228
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,360
Mac Os and Windows to encrypt your data, right?

1229
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:48,320
Uh And again, yeah, I would just

1230
00:49:48,709 --> 00:49:53,479
uh back in the day when you know CP US didn't have like built in encryption support.

1231
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:56,199
Yeah. No, this was a nightmare. It made it so slow.

1232
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:58,860
Uh Nowadays, you know, every intel and a MD,

1233
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,120
whatever CPU has built in AES encryption.

1234
00:50:01,129 --> 00:50:03,169
So when you enable disc encryption,

1235
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,790
there's literally no

1236
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:05,270
performance.

1237
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:05,600
It's,

1238
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,129
but, but again, I guess

1239
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,520
this is one of those instances where

1240
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:14,449
uh tablets and phones I think are, are offering a vastly superior

1241
00:50:15,129 --> 00:50:17,229
uh kind of just environment.

1242
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:17,979
Yeah.

1243
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:19,520
Um And the biggest thing for me,

1244
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,780
the reason I use data encryption is two reasons actually is number one obviously.

1245
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,469
So my, my data doesn't go walk about if somebody steals my laptop.

1246
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,969
The other big thing is, is to deny use of that laptop. If somebody steals it.

1247
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:29,949
Because you know,

1248
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,790
think about this, if every single device that got stolen wasn't usable, then

1249
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,360
you know, there would be no resale market for these things and that would be great.

1250
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,750
So I actually have a secret option three

1251
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,399
is when I'm getting rid of hardware

1252
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,800
and you have an encrypted disk, you only have to wipe the,

1253
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:49,360
the first bits of disk because that's where the keys live,

1254
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:50,010
right?

1255
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:50,409
And then

1256
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,879
basically the rest of the disk is essentially

1257
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:55,560
random if the key is no longer available.

1258
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,870
Well, and I wrote about this 17 years ago,

1259
00:50:57,879 --> 00:51:00,879
I did a presentation on why data deletion is not data deletion.

1260
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:04,120
And and for example, a great example is, you know, hard drives, remap bad sectors.

1261
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:06,340
So if you'd written plain text to bad sectors,

1262
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,389
your hard drive might be like, oh, it'll be on the safe side.

1263
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,969
I'm not going to let you touch that sector but you know,

1264
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:11,909
data recovery software easily can,

1265
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:14,959
well, in like S sds basically can't be wiped.

1266
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:16,510
I mean, let's face it.

1267
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:17,270
Yeah,

1268
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,540
exac well, not reliably

1269
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,260
because you can't actually like,

1270
00:51:21,439 --> 00:51:21,889
yeah.

1271
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:23,040
Um

1272
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:26,719
yeah, so it's, it's better just and realistically, like I said,

1273
00:51:26,729 --> 00:51:29,540
from a performance point of view, there's just, there's no excuse not to,

1274
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,159
not to encrypt everything everywhere.

1275
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:32,479
Now at rest,

1276
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,919
um I get key management. It's not always easy but

1277
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,080
sorry folks. That's how it is.

1278
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:41,020
Um The next one I do like is use Microsoft free Antivirus.

1279
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:45,229
-- And when I have had Windows, uh I believe yes, it was introduced
-- when I

1280
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:46,100
say

1281
00:51:46,379 --> 00:51:50,340
-- I've got a handful of Windows, I think, I
-- think for sure it was in Windows.

1282
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,750
Defender was in Windows seven anyways, it's in Windows 10. Now

1283
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,149
their antivirus, I will say two things about it

1284
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:57,010
almost never breaks the system

1285
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,719
which a lot of Antivirus does occasionally, you know, like,

1286
00:52:01,149 --> 00:52:05,179
takes out some poor accounting package or just you reboot and you, you're hooped.

1287
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:08,629
And number two is it's lightweight enough that it doesn't, like,

1288
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,060
mess up all your performance.

1289
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,620
Which again, a lot of antivirus software makes machines.

1290
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,659
Most antivirus software is terrible.

1291
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:18,340
-- And I've been running
-- well and then you look at, like, um,

1292
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:19,310
again

1293
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:19,739
or

1294
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:22,239
-- in research into antivirus software
-- and it

1295
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:24,600
is not,

1296
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:29,899
they're no better. But I guess the one thing I like is it's, it's free.

1297
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:34,419
Right? Why am I going to pay for crappy software when I can get it for free?

1298
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:36,760
Yeah.

1299
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:37,719
Yeah.

1300
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:40,179
Um, so the next one is, is a classic backup,

1301
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,270
your Mac and back up your Windows computer and in

1302
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,469
fairness backing up a Windows computer is a lot easier.

1303
00:52:44,479 --> 00:52:44,800
Now,

1304
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:45,760
um,

1305
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:48,929
-- you need an external hard drive or something, plug it in and pretty
-- much

1306
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:49,979
just with the tablet

1307
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:50,729
through it.

1308
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,479
I mean, it's a no brainer.

1309
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:53,800
Yeah.

1310
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:55,510
Yeah. Uh,

1311
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,760
well, but the thing to remember too is, I mean,

1312
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,919
part of the problem is having off site backups

1313
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,010
because for example, like, you can back up all

1314
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,300
the laptops you want,

1315
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,449
but if your house burns down and all your backup hard

1316
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:08,540
drives and laptops are in the house when it burns down,

1317
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:12,770
you know, you're absolutely, you're done. Use the cloud.

1318
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:17,129
And so that's one thing where I do, like, a lot of the, like, file services,

1319
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:18,729
like Dropbox and stuff where you can keep,

1320
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,129
again, it goes,

1321
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:23,929
it's kind of more of a feature like keeping files in sync with that is super useful.

1322
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,320
But then by virtue of having your files in sync, you having them in the cloud,

1323
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,419
you know, you now have an off site backup of your stuff.

1324
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:30,070
All

1325
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:30,330
right,

1326
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:31,209
let's keep going.

1327
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:31,889
Um

1328
00:53:32,439 --> 00:53:32,830
Yeah.

1329
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,060
Uh The next one of course is update your Windows software and update your Mac.

1330
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,070
Now, having said that I just recently finally factory wiped some,

1331
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,000
I bought some Windows 10 tablets that were super cheap

1332
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:45,629
and I got rid of them for the simple reason is that I was spending 1 to 3 hours a week,

1333
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:46,439
updating them,

1334
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,600
the antivirus and the Os and everything and they were just,

1335
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,399
the update was so painful and these tablets were so limited that

1336
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:57,040
yeah, I ended up factory wiping them so that I can give them away to charity.

1337
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:57,879
Um,

1338
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,600
and even Mac, I find is now, like,

1339
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,320
not as great as it used to be.

1340
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,120
Some of these updates are pretty horrifically large and I mean,

1341
00:54:06,129 --> 00:54:07,750
Microsoft office is a great example.

1342
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,520
Right. It's on average every month now. It's over 500 megabytes of updates.

1343
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:15,429
So if you're not on high speed internet, I don't know what you're going to do.

1344
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:15,840
Right.

1345
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,080
Like straight up, if you're on dial up, you can't update 500 megabytes.

1346
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,669
I know. Actually

1347
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,209
I did,

1348
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,969
I wrote a blog post some time ago.

1349
00:54:24,979 --> 00:54:30,250
Where I like used uh uh firewall to artificially lower my speeds

1350
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:32,510
and the internet is unusable at dial up.

1351
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:32,699
I'm,

1352
00:54:32,709 --> 00:54:35,969
I'm comfortable saying that it is unusable near the

1353
00:54:35,979 --> 00:54:38,330
only website that was almost usable is Amazon.

1354
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:42,290
And they do some clever things where the first time you go there, it'll be really,

1355
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,330
really, really slow

1356
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,929
and then they purposely serve content in a way that makes it very, very fast

1357
00:54:49,149 --> 00:54:50,719
after the first uh,

1358
00:54:50,899 --> 00:54:53,939
visit anyway. Anyway, let's keep going. Yeah, we get

1359
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:54,949
it.

1360
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:59,590
Ok. So moving along now we have secure your internet connection and,

1361
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,750
uh, the first one is use a VPN.

1362
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:06,360
Uh, again, this is like if you're dealing with blocked content or,

1363
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:08,760
and one thing to keep in mind with blocked content, for example,

1364
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:11,429
if you're on a corporate computer and they have content blocking

1365
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,120
-- and you bypass it,
-- there's

1366
00:55:13,649 --> 00:55:13,659
a

1367
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,540
chance they have like three things spying on you at the

1368
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:19,100
same time and so you're not going to evade them.

1369
00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:21,800
Yeah.

1370
00:55:21,979 --> 00:55:24,270
So, I mean, using a VPN, um,

1371
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:25,810
well,

1372
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:29,840
you know, sad to say actually with the repeal of net neutrality in the US last week,

1373
00:55:30,129 --> 00:55:33,090
using a VPN might become a much more popular thing

1374
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,419
because if I SPS start throttling certain types of traffic,

1375
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:36,669
like

1376
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:40,669
competitors voice services or online gaming or whatever, or Netflix,

1377
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,500
you know, unless they then start throttling the hands which

1378
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,219
there's some of them that are definitely evil enough to do that.

1379
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:48,199
Um,

1380
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,669
you know, and give you the whole, like, oh,

1381
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:53,159
you should upgrade to a business connection if you want a VPN.

1382
00:55:53,379 --> 00:55:53,939
Um,

1383
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,350
the nice thing about most VPN S is, is that

1384
00:55:57,989 --> 00:55:59,520
if you start blocking VPN S,

1385
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,610
you're going to annoy a lot of business

1386
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,679
customers which they generally want to avoid.

1387
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:03,530
Um,

1388
00:56:03,699 --> 00:56:05,550
so, yeah, I mean,

1389
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,370
using a VPN you're going to be paying about five or 10 bucks a month for a VPN service.

1390
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,489
Um,

1391
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:15,179
but yeah, there's definitely, uh, a valid use case for it now, especially in the US,

1392
00:56:15,189 --> 00:56:16,510
with the repeal of net neutrality.

1393
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,050
Luckily, I live in Canada where it's enshrined in law

1394
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:20,729
that we have net neutrality, uh,

1395
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:22,239
along with a lot of the world.

1396
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:24,860
Um,

1397
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:27,020
next one is I've never even heard of use glass

1398
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,399
wire for windows and it's a firewall program for windows

1399
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:32,260
and then enable your Mac firewall. And I would,

1400
00:56:32,939 --> 00:56:34,350
I honestly thought Mac Os,

1401
00:56:34,469 --> 00:56:34,550
that's

1402
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,090
crazy by default.

1403
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,080
So, if it's not enabled by default, shame

1404
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:38,770
that

1405
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:41,060
because I just got a Mac,

1406
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,100
uh,

1407
00:56:42,389 --> 00:56:43,679
about a year ago

1408
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:45,350
for, for work.

1409
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,020
And yeah, I,

1410
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,800
I was poking around at the security settings and the firewall is not on by default,

1411
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:54,379
which I was, I, I almost didn't believe when I saw that.

1412
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:58,260
Well, in fairness max by default don't have a lot of services

1413
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,840
like you have to enable them.

1414
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:03,399
So, but at the same time, really that firewall should be enabled,

1415
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:05,429
um,

1416
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:06,820
moving along

1417
00:57:07,459 --> 00:57:09,530
and that's it. So what do you think?

1418
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:14,360
Uh Well, honestly, a lot of the stuff that is uh difficult is labeled as advanced,

1419
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:18,280
you know, and stuff like the built in option of using data encryption or

1420
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:23,340
um you know, backing up your computer. Uh I think there's a good,

1421
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:24,899
it,

1422
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:26,439
it always comes back to that kind of return

1423
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:29,760
on investment and more importantly for normal people.

1424
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,479
Is it actually achievable?

1425
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:34,129
Like let's face it, I am, you know, you and I are,

1426
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:37,760
I would say hopefully somewhat advanced security knowledge people

1427
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,679
and I would definitely say I cannot

1428
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:44,370
with 100% certainty, say that if you send me an email, I will definitely.

1429
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,639
Yeah.

1430
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,449
Um And so that's why I use things like

1431
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:51,860
that.

1432
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,010
I think what these guys are trying to do is really good.

1433
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,899
I, I think they asked the right number of questions up front.

1434
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:03,810
I like the way the interface is set up, but I think they give,

1435
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,889
they give too many options

1436
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:11,100
like let's face it if, if I was a person that didn't really know anything,

1437
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,899
I don't want 30 things I want, you know what I want.

1438
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:15,719
My advice should be the advice should be

1439
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,479
two factor off in a password manager and that would be,

1440
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:22,639
that would make most people probably 500% better.

1441
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:24,090
I was gonna say

1442
00:58:25,129 --> 00:58:28,989
if I had to pick one thing from this whole list, I would say honestly,

1443
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,969
my number one would be get a password manager.

1444
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:32,229
Number one,

1445
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:35,060
because that applies to all websites regardless.

1446
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,709
And then number 22 factor authentication because like I said, a lot of sites don't,

1447
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:39,870
still don't offer

1448
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:40,219
factor

1449
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,110
authentication.

1450
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:41,899
And, and

1451
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,199
no, I know, I know. II, I agree with you. I guess

1452
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:46,919
two factor

1453
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,169
on would be number one

1454
00:58:48,669 --> 00:58:51,260
or I'm sorry. Pastor manager. Number 12

1455
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:51,629
factor

1456
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,449
O is also really good.

1457
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,010
And then backups would be my third.

1458
00:58:56,149 --> 00:58:58,850
And I think if you did those three things, right? And

1459
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,280
egos are huge and, and

1460
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,370
the way I always think about this stuff is

1461
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:09,600
you can give people a list of three things and they might do one of them.

1462
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,280
If you give people a list of 30 things, they will do none of them.

1463
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,080
And that's just the way people work.

1464
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,120
It's, I mean, the good news, you know what I am noticing about this list though,

1465
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,820
more of this stuff is now built in,

1466
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:22,800
right?

1467
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,449
Because I remember when this conscription and stuff you

1468
00:59:24,459 --> 00:59:25,870
had to buy third party software for that,

1469
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:27,120
you're right.

1470
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:32,159
Like the world is getting better. Like Windows has honestly passable built in,

1471
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:36,360
right? It's not amazing and great, but it's OK.

1472
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,399
All antivirus is terrible.

1473
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,879
And I know lots of people like to argue with me about this, but

1474
00:59:41,129 --> 00:59:42,189
it, it sucks.

1475
00:59:42,439 --> 00:59:42,899
I mean,

1476
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:47,360
well, no, I would say antivirus at the client level is terrible at the server level.

1477
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:48,510
It's actually quite appropriate

1478
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,739
for a whole pile of reasons and you can do stuff at

1479
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,729
the server level that you can't do on the client side.

1480
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:56,389
Uh,

1481
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:57,350
yeah.

1482
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,649
Well, like behavioral or, you know, spotting trends, like, you know,

1483
01:00:01,659 --> 01:00:06,370
suddenly if somebody from Russia sends, you know, 10,000 people the same dot Exe.

1484
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,290
Yeah. You know,

1485
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,370
you should block that probably.

1486
01:00:11,439 --> 01:00:15,840
But, yeah, it's, um, I also like that they do give you links to actual people that

1487
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:16,479
it's a good

1488
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:16,760
start

1489
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:17,080
and

1490
01:00:17,189 --> 01:00:18,909
organizations that can help you because

1491
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,850
honestly, I didn't know half of these existed.

1492
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:24,830
Ok. So, I guess all in all this is very nice. It's very well done.

1493
01:00:25,179 --> 01:00:29,030
I, I, my only real complaint is the list is too long at the end.

1494
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,399
But again, I don't think there's any, you know, here's what I would do.

1495
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:35,949
I think if I was them is a long list isn't necessarily a bad thing,

1496
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:38,439
but they don't really organize it in the,

1497
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:41,070
these are the three most important things to do.

1498
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,159
And if you're doing these, then you should look at doing this stuff. Where is it?

1499
01:00:44,169 --> 01:00:47,040
It's kind of arranged in a more hodgepodge manner

1500
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,459
where if I didn't know what I was doing,

1501
01:00:48,469 --> 01:00:49,520
I wouldn't know which,

1502
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:53,959
like which one of these things is the most important thing I should do. Right.

1503
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,219
Yeah.

1504
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,989
Well, here's a real question. What would it take?

1505
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,409
Honestly,

1506
01:00:58,419 --> 01:01:00,080
let's just pick the two top things that you can

1507
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,070
do without actually having to buy hardware or whatever.

1508
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,379
What, what do you think it would take to do to get,

1509
01:01:04,389 --> 01:01:08,629
say 90% of people using a decent password manager and backing up their computer.

1510
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:11,830
-- Uh
-- You have to just make it default with the computer.

1511
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,310
I mean, let's face it. This is one of those things that the reason

1512
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:18,909
anyone uses many of these tools like for backing up that,

1513
01:01:18,919 --> 01:01:21,929
that ipads have is because it's just part of the ipad.

1514
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:22,729
Yeah. Yeah.

1515
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:24,790
And I think the good news is well and this comes,

1516
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,760
I would say maybe 1/4 recommendation is using cloud services because

1517
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:30,669
a lot of them are quite secure and by definition,

1518
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:32,540
hopefully are properly backed up.

1519
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,229
So like Gmail or Dropbox or you know, whatever.

1520
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,489
And so there, you know, you're just,

1521
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,060
you're getting your cake and being allowed to eat it like it just

1522
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:42,179
in theory, I've, I've never, you know,

1523
01:01:42,189 --> 01:01:45,060
the number of people that have complained about loss of data from Gmail is

1524
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:48,020
vanishingly small compared to the total number of people

1525
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:51,419
-- generally like human error.
-- You know, there have been one or two incidents.

1526
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:55,659
Well, no, there's there. If you Google it, there's one or two incidents that

1527
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,979
like where Google had like a pretty whoopsy moment.

1528
01:01:59,459 --> 01:02:00,090
Uh and you know,

1529
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,659
same like with git lab where they knew

1530
01:02:01,669 --> 01:02:03,879
what a production web database server or something.

1531
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:05,219
So it does happen. But,

1532
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:09,620
but realistically, you know, I kind of hate to say it but it kind of gets you into that,

1533
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,649
it's probably safer to have one super

1534
01:02:11,659 --> 01:02:14,489
tanker that's hopefully managed well versus like,

1535
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,370
you know, 10,000 people in kayaks with

1536
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,169
oil.

1537
01:02:17,899 --> 01:02:20,520
I think all in all this is actually a useful thing.

1538
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:20,889
Um,

1539
01:02:20,899 --> 01:02:23,010
I would probably say that I wouldn't even

1540
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,899
bother going to this unless you've already got a

1541
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,659
password manager and backups going because until you do

1542
01:02:27,669 --> 01:02:29,479
that doing the rest of the stuff is kind of

1543
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:30,870
not

1544
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:31,629
fair.

1545
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,500
All right, man, I'm calling.

1546
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,340
