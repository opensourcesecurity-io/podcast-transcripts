Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,350
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,060
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,229
What's up, man?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,949
-- It's winter. Finally. It's nice.
-- Nice. I hate winter.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,709
It's better than everything being brown and basically dead

6
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,409
now. It's dead but covered in pretty white snow.

7
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,629
I don't have any snow yet.

8
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:24,850
My biggest complaint is just,

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,790
I really like to ride my bicycle outside and I can't do that in the, in the snow.

10
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:29,829
I have seen

11
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:33,680
-- people on their mountain bikes with the monster tires.
-- It is possible

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,909
it's dangerous as heck because cars don't respect cyclists here.

13
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:41,909
-- But
-- so I investigated doing this and there are special ice tires you buy,

14
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:42,779
you put them on your bike.

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,099
They're incredibly expensive because you can't like,

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,930
you can't cheap out on these because of what you're doing.

17
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,939
-- Don't cheap out on your winter tires, period.
-- Right. Right. But the point is

18
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:57,840
basically the consensus of everyone I've spoken with is that if you ride a bike

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,880
in the winter,

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,889
you will fall, there's a

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,799
multiple times and

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,870
I'm too old to fall off a bike. I'm gonna break a hip or something at this. Point.

23
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:10,059
So it is out of the question

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,870
to be riding outside in the winter on a bicycle for me.

25
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,150
Yeah, I, I biked to high school most times because, um, the,

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,089
the school express bus that went by my house was

27
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,260
typically full by the time it went past my house.

28
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:20,930
And so it would just,

29
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,400
it would just drive by. That's ridiculous.

30
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,870
Well, it, it's a city, it's city, it's like a public bus

31
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,629
and it's like full. So, like, what's the bus driver gonna do?

32
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,959
Stop and apologize and then continue without me anyway.

33
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,430
Yeah, it's not a school bus. Sorry? Yeah.

34
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,290
No, my high school basically had like a transit center right next to it.

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,589
So it actually had really good bus connectivity.

36
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,750
But like first thing in the morning, right, like,

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,830
weirdly a couple of 100 students want to go to school at the same time.

38
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,529
Very strange.

39
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,099
So I would bike to school and yeah, like, uh,

40
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,190
when I look back at those risks,

41
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:56,650
I took just riding in rush hour traffic in snow and ice.

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,150
I am amazed. I did not die.

43
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:01,139
Which kind of leads to our show topic of

44
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,120
basically

45
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,949
behaviors and beliefs that used to be correct that are now like,

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,110
stupidly dangerous or wrong.

47
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:11,589
-- All right.
-- So there's an exception to this, there is an article

48
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,910
that Kurt and I read the other day

49
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:19,035
that is the, the title is Experts from a World that no longer exists.

50
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:24,955
And I read this and thought this has to be a show because I love it.

51
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:29,354
So I will summarize this first before we move on

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,539
is the fundamental premise of all of this is that

53
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,380
obviously people become experts based upon some sort of knowledge.

54
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:43,059
Like you could potentially claim that Kurt and I are experts at, at security,

55
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,990
which we'd laugh at.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,339
But

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,839
you know what I mean? We, we spent a career

58
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,059
building up this corpus of knowledge that we possess

59
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,100
and

60
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,779
our knowledge

61
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,220
is, I would, I would say it is useful at a point in time that is in the past,

62
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,139
but the the world is still moving into the future. So

63
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:05,059
-- if you don't, basically, you become an expert,
-- you have to re invent yourself.

64
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,660
-- But then
-- the world changes past your expertise. Yes, exactly. You have to,

65
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,169
you have to build a change,

66
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:14,779
you have to re invent yourself constantly, like shedding the skin, right?

67
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,839
And I think

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,339
the other thing is, well, let's, we're going to ignore the whole, what is an expert?

69
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,029
What decides an expert thing? Like is it a bunch of knowledge? Is it success?

70
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,940
-- Is it whatever?
-- Right?

71
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,699
Well, look, I, I think let's just, let's clarify at the beginning.

72
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,119
Everyone is an expert at something I'm

73
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,720
-- comfortable saying
-- that that's almost always true.

74
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:33,029
But

75
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:38,009
yeah, at something there is something that everyone is good at.

76
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,770
I feel like there are some people that are

77
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,850
just useless based on some youtube videos I've seen in

78
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,759
videos

79
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:49,759
that's maybe another show topic. But let's just say for the moment

80
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,800
that everyone is an expert at something, at

81
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,949
least one thing, possibly more.

82
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:56,199
Ok. Ok.

83
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,000
So

84
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:01,600
I have a story I want to tell completely related to this actually.

85
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,080
So

86
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,559
the Linux Foundation, you know, David Wheeler was on the show last episode.

87
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,779
They're doing their great M FA project

88
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,160
where they're,

89
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,460
they're looking to distribute a

90
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:14,679
whole bunch of

91
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,010
UB keys and Google Titan Keys

92
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,119
to the world. OK. And

93
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,630
I was in a call with David and, and like, basically, no one showed up.

94
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,720
It was me and him and a couple other people

95
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:28,890
that important to scare the N PM ecosystem. What are you talking about?

96
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:31,980
No, no, this is, this actually isn't related to this at all.

97
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,179
It was, I forget what the meeting even was now. Anyway, barely anyone shows up.

98
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,649
And so we're just kind of all chatting and having a

99
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,820
nice time and somehow this M fa stuff comes up.

100
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:41,816
And basically David was like,

101
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:44,885
I need someone to write how to documents.

102
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:48,276
Like that is the one most important thing we need for this project to go forward.

103
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,786
And I'm like, you know, man,

104
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:52,996
I've written a bunch of stuff about these keys in the past.

105
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,045
I will, I'll do it, you know, I'll do it to just

106
00:04:56,365 --> 00:05:00,066
get it done and like my draft will suck and we can fix it.

107
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,506
But I'll at least get it moving out of the gate. OK.

108
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:06,701
So I start doing my research and obviously you've got the Titan key,

109
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:08,641
you've got the UBI key, they're not exactly the same.

110
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:12,022
And so I'm understanding features and everything and the only part of

111
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:16,421
the Venn diagram they really have in common is the 502 protocol,

112
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:16,902
right?

113
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:17,552
Which,

114
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,171
and then you learn the ugly secret,

115
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:23,971
what ugly secret that most places say when they support two of a and M fa with the

116
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:26,092
ki they're not supporting 502 they're supporting the

117
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:29,451
specific protocol. And so for example, it only works with

118
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:31,082
keys and not with Google Titan.

119
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:34,369
Uh uh some of them, some of them, but that's not the point of my story.

120
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,059
Well, but the thing is you got to figure out which is, which, well,

121
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,519
-- whatever
-- I don't care about that point.

122
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,700
So anyway, the point is I said, all right, I'm going to focus on,

123
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,029
on Fight 02 because that's what they have in common.

124
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,619
That'll be the easiest thing to write about

125
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,500
basically. And like Titan Keys basically do Fight 02 and

126
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:49,779
yikes

127
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,609
do like 100 million other things. OK? But I'm gonna focus on Fight 02.

128
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,850
Now, I've done a lot of, we did, we did podcasts about Fight 02. I mean, like

129
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,750
I would say, if you said, are you an expert on this? I, I might not say I'm an expert.

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,579
But I would say I know more than average. OK, I start doing my research.

131
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,190
There is so like there's so much new stuff in this space. It blew my mind.

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,519
Like, so here's the most, the,

133
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,190
-- the best thing I love
-- all

134
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,920
time stuff.

135
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,359
No,

136
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,959
no. That's boring,

137
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,760
-- dude. I can use my face to authenticate to a website now.
-- That's boring.

138
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:21,779
That's boring. Trust me.

139
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,140
So what I learned

140
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,700
is there is now support

141
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,970
in open SSH

142
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,380
to use the

143
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,679
Fido keys

144
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:35,880
to store encryption. So you can, you can ssh using the keys stored in your phyto

145
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:39,619
token. But wait, there's more. So anyway, I get this set up, right.

146
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,869
I'm like, OK, I can SS A and

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,899
then I learned that get

148
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,250
version 2.34 which came out

149
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:48,480
like 10 days from the time of recording. I think

150
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,609
that allows you to sign commits with an SSH key.

151
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:57,429
So now I can sign a get commit using a key on a Fido

152
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,730
token. I'm like, this is ridiculous.

153
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,160
This is so funny because I just looked up to get 2.3 0.4 release.

154
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,630
They hid that under the tidbit section on the

155
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,940
freaking headline. And here's my favorite part.

156
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,660
Sorry, I didn't, I never read this before but,

157
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,380
but the experience of using GP G and maintaining keys can be somewhat cumbersome.

158
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,329
Yeah.

159
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,149
Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,339
You don't say right, right.

161
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:22,760
Like now, now I will say

162
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,040
at this moment,

163
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,109
you cannot verify

164
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,279
SSH signatures with github

165
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,519
or GIT lab.

166
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,170
That's obviously the first thing I looked at,

167
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:33,209
but you kind of get the point is there's a

168
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,959
topic that I thought I knew more than average about.

169
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,559
And I learned so much working on this documentation and understanding how it works.

170
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,109
And it just, it,

171
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,619
it's funny because

172
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,445
it, it occurred to me shortly after I started, you know,

173
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:47,535
going down this rabbit hole and learning all this stuff.

174
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:48,325
I'm like, holy crap.

175
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,674
Like this is literally the thing we're going to talk

176
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,605
about in a couple of days on the podcast.

177
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,304
Like, it's so funny.

178
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:55,994
Well, what I love is like web off

179
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:57,334
now supports biometrics.

180
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,994
So literally, I go to websites and windows is like, hey,

181
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,665
do you want to use your face to authenticate to this website?

182
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,845
And I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever, right? You know,

183
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:04,894
it's

184
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,304
this whole thing of I think part of the challenge is

185
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:15,380
the world used to change in more of an additive way than in a transformative way.

186
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,429
And I think it changed really slow.

187
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:20,170
But yeah, also that like, but it was like, you know, A

188
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,540
plus B, not A replaced by B, right?

189
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:28,279
Like we had radio and then we got TV, and everybody still has radio and TV,

190
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,640
right? But now, for example, computers, like

191
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,299
the only reason I own A TV is because, well, it's

192
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,270
basically a cheap monitor for my Apple.

193
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,070
-- That's what I plug my video games into,
-- like, I haven't had cable TV for over 10 years.

194
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,119
I guess I technically own a radio because I own a car. Right.

195
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,590
But I don't actually own a radio

196
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,309
anymore. And that's the thing. Right.

197
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,119
These, especially in tech with cloud because we've made that transition from,

198
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,510
like,

199
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,789
products to utility.

200
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,549
Like, all my stuff is in the cloud now. I don't own anything.

201
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,570
It's been, it's completely transformational.

202
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,760
Like the CS A the only on premises gear we have is some ubiquity wi fi gear.

203
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,419
And I think like three printers globally. That's it.

204
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,190
That's our physical it infrastructure stack, right?

205
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,130
Compared to 10 or 20 years ago, right?

206
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,460
We would have had a server closet at each location,

207
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:14,780
a

208
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:15,309
co

209
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,419
location plus

210
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,840
probably something hidden in my basement in case everything burns down, right?

211
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:22,849
And now it's completely transformational because it's all in the cloud.

212
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,789
And, and that I think is the biggest problem is

213
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,000
because you said this, right,

214
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,489
we can teach developers new things but to teach them to

215
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,219
like forget or to stop doing old things is really hard.

216
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,500
I mean, it, it kind of is, I I do agree with that.

217
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,619
You've got me thinking now where you're talking about

218
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,080
the old world and the additive nature of technology.

219
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,979
And

220
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,169
I do feel like especially tech has been often very like rip and replace

221
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:53,950
where because you think a long time ago there were kind of mainframes

222
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,419
and then we moved ourselves into

223
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,409
like individual computers

224
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,299
and now we're kind of

225
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:04,539
moving back into the mainframe sort of world of cloud.

226
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:06,270
Well, no, no, we're not moving back to a mainframe.

227
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,530
We're simply moving to a utility model of computing.

228
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:13,020
I need computing. I like, I need water. I phone up Epcor and

229
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,710
agree to pay them X amount of dollars per month

230
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:18,450
for water and electricity and sewage and garbage pickup.

231
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,419
You know, same thing with the internet,

232
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,880
right? Internet used to be a bespoke.

233
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,369
Like I had a dedicated 14 4 dial up connection to the internet on 24 7.

234
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,770
I had my own phone line for it.

235
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,090
You know, when I work with my parents back when I was a teenager

236
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,510
and it was, you know, it was a disaster to set up and maintain.

237
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,570
You know, there were scripts to like,

238
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,510
restart it when it died every randomly minutes or hours.

239
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:43,539
But now it's just like, hey, you know, tell us or shock. Give me fast internet.

240
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:44,409
Ok, thanks. Bye.

241
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:45,719
I mean,

242
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,580
-- that is true. Right.
-- It's cars are similar, right?

243
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,849
Car maintenance or even even starting a car,

244
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,030
we went from crank starts where it might break your arm to

245
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,260
you. Push a button

246
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,260
or, you know, you don't even turn a key anymore. You just push a button.

247
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:02,640
Uh, I do have that. I, I it's so weird because my, my electric car,

248
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,030
I get into it

249
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,200
and then

250
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:06,539
I push on

251
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:10,000
and I would muscle memory be, like, trying to stab it with a key.

252
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:10,469
Uh,

253
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,599
so, you know, it's funny, I actually adapted to that really quickly.

254
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:17,479
Now, my problem is going back to the gas car having to put a key in it

255
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,750
and just like getting in and sitting there for a second.

256
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:21,880
Like, I don't remember how to do this,

257
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,320
-- like, Scotty at the computer. Computer.
-- Right. Right.

258
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,719
That's what I feel like every time I get into the gas car.

259
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,210
Yeah.

260
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah. Right. It's like, oh, I have to, I have to start it

261
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:32,890
like some caveman.

262
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,820
Um, but that's the thing. Right is,

263
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,090
and I think that's a big thing is, is in it,

264
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:40,409
especially corporate it if you have old system and

265
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:43,010
new system and if you carry both of them,

266
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,169
the cost is horrendous.

267
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,460
But if you can get rid of old system and just move to new system,

268
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,530
yeah, that's not easy and cheap and fun, but

269
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:55,244
not having those legacy costs and the costs of doing two separate

270
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:56,885
things and having two separate documentation

271
00:11:56,895 --> 00:11:58,775
pass and process pass and everything.

272
00:11:58,864 --> 00:11:59,815
Right. I mean, it's,

273
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,984
I've seen like, well, government's a great example. Right.

274
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:02,585
Government doesn't,

275
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,715
can't get rid of old it the way they would like to because some of, you know,

276
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,114
the papers legislated

277
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:10,025
and so they're stuck with this insane stuff that, like,

278
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:12,465
works because it abides by the legislation

279
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,599
and they're stuck with it.

280
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,409
Um,

281
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:15,739
yeah,

282
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:17,130
I wanna,

283
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,549
I wanna pull us back out of the show for

284
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,570
a minute because there's actually some things in this,

285
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:23,640
this article that I think

286
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,679
have have, I'm still not in, I don't know if I agree or not. Exactly.

287
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,630
But so the, the first one I think the most important

288
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:32,090
is

289
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,590
the, the author talks about Henry Ford

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,690
and Ford made a point of not documenting failures.

291
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,580
And now I know I have spoken in the past

292
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,659
about the importance of publishing failure because others can learn.

293
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,690
But in the case of Henry Ford, the reason he said that

294
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,880
is he said, documenting failure,

295
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:57,440
-- basically tells another person don't try this
-- depending on

296
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,359
the maturity of the person and organization involved.

297
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:01,020
I agree

298
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,429
because to have the maturity to look at the failures of the past

299
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,669
and actually maybe understand why they failed and maybe try it again.

300
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,309
Because a great example is we all remember

301
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,140
the before, you know, and just around the two thousands of all the online

302
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,419
web stores like pets.com and stuff that just

303
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:20,299
-- crater spectacularly
-- that's literally called out in this in

304
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:20,590
this

305
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,380
compared to how much money we all spend on Amazon

306
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,059
or or

307
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,650
so literally, I mean, from the context of pets.com,

308
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:29,010
I have a funny story about pets.com.

309
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,739
Actually the

310
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,820
the first job I had out of college,

311
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:35,609
everyone had pets.com that like dog with the

312
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:37,770
watch around its neck or whatever it was,

313
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,650
everyone had those like plushies all over the office.

314
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,369
So one day I'm like, what's the deal?

315
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:45,450
And it turned out that the office I worked in

316
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,289
was the old pets.com office.

317
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,460
And so they, they all the furniture, well, they just,

318
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:53,809
they locked the doors on them one day.

319
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,609
So, like all the furniture and there were boxes of like swag.

320
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,260
So everyone, they just like, used it.

321
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,570
But, but anyway, anyway, like,

322
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,719
so

323
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,239
pets.com

324
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,299
-- always have a special place in my heart. You
-- can

325
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:09,039
-- and use them to insulate your hobo shelter.
-- I don't have any anymore.

326
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:13,309
I, sadly I threw them all away when I left that job. But so

327
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,340
now that I'm old, I wish I did anyway.

328
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,059
So like pets.com is a great example where when

329
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,049
pets.com came out in the early two thousands,

330
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,520
it was a monumental failure.

331
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,260
It's like one of the most epic failures of all time.

332
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,849
But now there's a company called Chewy, which is literally doing the same thing.

333
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:29,260
And in fact,

334
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,539
I use them all the time to order dog food

335
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,679
because they have the one specific kind of dog food.

336
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,320
The vet was like,

337
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,219
you have to feed your dog because my dogs like getting

338
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:38,880
old and fat and they like feed it this special food.

339
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,039
I order, I use them all the time

340
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,080
and Chewy is wildly successful today,

341
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,030
whereas pets.com exploded in a blaze of glory.

342
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,239
Well, and I mean, I had a presentation I shopped around internally.

343
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,669
Red Hat talking about why clouds?

344
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,179
Why now and part, it's basically, it's the ecosystem

345
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:58,599
there you can't build in a vacuum and expect to succeed.

346
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:00,409
Right. Like,

347
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,070
like, I don't care how good your rockets are. Two.

348
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,460
In, in World War Two you don't have computer guidance. You have at best, really crap.

349
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:09,200
Analog computers and gyroscopes that are

350
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,590
not that good,

351
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:11,659
you know.

352
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:12,650
And

353
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,500
so I think part of this is people forget that.

354
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,590
It's, it's about the whole, I hate to say it's like a rain forest,

355
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:22,049
it's all interconnected, you know, and you touch one thing and it dies.

356
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,890
-- So
-- actually there's a really cool quote.

357
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,289
I just pulled up in this article from Mark Andreessen

358
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,880
and he says all of the ideas that the

359
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,530
people had in the 19 nineties were basically correct.

360
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:32,830
They were just early,

361
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,299
the infrastructure necessary to make most tech

362
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,469
businesses work didn't exist in the nineties,

363
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,770
but it exists today.

364
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:41,619
So almost every business plan that was mocked for being

365
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,330
a ridiculous idea that failed is now 20 years later,

366
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,530
a viable industry.

367
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,770
I mean,

368
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,840
you know what it kind of reminds me of sometimes is

369
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,880
going to the moon.

370
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,309
And I know I, I I've used this before in the past many, many times, but like

371
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,309
in the, in the late sixties,

372
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,979
we went to the moon

373
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,390
in spite of the technology

374
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,969
and it was, it was just like you just keep pouring money into that fire and we can do it.

375
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,789
Whereas now you look at space. You've got these private companies

376
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,630
and it's because it's become affordable and economical to be investing in space.

377
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,950
It's not a money fire, it's,

378
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,830
it's a viable business now because we have the technology to drive the business.

379
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,190
Right.

380
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,989
So I think part of it is experts

381
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:28,219
have success in the past and

382
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,530
they kind of coast on it.

383
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,869
I don't want to say coast on it, but, you know, they sort of ride it

384
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:33,119
and

385
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,530
the thing is you can ride on past success and

386
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,369
you can keep doing behavior that maybe is no longer that

387
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,530
effective,

388
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,020
but it's not a complete failure immediately, right?

389
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,929
Like it's these, these, these, even when these man, like the shift to cloud,

390
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,250
you know, 10 years later,

391
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm still dealing with people who are like clouds.

392
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,440
A fad, everybody's going to go back to on premises. And I'm like,

393
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,609
I don't heard that in a while.

394
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:58,400
I still hear cloud is just someone else's computer, which is like,

395
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:00,929
I mean, everything is someone else's computer at this point,

396
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,010
-- but
-- it's a subtle difference.

397
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,400
It's,

398
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,810
it's somebody else's utility grade compute system.

399
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:06,939
I mean,

400
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,020
and there's a big difference between my computer

401
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,880
running in a colo closet and Amazon,

402
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,160
like,

403
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,339
Amazon is dropping $4 billion on a new

404
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:15,618
availability zone in Calgary just south of here.

405
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,108
And so it'll be three,

406
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,749
you know, physical sets of infrastructure located, what,

407
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,269
like 10 to 100 miles apart.

408
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,909
So that a tornado or airline crash or whatever doesn't wipe it all out

409
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:27,548
and everybody's losing their mind of mind.

410
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:30,529
They're like, oh my God, $4 billion over 10 years, that's a massive amount of money.

411
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:33,188
I'm like, no, it's not like, not for them. No, no.

412
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:37,448
A basic, a basic cloud class data center now,

413
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,668
like a single physical instance is a billion dollars.

414
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:40,588
That's the rule of thumb.

415
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,430
Right.

416
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:41,869
And, you know,

417
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,569
it goes back to like that corporate earnings call

418
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,449
Microsoft had I was on a few years ago where

419
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,510
they were talking about their data center sizes

420
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
and they measure them in data center miles.

421
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,369
Like how many

422
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,040
miles long is it?

423
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,329
Right. Because it's like Star Trek with their kilo quads.

424
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:58,770
Like we just, we make up a term to cover the compute amount because

425
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,459
like it just doesn't, you know, it's a meaningless numbers.

426
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:03,819
We measure it by floor space in miles now.

427
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,219
And that's the thing, right?

428
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,079
This, this is so somebody else's computer that's again, it's like saying, you know,

429
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,880
the Hoover Dam is just somebody else's

430
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,900
generator.

431
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,989
-- No, it's a bit more than that.
-- It is. But I'm also happy to use the electricity.

432
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,040
What? There's a huge infrastructure behind it that people ignore.

433
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:22,540
There's

434
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,479
a and I don't mean just physical infrastructure but people knowledge,

435
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:26,719
institutional knowledge,

436
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,839
corporate bonds to pay for the thing.

437
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,640
You know what I mean?

438
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,280
And so

439
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:33,560
I think with a lot of this expert knowledge,

440
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,810
you know, you can still sell people on premises. Compute

441
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,250
some, some people will still buy it.

442
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:45,349
But, you know, five or 10 years from now, man, that's gonna be a tough market to be in.

443
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,119
It's, it's, yeah, absolutely. I mean, I don't think anyone will doubt that

444
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,329
-- it's
-- people still

445
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:52,520
electric cars.

446
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,310
Well,

447
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,329
oh, man, I love my electric car.

448
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,229
I've spent so I need, I just need to say I've owned it for over a month now.

449
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:04,170
I have spent $20 in electricity and I've driven

450
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,739
-- like 1200 miles. Can you
-- qualify that?

451
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,510
Is that roughly $20 or you actually know that number to be true?

452
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,489
Well, I could calculate it to the penny, but we're talking,

453
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,280
it's probably 23 or $24 dot Whatever.

454
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,130
But I literally have a number I can calculate based on

455
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,010
the amount of electricity that has gone through my charger.

456
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:23,729
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

457
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:24,760
So,

458
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,959
and I think that's one of the problems is,

459
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,160
is

460
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,319
expert knowledge is not binary, it doesn't suddenly become useless.

461
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:37,540
The problem is, it becomes less and less useful. There's like a decay function.

462
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:40,790
Oh, perfect example, setting up and running a mail server.

463
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:43,000
Is that still useful knowledge? And I would argue

464
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,520
it is if you apply correctly because I use my knowledge of how to build mail servers

465
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,229
-- to use cloud services more effectively.
-- Sure. Sure. And, and I agree with that.

466
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:52,900
I think

467
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,819
there is

468
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,949
a foundation of knowledge that's valuable and like especially in cybersecurity.

469
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:02,540
I think there's some foundational concepts that can be valuable. But I think

470
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,640
once you start going above the foundation, there's certain things like, I mean,

471
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,900
the favorite whipping boy is, is password advice, right?

472
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,319
The old misguidance. It was crap, someone made up. And I

473
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,770
you'll hear people say,

474
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,000
well, I think we should change passwords more often. It's like

475
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,140
there's literally evidence that says that is harmful.

476
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,780
Here is the evidence like, well, I just don't want to believe that. And it's like,

477
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:25,479
yeah, I love

478
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:26,880
you.

479
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,609
I love how nist literally officially recanted on

480
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,530
that and people still refuse to believe.

481
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,819
But here's the thing when you, I think you get that,

482
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:38,500
that expert mindset of these are the things I know.

483
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:39,949
And even when, I mean, I mean,

484
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,729
studies have shown when you present humans with evidence,

485
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,819
showing their beliefs are incorrect,

486
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:48,050
they don't change their mind, they double down.

487
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,469
And I think maybe there's that difference

488
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:53,395
between having the expert knowledge and how it's applied, right?

489
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:54,515
Because I have a lot of, you know,

490
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:58,354
DNS and email information because I've earned it through blood, sweat and tears.

491
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:01,484
But now I apply it through cloud services and getting them to, you know,

492
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,744
work as optimally as possible instead of standing on my own stuff.

493
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:05,285
And I think

494
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:06,875
maybe that's the second part is

495
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:11,630
the problem is, is it the information that is sort of right or wrong?

496
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,030
And it's not a binary state Right.

497
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,609
Like, it's a decay function, you know, like, flint,

498
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:18,189
napping is still useful if you want to do it as a hobby.

499
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,349
But, like, as a actually making tools kind of thing.

500
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,030
Like, no, just go to Home Depot and buy a sharp thing.

501
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:23,770
Um,

502
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:26,829
but then the application of that knowledge is, you know,

503
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,510
are you applying the knowledge in the old,

504
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,430
tried and tested way or applying it in a new, more modern, effective way?

505
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,790
I mean, I, I don't think when we think of experts from

506
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
a time now gone,

507
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,119
I don't think we think about people using their foundational knowledge

508
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,270
in a new way. I think we think about people

509
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:52,030
clinging to their expertise trying to hold back progress.

510
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:52,849
Well, like,

511
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,619
because going back to that example of all those

512
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,640
old business plans that failed in the nineties.

513
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,189
Well, yeah, now they're being applied differently, like instead of ok,

514
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,280
we're going to build an on premises data center to do XY and Z.

515
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,959
It's like, no, let's build a really cheap service infrastructure

516
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,479
and let's use

517
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:09,979
uh Well, perfect example, Costco, Costco doesn't do shipping,

518
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:11,390
they just pay ups to do it

519
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:12,119
right.

520
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:12,650
I mean,

521
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,969
and it's ridiculous because I literally just bought a utility sink and it's a

522
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:19,160
metal thing and it came in a giant box and it was heavy as sin

523
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,910
and shipping was included.

524
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,890
And I'm like, I cannot even fathom what it would have costed me to ship this box.

525
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,540
-- Across the city using UPS.
-- Right. Right.

526
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,780
It would have been ridiculous,

527
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,979
but I'm sure Costco has some amazing deal with UPS where, you know, they,

528
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:35,359
they pre optimized the, like,

529
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,660
they literally have everything ready to go in a perfect way

530
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,420
where they just throw it on the truck and they're done.

531
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,900
-- Right.
-- Right.

532
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:42,449
So, so the article calls out

533
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:48,739
a, a sort of similar point to what you just brought up is. So, for example, let's say

534
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,339
there were some wise investors who knew

535
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,359
the pets.com model would be sufficient in 20 years.

536
00:22:57,469 --> 00:23:00,949
Even if you would have kept pets.com alive for 20 years,

537
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,880
it would, it would still fail because

538
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,000
basically all of the ideas from the nineties like the,

539
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,209
the infrastructure they built would no longer be applicable today.

540
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:14,589
So there is an importance in failure and rebirth

541
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,750
versus keeping it alive for a long period of time.

542
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,270
And I think this is even true of knowledge of,

543
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,829
I think sometimes it's acceptable to be like,

544
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,729
I need to forget what I know and start again.

545
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,699
Well, I have an active rule of thumb.

546
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:29,790
I've applied now to myself for the last few years,

547
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,979
which is anything sort of very specific.

548
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:34,989
Technically that I know that's more than three years old is suspect.

549
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,290
-- II, I can get behind that rule
-- and some of it like, OK,

550
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,869
like programming and Python and classes versus this and that, OK,

551
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,750
that's kind of timeless and probably still useful long term.

552
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:45,859
Not really though.

553
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:46,170
I mean,

554
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,459
but Python three has enough changes over Python two that

555
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,250
there's a generous amount of relearning that had to happen.

556
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:53,420
But I mean,

557
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,979
these sort of core fundamental concepts that are probably still mostly ok,

558
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,050
but things like actually setting up an email server, no,

559
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,380
Kurt will never do that again.

560
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,239
And, well, I will actively campaign against ever doing it again

561
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,359
because I will just pay Sendgrid or mail gun, you know, 100 bucks a month

562
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:11,810
and get api keys out of them. Part of it is, I guess

563
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,849
how do you recognize that knowledge is

564
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:18,260
bad or out of date or incorrect?

565
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,890
And that speaks to a level of maturity of

566
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,390
being willing to pre and post mortem your ideas.

567
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,859
And by premortem, I say, OK, I have this idea,

568
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,979
here's what I expect to happen

569
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,500
and then you do it and then you do a postmortem and

570
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,000
-- well, in theory, they should line up, right? Like
-- you should

571
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,349
-- have,
-- I mean,

572
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:39,780
-- predicted the future and made it happen.
-- I want to say that doesn't happen.

573
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,260
And I think there's always going to be exceptions to that rule.

574
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,839
And I, but I think it's something maybe we need to start doing.

575
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,780
But I mean, kind of talking about

576
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,099
at the very beginning,

577
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:50,579
we mentioned how expertise in the past was more

578
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,099
additive versus today where it's kind of just replacing.

579
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,420
And I think

580
00:24:55,689 --> 00:25:00,319
it is very difficult for humans to undo something

581
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:02,119
they've learned and try to learn a new thing.

582
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,449
I mean,

583
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,359
I think this is where that whole concept of like, oh, there's, you know,

584
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,010
you can't be an old person in tech

585
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,459
and I think if you're going to cling to your skills of the past, no,

586
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,689
you can't be an old person intact because

587
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,300
you don't have skills that anyone wants anymore

588
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,979
versus saying

589
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,630
I'm going to retrain myself constantly and I'm

590
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,250
going to always be gathering new things.

591
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,540
But I, I don't think that's normal. I don't think, I, I think that's a really

592
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:29,709
-- hard thing for people to do.
-- There's literally neuroplasticity, right?

593
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:33,819
Neuroplasticity is a thing. It's, it's the, it's the ability of your brain

594
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:38,280
to change and relearn and learn new things and unlearn old things.

595
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,910
And it's like super well documented that the older you get,

596
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:43,939
the less of that you have

597
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:48,119
statistically, like, obviously there's exceptions to the rule and blah, blah,

598
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,359
blah.

599
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,089
And there's things like, you know, like, like literally like exercise,

600
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:54,949
there's certain ways of thinking and doing things that

601
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:57,420
can increase your neuroplasticity in the long term.

602
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,510
But by the time you probably realize you should

603
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,979
be doing that in your forties or fifties,

604
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:01,709
it's too late.

605
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:05,599
I mean, it's well documented that the human brain is wired such that, yeah, the,

606
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:07,425
you get the tougher it is to learn new things.

607
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:11,364
Like I think of trying to learn a second language now versus when I was in my, you know,

608
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,234
early teens and it's like, oh, my goodness.

609
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:15,854
No, that's, that would be a complete waste of my time. I mean, all right.

610
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:17,724
So, in the last couple of minutes,

611
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:20,314
let's assume this is all correct. Let's assume

612
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:23,765
that many of us are experts from a world that no longer exists.

613
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:26,694
Let's assume we have this foundational knowledge, I guess.

614
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:30,925
What do you do? Right. What, what do you do next?

615
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,479
I would say, well,

616
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:37,599
some part of it would be make sure that the knowledge you have is being applied as,

617
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:40,569
as best and correctly as possible.

618
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:42,329
Also

619
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,180
learn new things. Like, I mean, just on a tactical level,

620
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,280
no, just on a tactical level, you're going to have to learn new things like windows,

621
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,270
11 came out and people are kvetching about how much they hate.

622
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,569
Windows. 11 over windows 10,

623
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:55,859
my reaction is straight up. They move the icons to the middle.

624
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:56,380
I like

625
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:56,930
windows. That's all

626
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,319
-- I don't, I don't get all I hate. I like
-- it.

627
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,834
Like I'm like they moved all the icons from the

628
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:05,194
-- left side to the middle. I mean,
-- they look nicer too.

629
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:08,594
They're more appealing to my eye than the anyway. Anyway. Ok.

630
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:11,555
So I, I kind of have an answer I think I want to give for this.

631
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:15,765
That's very related to my story I told way back 20 minutes ago

632
00:27:15,974 --> 00:27:16,555
was

633
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,650
I, I think getting involved in things like a, a working group

634
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,829
that's working on things for the future.

635
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,319
Like obviously, in my instance, it's the open SSF and then

636
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:29,599
volunteering to like write a new thing.

637
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:32,400
And now I think this is important though because for example,

638
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:34,900
there's a bunch of other documentation that's being worked on,

639
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,790
but no one wanted to touch the how to guide.

640
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,099
And I think that's because most of the other docs was basically copy editing.

641
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:41,619
So no one had to stick their neck out,

642
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,479
like stick your neck out

643
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,979
and write Docs about it.

644
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:46,785
You maybe think you know about

645
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:51,055
and don't write what you know, like actually research and do it as you do.

646
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:52,765
You know what I mean? I think that's

647
00:27:52,915 --> 00:27:55,185
one of the ways to stay fresh.

648
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:57,675
See, that makes me really sad because that is literally what a

649
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:01,344
like what a college or university degree is supposed to teach you is

650
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:05,005
how to learn things and how to not just learn things for yourself,

651
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:08,454
but then how to learn things and also kind of explain it a bit to other people

652
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:12,155
and the vast majority of people do not have the skill and have not practiced it,

653
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:12,385
right.

654
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:13,025
You and I

655
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,439
are very weird. Like I wrote a magazine column for eight years.

656
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:20,400
It's, this is not a skill most people have or have the time to learn.

657
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,109
And

658
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,040
-- I, I,
-- no,

659
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,469
-- I
-- don't think it's good advice to put up only in the sense of I don't think it's real.

660
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:30,069
I don't, II, I, maybe, maybe you're right. But I think

661
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:34,780
I, I don't think it's a skill people don't have. I think the problem is,

662
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:37,650
and I was thinking about this because, because you and I,

663
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,020
we create something from nothing every week

664
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,219
when we do this show, for example, like we literally start,

665
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:48,739
well, well, maybe we could say we, we make nothing worse. But, you know, anyway,

666
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:51,650
the, the point is, I think it is scary

667
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,719
sometimes to, to start with nothing like, like writing a guide on how to use Fight.

668
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:57,660
02 tokens.

669
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:01,319
I started with a, an empty file

670
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,589
-- and it, sometimes it's like, what do I even do?
-- I call that blank page syndrome?

671
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,349
-- I mean,
-- yeah.

672
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,310
And now

673
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,040
I think for my instance,

674
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,390
I built enough stuff,

675
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,670
I'm comfortable just like crapping whatever onto the page and being like,

676
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,180
I'll fix it later and then I do.

677
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,469
But you know what I mean? I don't,

678
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,479
I don't think it's so much a skill people don't have.

679
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:25,489
I think it is intimidating sometimes to be faced with that blank page.

680
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,400
And I think part of part of being an expert and

681
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,170
staying an expert is becoming comfortable with the blank page.

682
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,339
Well, it's, it's the same thing as public speaking, right?

683
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:35,959
Literally, public speaking is one of the

684
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,920
most common, biggest core fears. A lot of people have.

685
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,300
I've seen studies that say like over half

686
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,750
of people fear public speaking and I'm like,

687
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
having done it multiple times.

688
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,520
I'm kind of like, huh?

689
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,170
-- Like, I don't get it.
-- I love it. I love,

690
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:46,489
I've

691
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,920
always like public speaking and

692
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,599
just

693
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,189
literally yesterday I learned that, uh, so 4h, you know, um, it's the,

694
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:57,079
the well traditionally rural club for kids, but now also urban,

695
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,079
one of their core components is

696
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:01,155
public speaking because they basically, like,

697
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:05,665
it is such an important skill that it's, it's a core component of

698
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,724
their program for everything the kids do,

699
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:11,724
whether it be raising cattle or doing like arts and drama or, you know, whatever.

700
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:14,204
But public speaking is one of the core and I think

701
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,805
honestly public speaking and public writing

702
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:21,599
and I, I, what I think I find interesting is open source is a form of public writing.

703
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,310
Like code is writing. Oh, I agree.

704
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,040
You know, and getting over that fear, like you've made the comment like, oh Kurt,

705
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,650
you know, I'm so glad you're willing to, like, put, like,

706
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,380
just write garbage code and put it out in public and I'm like, oh yeah, like,

707
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,239
wait till you see this stuff from my sandbox.

708
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:37,270
You know, the stuff that I, I know won't see the public like it's,

709
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:38,680
you think that stuff's bad?

710
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:39,959
Wow. Just wait.

711
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,920
But, and that's the thing, right? So many people are terrified

712
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,439
to put themselves out there because, and rightfully so

713
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:47,579
they'll typically get attacked and tore down.

714
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,630
Yeah. And that,

715
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:51,770
and, and that's terrible, I think,

716
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,609
and that, that's actually something

717
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,060
I, I, I'm gonna end on this note because we're basically out of time. But

718
00:30:57,229 --> 00:31:03,300
so when you and I were young, it was very typical to criticize the work of others.

719
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,900
And I feel like that was just in the security industry especially,

720
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,099
I think that was expected, we'll say, right?

721
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,599
And I think

722
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:17,140
now I've reached a point where I try really hard to never criticize. I, I'm

723
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,689
comfortable saying

724
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:21,060
what if we worked on it in this way?

725
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:24,530
Well, you know, but I don't like just saying, but actually, or

726
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,410
well, you know, to counter this or whatever, it's like

727
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:30,150
when someone makes a thing,

728
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,890
it almost always adds to the universe.

729
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,550
And you can easily say, oh, it could be a little better if we did this

730
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:39,829
and I'm comfortable with that. But you know what I mean?

731
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,729
And, and telling people the thing you built is crap that is

732
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,859
-- unforgivable. I think in modern society,
-- here's the

733
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,069
really high quality good critique and constructive feedback is really

734
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,660
hard because you have to be such an expert.

735
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,869
You know, like if you're going to critique somebody's food,

736
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,949
you better be Gordon Ramsay.

737
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:00,750
So

738
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:01,329
he's

739
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:02,310
a terrible example.

740
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:03,430
No, no, just wait

741
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,670
so good.

742
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,109
Good critique

743
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:06,670
is

744
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,020
fantastically hard.

745
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,020
Possibly,

746
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,739
I would say harder than actual creation and the creation of course

747
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,479
is much harder than just bad critique in tearing somebody down,

748
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:15,689
right?

749
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:19,010
Bad critique in tearing somebody down is so easy. It's so easy.

750
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,300
In fact that I have a stack of like, you know, critical thinking cards, you know,

751
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,130
where they talk about a

752
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,089
hominid and straw man and all the fallacies and attacks that people use

753
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:31,500
in bad critique, right? Like literally, I have a set of cards that say,

754
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,939
you know, when people basically are doing argumentation,

755
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,579
this is how bad argumentation works.

756
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:39,069
And it's so common that, you know, there's posters and trading cards for it.

757
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,219
And I think maybe that's the problem is

758
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,530
also if you're not an expert, how do you differentiate good from bad critique?

759
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:48,699
And it's, it's, you know, and like these people saying

760
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,739
missed password rules or,

761
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:51,410
or

762
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:53,189
whatever, we want to change passwords.

763
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:55,780
Well, when I critique them and say no changing passwords is bad,

764
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,119
how does somebody judge if my critique is good or not?

765
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,939
By definition,

766
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:01,060
they need some level of expertise that they don't

767
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:03,359
have otherwise they would be doing the critique themselves,

768
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,619
right? And I think part of it boils down to trusting experts.

769
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:08,185
So like my argument would be, look,

770
00:33:08,214 --> 00:33:11,805
Nist said this and then Nist recanted like Nist here's they,

771
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:15,064
they have a document now that says we were wrong about this, please.

772
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:16,765
For the love of Pete stop doing it

773
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,125
and people ignore it.

774
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:21,375
And so I like, I hate the appeal to authority argument, but in some cases,

775
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:23,964
the appeal to authority is the correct argument.

776
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,290
Like it is literally like this is how the world works.

777
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,680
There's stuff that's so complicated.

778
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,949
I cannot and will not understand it. I'm just going to listen to the experts on that.

779
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:35,530
Like, they keep telling me to put oil in my car but not too much and I'm, like, sure,

780
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,420
whatever, I'll believe you.

781
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,869
Because if I don't do that, I've seen the videos of what happens.

782
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:39,709
I mean,

783
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:41,280
yeah,

784
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:42,369
I agree.

785
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,729
I, I think,

786
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,890
-- I think that's the only answer. It's,
-- it's,

787
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,369
but how do we get that pool of real?

788
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,839
Like, we don't have Nobel Prizes to differentiate them

789
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:51,300
from the

790
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:55,369
security universe. No, we don't. And there's, there's loads of people I hear

791
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,209
giving talks on all kinds of topics that I think like this is,

792
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:00,739
this is outdated knowledge.

793
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:05,520
This isn't valuable anymore and, and it is like, I, I agree it's really hard and

794
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,120
I guess the one thing I will say to take away from all

795
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:12,080
of this is go read the article in the show notes and just

796
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,110
accept

797
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:19,110
that this is a fundamental truth of the universe and make a point to

798
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,270
continue to update your knowledge whenever possible.

799
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,629
Well, not just to examine your knowledge,

800
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,469
think about what you know and why you know it and how it works

801
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:30,708
and why it works and maybe why it doesn't work as well anymore.

802
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:33,860
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah, I agree. All right. I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt.
