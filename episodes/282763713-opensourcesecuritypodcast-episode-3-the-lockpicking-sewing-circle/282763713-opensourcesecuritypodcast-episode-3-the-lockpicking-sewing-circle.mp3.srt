Hi and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,619
This is Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:11,810
-- Hey, Kurt,
-- thanks, man.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,949
So this is an exciting episode.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,389
This episode will go up in a mere couple of hours probably

5
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:22,090
and it will be consumable by the universe as we announce our podcast and,

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,530
and it's gonna kind of be a big deal for us.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,729
So I'm super excited and most importantly is we get to

8
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,690
actually talk about some current news instead of recording podcast,

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,569
you know, weeks ago

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,020
that we know will be too stale to be relevant today. So that's super exciting.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,729
So I'll tell you what, uh why don't you start out what, what's,

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,500
what's new in the world?

13
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:39,810
Kurt, what do you want to talk about?

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,209
So recently I've run into a problem or a design decision made almost a decade

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,009
ago that is now coming back to haunt us again and again and again,

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,310
and that is on Linux, you got your proc slash P ID slash mem

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,169
and you can write to it and this,

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,049
this seemed like a good choice at the time

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,409
because it allowed debuggers to monkey with their own

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,389
programming.

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,839
But now it means

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,739
virtually any file over right.

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,879
Vulnerability can potentially become a code execution vulnerability.

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,160
And I've also been reading apparently a lot of user space root kits are using this.

25
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:18,419
Yeah. OK. So why don't you tell us why that is bad, first of all?

26
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,209
All right, let's, let's back it up even farther.

27
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,150
What is slash proc slash P I

28
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:25,959
slash mem? OK. What, what is it?

29
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,419
So proc is the process uh sort of memory space

30
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,209
on Linux and it's represented as a bunch of files.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,330
So you've got things like

32
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,800
uh slash proc slash the process ID and then you've got things like

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,449
the command line options, it was run with, you've got things like the,

34
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,290
the program's current memory

35
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:49,169
uh and just a whole bunch of other fiddly bits that if you're not a developer,

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,089
you don't need to care about.

37
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:55,589
And so for debugger, for, if you want to debug a program, typically,

38
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,510
what you wanna do is you want to put like a break point into the program

39
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,309
somewhere so that you can like stop it and take a look at what's going on.

40
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,180
Well, if you can modify the process's memory,

41
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:07,930
you can insert as many breakpoints and whatnot as

42
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,630
you want and you can even change things.

43
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:09,970
So

44
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,179
for example, you can stress test a program, you know,

45
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,910
you can change a setting or a variable in memory as the program executes.

46
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,699
So this is incredibly useful for debuggers.

47
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,529
But from a security point of view,

48
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,009
like I said, it means any program that has a file over right issue,

49
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,979
it can now write to itself and it can modify itself.

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,880
All right.

51
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,660
So I, I think it's also important to point out here that the, the real danger

52
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:38,449
is if you have say a web server or PHP application,

53
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,580
there's a special file called slash proc slash self,

54
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:46,389
which refers to the process itself slash met, right?

55
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,050
And that's kind of the issue is you can have

56
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:51,119
an attacker overwrite or I shouldn't say overripe but rather

57
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,199
inject code into the process, literally, which is

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,259
really exciting sounding when you're doing the red team work.

59
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,470
But when you're trying to defend,

60
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,440
this is this is a terrifying feature unquestionably and,

61
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,919
and I'm familiar with the issue you speak of

62
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:05,000
and this is something that that's actually being talked about

63
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,589
right now is what do we do with this? Because you're right.

64
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,750
This was something that was said a very long time ago

65
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,690
and the world is changing dramatically.

66
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,750
If you look 10 years ago in the open source universe,

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,789
we laughed about viruses when someone would say about, you know,

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,220
do I need a virus scanner on Linux?

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,309
We would laugh at that question.

70
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:25,039
And now when people ask that question,

71
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,970
I think that's a perfectly legitimate question.

72
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,919
And this is one of those examples of

73
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,509
we have some work to do

74
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,919
to make sure we do things the right way.

75
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,210
And now I will also say that that's some,

76
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,309
some something I know about this as well is so the slash proc

77
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,199
file system,

78
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,309
Sc Linux

79
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,699
doesn't cover that, for example.

80
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,369
So it poses some unique challenges for us and what we're going to do.

81
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,949
And so the the knee jerk reaction

82
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,050
is, well, let's just mark proc self

83
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:51,229
mem as non writeable, right?

84
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,759
But that doesn't actually solve the problem because there are some

85
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,880
other clever things you can do with the proc file system.

86
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:56,419
And so

87
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,210
what we really want to do is make sure we enhance the security of that

88
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,830
and make sure it can do things like be covered by the Linux security module.

89
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:06,080
Uh Se Linux, in our case is what we plug into that,

90
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:09,949
but also various other protections built into the operating system. Whereas

91
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,119
instead of proc being a special snowflake, let's make it follow the rules, right?

92
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,690
And that's uh in my opinion, that's totally the right way to do it.

93
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,630
Yeah, I mean, this is just one of those classic things where, you know, 10 years ago,

94
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,089
if you told me, hey, Kurt,

95
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,329
uh Red Hat is gonna run a service where we

96
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,649
let people sign up for free or almost next to nothing

97
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,269
and they upload a bunch of random code that we then run for them.

98
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,609
Uh not in a virtual machine but on

99
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:38,290
an actual like shared virtual machine with other customers

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,890
uh, I would have laughed because that would have been clearly insane.

101
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:45,920
Uh And of course, now that's the entire business model behind containers.

102
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,420
-- Yeah,
-- but we didn't say it's not insane. Right.

103
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:49,029
But

104
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,950
no, no, it's

105
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,220
a, I

106
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,609
mean, this is a huge deal. Right. Is,

107
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:54,230
there's,

108
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,720
there's this crazy convergence in the open

109
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,489
source universe of kind of features and threats

110
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:02,230
and in the real world, I mean, it,

111
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:05,570
it's like we keep talking about over and over again open source one,

112
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:06,790
everyone's using it.

113
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,149
But now the terrifying thing is because everyone's using it.

114
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,989
We have real threats, we have real dangers in this stuff. And

115
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,589
it's not like the good old days when, when Linux

116
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,910
and open source in general were relatively ignored just because they didn't have

117
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,420
a massive user base and now they have a huge user base.

118
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:27,670
And so from the security perspective, it, it's borderline terrifying.

119
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,260
Yeah.

120
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, I mean, we've got situations where, what that, uh, I wanna say that Seagate Nas

121
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,859
Drive thing is, uh,

122
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,059
there's like 88,000 of them apparently hacked

123
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,029
and running some sort of Bitcoin miner

124
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,529
that's not efficient at all. They need to buy some basics.

125
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,200
But so, so that actually leads into one of the,

126
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:50,079
the interesting news stories that I found this week was that

127
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:52,989
there's apparently a rise in telnet

128
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:57,679
activity. People are seeing who run honey pots, which is related to the, the N A

129
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:01,700
takeover because apparently what's happening is a lot of these IOT devices

130
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:02,799
are running.

131
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,859
I, I guess Linux

132
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,339
or open source in general,

133
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,859
but they're also using Telnet as one of the ways you connect to them.

134
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,299
And

135
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,700
we all know Telnet was we, we,

136
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,399
we thought it was dead because it's incredibly old and super insecure.

137
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,940
So this is, this is honestly a little terrifying to read a story like this.

138
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,019
It's actually worse than that. The problem isn't so much TNO

139
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,179
because this would also affect systems running. Ssh. The real problem is

140
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,690
a lot of these device manufacturers have

141
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,299
default accounts

142
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,130
like admin 12345.

143
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,640
Yeah.

144
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,600
Um, you know, I, I recently had to reset my,

145
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:39,809
one of my DS L devices and it took me forever

146
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,790
because they used uh 12345 instead of 1234 for the password.

147
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:47,230
And it took me a while to hunt that down. Now, the good news is,

148
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,859
yeah, the good news is on, on, you know,

149
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,959
on some of these devices you can change the administrative password

150
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,010
but on many you can't,

151
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:57,910
you know, they, or, or it's so painful that there's, you know,

152
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,540
no regular user is gonna do this, you know, like your mom or my mom, they're

153
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:01,920
not

154
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:05,410
-- painful,
-- man. I mean, I first of all, I don't want my parents

155
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,529
even touching the admin interface and anything they own.

156
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,600
But then

157
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,209
even if they knew it was there, they don't care,

158
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,959
they're not going to go in and change a password.

159
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,890
I mean, it's kind of like the old wifi used to default to open.

160
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,410
Remember where you buy your, your wifi router,

161
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,329
you plug it in and now the neighbors have internet

162
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,350
and this is a very similar problem.

163
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:24,829
Yeah.

164
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:27,989
So, I mean, the problem though is, is you,

165
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:32,200
you have a situation where legitimately you need to ship devices in

166
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:35,239
a way so that people can log in and administer them.

167
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,820
But how do you do so securely?

168
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:41,579
You know, and especially when it's a cheap device that cost maybe 20 $30.

169
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:43,380
You know, you're not going to build some huge

170
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:47,049
tool chain or some huge administrative thing that's secure.

171
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:49,100
I mean, this is a 20 $30 device that

172
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,359
uh I mean, it's,

173
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,959
it's at the point now where one of my wi fi uh access points was acting a bit flaky.

174
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,220
So I, I threw it out and

175
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,359
bought a new one,

176
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:00,220
-- right?
-- Like I, I could have troubleshooted it. But,

177
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,619
you know,

178
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:01,880
well,

179
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,279
this is gonna be one of the terrifying things about

180
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,739
iot is when something costs me literally a dollar,

181
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:11,179
I'm not gonna fix it. I'm gonna throw it away and go get a new one

182
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,750
and, and the universe is going to do this.

183
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,149
So now of course, the Bitcoin miners will,

184
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,630
will have a nearly infinite supply of devices they can use.

185
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,750
But, but as normal people,

186
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,269
I mean,

187
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,480
should we care should we just accept the fact

188
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,209
that we're gonna be throwing this crap away for?

189
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,250
-- I, I don't know. It's a weird,
-- not even cheap stuff.

190
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,559
It's, uh,

191
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,049
did you hear about the Sony Bravia 50 models of

192
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,549
their TV S or are losing the youtube app?

193
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,229
What do you mean losing the youtube app?

194
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,880
Well, it's a smart TV that has an app for youtube

195
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,659
and as I understand it there's like the old version of the

196
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,940
youtube app and the protocol or something that Google will no longer support

197
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,340
and Sony is not going to

198
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,700
ship an updated app to people. So

199
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,809
your Sony Smart TV

200
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,619
has a youtube app that won't work,

201
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,809
right? So, they're just turning it off.

202
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,309
Yeah. And, and so, and the thing is even if I,

203
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,770
if I had one of those TV, S and I wanted to fix it,

204
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,250
would I even be able to, I mean, I might technically be violating the D MC A in America.

205
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:15,940
Regardless of that, I would put a 10 to 1 odds on you bricking your TV versus fixing

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,109
what

207
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:16,289
you do

208
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,739
that.

209
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:17,929
Exactly.

210
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,429
So, you know,

211
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,169
even if you want to fix these things and even

212
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,250
if you have the technological capability to fix it,

213
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,989
it could still, it's just so

214
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,630
painful to do so that even somebody like you or I is not going to do it.

215
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:31,190
This reminds me is

216
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,270
I have a Nexus five X phone

217
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,669
and I wasn't getting my upgrade to Android seven fast enough for my liking.

218
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,789
So I decided I'm going to side load

219
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,109
Android seven onto my phone.

220
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,190
It is a horrifying user experience to do this.

221
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,710
And, and I made a comment to someone I work with who has one also.

222
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,450
I, I was like, th this was terrible.

223
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,799
I mean, I, I couldn't imagine a worse experience in this. Like it kept failing on me.

224
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,429
The error messages were cryptic and,

225
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,099
and luckily I, I knew enough that I was comfortable continuing to try.

226
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,299
But then also as it was pointed out to me,

227
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,919
is anyone willing to side load an operating system

228
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:10,250
onto their phone is clearly not the target market

229
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,489
for easy updates, right?

230
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,330
And additionally,

231
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,150
these are people who are going to be way more willing

232
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,400
to put up with a whole bunch of pain and suffering

233
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,200
in order to side load the new version of Android

234
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:24,729
regardless of how terrible the experience is. And, and that kind of hit home, right?

235
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:25,159
Is that it,

236
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,369
it's very much, there's the, the normal people universe and then there's kind of

237
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:35,739
us where we do a lot of weird stuff and we're willing to put up with a lot of pain.

238
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,500
And so, II, I don't know.

239
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,940
And I look at IOT in this context and it, it, it horrifies me a little bit because

240
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,460
I can't even keep half this stuff updated and taken care of.

241
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:48,460
And, and so normal people have have no hope. I mean, let's face it.

242
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,859
Well, and I think it's even worse than that, that the,

243
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:54,140
the economics of these devices are, they get sold and then,

244
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:58,619
well, there's no recurring revenue for the manufacturer to support it to, to want

245
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,900
them to support it. And

246
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,599
nobody in there, you know,

247
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,690
and if you try and sell a light bulb that has

248
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,179
a recurring monthly charge of $1 or even a penny,

249
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:10,640
you know, I, I recently, uh, was looking at on

250
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:10,859
Netflix

251
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,200
now

252
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,260
service camera.

253
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:14,640
Yeah.

254
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:17,590
You know, and like, for example, Nest, you know, the Nest cameras,

255
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:18,820
they now have an outdoor model,

256
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:23,080
uh, and it's 250 bucks. Ok. It's a little pricey but whatever. But

257
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,599
you then have to pay either 100 bucks a year or

258
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:30,229
$300 a year to get 10 or 30 days respectively of,

259
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:34,429
of data and of the, uh, of the, uh, video storage.

260
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:35,400
Right?

261
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:39,979
I can't, I can't buy that Nest camera and have it like stored to my local file server.

262
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:40,640
I

263
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,340
have to pay

264
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,299
Google, wait and

265
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:42,750
store

266
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:45,080
-- it.
-- So you buy the camera for money

267
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,359
and then to use the thing you just bought, you have to pay somebody more money.

268
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,049
Well, you can use it, you can watch it in real time.

269
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,690
But if you wanna have historical footage,

270
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,950
10 days or 30 days of historical footage to check,

271
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,549
which obviously is a security camera.

272
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,219
That's kind of the whole point of these things, you know,

273
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:03,549
is after the event happens you go look back and you're like, oh,

274
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,239
it's the guy in the baseball cap that did it,

275
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:06,140
you know?

276
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,599
So, yeah, you have to pay 100 bucks a year or 300 bucks a year.

277
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:12,130
Um, and, and part of it is, you know, that boils down to the,

278
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,239
they want this user experience that is painless.

279
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,609
Right.

280
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:18,080
And, you know, having people run local file servers and stuff like that is,

281
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,000
is not painless.

282
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,739
It's quite painful.

283
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:20,380
-- Yeah,
-- that's fair.

284
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:21,179
I mean, this is,

285
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,640
this kind of comes back to my complaint about some of these

286
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,659
like massive multiplayer online role playing games is either charge me per month

287
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,260
or charge me for the game.

288
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,940
I don't want

289
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,280
both of them, right?

290
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,099
Which is just like one of my pet peeves is I,

291
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:37,559
I hate that that you want me to pay for your game

292
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,739
and then to pay you once a month to play your game.

293
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,099
It's like, no, I hate that.

294
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:46,309
So I don't know, it's crazy. Uh But however, let, let's stick to IOT

295
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,669
and some other cool news. 10 million raspberry pies have been sold.

296
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,729
That's crazy, man. 10 million.

297
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,049
Well, you know, I bought two of them.

298
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:58,229
I, I bought one to act as a firewall and I bought one as a,

299
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,520
as a backup slash

300
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:01,830
three,

301
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,830
-- you know, one because
-- they're so cheap.

302
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,909
Are off

303
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,119
one of them. Is my, my DNS server in the basement. Well, my backup, my secondary DNS.

304
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,650
But then I, I do, I have a raspberry pie.

305
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,130
When the, the touchscreen came out, I bought the,

306
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,330
the touchscreen with a new pie and the touchscreen is really cool actually.

307
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,369
And, and I'm actually,

308
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,010
I'm putting together a project to do stop motion for my kids because they,

309
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,140
they got interested in stop motion animation at, at a museum this summer.

310
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,659
And so I've got it, it's nearly complete. Funny enough.

311
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:31,830
The thing that's hanging me up now

312
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,869
is I wanna over engineer this.

313
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,109
So it automatically uploads their videos to youtube and my wife is like,

314
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,130
that's ridiculous.

315
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,395
Just save it to a thumb drive or something like why are you doing this?

316
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:43,864
And I'm like, but no, it's way cooler if it uploads it magically and,

317
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,914
and so it's done except for that.

318
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,325
And so now I'm, I'm, you know,

319
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:51,085
busy not getting the work done because I'm trying to over engineer the solution.

320
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:51,554
Well,

321
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,265
it's funny that you mention that because I was actually there

322
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:57,145
was a tweet recently talking about a family privacy policy.

323
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,775
Uh and this family's privacy policy, if I remember it was three main points,

324
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:01,325
it was that

325
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,484
basically what happens at home is by default private.

326
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,549
And if you want to record,

327
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,640
you have to tell people and especially if you want to upload and share it,

328
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,849
say to Facebook or youtube,

329
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:13,489
you have to get

330
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,739
permission from everybody involved.

331
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:16,380
You know.

332
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,679
Um, and it's funny because to me, you know what,

333
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,830
you and I grew up in a world where everything that happened at

334
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,140
home was private by default and not recorded except for the neighbor lady.

335
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,500
Right.

336
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,419
Yeah. Or, you know, like a birthday party once in a while be recorded. But,

337
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,489
you know, and, and it's funny to me to be growing up in a world where, yeah,

338
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,429
my kids could record their lives 24 7 with their,

339
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,630
like ipod touch if they really wanted to,

340
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,340
you know, you know, what disappoints me

341
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:38,750
about this

342
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,169
more than anything else

343
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,169
is we walk around

344
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,130
with cameras in our pockets

345
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,590
and no one has taken a picture of Bigfoot yet.

346
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,599
Well, you know, to me that's pretty much

347
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:50,000
the

348
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:50,580
proof that

349
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,150
that's

350
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,409
true now that there are more cameras than ever.

351
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:55,780
-- There
-- are

352
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,030
-- fewer
-- pictures. Like, like if you're running from Godzilla, you

353
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:00,719
backwards and you just

354
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,190
hit

355
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,280
-- record.
-- You know,

356
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:03,000
you know, that

357
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,450
great question is if, if a monster attacked,

358
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,429
how many people would die streaming it to

359
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,549
youtube versus running and saving their own lives.

360
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,419
-- I bet the number would be significant
-- based on the

361
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:18,349
number of people that have killed themselves playing Pokemon Go,

362
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,169
uh, you know, human nature, right?

363
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,849
It's called Darwinian Evolution Curt.

364
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,840
Anyway. All right. That's enough of that.

365
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,400
Yeah, other, other exciting news

366
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,330
is

367
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,020
so we love our long passwords, right?

368
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:36,690
There was a really crazy story I ran across

369
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,880
that was talking about the last dot FM password leaks

370
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:44,409
and some of them are actually really long passwords which got me thinking, I'm like,

371
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:47,109
how on earth did somebody crack this stuff?

372
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:50,309
I mean, they're like 40 character passwords, right? Like super duper long.

373
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,150
It turns out

374
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,190
that they used lyrics to songs,

375
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,070
which I guess being a music service totally makes sense.

376
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,950
But at the same time, it really got me thinking that,

377
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,090
you know, long passwords that come from somewhere else are obviously no longer safe

378
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:05,169
because

379
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,010
if it's written down somewhere, someone's gonna figure that out.

380
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:12,289
Well, you know, it's, I think it comes, uh, to put it in geek terms,

381
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:14,210
it's a question of entropy, right?

382
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,719
And the reality is the bad guys have access to, like, the texts of

383
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:20,280
human

384
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:20,890
history,

385
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,000
all the books, all the song

386
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:23,020
ever written,

387
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,039
you know?

388
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:28,169
Yeah. And, and to be honest, it's not that big, you know, a couple.

389
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:30,809
Like I have a Kindle and, uh,

390
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,450
somebody was ribbing me for buying a Kindle because it doesn't have an SD card slot.

391
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,409
-- It
-- can hold

392
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:36,119
more

393
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,849
-- books
-- than you could read before you die. Right.

394
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,510
Yeah, exactly. It can hold three gigabytes of data.

395
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,039
And the average, like, 152 100 page book on that thing is like

396
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,580
one or 200 kilobytes.

397
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,299
So, yeah, I mean, it can hold more books than I'll ever read in a lifetime

398
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,929
and that's without a job or sleep.

399
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,179
Right. You know.

400
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:57,419
-- Right.
-- Exactly. And

401
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,619
you know, that, that always makes me sad. Is I have, uh, I bought a nook a long time ago,

402
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,460
which I, I still have

403
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:07,400
and I look at all the books I have and I get sad

404
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,420
because I, I haven't read them all and I know that there are

405
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,670
probably 10 years worth of books I have on that thing right now and it's, it's,

406
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,640
it's crazy.

407
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,979
Right. It's so easy to buy books. Or someone will mention something.

408
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:20,839
They're like, oh, yeah, I should get that. And then you could buy it

409
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,949
and then you never read it. I feel like I'm playing Pokemon where, where

410
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,689
you catch all these Pokemon

411
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,098
and then you never look at them again.

412
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,698
Well, you know, we've gone from an environment of scarcity, you know,

413
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:36,178
as a kid buying tapes or C DS was a big deal and now it's like,

414
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,088
how many hundreds of thousands of songs can you get for free

415
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:42,489
or, you know, if you're willing to spend 100 bucks on itunes?

416
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:43,438
-- It's
-- crazy.

417
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,489
You know, though, I have not bought

418
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:50,418
music in an extremely long time just because I now suffer

419
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,139
from the paradox of choice as it used to be.

420
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,818
You'd go to the record store and there were like three records.

421
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:56,698
Well, or, or C DS in most cases

422
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,430
that I actually cared about.

423
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,599
And now I look at, you know, itunes or, or Google play or whatever,

424
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:03,790
whatever it is I'm using

425
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,140
and I'm, I'm just mortified by the choices I have and then I,

426
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,719
I give up and just don't buy anything.

427
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,609
So it's,

428
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,979
it, it, I always find it comical that, that we love our choice or we think we do.

429
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,689
But then we're presented with a near infinite selection.

430
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,319
We often do nothing.

431
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,109
Well, I mean, it's, you know,

432
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,270
it's one of the fundamental things human humanity suffers from is

433
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,530
I could have made a better choice.

434
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,459
You know, what if I make a bad choice? What if I, what if I buy the wrong music? If

435
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,109
-- you're doing nothing
-- is safer than making a decision, right?

436
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,300
Which speaking of doing nothing, I, I love the,

437
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,160
the news story I'm most excited about.

438
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,329
And this is the one I'd love to talk about is

439
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:48,400
there is a, a company that claims to have a hack proof system.

440
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,199
Let, let me pull this story up because I don't, I don't remember the name of them, but

441
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:55,880
I love it when people talk like this because if there's one thing,

442
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,560
history has shown us

443
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,770
that there are no absolutes.

444
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,640
OK. So the company is calling itself hack proof Systems Incorporated

445
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,550
and they're offering $5000 to the first person who

446
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,010
can crack a server protected by their technology.

447
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,589
And of course,

448
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,709
they're, they're not incredibly detailed at what their technology is.

449
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,319
But as you can imagine, I'm sure it's something

450
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,989
incredibly advanced Right.

451
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,579
-- More to the $0.5000.
-- What

452
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:22,319
is it?

453
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:26,459
You know, when, no, when you look at what the average, even like a quote

454
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,810
unquote, low paid security professional makes.

455
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,599
-- That's basically two weeks of
-- income.

456
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,520
Look at, look at bug bounties. Right.

457
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,500
If, if you find a good security flaw, you, you could be talking 100 grand.

458
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,760
Right. And this is apparently this is hack proof technology,

459
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:45,239
which I would, I would equate would be on the level of say an iphone root kit,

460
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,920
which I know is worth multiple, hundreds of thousands of dollars.

461
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,209
Yeah, these guys are offering five grand,

462
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,400
you know,

463
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,949
things like this really drive me nuts because if they were offering $5 million

464
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,290
and it was, you know, bonded, then I'd be like, ok, maybe, maybe it's legit. But,

465
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,250
you know, it's like I could offer a hack.

466
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,000
Uh, I'll pay, you know, a dollar to break into this box. It's sitting on my desk.

467
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,839
Is it on?

468
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,329
Nobody's gonna do that because it's,

469
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,329
it's gonna cost a couple 100 bucks to get an airplane ticket over here,

470
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,319
you know, very much.

471
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:18,410
So, I mean, that's why, you know, banks don't get robbed anymore by and large is

472
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:19,319
you're

473
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:19,829
gonna get

474
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,760
a bank

475
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,469
robberies apparently are still incredibly common. I didn't know this.

476
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:27,239
I was doing some research into something else

477
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:28,079
and

478
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,680
I,

479
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:31,640
somehow I stumbled upon the fact that that the number

480
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,510
of bank robberies is still quite significant but the,

481
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,219
I mean, these guys are walking away with almost nothing. I mean, it,

482
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,410
economically speaking, you'd be better off getting a part time job,

483
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,729
almost anywhere over robbing banks.

484
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:45,719
But it's still,

485
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:49,849
I guess it's probably that mindset right where people think, oh, I'll rob the bank

486
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,819
and in reality you'd probably make more money robbing, you know, mcdonald's. But

487
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,959
it's still,

488
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,239
I, I get it right because historically speaking,

489
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,069
banks had all the money and they still do.

490
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,609
It's just money is now, you know,

491
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:04,050
data on a computer instead of stuff sitting in the big vault.

492
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,489
Well, I know the last time I looked locally in Alberta,

493
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,160
the average bank robber was making off with something like 2000 $300.

494
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,599
That's terrible. You know, which honestly if you're, if, if you're

495
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,219
well, but by definition, if you're into short term thinking,

496
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:17,119
that's a pretty good deal.

497
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,359
-- I
-- mean, that is one way to look at it, you know, and

498
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:22,579
I mean, the reality is the people that commit this kind of crime,

499
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:25,920
they're not into long term thinking and risk evaluation and, you know,

500
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,079
they're not like, well,

501
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:30,510
the chance of getting caught is 7% with an annualized rate of this.

502
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,660
And if I make, you know, 100 grand a year bank robbing,

503
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,089
but then I spend two years in jail.

504
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:34,800
Is it worth it?

505
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,170
No, they're like,

506
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:37,270
I'm gonna,

507
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,180
and half of these ones in Alberta now they don't even have a weapon,

508
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:42,849
they just pass a note to the teller and of course the banks are just, like, whatever,

509
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:44,930
give them the money, like, just make them go away.

510
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:47,790
Right. Because, you know, we don't want to know they're trained to do that.

511
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,630
Well, you know, I mean,

512
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:48,890
you,

513
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,150
well, a single medical claim is vastly more expensive.

514
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:55,170
You know, somebody even gets punched in the face.

515
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,069
So, you know,

516
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,949
I mean, what really makes me laugh here.

517
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:02,959
I don't know if you have it down there, but in Canada, in the winter all of the banks,

518
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:05,150
well, most of the banks put up signs in winter saying, you know,

519
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,670
please take off your ski mask

520
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,050
-- when you come into the bank.
-- Right?

521
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,939
No, actually, uh, ski masks are not often worn here,

522
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,790
which

523
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:19,319
I guess it is a comical problem to have is, is, you're right.

524
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:22,060
I could see that being in Canada that, that ski masks, uh,

525
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:25,079
would be expected apparel and, yeah, take it off that,

526
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,569
that's really funny.

527
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,839
If somebody walked up to me in a ski mask, I'd be like, take it and go just,

528
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,040
just leave me alone.

529
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:32,859
Yeah.

530
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:36,459
Well, I mean, you know, it's when it's minus 30 outside and blowing,

531
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:39,099
you kind of have to wear a ski mask even.

532
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,869
And, I mean, I'm talking, like, even going from the car to the door,

533
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:42,579
you know,

534
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,010
I've had people

535
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,979
travel here, you know, they get off at the airport and it's like,

536
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:47,780
did you bring your coat?

537
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,819
-- No, we just have to get to the car. Yeah. No, you're, you're going to die.
-- I,

538
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm familiar with that every now and then

539
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:58,380
it will get that cold. It's, it's fairly rare and when it does it is terrible.

540
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,699
I was actually, I was, I was on a plane one time when it was really,

541
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:06,180
really cold like that and I was honestly a little surprised that the plane, like it,

542
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:07,619
they had no real issues.

543
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,020
I was waiting for something crazy to happen because it was so cold and no,

544
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,500
it just took off and, and then I landed in,

545
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,619
I think I was going to California that time.

546
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,709
So it was a very pleasant landing coming from where I was at.

547
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:19,910
Yeah.

548
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,819
But, uh, no, I mean, it's, it's these behaviors that are

549
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:27,359
in general people don't deal well with strange behaviors,

550
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:28,319
you know?

551
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:29,510
Uh, yeah, I mean, that's

552
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,119
thousands of years of evolution on our side essentially. Right?

553
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,880
It's kind of that in order to fit in with society you need to fit in.

554
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,050
Yeah. And I mean, it was a lot like traffic, you know, if everybody,

555
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,849
like, every time I'm in traffic and somebody tries to give way to me, you know,

556
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,849
like for, like

557
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,010
they basically try to give up their right of way. It's like, no,

558
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,349
no,

559
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:47,839
just

560
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,770
doesn't work.

561
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,000
I know what you mean.

562
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,209
It is a challenge without a doubt

563
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,219
and I see a lot of that in security, you know, we say follow the rules, do this, do that.

564
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,839
But, you know, human nature when it really comes down to it, um,

565
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:03,369
people share passwords, people pick poor passwords,

566
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:04,489
you know.

567
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,819
I mean,

568
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,550
and these long passwords are interesting to me because

569
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,849
just looking at that list for a second,

570
00:24:09,189 --> 00:24:13,219
some are just like repeating strings like this one that's all

571
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:14,349
zeros,

572
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,699
you know, it's like 20 or 30 0 and then there's this one that's like a,

573
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,829
followed by just a big pile of ss,

574
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,260
you know, it, it makes me laugh because like when I, I was setting up my, uh,

575
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,660
an iphone for my mom

576
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,900
and so I entered the pass code is 1234

577
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:31,329
and it specifically warned me, are you sure you want to use that passcode?

578
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:32,859
Right?

579
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:37,290
So it's like, it's, I guess there's a short list of like bad pass codes for your phone,

580
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,920
like

581
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,680
1234 being one of them.

582
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:42,869
But realistically like with a four digit pin number, it's

583
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:46,439
chances are if you shoulder surf the person, you're gonna catch it pretty quick.

584
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:46,910
I mean,

585
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,209
my five year old son does this all the time and I've

586
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:52,219
actually gotten him trained now to the point where I say password,

587
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:55,959
you have to turn around and I, I make him turn around and face away from me.

588
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,030
Yeah. You know, I

589
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,270
taught my kids that as well at a young age where they would,

590
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,790
they'd stare at me while I was typing a password and I'd say look away, you can't,

591
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,699
you can't see me do this.

592
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:06,449
And now, yeah,

593
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,699
they've reached a point that when they see the password dialogue appear,

594
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,550
they look away, which is really funny.

595
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,319
Yeah.

596
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:11,489
Well,

597
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,060
and this is also the reason I upgraded to

598
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:15,180
an iphone IE because it has the fingerprint scanner.

599
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,000
Literally,

600
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,939
the reason I upgraded my phone now is so I don't

601
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,689
have to deal with my five year old trying to shoulder sur

602
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:22,430
which kind of has its own set of problems because so

603
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,939
I have a fingerprint scanner on my phone as well.

604
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,369
And I will occasionally turn it off depending upon

605
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:31,819
what I'm doing and where I'm going because I found out that

606
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:32,849
in the US,

607
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,959
you don't have to give out your password to authorities,

608
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:37,849
but

609
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:41,969
they can, they can basically touch your phone to your finger

610
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,380
and that's not illegal.

611
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,119
And so that's like it's really something else. I mean,

612
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,199
it, it kind of comes back, you know, tying this back to passwords is

613
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,310
it's one thing when you have a password, you know,

614
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:58,369
but your fingerprint and you know, legally speaking is not the same thing,

615
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,670
whereas you can often use both of those things to accomplish the same outcome,

616
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,150
which is fascinating to me.

617
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:06,989
Well, I think a lot of what it boils down to is

618
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,270
-- unless it's in your head, it's not private anymore. Even
-- that,

619
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:10,920
even

620
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,050
if

621
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:11,339
they,

622
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,699
even if they couldn't compel true. I mean,

623
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:16,189
and even if they didn't,

624
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,339
even if they weren't allowed to compel you to touch your finger to the phone,

625
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:22,510
they could just take your fingerprints and build a 3D model off of it using,

626
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,300
uh,

627
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,459
well, 3D.

628
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:26,349
And here's what blows me away about 3D printers now is

629
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,449
they have one at Costco for 30 bucks for little kids.

630
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:28,949
-- A
-- 30

631
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,270
-- dollar 3d
-- printer.

632
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,469
I'm assuming the business model is cheap printer.

633
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:34,890
-- I
-- mean,

634
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,300
it's like this,

635
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,979
it's this little plastic spool printer.

636
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,589
And, well, have you also seen the pen one?

637
00:26:42,189 --> 00:26:46,369
So you have this pen that extrudes hot plastic, essentially that cools really fast.

638
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,930
So you can basically draw in 3D.

639
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,410
That's fascinating. So, so you're the printer?

640
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:52,209
Yeah.

641
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,270
Yeah. It's like 20 bucks or something.

642
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:56,489
It's, it, it just blows me away.

643
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,650
Unbelievable.

644
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,410
Wow. That's so crazy.

645
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,520
Yeah, I, no, the, the, the, what, what really blows me away is,

646
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,780
I'm looking at the toys that are available to my kids now and,

647
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:11,479
you know, they're the science fiction for us from, well, even five or 10 years ago,

648
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:12,589
little 20.

649
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:18,189
Ok. The 3D printing pen I'm seeing here is 9995

650
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,900
but I'm not seeing a $30 3D printer

651
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,739
on the internet.

652
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,560
But regardless, having a 3D printing pen is crazy.

653
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,560
That's amazing to me.

654
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:33,410
And I think it's,

655
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,469
it's probably worth pointing out here since this

656
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,670
is a an open source security podcast.

657
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,270
There is a very open source friendly printing company called Lulls

658
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:42,420
Bot.

659
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:46,449
And we've got a guy at Redhead, actually, his name is uh Spot Tom Calloway.

660
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,530
And he goes to these conferences and he always

661
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,949
brings his 3d printer and he's printing stuff nonstop.

662
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:55,900
And it, it's just fascinating because everybody just stands there and watches and,

663
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,729
I mean, it, it's not as unique as it used to be

664
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,750
because I remember like 34 years ago he'd show up with

665
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,839
this stuff and there'd be a crowd of people and I,

666
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,130
I was one of them where you just,

667
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,089
it was hypnotic watching this stuff work because it was

668
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:11,339
so bizarre and unlike anything you've ever seen before,

669
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:15,359
well, it's like watching a plant grow but, you know, speed it up, right?

670
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:16,319
It's just this, this,

671
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,260
no, this thing takes shape.

672
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,280
You start with literally nothing and then boom, you have this 3D object that just

673
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,949
magically appeared out of

674
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:25,260
chair.

675
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:26,969
It's

676
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,310
a

677
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,380
weird,

678
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,180
weird new problems and, and issues to do.

679
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:36,359
I mean, it's like when they 3D printed the, the TS a keys

680
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,510
for, for your luggage right now, anyone literally can unlock any

681
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,880
airplane ts a style lock which is crazy

682
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,849
or you can just use a ballpoint pen.

683
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,069
But, uh,

684
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,510
well, I mean, you know, speaking of that, like the, uh, the bidding on the, um,

685
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:53,949
what is it?

686
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:57,050
The New York State elevator access keys,

687
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,290
uh, you know, the bidding is how deep the key is cut at various places.

688
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,189
Well, the key is actually called,

689
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,900
it's like the 6426 key or something and that's the actual bidding for the key.

690
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,219
So, you know, it's,

691
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:10,750
that is fantastic.

692
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,819
I mean, let's face it, man. Security through obscurity doesn't work.

693
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:16,939
I think that's a given and that is one of the,

694
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,160
well, it works until it fails and then you have. no,

695
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,439
that's,

696
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:21,390
there's

697
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,189
nothing you can do that

698
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,939
I do. That is one of the things I love

699
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:28,979
about the whole open source universe is it's very difficult to hide these things.

700
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:29,739
And so

701
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,689
you kind of when you design it from the start

702
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,979
with the thought that this will be wide open,

703
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,219
it really makes you

704
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:38,449
think long and hard about how to do it. Right.

705
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:41,699
Well, that's one of the things I love, you know, working here at Red Hat is

706
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,619
I don't live in daily fear of somebody getting access to our source code.

707
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,020
Whereas if I worked for Microsoft or Apple,

708
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,469
you know, that

709
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,229
would,

710
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:53,670
I mean, remember when the Windows source code was leaked online, you know,

711
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,109
way back in the day, a bit of it.

712
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,040
You know, it was a huge

713
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:57,810
debt

714
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,630
-- problem.
-- I, I worked here when that happened

715
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,579
and

716
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,569
I know it was,

717
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,699
we were very particular about do not look

718
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:09,270
at this code because there's immense legal ramifications.

719
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,300
If you look at the window source code and then you write open source software

720
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,270
because

721
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,290
if you're using any of those ideas that you have some significant, you know,

722
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:21,250
intellectual property concerns.

723
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:24,369
Yeah. No, it's just, it's one of those things where it's, uh,

724
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:28,890
but I mean, I, I, that is a very difficult philosophy to apply,

725
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,770
uh,

726
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:33,969
to certain parts of the physical security world. So, for example, I mean,

727
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,160
uh, locks, locks are a good example of where the lock mechanism itself,

728
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,290
you want people to beat on and find flaws.

729
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,920
Um, I don't know if you've seen this youtube channel,

730
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,290
I forget the name of it.

731
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,430
But this guy basically is a locksmith and he

732
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:48,469
takes locks apart and shows you how they work

733
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,239
and then he's got this thing where people send him locks that he then picks

734
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:55,910
and these people do all sorts of crazy things and, you know,

735
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,010
it takes them on average five minutes to open these locks,

736
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:01,069
right? Like this person sent him this crazy bike lock from Japan.

737
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:04,069
It looks really awesome. It's, you know, it looks amazing.

738
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,959
And then the guy like, peels the plastic off and he's like, ok, yeah,

739
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:08,699
it's welded up really well, blah, blah, blah.

740
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:11,790
But the actual lock mechanism itself was like, it took him like three minutes.

741
00:31:13,449 --> 00:31:14,510
That's fantastic.

742
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,569
Now, have you ever picked a lock before?

743
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:21,410
I have picked a very cheap padlock that was

744
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,319
literally like put a flathead screwdriver in turn.

745
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,369
And I mean, that's the real ugly truth of some of these locks is they're so,

746
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:33,869
uh, like, mechanically weak that you, you don't even, you can just overpower them.

747
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,900
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. That's probably,

748
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,010
I know that that's one of the things I love doing.

749
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,500
And in fact, this is for,

750
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,239
for those of you out there in the universe when you go to a hacker con,

751
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:44,439
there's generally a lock pick village

752
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:48,819
and you sit down at a table and there's usually locks and picks and all this stuff and,

753
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:50,000
and I, I love to pick locks.

754
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,500
It's

755
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,910
one of those things that is just fascinating to you.

756
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,530
I won't say I'm a pro at it by any means, but I do enjoy it.

757
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:59,489
And the beauty of the lock pick village is you sit down at

758
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,099
a table and other people come and you all sit together and,

759
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:06,250
and while you're like, picking locks by itself is a very boring thing to do.

760
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,689
If that's all you're focused on, you're gonna go nuts in about two minutes.

761
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:12,260
But it's awesome when you sit there at a table full

762
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,060
of people and you talk about whatever and you meet,

763
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,660
I honestly, I've had some of the best conversations at,

764
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,699
at Khan's sitting at the lock pick table.

765
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,839
You know, it always, whenever I see those,

766
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,770
it always reminds me of like sewing circles.

767
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,459
You know,

768
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:29,900
it's, you got this thing to like make work with your hands.

769
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,900
It's, it doesn't require all your concentration, but a little bit. And,

770
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,930
yeah, it's kind of

771
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,229
like a

772
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,339
fantastic comparison. Kurt. The lock picking sewing circle.

773
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,050
I love it.

774
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,609
That's, that's awesome.

775
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,099
Oh, man. I can't think of a better way

776
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,739
to put this one to bed

777
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,060
a

778
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:49,410
lot of picking sewing circle. I love it.

779
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,349
All right, man.

780
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:55,089
Well, well, it's been fun and I guess until next week when I'll be at my remote,

781
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:56,949
undisclosed location for recording

782
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,750
and, and with that,

783
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,750
take care Kurt and have a good week and I'll talk to you soon.

784
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,569
You too. Thanks.

785
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,540
Bye folks.
