Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast. Holiday special. 2018.

1
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,299
I wanted you to call it the holiday spectacular car. Wait Christmas special.

2
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,729
We're gonna call it the Christmas special.

3
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,100
Oh, well, I don't think Christmas is all special.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,290
Not anymore GDPR is gonna ruin it. Right.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,090
Yeah, pretty much.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,010
Oh, sweet. No.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,689
So, anyway, the plan this year is, is in the past couple of years for Christmas,

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,750
we've done a silly show

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,869
and it's always been in the context of Santa Claus, hasn't it?

10
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:38,610
But anyway, this year,

11
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:41,119
basically what we did is we took GDPR and kind

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,950
of broke it down and decided we're going to talk about

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,590
how, and if GDPR is going to apply to Santa Claus because let's face it.

14
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:49,860
If there's anyone

15
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,110
that has more information on us than Google and Facebook, it's Santa Claus. Right.

16
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:55,459
I would agree.

17
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:58,529
I mean, it, it goes back to when I was a kid, right? Like,

18
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,409
not just me but my parents talk about it, you know.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,879
-- That's right, man. You better behave or like Santa is watching,
-- right?

20
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:07,250
It's not going to bring you any stuff.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,290
Uh Saint Nick. That's so confusing that, that's something.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,870
Do you do Saint Nick in Canada? We do Saint Nick up here where I live.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,069
My mother is German. So we did Saint Nick. Yes.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,220
What is it like? December 5th or something?

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,029
Yeah, you put out your shoe, your clog and you leave out a carrot for his donkey.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,139
Uh The Germans don't do slave pete. So it's a little bit less

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,949
terrible than, for example, maybe what

28
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:29,169
the Dutch,

29
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:31,309
the Dutch have. Saint Nick with slave Pete.

30
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:32,730
He's got

31
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:32,940
a,

32
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,889
he's basically got a slave. Right.

33
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,080
-- So, it's, yeah, it's,
-- uh, oh, well, he, I mean, he has an army of slaves,

34
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:40,779
I guess elves we call them.

35
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,440
But whatever. Anyway, whatever.

36
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:46,010
The, the man, I actually, you know what, I'll put a link in the show notes for this one.

37
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:46,599
There's

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:46,730
a

39
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,800
David Sedaris has a really funny bit.

40
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:53,745
He does where he kind of goes through a lot of the Santa mythos across Europe.

41
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:56,605
And of course, in his typical, humorous way, it's,

42
00:01:56,614 --> 00:02:01,025
it's absolutely fantastic the way he picks on just some of the madness behind these,

43
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:02,065
these Santa myth.

44
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:05,574
Right. Right. Anyway, so on

45
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:05,894
with the

46
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:06,165
show

47
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:09,375
when you think about this stuff and I think that's where we're going to end up.

48
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,434
Let's not think too hard. All right.

49
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,164
If we think too hard we're going to ruin

50
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,785
what's already a show on extremely questionable ground.

51
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,860
Yeah. So, the GDPR.

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,080
Right. Right.

53
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:24,869
So, what I did and and this is actually something I'll,

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,740
I'll just put in as a side note is.

55
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,410
So I went through the GDPR.

56
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,309
It's got 99 articles and I thought about which ones of

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,529
these are worth talking about in the context of Santa Claus.

58
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:34,889
And

59
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,250
in all seriousness,

60
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,770
if you're in an organization that needs to care about this stump,

61
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:42,029
this was a really interesting thought exercise for me because I, it,

62
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,009
it made me frame things in a manner.

63
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,539
I've never done before and I've been through these terrible 99 articles in the

64
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,410
past and I didn't ever think of them the way I did this time.

65
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,160
So I guess just as a side note, if you need to do some sort of, I,

66
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:56,490
I guess

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,410
training or, or even

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,270
just, just

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,149
circling

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,389
up. Yeah. Right. Exactly. A thought exercise in GDPR.

71
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,149
Like a sand table exercise.

72
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,429
-- Yes.
-- There you go. There you go. Alright.

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,710
So, anyway, on with the show, I guess I've got,

74
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,179
uh, we'll start with articles one through 12.

75
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,529
I've noted those as boring details about GDPR. So we're just going to skip those.

76
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:17,899
Right.

77
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,380
Yeah,

78
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,339
pretty much.

79
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:19,940
And,

80
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,000
and we'll get to articles 13 and 14 is where we'll start and

81
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,770
these are basically the right to be told of what is collected.

82
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:27,509
And when, and so

83
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:31,339
we all know Santa has an extensive list that he apparently checks twice.

84
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,259
But the question is,

85
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,440
what is he collecting on us? And when is he getting it

86
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,050
and I, I have no idea.

87
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,020
So my understanding is at a minimum.

88
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:42,160
I mean, he would have to have your name and address

89
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,550
and whether you're naughty or nice.

90
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,479
Is that all he has? Actually, actually

91
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:50,589
in every Santa story I've ever seen,

92
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,389
he always knows details about the people he's speaking to.

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,229
So he clearly is collecting more than just if you're naughty or nice.

94
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,350
He's collecting information about your naughty and nice activities.

95
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:04,830
Well, it's funny, I was talking to somebody about this in terms of A I and for example,

96
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:09,160
can an A I come up with some sort of statement about a group of people,

97
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,399
for example, like, you know,

98
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,470
most of these people are women or most of these people are left handed or whatever

99
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:18,279
and then remember that but forget the data though it was fed to learn that

100
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,119
and be like GDPR and privacy compliant where you essentially say like, look,

101
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,160
we don't have the data,

102
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,040
we just have the the outcome or the results of the data

103
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:30,000
uh that's actually covered somewhere down lower if I recall correctly.

104
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,970
Yeah. Um but so in this case, clearly, that's not the case, right?

105
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,230
Because like you said, he knows details now that you Yeah,

106
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,750
yeah, you know, J Little Judy,

107
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,980
what about when you punched Little Billy in the face or whatever,

108
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,089
which now leads itself to the question?

109
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,420
Does Santa have a data protection officer?

110
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,880
Is it like the Elf on the shelf. Is it? I don't know,

111
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,239
I, I don't know of one.

112
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,600
I think the answer is we, we can't conclusively say yes or no

113
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,119
-- because additionally,
-- I guess you'd have to write to him. And

114
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,640
that is true. We could ask who their DPO is and,

115
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:00,399
and

116
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,519
I, I have not had any success getting Santa to acknowledge my GDPR request to date.

117
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:08,670
And maybe it's just because I live in North America. I'm not exactly sure.

118
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:09,589
That's a good point.

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,149
I would assume, based on, based on Santa's logistics expertise and chain,

120
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:15,609
I,

121
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,820
-- I would assume he's capable of having AD P
-- O.

122
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:19,470
You'd hope so.

123
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,970
Which actually because no offense if you can, if you can deliver globally

124
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,209
overnight,

125
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,679
-- then clearly you're, you're, you're not some like small town like two
-- bit

126
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,149
fair.

127
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,119
That's fair, which actually this kind of lends itself into article 15.

128
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,239
Now is there's

129
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,390
uh the right to be told how your data is being used

130
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,329
and it also kind of specifies, you know, how do we,

131
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,350
how do we ask for this and log a complaint?

132
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,850
Right? Which again, we, we have no idea.

133
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:46,850
I guess writing to Santa appears to be not working, maybe,

134
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,570
maybe we could go to the mall.

135
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,570
Well, no, no, no, he's, he's very explicit.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,089
He uses the data to populate a naughty and nice list.

137
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,670
Uh

138
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah. OK.

139
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:01,540
I guess although, although he also knows what I want for Christmas,

140
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:02,980
which is an additional detail.

141
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:03,309
Right.

142
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,850
True.

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,529
And again, but that's explicit. He knows what you want for Christmas,

144
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,929
-- which I never freaking get.
-- And I'm hoping it's because you told him

145
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:14,769
uh maybe he's got some sort of, you know.

146
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:18,290
Yeah, the surveillance of the Elf on the shelf or something, collecting that data.

147
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:18,739
Stupid

148
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,799
-- Elf.
-- Actually, it's probably based on browser activity. I mean, I,

149
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,380
-- I'm
-- not

150
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:22,630
doing

151
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:23,529
anything.

152
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,309
I remember as a kid I'm

153
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:26,700
on

154
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:27,190
the.

155
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,890
Yeah. Yeah, just when I die, please delete my browser history.

156
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,510
Um,

157
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,269
but no, I remember as a kid going through catalogs looking at toys and, you know,

158
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,700
like the Sears catalog or Canadian tire catalog and

159
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,549
-- that kind of stuff.
-- The Canadian tire catalog. Does it have more than tires in it?

160
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:46,739
Yeah. They, they're like a quasi

161
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,429
department outdoor store

162
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,059
and

163
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:52,250
they basically sell a lot of useful stuff like toys,

164
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,470
outdoor camping gear. All your Christmas crap. Well, all the holiday,

165
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,269
you know?

166
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,239
Ok.

167
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:02,230
-- They even sell potato chips and candy
-- and tires. Do they sell tires?

168
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,119
Tell me they sell tires.

169
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,920
Yeah, that's actually where my winter tires because, well, I live, like,

170
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,109
across the street from a large Canadian tire.

171
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,279
So it's just easy to get my tires done.

172
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,720
-- Now, do they sell more than just tires at the shop or is it only tires
-- at the

173
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,910
everything? Yeah. No, it's all the auto parts. Like it's, it's the,

174
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:18,369
yeah,

175
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,160
they actually were the ones that did that where they

176
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,119
built a truck out of ice that actually works.

177
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,299
Um, it was an ad for, um, for a car battery, you know, that the,

178
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:27,989
the car battery works in cold weather.

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,489
So, well,

180
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,100
all right,

181
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,829
-- anyway, you live somewhere where
-- it gets,

182
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,589
it does get cold, but I've never

183
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,390
seen a truck built out of ice.

184
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,230
So, so there's that.

185
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:43,329
So I think Santa's sort of in the clear here because he's very explicit that you know,

186
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,399
he knows what you want for Christmas and he knows if you've been naughty or nice

187
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,230
-- and he knows the details.
-- Well, actually it's more complicated

188
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,730
because I should be able to ask him

189
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:53,329
these questions

190
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,779
and I don't have a way to do that. So we think we know it. He's

191
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,089
yeah, he doesn't reply,

192
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,570
right? For some reason

193
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:01,929
in

194
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,369
Canada,

195
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,940
he must be closer to the North Pole.

196
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,329
Yeah,

197
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,260
you just write to Santa postal code H zero H zero

198
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:12,010
-- H zero North Pole
-- and a reply comes back to you.

199
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,440
You should send him a GDPR request and see what happens.

200
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,679
-- I don't think Canada post is going to care for
-- that. This is important stuff.

201
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,959
Kurt, you need to do this because in America when we mail Santa,

202
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,359
we don't get replies usually,

203
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,529
right?

204
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,470
Unless someone replies,

205
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,109
right.

206
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,429
-- But anyway, anyway,
-- but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Santa,

207
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,739
he lives in like international waters.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Well, it doesn't matter

209
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,539
because actually this is,

210
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,070
this is also defined later on in the GDPR statutes or articles, I should say

211
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,849
where they basically say

212
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:50,840
-- we don't care where you are if you are in.
-- But he has no revenue.

213
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,099
That's actually a fair point because really the, the way this is enforced is,

214
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:57,419
is they're assuming

215
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:01,010
that nearly every company has some sort,

216
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,320
some sort of financial footprint in Europe.

217
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,729
And if you don't have any financial footprint in Europe

218
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:06,890
then

219
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:08,450
-- there's nothing they can do
-- to

220
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:08,729
-- you.
-- Yeah.

221
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,520
You know, he's like spacex,

222
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:12,530
his logistics chain

223
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,059
is like magic in the air. Like it's, you know, he doesn't have like,

224
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,080
spots at the airports in Europe or, or warehouses.

225
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,570
Yeah, you are right. He does however, use their airspace and

226
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,450
I wonder if they would go so far as to shoot him down

227
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,609
for, I'm gonna just go out

228
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,969
on a limb and say

229
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,239
the optics on that action would be, let's just say negative.

230
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,179
I think

231
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,119
that's a fair observation that,

232
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,719
that shooting down Santa Claus would be frowned upon

233
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,010
even if he is violating multiple international treaties.

234
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,619
Uh, a nightmare before Christmas they did that.

235
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,280
Uh That's right. They did. You're right.

236
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,130
They shot down Jack Skellington, although that wasn't actually Santa,

237
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,559
but they did think it was Santa.

238
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,479
So

239
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:05,710
we'll put it in the plausible camp, plausible

240
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:07,320
myth, plausible.

241
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,719
All right. So anyway, uh, right, to be forgotten and write to rectifications here.

242
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:14,849
So let's say

243
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,229
I'm on the naughty list and I don't think I should be, I guess first of all,

244
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,929
I need to send a submit a request.

245
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,229
Figure out I am on the naughty list and then I can say, oh, no, no.

246
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,219
Uh I didn't beat Kurt up at that party.

247
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:27,710
He slipped and fell and hit his head, for example, right

248
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,989
on your fist, right. Accidentally.

249
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:31,789
See,

250
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,739
I'm curious about this one because technically don't you

251
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,619
age out of the Santa system at 18,

252
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,950
do you? I don't know.

253
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:37,489
I'm

254
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:37,969
pretty

255
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:38,309
sure,

256
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,340
I don't know. The rules is, I mean, we could,

257
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:40,840
-- I
-- was

258
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,340
told

259
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:42,640
you were told that.

260
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,260
I think so. Well, it's, it's, that's, that's what I'm led to believe.

261
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,940
I, I have no idea that that's a good question.

262
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,080
Does he only collect data on Children and actually Children under 16 have special

263
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,140
rules as well versus Children over the age of 16 in the GDPR world?

264
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,500
So,

265
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,210
uh, Santa is only collecting data on Children. That's interesting.

266
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:03,570
Now, ah, ah, however, however,

267
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:08,479
having just watched multiple Santa Claus movies with my Children recently,

268
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:09,809
this is fresh in my mind.

269
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,250
Santa Claus consistently speaks to adults

270
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,489
and knows information about them, including, like,

271
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,719
what they maybe did or didn't get as Children or

272
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,679
in some cases what they did or didn't get,

273
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:25,570
you know, maybe in recent years suggesting he, he does not abandon adults.

274
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,109
Well, I'm not saying he abandons adults but he, he, he basically stops,

275
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,260
well,

276
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,210
-- he stops giving them presents or
-- maybe we're just all

277
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:36,710
on the naughty list automatically because we're terrible people,

278
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,729
-- which I, I won't argue with
-- most of.

279
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,869
Yeah, I was gonna say most adults I've met,

280
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,309
I was going to say with respect to article 16, the right to rectification.

281
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,869
All the,

282
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,500
all the situations I've seen with Santa

283
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,700
where he somehow had wrong information or something

284
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,330
he did correct it.

285
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:55,789
-- He does try to right his wrongs.
-- OK? Uh We could,

286
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,460
I'm trying to think of an example, but I, I think that's probably fair.

287
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,820
This isn't like dealing with the credit union or the, the Credit Reporting Bureau,

288
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,559
you know, where you have the right to correct your data.

289
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,010
But

290
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,440
good luck with that,

291
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:08,840
right?

292
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:09,440
You have to,

293
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,739
you have to write the the question or rather you have to

294
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,460
submit the request on the skin of a shaven yak and then

295
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,099
right. Right. Uh OK. OK.

296
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,109
Let's see.

297
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,450
Let's keep moving because we have,

298
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,969
we actually have quite a lot of these to get through.

299
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:25,969
So article 18 is basically the right to restriction of processing.

300
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:29,799
Uh This is essentially from what I read things like if

301
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:32,840
the data is wrong perhaps and they processed wrong data.

302
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,390
And, and that one, I won't lie to you.

303
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,450
That one was kind of less clear to me as to what it meant. But there's,

304
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,039
there's also in article 19 was interesting. So

305
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,549
this is where you obviously,

306
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,380
in most cases people are working or I should say people organizations

307
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,289
are working with other organizations and you're sharing data to a degree.

308
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,719
And for example, if, if you update data

309
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,059
based upon it being incorrect,

310
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,260
then you have to let other organizations that might have the bad data know, hey,

311
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,299
I've updated this

312
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,289
and you need to update your data too.

313
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:07,820
And so an instance I could think of here is when like one of Santa's helpers

314
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,580
maybe learn some new information about you being not naughty.

315
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:16,450
-- It would be his responsibility to let Santa know for example. So
-- I,

316
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:17,239
yeah,

317
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,809
and I would further say Santa does let us know by either we get presents or we don't.

318
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,700
-- That's our notification.
-- That's a crappy notification man.

319
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,650
That's like that's like saying the bank forgot to

320
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:29,679
tell you they're going to come foreclosing your house,

321
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,130
right?

322
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,200
Like that. Don't, don't do that. That's not, that's not cool.

323
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:37,520
No, I, I what the thing is, do they specify how notification happens?

324
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:38,429
Does it?

325
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,219
They are, I'm pretty sure they specified that you have to mail them something and

326
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,630
well, he's effectively not mailing you something,

327
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,559
but he's having a private courier in effect

328
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:48,239
it. I'm

329
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,489
pretty

330
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,479
-- sure and it's a non, no, I'm
-- gonna say that

331
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,900
-- I think legally
-- that no way, man, that,

332
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,679
that is not making it out

333
00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:00,200
of the the there, there's like a group responsible for overseeing this.

334
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,150
They're not judges, they have a fancy name. I forget it off the top of my head.

335
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:06,260
But there's no way they're going to agree to that. No way. Right.

336
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,320
It's going to have to be like a proper

337
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:09,880
-- written notification.
-- Get

338
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,349
-- a card
-- with

339
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:10,880
-- your
-- gift.

340
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,210
-- There's a written card with your gift.
-- I never got cards. I had my name written.

341
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,710
I had my name written on a, on a box. Basically a wrap present for real.

342
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,390
You must have a fancy Santa up there in Canada.

343
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,460
All right. Well, we'll keep going. Keep going. Uh Let's see here.

344
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,969
We've got data portability is article 20

345
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,599
this needs to be in a machine readable format.

346
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:36,640
So I can essentially request my data and say, give it to me

347
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:40,219
-- and then I could theoretically bring it somewhere else.
-- Here's a thought.

348
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:42,580
So I have seen where parents have gotten whether or

349
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,719
not the kid is naughty or nice and told the child

350
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,200
under GDPR my understanding was that that essentially like

351
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,099
c

352
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,010
like the,

353
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,450
the legal guardian or legal parent or essentially whoever's acting in legal.

354
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,409
Uh I don't want to say control,

355
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,650
but essentially whoever's in legal control of that entity, if they're a child

356
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,690
would be the one that represents that child. Right? Sure.

357
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,849
And so I would say for this case, that's, that's no problem because

358
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,609
yeah,

359
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:10,539
adults regularly contact Santa to find out if the kid is on

360
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:13,250
the naughty or nice list and then they regularly tell their Children,

361
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:14,729
you know, oh, you're being naughty.

362
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:17,039
You're not going to get any presents for Christmas. It's not a machine.

363
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:17,619
It's a, well,

364
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:22,039
no, no, no, no, but the, the transaction with the parents

365
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,419
uh must be, I mean, I'm assuming they use email or text or something.

366
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:27,059
Uh

367
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:29,299
My reading of this was

368
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,590
no

369
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,960
where the, the data he has.

370
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:37,280
Although I wonder if data not stored in electronic format is subject to this as well.

371
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:37,780
That's

372
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,840
it is.

373
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:39,950
Hm,

374
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:44,239
I, I don't know the answer to that because like, like in every particular.

375
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:48,130
So wait, can you have a note from GDPR by basically being like, we don't even, we're,

376
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,250
we're so old fashioned, we don't even have it.

377
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,690
We don't even have punch cards. We just have like literally paper lists.

378
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,770
I feel like the answer to that is going to be no.

379
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,440
And I don't think they necessarily cover that situation.

380
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,729
In fact, now that you bring this up and I'm thinking about it, I don't recall

381
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:06,780
this sort of situation being explicitly covered, but at the same time, like,

382
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:09,020
nobody doesn't have electronic records.

383
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,659
Now, in, in every Santa movie I've seen, his list is written on paper.

384
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,020
It is, it is never or, or he knows it. It's in his head.

385
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,479
I, I've never seen Santa using a computer. I've just checked

386
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:20,780
Futurama.

387
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,210
He is a computer in Futurama.

388
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:23,190
-- Yes,
-- exactly.

389
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,159
So while, yeah,

390
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:27,510
while the drafters of the GDP are intended for it to be technology neutral,

391
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,190
the regulation only applies to two situations where processing

392
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,309
of personal data is conducted by quote automated means,

393
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,650
unquote.

394
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,349
And number two,

395
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,239
where processing of personal data is not conducted by automated means,

396
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,010
but the data forms part of a filing system or is intended for part of a filing system.

397
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,969
So clearly, Santa has a filing cabinet.

398
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:43,630
His list,

399
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,380
we've consisted, I've seen, no, I've seen

400
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,309
several movies where he has filing cabinets,

401
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,630
you know, and the, the files are organized alphabetically from A to Z.

402
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,669
Right. I mean, that's well known,

403
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,200
the Naughty and nice List. It's well known that it's alphabetically or

404
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,130
organized.

405
00:16:58,429 --> 00:16:59,400
That's a filing system,

406
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:03,299
you know, I would have done it by date of birth. But what do I know?

407
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:06,060
So,

408
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,260
-- yeah. No, I would say that this definitely applies to him then.
-- Ok. Ok. That's fair.

409
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,420
I'm, I'm, I'm comfortable with that. I feel like that would be fair.

410
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,540
But at the same time

411
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,459
I would be extremely interested in knowing

412
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,839
of any organization not using electronic records.

413
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,910
Right. That would be madness.

414
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:25,729
Well, I mean, there's lots of organizations that use, you know,

415
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,420
paper and pen to put stuff down but

416
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,500
then hopefully it's getting into electronic records.

417
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,579
Like, oh, I don't know, the health industry.

418
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,489
Uh,

419
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,729
they, so actually I was,

420
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:39,410
I just went to the doctor and literally everything they do now is all on a computer.

421
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,770
They, they did not write anything down with a pen at all during my visit.

422
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,380
I know locally, like when the computer systems crash,

423
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,439
-- they go back to pen and paper because, well, you have to, uh,
-- that, that's fair.

424
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:51,359
I can understand that.

425
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:54,489
But again, it's going to probably make its way into electronics records.

426
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,479
So anyway, we got a lot to go. Let's keep going.

427
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:59,839
Uh, there is article 21 right to object.

428
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,640
This is obviously now, no,

429
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,954
this one was interesting because I know you've brought up in the past

430
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:07,415
on GDPR things like you can't ask your bank to forget about you.

431
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:08,474
And this covers that

432
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,194
you have a business reason

433
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:10,854
right

434
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:13,114
-- there is
-- if you have a clear business need to

435
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,035
know about this person

436
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:17,015
and, and there's even more uh it's,

437
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,685
it's covered somewhere else where things like they, they call it like,

438
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:23,094
0 23 has various restrictions like national security.

439
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:26,064
For example, you can't tell the police or, or whoever, you know, hey,

440
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:26,714
forget about me.

441
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:27,744
They're like, no,

442
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,114
definitely not.

443
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,520
Uh But 22 I thought was interesting.

444
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,900
This is the right not to be subjected to automated decision making

445
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:39,510
where obviously this, this actually goes back to your question about if the A I

446
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,160
decides a group of people is say men or women,

447
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,900
you can object to that and say, you know, you can't use my data for a purpose like this.

448
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,069
And now, now this begs the question,

449
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:52,780
does Santa have automated decision making for the Nadia?

450
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,969
Nice list or, or is this some sort of conscious effort

451
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,369
also

452
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:01,589
uh let's assume automated or non automated grading system.

453
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,530
-- Is it an arbitrary grading system or does he like grade on a
-- curve?

454
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,560
It's pretty arbitrary because I know some kids that should be on

455
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:10,089
the naughty list that got a whole lot of presents last year

456
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,079
and maybe he's grading on a curve.

457
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:15,119
So there's like a small group of kids at the tail end pulling it,

458
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,599
-- you know, the average up or
-- down.

459
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:21,050
And we all know that Santa prefers wealthy families to poor families, right?

460
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,400
In terms of delivering presents. So there's that also,

461
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,979
I suspect Santa's grading on a curve

462
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:28,859
because that would explain some of the disparity,

463
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,069
right?

464
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,959
Because there's kids that have objectively been just as terrible as other kids.

465
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:36,030
-- And that one is classified as naughty and one is classified as not right
-- now.

466
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,290
I would,

467
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,250
I would be willing to say that Futurama

468
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,670
Santa is using an automated decision making process,

469
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:42,030
right?

470
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,300
Unquestionably as he is a robot.

471
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,189
So by definition,

472
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,260
it's automated.

473
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,239
Well,

474
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:51,619
the Santa didn't do it. Remember he had a computer, the Naughty Nice

475
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,939
Ron or whatever it was called. We'll have to find a picture of it.

476
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:54,719
Yeah.

477
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:56,459
Knock, what is it?

478
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:57,729
Knock before you come in here,

479
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,439
I get Cinemax on this thing I think is what he yells at the end.

480
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:01,880
Yeah.

481
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:05,150
Oh man, that's such a good show. I need to re watch a

482
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,479
-- drama Christmas
-- episode. I'll have to add a link to what Cinemax was.

483
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,489
Right.

484
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,920
Uh You'll never know Children, you'll never know.

485
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,880
Uh OK. So, anyway, we talked about 23 some, some restrictions.

486
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,430
Uh article 25 talks about responsibilities of the controller.

487
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,469
So this is actually an interesting point to talk about.

488
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,349
There are, there's something called the controller,

489
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,609
-- you mean article 24 the responsibility
-- of?

490
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:28,569
Right. Right. Right.

491
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:32,699
This is part of this falls under what is known as chapter five in the GDPR.

492
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:33,890
There's a whole bunch of stuff here.

493
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:34,760
But anyway,

494
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,989
so the controller is the organization with the data and

495
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,189
then there's also a processor which is an organization that,

496
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,890
that the controller could use to process data. An example being,

497
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:45,520
you know,

498
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,839
let's say you send your billing off somewhere and they

499
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,459
do something with it and then send it back,

500
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:49,689
right?

501
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,140
You've got the controller holds the data,

502
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,989
the processor does something with the data and

503
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,869
generally would give it back to a controller.

504
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,729
Stupid question. But so I know Santa has

505
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,750
insourced manufacturing, he has LS for manufacturing

506
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,760
and in some movies, the elves have also I've seen them doing administrative work.

507
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:10,520
He would definitely be the controller and the processor unquestionably.

508
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,800
Right. Yeah. But I mean, well, no, no, no.

509
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:17,050
But I mean, is it purely just Santa or Santa and the elves? Is it an individual or

510
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,280
an, or an organization?

511
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,439
Uh I would say it is an organization

512
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:25,079
where you've got the equivalent of like Christmas Inc or something.

513
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:26,239
I don't know what it would be called.

514
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,199
What is Santa's legal entity name? That's a good question.

515
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,670
I believe it actually is Christmas Inc, that's, um,

516
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,250
-- there's a movie called
-- Incorporated. Yeah,

517
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,160
that's awesome.

518
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,530
But

519
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,819
where is he incorporated then? Is he incorporated in Europe? In the United States?

520
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:41,609
Is he incorporated?

521
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,319
I would assume he's flying a flag of

522
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:45,319
convenience because he's out in international waters.

523
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:46,329
So, probably Panama

524
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:51,359
maybe. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, can you, he could he incorporate?

525
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,699
Well, he'd have to have his own country and we don't consider it.

526
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,119
Nobody recognizes the North Pole as a country. So,

527
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,310
-- uh right.
-- It's a big chunk of ice.

528
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,670
That's true. There's no land is there?

529
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:03,369
No. That's right. It's all ice.

530
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,089
-- Not unless you count Greenland
-- or

531
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:07,979
their own countries

532
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:09,819
anyway.

533
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,109
So anyway, this is, this whole chapter revolves around

534
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,030
your data processors

535
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,520
and kind of protecting the data and,

536
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,270
and the controller and what that would mean and the rules around that.

537
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,219
And it's, it's quite frankly just a lot of

538
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,699
kind of boring stuff.

539
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:30,119
But the one I really like is article 32 and this is around protecting the data and

540
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,420
this is where we talk about things like

541
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,640
encryption and anonym organization and pseudo anonym organization,

542
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,170
which is the worst word in the word world to spell

543
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,900
and kind of. So here's a question is Santa protecting his data,

544
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,979
you know what I would say?

545
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:43,859
Yes,

546
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:48,339
because if he has a physical list that is not electronically accessible

547
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:50,859
and it's kept in a lock filing cabinet in a secure building.

548
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,050
I mean, you can't really ask for much more than that.

549
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,750
No computer hackers are getting in.

550
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,420
Uh,

551
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,540
I mean, that's, that's fair and that's reasonable and,

552
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,410
and protecting the data,

553
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,349
you don't necessarily have to encrypt it, it's a matter of,

554
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,650
depending upon your situation.

555
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,050
Are you keeping it safe in a reasonable manner? Right.

556
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,760
Whereas generally like if you're in the cloud, like, yeah,

557
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,410
encrypt that stuff because, you know, you don't really have control over it.

558
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,650
But

559
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,040
yeah, I, I think that's probably fair,

560
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,989
which then brings us to things like breach notification,

561
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:25,050
right? Which is kind of 33 and 34 talk about, you know, notifying

562
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,260
different groups. There's the supervisors

563
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,560
are basically like the countries that are in charge because every

564
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:34,560
-- country kind of has their own GDPR magic
-- supervisory authority thing.

565
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:35,280
Right. Right.

566
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:38,140
And then you also have to notify the person

567
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,839
who had their data breached and to my knowledge,

568
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,079
Santa has never had a data breach.

569
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,910
I'm, I'm trying to think of this and I can't think of an instance.

570
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,689
He,

571
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:51,550
I think he technically has because I have seen documentary movies where

572
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,750
people have broken in to look at the Naughty and Ice List

573
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:54,739
on

574
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:56,349
-- air.
-- Actually, that's a really good point.

575
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,910
And actually in Futurama,

576
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,459
the, the characters,

577
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:04,150
what they freeze Santa in ice and then they go to deliver presents

578
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,270
and so they basically have unfettered access to all of Santa's data.

579
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:14,160
So, ok, I, I think there may have been, although, although are those

580
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:18,270
movies and shows canon or are they viewed as fiction?

581
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,579
All of them are,

582
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,170
they're all

583
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:21,949
ok. Fair.

584
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,439
So that means Santa has unquestionably had data breaches. I'm

585
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:27,599
-- sure
-- the Spiderman movie just covered this one.

586
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,660
-- I didn't, I don't, I didn't see the Spiderman, the
-- Multiverse Spiderman.

587
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:34,104
-- Uh
-- I don't even know what you're talking about. I don't watch a lot of movies.

588
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:35,214
You'll have to forgive me.

589
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:36,454
-- Oh, no worries.
-- I didn't see it either.

590
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:40,744
-- I just saw an ad on it for youtube or an ad for it on youtube
-- anyway. Anyway.

591
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,135
So, ok, but here's the thing.

592
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:46,885
So we'll assume all of Santa's prior breaches have been pre GDPR.

593
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:49,415
So now we know post GDPR

594
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,535
that it is.

595
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:54,599
Now we're all going to get letters in the mail from Christmas Inc.

596
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,400
When

597
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:58,689
somebody breaks into Santa's layer, it's called a layer.

598
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:00,640
I'm calling it a layer when somebody breaks into

599
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,469
Santa's layer and gains access to the list.

600
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,969
Although at the same time, if someone's reading the list,

601
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:08,400
you only have to tell the people that were looked up, right?

602
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,569
You don't have to tell everybody

603
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,069
assuming he can prove who did or didn't look at certain parts of the list,

604
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,010
which

605
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,550
-- I don't know
-- every movie I've ever seen, they've been caught

606
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,469
reading it.

607
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:19,430
It's not like they, you know,

608
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:22,719
it's not mission impossible where they manage to get the knock list and get it clean.

609
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:23,770
Right.

610
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,439
Uh, that's, that's probably fair. That's fair. Anyway, we'll keep going.

611
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:28,969
Uh, let's see here. We've got,

612
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,439
uh, actually one thing interesting

613
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,290
that

614
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:32,459
I,

615
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:36,369
I had forgotten about article 36 where if you're doing high risk

616
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,979
processing where you kind of know the data is dangerous or,

617
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:42,489
you know, the data has been breached or something,

618
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:47,089
you actually need to gain consultation to say like I'm going to do this, you know,

619
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:47,969
help me do it right.

620
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:50,689
And I guess in Santa's case,

621
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,880
I don't know if he's ever had to process high risk data.

622
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,609
-- That's, that's a good question.
-- Uh

623
00:25:56,959 --> 00:26:01,920
um I would say he does process high risk data because for example,

624
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,479
he knows your real name, right?

625
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:06,380
That's been firmly established.

626
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:09,824
Everybody knows that that's on the internet, whatever we have a podcast,

627
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:10,234
we're fine.

628
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:10,755
Well, no, no, no.

629
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:12,405
But I mean, I'm saying, for example,

630
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:15,354
if you're a spy in a foreign country living under assumed identity,

631
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:18,234
-- Santa knows where you live and what your real name is.
-- That's true.

632
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,755
He knows who the spies are. Oh man,

633
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:21,675
that's crazy.

634
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:22,734
He knows,

635
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,935
you know, like, and he also knows a lot of personal details,

636
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:26,844
like if you've been naughty or nice.

637
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:27,954
So like all the

638
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:31,295
anybody who makes a living killing other people,

639
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,719
he knows about this

640
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:36,089
witness protection programs, right? There's, there's countless

641
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,520
opportunities here for, for Santa to have extremely sensitive information.

642
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,939
Interesting. So that,

643
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,630
wow. Wow, that's wild.

644
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:50,140
Uh, now, now here's a question, let's say, uh, data is breached on, say,

645
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,760
someone in the witness protection program

646
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,640
who does he contact and how do you, do you, do you send it to their,

647
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:00,709
their persona and say, uh, someone accessed the naughty list. Wink, wink or,

648
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,369
I don't know,

649
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,380
assuming the timeline on breach notification is long enough and

650
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,979
you would just drop a note down your chimney,

651
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:07,420
I guess,

652
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,170
right?

653
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:10,180
Like just

654
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:14,069
when you're doing the rest of them, right? Like why, why do an extra delivery?

655
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,209
All right. So anyway, article Keep moving.

656
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,489
Article 37 38 39 talk about a data protection

657
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,250
officer and this is meant to be a person you

658
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,569
consult with when you have questions or you need to

659
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,969
start doing certain activities because you haven't had an incident

660
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,000
and,

661
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,250
and basically I sum this one up as uh they can't

662
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,479
be a bum and there are certain things they must do

663
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:37,790
and that seems fair. But the question being

664
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,500
uh we, we talked about this earlier, like Santa doesn't really have ad po

665
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:43,660
that we know of.

666
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:44,479
Yeah,

667
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:46,140
what we need to do

668
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,930
is create a new holiday character

669
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:51,530
called like George the DPO elf,

670
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,180
right? And, and he would be

671
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,010
the worst elf of them all. Nobody likes him.

672
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:03,709
So there we go. That could be our contribution to Christmas George, the DPO elf.

673
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:04,900
Right.

674
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,449
Anyway,

675
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,619
like the elf on the shelf, except he's the elf in the back room account.

676
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,479
That's the elf on the shelf. I hate that guy.

677
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,410
Anyway, anyway, we'll keep going.

678
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,819
So, uh, 4041 we're code of conduct, which is just be nice.

679
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,270
Right. Uh, actually I found articles 42 and 43 talk about certification,

680
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:23,780
but it's not mandatory.

681
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,489
It's encouraged you acquire certification, which I found kind of funny.

682
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:30,319
My assumption is they will change that someday.

683
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:34,160
And, and in that context again, uh is sent to GDPR compliant.

684
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:34,959
Probably not.

685
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,410
And it doesn't matter because he doesn't have to care.

686
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:38,130
Uh

687
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:42,150
Let's see, there was 44 and 50 talk about the transfer of data.

688
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,439
This is obviously a big deal for an organization because you might

689
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:47,910
need to move data somewhere else for a variety of reasons.

690
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,959
Be it? You sold it, you, you were sold yourself.

691
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,329
But in Santa's case, does he transfer data?

692
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,839
Now, now the question being like, do his helpers

693
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,239
have access to it? Like I'll say the mall, Santa,

694
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,439
does he acquire data

695
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:02,920
through?

696
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,520
Well, it wouldn't be a transfer though because you're not,

697
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,959
you're not permanently giving it away.

698
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:07,569
It would be potentially

699
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:09,119
a, a temporary

700
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,180
-- gift like
-- lending, it still counts as

701
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:11,550
transfer.

702
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,079
Ok. That's fair.

703
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,699
It's any movement of the data like it's because yeah, people quote

704
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:18,760
unquote rent lists of people for like

705
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,410
advertising purposes and that's a data transfer.

706
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:24,160
-- OK. That's fair. That's fair. Right. But
-- the data is,

707
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:27,500
the party B is now aware of the data.

708
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,949
They know the data, they,

709
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:31,719
it's been transferred into their brain or computer or whatever.

710
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,680
-- OK.
-- That's fair. That's fair. So anyway, we're going to keep going.

711
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:35,640
So we're running out of time here.

712
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,630
So there's articles 51 through 59 talk about supervisory authorities.

713
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:44,160
Again, this bring begs the question, where is Santa Incorporated,

714
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,040
-- which would kind of dictate some
-- of

715
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:46,939
it.

716
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:48,719
That would be some of it.

717
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:51,939
But I, I assume in this case, we would just take the pragmatic tact of, you know,

718
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:54,719
if somebody in Romania or somebody in Germany is affected, they,

719
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:55,459
they go to that country.

720
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:55,569
That's

721
00:29:55,989 --> 00:29:56,270
true.

722
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,619
Actually, that's a fair point.

723
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,280
So I guess all of you country,

724
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,569
supervisory authorities were counting on you to crack down on Christmas inc

725
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,510
and, and their reign of terror.

726
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,099
Uh So anyway, again, it was kind of dry, not terribly exciting.

727
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:13,540
Uh article 60 to 62 talks about how the supervisory authorities need to cooper,

728
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:16,520
which I guess is fair, you know, spelling that out makes sense.

729
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,400
But again, I guess that kind of comes back to what you were saying,

730
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,229
where depending upon where the people are.

731
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,650
So maybe all of Europe could band together

732
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,579
to end Santa's reign of terror.

733
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:26,500
Uh

734
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:27,930
-- All of
-- Europe believes in Santa.

735
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,000
Yeah.

736
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,290
Although I would assume there's at least one person per country there must be so,

737
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,170
therefore, Santa exists in that country.

738
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,560
Right? I would hope so.

739
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:41,390
And, and the vast majority of the Santa Mythos is, you know,

740
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,589
solidly rooted in European culture

741
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,469
-- and, and
-- northern Europe,

742
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:47,189
the southern Europe. Not,

743
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:47,979
-- yeah,
-- they do.

744
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:52,329
-- But not to the degree, like I
-- thought even Greece had a similar character.

745
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,900
Yeah. But I mean, it's, it's more of a Scandinavian

746
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:57,619
northern European, like Germany

747
00:30:58,709 --> 00:30:58,979
and

748
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,339
you need something happy in the winter,

749
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,890
right? Something to hope.

750
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:08,170
-- Hope, hope is all I have. It's snowing outside
-- because we don't have the sun.

751
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,339
That's right.

752
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,750
Oh, man. Actually the sun was out the other day and it burned my eyeballs off.

753
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,229
I thought I haven't seen this in so long. What is going on here? Yeah. I felt like,

754
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:21,829
I felt like when, like, in the movies, when that guy comes out of, like,

755
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,089
the prison he's been in for 100 years and he's like,

756
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:26,550
covering his eyes with his hand and, like, hunched over,

757
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,189
but that's totally what it looked like.

758
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,780
40 days in the hole.

759
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:31,829
That's right.

760
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:36,540
Uh, let's see here. We've got, the rest of this is pretty unexciting for the most part

761
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,280
and, and basically we've hit the, the meat of GDPR, the,

762
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,880
the rest of GDPR talks about things like punishments

763
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,599
which again, like the penalties now that,

764
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:49,619
that does beg the question because the penalty is heavily based on your revenue.

765
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:52,040
Does Santa have revenue? Right?

766
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,410
I don't know. So, where does he get his raw materials?

767
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:57,880
Well, yeah, exactly.

768
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:57,969
So,

769
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:01,449
does he have like an internal accounting system in Santa Box or does he actually just

770
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:04,060
transact business in us? Dollars like the rest of us

771
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,310
-- or does he use Santa coin?
-- It's easier to hide

772
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,380
Santa coin. If it's not, it should be. Right. It's a thing.

773
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,319
-- IC O
-- it's, it's, I'm Santa coin

774
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,589
is

775
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:13,719
a,

776
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,619
we should buy some Santa coin. We could, we could give it out as

777
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:16,930
I

778
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,199
bet it's very inexpensive right now. Coins

779
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:20,839
-- dot com.
-- Oh, no,

780
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:27,890
no, no. Santa coin is worth 40 cents roughly us per coin uh

781
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,300
-- coin.
-- What's the hashing algorithm? Does it say?

782
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:34,520
Uh let me just check dead coins

783
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,060
because I suspect

784
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:42,390
I feel like based on its volume and no, it's not listed on dead coins.

785
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,079
So it's technically alive but

786
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,030
like it's market cap

787
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,819
and um

788
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,319
oh that's a pretty flat line.

789
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,709
Whatever, man.

790
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:54,260
It's the decentralized future. It says

791
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,030
it has STC.

792
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,900
It uses S crypt which is a fair algorithm.

793
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,829
That's a shame because I still have my old Bitcoin gear in the basement.

794
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,020
It'd be nice if I could use that.

795
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,949
But the 24 hour volume basically hit like zero

796
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,790
good. We could probably mind a bunch of it and give it away as prizes.

797
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,900
This sounds great. Uh We should figure this out.

798
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:12,630
Uh

799
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:15,030
One Santa coin is 40 cents.

800
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,609
Uh That's only from the 15

801
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,880
volume is about 100 200 grand.

802
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:23,089
Uh, that's from like a year ago.

803
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,630
Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's alive barely

804
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,589
anyway. Anyway.

805
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:32,540
So, I

806
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,020
-- guess
-- here

807
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,150
we

808
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:35,540
established that Santa uses Cryptocurrency,

809
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:35,969
Cryptocurrency.

810
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:37,300
But

811
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:38,060
I

812
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,449
guess

813
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:38,939
that's

814
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,410
Cryptocurrency is currency as he can be fined.

815
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,599
Ok.

816
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,410
So the thing is, it talks about annual turnover. So,

817
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:50,229
depending on how they exactly define that.

818
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,660
I mean, because he's not selling this stuff,

819
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,739
he's just using money internally to pay his elves and pay his suppliers and

820
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,920
making money off,

821
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,040
I

822
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:56,239
assume

823
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:56,859
from him then,

824
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:57,790
I mean,

825
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,689
there's got to be some sort

826
00:33:58,959 --> 00:33:59,790
-- and
-- sponsorship

827
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:02,589
licensing is likeness.

828
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:05,050
Uh Maybe

829
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:05,250
I

830
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,930
would be revenue

831
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:06,550
Coca

832
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:06,930
Cola,

833
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:07,900
Santa Claus

834
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,860
like this.

835
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,860
He licensed it to them.

836
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,260
Oh, man.

837
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:17,780
Ok. Maybe I'll, I'll, I'll go with this, I'll go with this. So we'll assume

838
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,699
-- he, you
-- think those he's not gonna cut of that sweet Mal Sound of money,

839
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,340
-- right.
-- That's right.

840
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,370
Every 10% of every mall Santa paycheck goes to Santa Claus right.

841
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,458
There you go.

842
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:30,770
Oh, man.

843
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,560
Anyway. So I guess in summary,

844
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:35,099
wait, do we,

845
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:39,898
do we have a summary like GDPR and Santa are probably grossly incompatible.

846
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:42,039
I don't see a way out of this or

847
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,030
I think GDPR and sound are entirely compatible and, but

848
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:49,149
it's kind of like I, I

849
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:54,550
here's how I view GDPR were Google and Facebook, terribly worried about it. No,

850
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:57,739
I suspect San is in the same boat as Facebook and

851
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,550
Google in that he can architect his way out of it,

852
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,189
either legally, financially technologically or otherwise.

853
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,189
So, you know, it's business as usual for him.

854
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:09,370
Uh,

855
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:13,500
you know what I think you're right, because since GDPR has become a thing,

856
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,060
I have seen no difference in the activities of Santa,

857
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,780
I'm, I'm willing to say that which is

858
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,580
clearly not that

859
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:25,780
he's, well, I'm still not getting anything. Right. It's my

860
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:29,379
browser history insurance. I'm never going on the nice list again.

861
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,439
But

862
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:35,090
right. So, no, I, yeah, I guess you're probably absolutely correct.

863
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,399
Is Santa doesn't care,

864
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:38,919
partially because he doesn't have to and partially because he's

865
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,209
just going to game the system to his advantage.

866
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:41,850
Now,

867
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:44,129
does that put Santa on the naughty list or,

868
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:47,729
or the Santa think the people who made GDPR belong in the naughty list?

869
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,060
I

870
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,449
think a bit of both.

871
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,409
I, I think Santa is nuanced enough to know. I, I,

872
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,280
to me GDPR is well intentioned but the execution and

873
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,590
especially like that Romanian journalist Kerfuffle currently going on.

874
00:36:01,229 --> 00:36:02,610
Clearly,

875
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,929
there's some shenanigans going on here, some naughtiness

876
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:10,389
and the fact that Facebook isn't worried kind of really puts me on the whole,

877
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:12,489
I think GDPR was well intentioned.

878
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,129
But clearly if Facebook and Google aren't that worried, then it

879
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,530
really didn't accomplish what it was meant to.

880
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,610
-- Uh
-- That's fair. OK. So I guess

881
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,850
for now,

882
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:26,530
good, good luck, Santa keep up the good work, I guess. Um

883
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,389
Let, let me know how I can get back on the, on the good list.

884
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,429
I should, may maybe I wonder, I wonder,

885
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,389
could I send him

886
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:39,260
a GDPR request, demanding to know how to be put on the good list?

887
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,909
I wonder I should, I should try that.

888
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:46,030
Although I'll send you the letter because apparently Canadian Santa replies. So

889
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,830
maybe now, now, can I, I wonder if I can write Canadian Santa as a US citizen and have,

890
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,030
have him reply to me?

891
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,570
Interesting. I should try this.

892
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:54,750
Uh

893
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,030
Right. Anyway,

894
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,590
well, that was fun.

895
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,270
