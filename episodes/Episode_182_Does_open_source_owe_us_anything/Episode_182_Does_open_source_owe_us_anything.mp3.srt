Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 182 with myself,

1
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,770
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,279
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,770
How you doing, man?

4
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:17,250
Better. The cold snaps over and it's actually kind of nice winter now

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:18,889
and again,

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,260
we talk of the weather for people who live in strange places and potentially are

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,770
listening through the sands of time and it's the middle of summer for them.

8
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:27,530
So,

9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,860
and maybe it's snowy where they live in the middle of summer. It is possible.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,659
That's true. There is there anywhere that snows in the summer?

11
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:36,450
Probably some places in South America. Right.

12
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:39,029
Well, if you live high up enough in the mountains. Yeah, that's probably true.

13
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,569
Like we once almost got snowed on at summer camp.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,250
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,349
Like I remember us having a snowball fight that

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,229
I'm not even gonna

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,189
comment on that. There's,

18
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,349
there's so much there, Kurt, I feel like

19
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,439
I went to summer camp like a normal person. I am completely normal. I do

20
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:58,529
normal things. Right.

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,229
Right.

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,389
Anyway.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,590
Oh, my God. I didn't even know how to transition out of this.

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,059
That I'm normal, normal.

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,779
But,

26
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,209
well,

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,349
ok, normal. Human behavior

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,830
anyway.

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,410
OK.

30
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:20,809
So we have a special episode planned today and this one normalizing Eval code

31
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:21,419
it.

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,389
No.

33
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:23,660
So

34
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,050
I have a couple of stories that have come to my attention recently and,

35
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:33,110
and one of them I'm involved with more than I wish I was.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,550
But

37
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,540
it is

38
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,569
something that's been on the back of my mind now for a while.

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,599
And this is kind of the question I will pose to you is a very general idea is,

40
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,910
does the maintainer

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,970
of an open source project

42
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,440
owe you anything?

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,220
I would say that's a complicated question.

44
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,629
And it depends, and I would say one of the biggest it depends on is

45
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,050
what have they publicly said.

46
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,260
Because for example, if I download a piece of source code

47
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,209
and obviously it has the standard licensing terms of, you know,

48
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,250
this software isn't good for anything.

49
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:07,750
And if it eats your cat,

50
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,050
that's too bad,

51
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,199
right? That's generally accepted software clause.

52
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,910
You know, if it causes any damage or problems, it's, that's on you

53
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,929
on the flip side. If

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,979
the developer or developer plural, if it's big enough to be a project,

55
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,490
have made some sort of commitment to the software,

56
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:25,630
what do I want to say?

57
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,270
Sort of actually, you know, in writing where they've said, like we,

58
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:32,350
we will support this version and the last version or,

59
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,919
you know, we are committed to improving the software.

60
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,210
Well, then I would say

61
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,759
ideally they keep their word ok.

62
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,960
So let's take the large organizations, like obviously there,

63
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,389
there's places like Apache or the open SSL group or Mozilla,

64
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:47,679
take them away

65
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,399
because they're, that's a different conversation.

66
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,960
Yeah. So, ok. Well, actually let's even take one

67
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,009
people who actually

68
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,940
make

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,559
money directly off of their software.

70
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,580
Not necessarily, I don't, I wouldn't even say that because I would say if I'm,

71
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:05,339
for example, I have a bunch of github

72
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,490
repos

73
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,119
and I don't make money off them.

74
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:13,210
They're in my case, they're not widely used by any means, but

75
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,729
they exist.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,619
And the question I have is do I owe the people using my software anything?

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,940
So my thinking here is,

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,820
for example, if your software does have

79
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,559
some dangerous or pointy or sharp edges,

80
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,660
you should probably document or make those known.

81
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,009
Like one of my favorite examples is Python Pickle, right?

82
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,089
If you go to the Python Pickle web page and giant red text

83
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,179
use that it has, you know,

84
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,399
it says like, do not use this to take data from unknown sources because basically,

85
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,100
like we're going to,

86
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,960
we're going to unpick this thing and it's going to like

87
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,419
it can modify your, your code, like you in memory,

88
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,970
it will eat your dog.

89
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:52,500
Yeah.

90
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,009
But you know,

91
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,559
Python Pickle does have a place in the in Python in the use for various reasons.

92
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,740
I would say essentially

93
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,380
ideally, I'd like to see the developers

94
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:03,190
make

95
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,750
a reasonable best effort and I'm not going to

96
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,710
qualify that with the usual term that we use,

97
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,839
which is, you know, I will make every commercially reasonable effort to blah, blah,

98
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,369
blah, blah, blah.

99
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,220
Right. Because these people aren't commercial.

100
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,019
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. We're not lawyers. There's no

101
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:18,728
commercial relationship. It's,

102
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:19,848
and even broader.

103
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,799
For example, if I do a youtube video tutorial on how to say, take something apart

104
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,359
and I do it in a way that

105
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,398
you're going to damage it and there's a better way to do it without damaging it.

106
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,209
Do I have a duty to take down that video when somebody points out, hey, you know,

107
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:32,699
here's a better video that shows you how

108
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,479
to take this thing apart without damaging it.

109
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:39,160
I think that is a reasonable comparison and I would argue yes,

110
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,209
you should take that video down or at least note it and say, look,

111
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,369
there's an updated video that bla

112
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,519
yeah, and that's probably better even, actually

113
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,920
I've several times looked for videos on like

114
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,579
how to sort of do some little plumbing thing or take something apart.

115
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:55,709
And it's like, well, it's like the classic thing, you know, the first tear down.

116
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,290
Well, actually I fix it does this, you know,

117
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,269
where they tear something apart and then they're like, oh,

118
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,369
and once we tore the first one apart,

119
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,170
that's when we figured out how you actually take it apart without, you know,

120
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,859
snapping this piece off or whatever.

121
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:06,140
Right.

122
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:08,059
And, and that's fair, you know, because,

123
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,369
and then quite often they will actually have like

124
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,480
a corrected video or at least a warning saying,

125
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:12,809
you know,

126
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,869
uh, this step where we said this, don't actually do this, do this other thing.

127
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,950
And, like, what was it?

128
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,429
I bought a, yeah, a replacement battery from my iphone se and of course, you know,

129
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm,

130
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:23,140
I'm pretty sure the first person to crack open an iphone

131
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,290
se there's a couple of spots where you can easily,

132
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,170
like, mess things up pretty bad.

133
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,040
Right. Right.

134
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,089
Anyways, but back to the software thing,

135
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,739
I would say people should ideally make a best effort.

136
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,369
The other thing,

137
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,230
well,

138
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,809
the other challenge too is we don't

139
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,279
necessarily know the circumstances of these people.

140
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,619
And I would say that also affects it because for example, sort of, uh in some cases,

141
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,660
these people are paid to work on this software, right?

142
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,410
They, they, they work for a company that's like we need a piece of software that does X

143
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,950
and so somebody writes an open source version implementation of it and releases it.

144
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,260
So

145
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,640
while they're not being like directly paid to work on it,

146
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:59,290
their company uses it and they get maybe some time to work on it.

147
00:05:59,299 --> 00:05:59,600
Right?

148
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,779
Versus there are people that wrote something for themselves and they're like, hey,

149
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,519
I found this useful.

150
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm just going to stick this up on my github because,

151
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,440
and then,

152
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,100
and sometimes these things become wildly popular,

153
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:15,130
you're conflating things that I think are irrelevant points to this conversation.

154
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,859
And so let me just explain

155
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:19,820
the stories driving this and then we can kind of

156
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:23,380
explore from there because I don't think that point matters.

157
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,019
So

158
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,950
the, the first story is

159
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,820
a Rust tool that's called Acti

160
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,059
web. And I'll put a link in the show notes to a blog post, that kind of

161
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:39,059
details the, the story behind this and what it kind of comes down to is obviously,

162
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,399
Rust is meant to be a safe programming language, not like

163
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,769
c for example, where C lets you basically shoot yourself in the foot, you know,

164
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,160
multiple times without even knowing you're doing it and it can be

165
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:51,255
extremely dangerous, right?

166
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,234
Russ is meant to fix a lot of those things,

167
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:56,855
but it also has the ability to run unsafe code

168
00:06:57,024 --> 00:07:00,505
where and that makes sense because sometimes you might want to say like, right,

169
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:03,934
like II I understand, take the training wheels off.

170
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:06,415
I'm on my own here. I get it right

171
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:08,095
now. This, this

172
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:13,135
Aix Web apparently basically took just a bunch of unsafe code

173
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:16,285
and wrapped it all in the unsafe.

174
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:19,765
Uh I I guess I don't need a decorator. I don't know what they call it, a rust

175
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,049
and then

176
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:24,089
sent it out to the world and people started looking at this, they were like,

177
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,329
whoa look at all this unsafe code, we shouldn't do this.

178
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,890
And the developer was basically like, it's fine, everything's fine, it's fine.

179
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,130
And then people of course, did a bunch of testing and they kind of fuzzed it,

180
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,790
it sounds like.

181
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,130
And you can imagine what happened right

182
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,609
now. Here's what I will say.

183
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:44,040
I think at this point, the developer can say it's fine.

184
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,809
The developer can say

185
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,250
I don't want to fix it,

186
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,130
but people started submitting patches

187
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,630
and the developer said,

188
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:52,549
no,

189
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,940
I don't want your patches that fix these bugs so well In fairness though,

190
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,510
I've seen people submit patches that are horrifically bad

191
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,950
and some of them probably were,

192
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm not talking about this specific issue, but in general,

193
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,149
I've seen people try and submit patches and it's like

194
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,829
your patch is bad.

195
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,950
It makes but Kurt, no, no, no, no, I don't, I don't want to do this because you're,

196
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,869
you're, you're distracting us from the actual problem.

197
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,350
Some of the patches were garbage. I guarantee it,

198
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,630
not all of them were right. This is

199
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:21,934
if you read the story,

200
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:25,684
this is clearly an issue of a developer who either didn't

201
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:28,605
want to admit fault or didn't want to do the work

202
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:33,844
and they were unwilling to turn their project into a community

203
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:36,544
project and they were hanging on to it by themselves.

204
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,075
And this is the thing

205
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:40,544
where I say, do you owe someone? Anything

206
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,950
that I think

207
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,590
this is where the open source concept sort of falls apart,

208
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:48,780
but sort of not because there's the concept of forking, that's part of it.

209
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,039
Well, I was about to say, I mean, worst case scenario,

210
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,520
somebody could fork this open source project, call it.

211
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:53,900
You know,

212
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,150
the thing that the code formerly known as act

213
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,179
and with a little

214
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,400
symbol but

215
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:03,919
is tricky. And I agree it's where this is going to end up. I have no doubt.

216
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:04,960
And additionally

217
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,489
running an open source project is really hard. Right.

218
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,390
Forking runs to the Wikipedia problem is the problem with Wikipedia is not that,

219
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,750
you know, it's great that everybody can have a copy of Wikipedia.

220
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,460
But if Wikipedia were to shut down,

221
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,590
where do we all go to keep editing it and keep it up to date

222
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,450
when there's like 700 copies floating around?

223
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,429
And that's one of the problems with forks is sort of, well, OK.

224
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,109
So this software got fork, there's like three or four major forks, which one is

225
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,700
the winner as it were.

226
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:31,429
And that's where that,

227
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,270
that's where you really do want the original developer's involvement

228
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:38,469
so that they can either officially bless the fork or

229
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,390
actually I'm just looking what happened with

230
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:41,280
Aix Web is

231
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,669
the original developer handed the project over to another person

232
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:48,239
to be project leader.

233
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:49,750
And so that hopefully,

234
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,440
now that person becomes more active and accepts patches and life goes on.

235
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,289
Right. Right.

236
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,369
And we can hope and now, but so here's, here's where that gets,

237
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,880
gets tricky and I'm going to, I'm going to kind of, there's a project in the node

238
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:05,130
Js world called low dash. And

239
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,619
I'm going to throw them under the bus a little bit here because I can

240
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,250
is so low dash is used in an enormous number of node dependencies.

241
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,849
If you do an NPM install of almost anything,

242
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:20,229
there is a very high probability low dash is going to come in with it.

243
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:20,690
And it's,

244
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,830
it's this,

245
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,099
this library that kind of adds functional programming like behavior to your,

246
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,630
your javascript project is basically what it is.

247
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,909
And it's a really cool library and it does some really neat things,

248
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,770
but the way it works, it has some very sharp edges and I've in fact is,

249
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,289
is I didn't try to do this. But I had multiple people come to me saying

250
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,559
I tried to raise some of these issues with low dash and the developer basically said

251
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,020
it's supposed to work that way.

252
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,169
And this is like this is like, you know,

253
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,419
to open your garage door and it lights on fire type stuff, right?

254
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:59,190
This is things that a reasonable person would not expect to be normal behavior.

255
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,799
Well, I'm just looking at that, that link you sent me and it's

256
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:03,650
Yeah.

257
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,830
Yeah. So it's pretty scary.

258
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,190
Yeah, I will,

259
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:09,840
I'll put a link to one or more issues.

260
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:13,130
I, I I'll, I'll decide how many I want to link because there's more than one

261
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:14,940
that are just some bugs

262
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,390
kind of detailing some of these issues. And the developer saying

263
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:22,349
I, I don't most of the time he says I'm too busy to do anything about this

264
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:23,400
and

265
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,080
see and that right there. But right there that says to me that,

266
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,400
OK, cool. You're too busy to do anything.

267
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,559
So are you going to accept help from the community members and actually, you know,

268
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,909
promote them to be

269
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:35,510
project

270
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:38,109
leadership admins or whatever you want to call it?

271
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,969
That's exactly kind of where I was hoping

272
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,690
to go with this because something like LO dash

273
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,150
is basically so embedded into the node ecosystem.

274
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,429
I think forking it is not going to be useful because so much

275
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,119
other stuff is already using it that I think replacing it would be

276
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,940
a monumental effort.

277
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,190
Well, actually it's interesting, there's actually some data on that Cloud Flare

278
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:01,390
blog just had an article on

279
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,780
javascript libraries are almost never updated once installed. The

280
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,559
Jquery Blog, I saw that

281
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,200
I am,

282
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,340
I am I for one am shocked, shocked, I tell you, you're right,

283
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:12,619
you know, like,

284
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,460
and this isn't just because you and I both

285
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,239
work for a software vendor where the idea was,

286
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,679
you know, take a piece of software and freeze it in time in Amber for 13 years.

287
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,080
No, like this is actually

288
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:23,760
this is actually quite normal.

289
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,590
Like for people like to be blunt, once you pull in something,

290
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,219
why would you update it?

291
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:29,919
It's only gonna maybe break stuff, you know,

292
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,880
like I'm really proud of my devs because they, they stay on the bleeding edge

293
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,440
and, yeah, they encounter Brokenness stuff all the time

294
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:37,159
but

295
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,880
they, they don't increase that delta between us and reality as much, you know, by,

296
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,719
by using the same thing for four years.

297
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,989
But, um, and especially, you know,

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,380
and it's one thing like pulling in a new version of something is

299
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,580
painful but like changing all those low dash to point to the,

300
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,479
the software formerly known as low dash,

301
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:58,219
right? That's just not gonna happen. No, it, it, it won't. I agree.

302
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,739
I agree. And then

303
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:01,700
it, it becomes very problematic.

304
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,039
And additionally, I think one of the other tricky things is so like, for example,

305
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,619
I have lots of crappy little github

306
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,500
projects that no one wants to help me with.

307
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,650
People, send me like drive by patches every now and then.

308
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,659
Actually, there, there's one project I have called

309
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,989
Yarn, which is an old net

310
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,780
hack style game

311
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:20,539
that is from, it's from a million years ago.

312
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,580
And for whatever reason I ended up with it,

313
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,219
I think it's because the old maintainer didn't care.

314
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,340
I sent a patches. You're like, I don't want this. Do you want it?

315
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:27,250
I'm like, yeah, I'll take it.

316
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,830
So anyway, I put it on github

317
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,590
and like,

318
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,890
yeah, someone sent me three patches one time.

319
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,299
I was like, do you just want commit privilege?

320
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,929
Because I'm sick of like, you know, taking your

321
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,099
request and adding it. I was like, oh yeah, that's cool.

322
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,799
And he did a few more and now, like, we haven't updated it in like,

323
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:45,489
five years and every now and then I'll get a bug report and I'm like, oh, ok,

324
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,859
I'll do something here and, you know, I'll maybe fix it or whatever.

325
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,200
But, like, it is,

326
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:51,885
it is one thing I think when it's just like,

327
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:54,825
crap little projects in Josh's github repos.

328
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,885
And it's another thing when, like, this is a

329
00:13:57,094 --> 00:14:02,775
functional piece of software that is depended upon by an enormous number of people.

330
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:06,965
I think the phrase you're looking for, it's a key component of the ecosystem. Yeah.

331
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:09,744
That's fair. Right? Like we can't just get rid of all the worms.

332
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:11,484
And I think in a case like that

333
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:16,760
saying as an open source maintainer, you owe people nothing.

334
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:22,679
I won't say that's untrue, but I would say what you owe the world is a community.

335
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,520
And if people are willing to help you and willing to work with you in your community,

336
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,809
well, I wouldn't say you owe them a community.

337
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,260
I would say you owe them

338
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,849
the right to allow them to build a community. Yeah, that's fair. OK. I'll buy that.

339
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,289
But, you know, I mean, same idea. Right.

340
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:39,270
That's, I mean, I tried that with DW when people wanted to get involved, I was like,

341
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,659
hell, yeah, please do.

342
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:43,200
And of course they didn't really, and when I shut it down, they were all like, oh,

343
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,219
I would have helped And I'm like, no,

344
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:46,955
no, you wouldn't know because if you would have helped, you would have helped.

345
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,906
And that's ok too because I think you shutting it down

346
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,346
was the right move instead of keeping it barely alive,

347
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:54,866
which is not the right move.

348
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,106
Yeah. Just put things down

349
00:14:57,536 --> 00:15:00,346
and there was a reasonable replacement for it. That's the other thing. Right.

350
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:04,736
Yes, that is true because CD E fixed a lot of their problems, you mean miter?

351
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:05,505
Sure,

352
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:06,171
whatever.

353
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,081
So anyways back

354
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:08,601
to this though,

355
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:09,591
I would say,

356
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:14,512
I think this actually there's a lot of real world analogs in the, for example,

357
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:19,632
it's not up to me or it's not my job to create community where I live.

358
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:23,351
But for example, I would say it would be a real dick move

359
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:26,791
to prevent other people from forming and creating a healthy community,

360
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,460
right?

361
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,599
To actively get in people's ways who want to

362
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,159
organize and make the world a better place.

363
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:32,630
That's kind of rude.

364
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,140
That's really interesting actually,

365
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,880
that you bring that up because I've seen things like this happen before.

366
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,599
And my favorite example is always when

367
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,570
you have like a group of especially young people trying to do something,

368
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,489
say at the park

369
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:50,890
and you'll have like this, it's always a grumpy old person for whatever reason,

370
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,159
they're throwing the ball too much and they're running

371
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,429
like one of my personal goals is to make sure that it's never me but you know. Right.

372
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,510
They're complaining about things and it's like just

373
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,960
there is literally nothing wrong with this event.

374
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:07,159
You need to just stay away, but they don't, right. They like, they actively try

375
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,719
to make it worse and they end up making themselves worse.

376
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:15,119
Well, or they impose rules or, oh, you're playing it wrong.

377
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:16,559
Like, literally, I,

378
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,650
I actually had to intervene once at the playground

379
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:21,359
because this adult was yelling at somebody else's kids

380
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:22,479
and,

381
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:23,549
and I was like,

382
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,760
and I literally the the parent was trying to intervene

383
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,020
and he was yelling at her and I'm like,

384
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,989
buddy, like a

385
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:31,799
complete stranger is intervening now in your behavior,

386
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,840
like you need to think about this.

387
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,390
And like, I, I literally, I hate to invoke this but like, you know, I

388
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,940
to become a scouting candidate, you have to take a bunch of training

389
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:44,119
and like the training explicitly covers dealing with people like this

390
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:47,340
because it's seen as such a threat and a problem, right?

391
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,450
And so I literally, and you know what the problem was,

392
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,840
this kid was,

393
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:53,969
he was basically accusing this person's kid of quote unquote cheating.

394
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:54,679
They were playing,

395
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,799
um it's whatever it's called grounders or something where you're supposed to,

396
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,780
one kid is supposed to keep their eyes closed while they

397
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,400
kind of try and find the other kids kind of thing.

398
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,299
And he was accused of cheating and opening

399
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:05,439
his eyes because he was like wearing sunglasses or

400
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,640
whatever and he couldn't see his eyes and he

401
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,250
wouldn't take his sunglasses off or whatever anyway.

402
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,900
So I spoke with this guy and he left in a huff because I was like,

403
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,650
I'm going to call the police in about a minute here.

404
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,449
Right? Because this is like, I feel physically unsafe and I'm 6 ft two

405
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,618
and you are literally behaving like a crazy person, you know.

406
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:22,979
And, um,

407
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:23,318
yeah,

408
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:26,428
it turns out the kid is wearing sunglasses because he just has an eye

409
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:29,188
condition and he can't be exposed to bright light without it hurting a lot.

410
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:29,889
You know,

411
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:33,178
more to the point too, if somebody else's kid is quote unquote cheating a bit. Like,

412
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:34,178
so what,

413
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:37,379
like that's part of life, that's part of learning about life. Like people,

414
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,159
I'm not saying it's good and you should cheat at games to be clear.

415
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:40,938
But at the same time,

416
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:44,729
let the kids learn how to handle it and only intervene if necessary. Right?

417
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:46,550
Like right now I'm at the stage with my kids.

418
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,869
They're nine years old and I'm like, I do as little as possible for them until

419
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,619
either they ask for help or they actually need help or a safety

420
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:54,290
because

421
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,050
how are they going to learn to do this?

422
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,530
And I see so many

423
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,650
other kids,

424
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,030
like literally, I have kids walk up to me at the playground and they're like,

425
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,650
can I play with him?

426
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,714
I'm like, I don't know, like who

427
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:04,714
is Kim? Like

428
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:09,025
I don't, I'm not I'm not the boss of Felix of Wolfgang. Like, I mean, I am but

429
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:12,795
you're, you're going to jail if they do something bad enough, right?

430
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:13,795
You know,

431
00:18:13,964 --> 00:18:16,775
like, I, I don't know if Felix wants to play with you. Like

432
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:18,214
Kim. Yeah.

433
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,025
No, I, I

434
00:18:19,204 --> 00:18:22,155
hear you back to the open source thing. I, I think,

435
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,109
for example, I mean, well,

436
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,640
I think part of the problem is people tend to really self

437
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,969
identify with the projects and especially the code they make because I,

438
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,170
and I think there is a bigger piece of artistry

439
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,119
to code than a lot of people want to admit,

440
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,349
right?

441
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:39,540
People become heavily emotionally invested in code they write.

442
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:43,229
And I actually have a parallel to this that

443
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:46,270
I, I will, I've been thinking about as well is

444
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,069
one of the things I've noticed in the security world especially is

445
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:56,680
we are notorious for viciously guarding our work of that's mine.

446
00:18:56,689 --> 00:19:00,760
You can't do it. I'm working on that. Go away. No, you can't change that.

447
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,569
I'm working on it. That's my project.

448
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:07,790
And this is one of the things I have been working. I, I used to be like that.

449
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,650
Mind you, I know I was, we

450
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,209
were.

451
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,459
Yeah. And many of us still are.

452
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,239
And if you say you aren't,

453
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:15,660
you're just in denial

454
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,930
maybe. But this is part of the human condition, man.

455
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:18,760
I agree.

456
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,260
You know what I always think of actually when this happens is like when

457
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,410
I write a blog post or something and an editor gets at it.

458
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,979
I'm like, oh, my goodness.

459
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:28,329
I either feel angry because they took my voice away

460
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:32,030
or I'm embarrassed because I feel like I'm illiterate.

461
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,170
But

462
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:34,109
it's usually one of those two.

463
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,030
It's never like, oh, yes,

464
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,750
this is very reasonable commentary on the piece I just wrote,

465
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,510
I got over that because I wrote a monthly magazine column for Linux

466
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,180
journal. And like, yeah, the first few times I was like,

467
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:44,560
oh,

468
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:45,469
well, I know

469
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:51,229
I keep it to myself now. Right? I used to like lash out now. I'm good about it.

470
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,650
But, but here's my point, right is especially insecure.

471
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:59,109
We're, we're notorious for that, that ownership concept of

472
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,119
i it's mine. You can't touch it. Well, I would say unhealthy ownership. Yes. Yes.

473
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,660
Exactly. And I feel like this is, you see this in open source a lot where people are,

474
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,609
if you let it go,

475
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:15,449
it can grow into something so much bigger than you can imagine.

476
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:18,099
But if you, if you insist on maintaining control,

477
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:20,290
like the absolute best you're going to get

478
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:25,630
is something that barely lives. Well, I mean, back to, you know, I think

479
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,390
allowing the marketplace to speak is important

480
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,420
and consciously choosing to ignore what the market wants. Yeah, you can do that, but

481
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,430
then you're not going to be giving the market what they want, you're going, you know,

482
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:39,189
and in this case, you can actually be harming the market.

483
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:40,020
Right. There's

484
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,910
you refusing to accept patches and make the

485
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,310
software better actually has a real world cost potentially

486
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,040
in that.

487
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,290
Now,

488
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,760
these people have a lot of extra bugs and just general crappiness to

489
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,209
deal with that could easily be fixed in the case of Lo Dash.

490
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,449
These bugs allow for remote code execution in your No Js projects.

491
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,430
Like that's a big frigging deal. I mean,

492
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,660
RC,

493
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,040
that's what we talked about last week or two weeks ago.

494
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,939
I think it was with the Citrix remote code.

495
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:12,449
Like that's literally the worst possible problem you can have.

496
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,192
And is it technically low dash's fault?

497
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:16,192
Technically,

498
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:19,092
the project should have sanitized their inputs before they

499
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:21,432
did the perfectly reasonable thing with low dash.

500
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:24,552
But the reality is it's kind of like one of those things of saying,

501
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:24,812
oh,

502
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:27,312
you have to flip the don't explode switch before you flip

503
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:30,112
the turn on the light switch even worse than that.

504
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,911
If you have a library that accepts data and

505
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,232
potentially accepts dangerous data

506
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:40,053
and more to the point. If you can fix it in one spot at the library, why wouldn't you?

507
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:43,553
Yes, you should. Absolutely. And look defense in depth, right?

508
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:46,494
Multiple layers don't say, oh, you should only do that here.

509
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:50,293
No, like you should be sanitizing your inputs everywhere,

510
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:53,093
everywhere you can sanitize and sanitize them not in one place.

511
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:53,154
Well,

512
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:55,644
and you should also be assuming that the stuff that was supposed

513
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:59,213
to sanitize inputs didn't necessarily do it exactly in the real world.

514
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:02,793
That's kind of how that works. Sadly, that is exactly how it works.

515
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:06,124
Like all the time, every time, what always gets me is what these frameworks,

516
00:22:06,215 --> 00:22:06,715
you can fix it.

517
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,985
A one spot for everybody for all time.

518
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:10,196
Why wouldn't you?

519
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:10,796
Right.

520
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:14,605
So I, I will, I will pick on one other thing and this is an interesting point as well.

521
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:18,826
If you look at the low dash uh like commit the activity graph in github,

522
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:22,336
there's a point where it, it dramatically falls.

523
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:26,336
And my assumption is the author either either had a job where they were working

524
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,515
on low dash as part of their job or they maybe got a new job.

525
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:32,625
You know what I mean? Like, there was some sort of probably life event

526
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,430
that has drastically altered the amount of time they can invest in this project.

527
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,359
And I mean, that's

528
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,550
I get it right. That, that's part of just life that happens to everybody.

529
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,959
I have many things that fall under that umbrella where I was doing certain things.

530
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:52,180
And I was like, like my blog is a great example. I used to write constantly and I just

531
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,819
due to a variety of events that have happened in life, I,

532
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:59,660
I write like a couple of times a year now instead of basically once a week.

533
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:03,579
And that's OK. Well, but here's a perfect example. He

534
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:07,109
when, when those things happen, the person can tell the community.

535
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,540
Well. Right. That's part of it. And I think

536
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:13,540
that is the thing I keep coming back to and kind of the,

537
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,300
the one message for anyone who hasn't turned this

538
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,890
podcast off and discussed up to this point yet.

539
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,369
Like the one thing I keep thinking of is

540
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:28,239
when you are part of making something with open source. And this is like

541
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,810
github

542
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,650
made this so easy, but it's not about you and it's not about your project.

543
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,369
It's about building up a community around what you're doing.

544
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,650
There's nothing wrong with being a community of one.

545
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,569
But if you have the ability to become a community of

546
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,839
multiple people,

547
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,859
it's so much more powerful. And like that is that is the point, right?

548
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:48,589
Like not to get all weird or anything.

549
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,030
But I mean,

550
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,859
the human condition is all about being part of a

551
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:55,369
community but being part of something bigger than yourself.

552
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,489
And like that is just open source. Well, to be blunt, nobody can survive on their own

553
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,750
unless they're like some crazy prepper who spent, you know,

554
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,469
years buying canned food so they could survive on their own.

555
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:09,219
Dude. You send me youtube videos like weekly

556
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,219
people that knew just that like,

557
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:12,729
right.

558
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:16,079
But I mean, the only reason they can survive on their own is because the the you know,

559
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:20,739
they had access to this massive everything to buy like a pallet of canned soup.

560
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,000
OK? That, that is fair and I will not disagree with you at all. And I think

561
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:28,900
that is, that's part of the story is if you are,

562
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,099
if you're developing software and github

563
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,369
and you're releasing it as open source,

564
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,390
you are standing on the shoulders of giants and

565
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,229
like letting people stand next to you or even stand

566
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:43,910
on top of your shoulders is extremely powerful and very

567
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,390
rewarding or kick you out of the way and take over it if they want to do a better job.

568
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,959
No. Really? Like because that does happen. Like, I,

569
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,280
well, for example,

570
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,550
I remember this one poor guy who started contributing to a major

571
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,650
library by doing documentation and then like six months later they're like,

572
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,189
yeah, cool.

573
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,349
I don't want to handle this. Do you want it?

574
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,829
And the guy's like, sure because he didn't know any better,

575
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,270
you know. So he said yes.

576
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,670
And then this thing had a major security flaw and he was like,

577
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,069
panicking because it had like 10 million installs.

578
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:11,890
It was a Ruby jam

579
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:15,969
and I'm like, no, you're not going to get sued. You'll be fine. I remember this. Yeah.

580
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:18,949
And you know, the poor guy was just freaked out but like, and he,

581
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,150
but the difference being is, you know,

582
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,760
rather than getting all crazy and defensive or whatever,

583
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,430
he actually reached out for help and it was fine,

584
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,869
but a lot of people do not want to accept help or they,

585
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,839
or maybe they feel like accepting help is a sign of weakness

586
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:33,760
because they feel like they should be able to do it themselves.

587
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:33,959
And

588
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:34,880
again,

589
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:37,829
yeah, that can sort of work for a while. But, like, even Lini Torvald

590
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,050
started accepting patches pretty early on

591
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:43,010
and, I mean, it seems to have worked out for him and he's like,

592
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,130
the least agreeable person anyone knows.

593
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,689
So,

594
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:49,729
yes and no, I actually have met people who are more disagreeable.

595
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:50,849
Yeah, that's probably true.

596
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:54,050
And they're in charge of open source projects that are much less successful.

597
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,910
Weirdly enough.

598
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:56,000
No.

599
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,199
And you know who I'm

600
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,260
talking? I know exactly who you're talking about.

601
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,680
So, anyway.

602
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,280
Uh,

603
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:02,930
yeah.

604
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:05,890
Right. Right. I, I agree. I, I, so

605
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,339
this to me is fundamentally part of the real world example of, you know,

606
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:10,180
people,

607
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,500
there are definitely benefits to learning how to behave with

608
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,160
and around other people and learning to cooper,

609
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,660
which oddly enough I seem to remember a lot.

610
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,949
It's being covered in kindergarten.

611
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,550
It's nice to be nice.

612
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,510
And that would be my takeaway. That's right. It's not so much nice to be nice.

613
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,510
It's, you're going to get punched in the face a lot less if you're nice.

614
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:31,989
Yeah, that's probably true.

615
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:34,810
And I don't mean, like, physically punched in the face but, I mean, metaphorically,

616
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:36,709
either way, probably both are true.

617
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:39,280
Yeah. Well, yeah, actually now that I think about it, yeah.

618
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,540
So I guess my key takeaway here is,

619
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,040
you know, if you're in charge of an open source project,

620
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,699
make sure you're behaving at least as well as a kindergartner.

621
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:50,130
So you get that gold star. It's a pretty high borrower set in there.

622
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,420
Sadly. Yeah, it is. It, for some of these people. It is. No, it is. I agree. And

623
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:57,540
I will,

624
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:03,790
I will always be more than happy to admit that many years ago. I was a terrible person

625
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,060
and I have a great deal of regret for the way I once acted.

626
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:09,270
And I feel like shows like this

627
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,760
and topics like this

628
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,280
are part of my penance

629
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,839
to try to help make sure it is not a,

630
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:19,599
a problem that persists even though I suspect it will.

631
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,262
But if even one person listens and understands,

632
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:26,032
I consider that a success because none of us are as cool as we think we are

633
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:26,902
and that's

634
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,123
pretty much how it goes.

635
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,333
Well, one thing I, I try to use and I've been trying to teach my kids is, you know,

636
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:35,912
if you can learn from the mistakes of others, it's going to be far less painful than

637
00:27:36,552 --> 00:27:38,022
learn from your mistakes.

638
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:41,743
I know so many people that make the same mistake over and over and over again.

639
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:42,373
It's like just

640
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:46,036
please learn like please.

641
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:47,426
But anyway, I

642
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:50,666
think it's just part of the human condition. Yes. Yes, indeed.

643
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:52,586
We are squishy annoying. Begged me.

644
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:55,845
So. All right man. I'm calling it. Thank you. Thank you, Kurt.

645
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:59,005
This was this was a lovely conversation and it, of course,

646
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,436
I had no idea where we'd end up.

647
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,855
I think this is a very nice place and I,

648
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:05,645
hopefully we haven't angered anybody too greatly.

649
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:10,339
And as these things always go, if you are part of a project and you need help, like,

650
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:14,119
ask for it or just accept it when it comes, it's, it's,

651
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:14,989
it sounds,

652
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:18,619
it sounds easy but I know it can be hard but it's ok.

653
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,439
All right. So, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
