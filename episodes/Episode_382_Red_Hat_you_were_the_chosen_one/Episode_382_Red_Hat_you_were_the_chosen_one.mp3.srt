Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:11,460
Kurt Siefried and my partner and not working at Red Hat anymore.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,449
-- Josh Pressers.
-- It's true.

3
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:17,170
-- This one's gonna be a doozy, I think
-- because you were at Red Hat for

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,100
12 years

5
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:20,299
and I was there for, I think seven

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,569
-- ish.
-- Yeah,

7
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:25,409
it's an easy place to stay for a long time. It's a cool company like,

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,510
and it was,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,079
it was the cool company.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,780
Well, it was the only cool open source company

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,200
for like a decade.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,849
It's still pretty cool. Look, I'm not gonna. Ok.

13
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:39,119
So. Oh my goodness. All right. Let's just start.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,150
Let's give our, our,

15
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:46,560
our warning of Kurt and I decided we want to talk about the current Red Hat.

16
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:50,590
-- We'll say news about Cento S.
-- Wait, you called Sento S?

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,779
Oh,

18
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:52,950
I was pronounced it Sento.

19
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:54,110
It could be Sento.

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,560
I don't care. I don't know.

21
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:58,895
I, I've called it Sent Os for a long time and that's what's in my brain

22
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:03,494
and a lot of people I've known have called it that so it is what it is,

23
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,815
whatever. Anyway,

24
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:08,455
we're not here to crap on Red Hat. We're not here to blame IBM.

25
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:09,764
-- I
-- definitely not blame Sento

26
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:13,675
and who I remember when they hired Karen beer and, like, he's an awesome guy. Yeah.

27
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:14,654
Oh, KB is great

28
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:18,434
and, well, KB is not there anymore. He, he departed a couple of years ago.

29
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:21,915
-- I think if I recall
-- correctly, I really have not been keeping track of Red Hat.

30
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:25,125
Well, and that's just it. Right. We're, we're gone now, so let's do it.

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,260
Oh, he stepped down in 2021.

32
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,349
Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's been a while.

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,839
I know which I think the first time they changed, sent to us, I'm gonna,

34
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:36,959
that's hard to say.

35
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,190
Um, the first time they changed,

36
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:42,160
sent OS to the stream model I think is when he departed,

37
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:43,339
that is the

38
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,029
right.

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,139
Well,

40
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,910
his departure appears to be aligned with the new direction of the Centa

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,239
project moving forward around, sent off stream with sent off eight,

42
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,610
going end of life at year's end.

43
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,650
Right. Right.

44
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:58,550
Anyway, I guess he wanted to spend more time with his family.

45
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,260
Apparently

46
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,599
I always love, like, whenever that I'm like, nobody, no,

47
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,639
like that's the whole point with having a job is so you can get away from your family.

48
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,320
I mean, sometimes,

49
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,000
but it, it's amusing to me.

50
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,119
Yeah, when the politicians are like, oh, yes, I just got caught buying crack.

51
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,789
I'm going to spend more time with my family. It's like, no, you're,

52
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:21,800
-- you're fired. Like we know how this works.
-- I mean, that's the thing, right. So

53
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,770
in the beginning, there was literally Red Hat.

54
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:27,720
Linux came in a box cost about 50 bucks. You could get it for free.

55
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:29,639
Honestly, Red Hat made a living.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,339
No, they didn't, they didn't.

57
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,449
And that's why they went into enterprise Linux

58
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,889
-- where the real money is.
-- I know I have a lot of history here.

59
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,970
Thank goodness, the ND A is long gone.

60
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:42,190
Well, you were basically there for the whole thing.

61
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,850
I started at Redhead in 2004 and this was after the IP O

62
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:47,850
and it was

63
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,070
that

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,320
I did too. I mean, I whatever, it doesn't matter.

65
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,580
It was a couple of years after Redhead enterprise, Linux became a thing.

66
00:02:55,589 --> 00:03:00,410
It was Fedora had just started not long before I started working at Red Hat.

67
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,820
I remember that. And

68
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:06,199
in fact, the reason I worked there is Red Hat end of Life, Red Hat. Linux

69
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,860
78 and nine on the same day. And the little start up I work for Progeny Linux systems.

70
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,179
He took over doing security updates for that and they

71
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,089
made me mad and I emailed Red Hat one day.

72
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,029
It was like, are you hiring? And they were like, holy crap?

73
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,699
Yes, like come do literally the same thing you're doing now, just for us.

74
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,550
And that's how like literally everybody I know at Red Hat got a

75
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:28,740
job on the technical side is like they were basically doing their job

76
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:32,850
-- and then moved to Red Hat and did the same job.
-- Yeah.

77
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,300
Yeah, that was very common back then, I think.

78
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,660
And, and so anyway, prior to Red Hat Enterprise, Linux,

79
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,940
there was Red Hat, Linux

80
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,860
and Red Hat literally made more money selling hats than they did selling Linux.

81
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,949
-- In those days.
-- They had boxer shorts.

82
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,080
It

83
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,229
doesn't surprise me,

84
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,559
but

85
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,479
for real, they made no money on redhead Linux.

86
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,710
And so the investors obviously were like,

87
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,050
you need to make money. That's kind of how companies work.

88
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,130
And this was, I mean, this was post IP O right? Where it becomes, we have to make money.

89
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,429
We need a way to do this and they created Redhead

90
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:07,214
prize, Linux.

91
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:09,494
And the thing that made Red Hat Enterprise Linux

92
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:12,375
truly unique at the time is the way

93
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:17,803
they twisted the GP L to do their bidding is how I would describe it.

94
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:21,165
I think it was, I don't remember if it was Ian Mogan or,

95
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:24,584
or Bradley Coon who once described what Red Hat did as

96
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,975
they found the line

97
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:29,015
where the GP L ended

98
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:30,214
and they stepped

99
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,170
exactly up to it but did not cross it. And so what Red Hat Enterprise Linux

100
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:38,140
did is they basically had an an A

101
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:40,649
ya a user license agreement that said

102
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,489
you can take this product, you can take these binaries,

103
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,929
you can take this source code.

104
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,329
And if you distribute any of this stuff without our permission,

105
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,049
we cancel your subscription to our service

106
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:56,700
which is not in violation of the GP L.

107
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:56,899
See,

108
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,299
that's me, the GP L just says if I ship you binaries,

109
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,559
I also have to ship you source code.

110
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,489
-- That's
-- right.

111
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:02,540
And it,

112
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,000
there is some language around, I cannot

113
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:08,209
uh encumber, you add more licensing terms.

114
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:09,630
But I'm not,

115
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,029
that's the beauty of it.

116
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,119
That's, and that's the hack if it were,

117
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,410
is they're not actually adding to the license.

118
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,720
They're saying they will actually well revoke

119
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,200
the entire license.

120
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,459
That's right. That's right.

121
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,190
And then, but, but Red Hat did release the source code to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

122
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,239
And they were, they've always been good about that

123
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:30,415
once a month, we got an email to sec

124
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:31,765
alert. Remember saying

125
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,654
I went to FTP dot Red hat.com and there's direct listings enabled

126
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,924
and there's packages what's source code and we'd be like uh huh.

127
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:40,054
-- That's the whole point.
-- Thank you for your bugger part.

128
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:42,054
We leaked our source code to the internet.

129
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:43,584
No, straight up. Like once

130
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:44,614
work,

131
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,295
it did happen a lot. But anyway,

132
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:52,375
they made the source code available and you can imagine the clones emerged

133
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:53,614
and this is where

134
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,880
uh well sent Os is fine,

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,970
but the original clones were terrible because here's the thing,

136
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,709
this is not a puppy, this is a herd of puppies. So like

137
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,570
compiling it all once and releasing it. Sure, I could do that.

138
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,829
You could do that in an afternoon.

139
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,750
But then the Death March of keeping it up to date with Red Hat.

140
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,329
Running a Linux distribution is hard to do. Who knew

141
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:15,829
we do? Especially

142
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,989
if you're trying to be bit

143
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,140
like, compatible with something else. Sure.

144
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,230
Because then you have to do it on their schedule.

145
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:24,920
Uh. Right. Right.

146
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,589
Right. And

147
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:26,329
that,

148
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:27,609
a lot of updates.

149
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,119
No, I know it was Microsoft used to make a big deal about that where they would,

150
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,809
they had a demo, they would do where Steve Ballmer would put like put red hots,

151
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,470
the candy,

152
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,420
like hundreds of them into someone's hands and

153
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,019
watch them spill them all over the stage.

154
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,619
I mean, this is back when Microsoft and Redhead hated each other

155
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:49,690
anyway. OK. So let's fast forward now to today

156
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,859
where we've got Redhead Enterprise Linux

157
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,049
and

158
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,149
there were the clone makers, they bought Sento S Cento S kind of pseudo goes away.

159
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,299
Well, what they did with Sento

160
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,750
is they made it

161
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:05,660
instead of literally being, uh I don't want to pay for Rel. So I'm going to run Sento.

162
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,059
They made Sento

163
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:07,750
the

164
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,230
upstream of Rel. See originally was Fedora was the upstream, right?

165
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,489
They would like just

166
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:18,410
keep stuff, you know, keep updating it, stuff would break new stuff would go in

167
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,269
and then they basically

168
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,329
pick a time and then freeze it and then like a year, year and a half later,

169
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,799
a reel would be born based on that version of Fedora from like 6,

170
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,459
1218 months before whatever kind

171
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:29,829
of.

172
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,320
And so then what they did is they put, so Fedora is like the really, you know,

173
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,420
every six months of new release followed by Sento,

174
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,619
which is a bit more conservative and more enterprise.

175
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,109
And then below that comes Rel and REL is the boring stable, it works thing.

176
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,209
And so the idea was now, is,

177
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,730
well, centaur stream is no longer compatible with REL because it's in front of REL.

178
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,149
So it cannot be compatible with R

179
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,540
-- but
-- they still were releasing the source packages. Well, the the source code in in a G

180
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,209
Repo

181
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,369
Loretta Enterprise Linux

182
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,329
and this is where like Rocky and Alma Linux were born

183
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,980
because Cent Os was no longer

184
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,200
like that compatible rebuild.

185
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:10,760
So you had community projects spring up that are the bug for bug,

186
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:13,230
-- compatible rebuilds of RTA Enterprise
-- Linux

187
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,070
and even just the effort of like, like you have to remove all the trademark stuff

188
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:20,920
-- that alone is a huge amount of effort.
-- But Red Hat did that for them.

189
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:24,190
Red Hat literally removed all of the trademark crap.

190
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,850
-- Yeah, they actually did the work that
-- wasn't in the

191
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,010
repos. I never looked at the

192
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:29,130
-- No, it
-- wasn't in the Get

193
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,070
repost like they actually did the work to do that, right? Like Red Hat did good

194
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,260
when they did this. So anyway, on June 21st,

195
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,840
Red Hat

196
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,159
released a blog post that they titled

197
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,840
Furthering the Evolution of Sento S stream.

198
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,270
And

199
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,820
yeah, this is where they murdered the clones.

200
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:53,059
Like here's the thing, Red Hat is not some big evil Machiavellian

201
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,119
company. Like we work, we work with these people. They're not,

202
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:58,640
they're just not capable of evil.

203
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,320
-- I mean,
-- we were,

204
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:02,909
we were always being accused of being like evil geniuses

205
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,255
when we worked there and like we were not.

206
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:08,875
Well, and my response always was if Red Hat is so damn evil one,

207
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:12,215
tell me one evil thing they've done and nobody could ever spit something out.

208
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,525
And I was like, number two, we'd be richer.

209
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:15,094
I mean,

210
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:17,924
no, seriously, if we were truly evil, we'd be richer.

211
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:20,724
Like look at what son was charging for Sun West and stuff.

212
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:24,174
If Red Hat could charge that, add a zero to everything.

213
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,255
Oh man.

214
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:27,905
Yeah, for real. It was still cheap than so.

215
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:28,484
Yeah.

216
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:29,184
Yeah.

217
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,125
Right.

218
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,380
Although I remember back in the day like,

219
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,219
so I wanna, I wanna give a little bit of background as well to this.

220
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:38,969
So when we, when I started at Red Hat,

221
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,179
it was not a job.

222
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,169
It was like a religion

223
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,669
to a lot of us. I mean, I remember when I was growing up, when I was a high school,

224
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,469
I did, my dream was to work at Red Hat someday.

225
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:53,010
Like we all have that like dream job we want.

226
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,929
When we're kids, mine was literally to work at Red Hat.

227
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,770
Like Red Hat was the company I wanted to work

228
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,359
for because they were the open source company that like,

229
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:04,630
I could work on Linux and pay my bills and feed my family

230
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,479
and they were like the only place.

231
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:09,929
And I mean, this is how I ended up working for progeny Linux system because I'm like,

232
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,559
well, they're not Red Hat, but it's Linux, like it's close enough.

233
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,309
And then I realized, oh, this could get me into Red Hat if I play my cards right here.

234
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,150
And I did and it worked out, but

235
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:23,789
like Red Hat was such a huge deal back then. I can't explain how powerful

236
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,200
and impressive and important that company was. Like,

237
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:28,049
they

238
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,330
open source.

239
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,469
Like, absolutely all of that. It was, it was absolutely amazing.

240
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,429
And I'm still a huge Red Hat fan.

241
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,190
-- Boy, I'm not going to say I'm not,
-- here's the question.

242
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:40,520
How much money over the last two decades do

243
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,900
you think Red Hat spent on all those different,

244
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,659
getting involved in all those different lawsuits,

245
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,090
like the skull lawsuit and Amicus briefs and like,

246
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,469
-- not zero? It's a lot, I'm sure
-- it must be in the tens of millions of dollars anyway.

247
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,440
Anyway, that they spent protecting open source.

248
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:54,969
Yeah.

249
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,969
Yeah. For real, for sure, for sure.

250
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,500
And, and so anyway, ok,

251
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:02,799
so here is the reason I give kind of that background, right? I think

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,020
when, what redhead did

253
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,349
and we'll get to explaining some of the nuance around that. But I, I feel like

254
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:13,460
they were the chosen one. I feel like that scene in Star Wars where Obi

255
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,989
Wan Kenobi is like, yelling at Anakin like you were the chosen one.

256
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:18,960
I feel like that's what just happened

257
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,299
where this was the company that like went out of their freaking way to,

258
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,960
to like we'll say do the right thing in quotes

259
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,099
and all of a sudden they

260
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:31,619
kind of unexpectedly even

261
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,260
they, they, they turned off the faucet

262
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,460
and everyone's like, shocked that holy cow, what just happened,

263
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,750
I'm gonna say something that a lot of people are probably, I

264
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:43,039
probably going to hate, which is I am

265
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,020
100% OK with this because by the letter of the law

266
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:48,580
and the letter of the license

267
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:52,679
and I would argue even the spirit of the license,

268
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:56,030
they're, they're within the gu they're within the guidelines. They're OK.

269
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,599
Look, they're within the guidelines, but

270
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,280
I'll, I'll skip ahead a little bit.

271
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,979
So, first of all, they released the blog post titled, right?

272
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,359
Furthering The Evolution of Sento S Stream, which

273
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:05,570
it

274
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,200
had that very like, oh, we're doing this for everybody.

275
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,239
Look at us, which obviously was not and it's not particularly well written.

276
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,950
I mean, Mike mcgrath wrote it. I, I've known Mike for a long time. He's a great person.

277
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,419
He's not evil anyone.

278
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,719
Apparently he's been called Evil multiple times over the last couple of weeks.

279
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,799
Like I worked with him for

280
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,859
actually pretty much my whole career.

281
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:31,719
Red Hat because he was the open shift guy and I was the cloud security guy.

282
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:36,820
-- So
-- he's less evil than both of us put together by far like unquestionably anyway.

283
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,200
But then, but then

284
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:45,440
uh on the 26th, so five days later, he writes another blog post, we'll say that is

285
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,419
more direct and truthful is how he would describe it.

286
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,750
And he basically at the end says, like we did this to cut off the clones. Yeah.

287
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,900
And obviously that's a business decision.

288
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:58,570
Unquestionably at that point. Now, here's,

289
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,989
here's what I think. And this is me with some background in this space as well as just

290
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:08,390
some understanding of the market. I don't think

291
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,630
it's going to matter to their bottom line.

292
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,669
I think they did this to affect the bottom line. And I think if

293
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,989
it at best it will be zero

294
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:20,750
-- and it might even hurt them a little bit. Is my
-- suspicion, my suspicion is that

295
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,020
there are some business people that think it might help.

296
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,419
-- Oh, I
-- have no, I guarantee they think it'll help or they wouldn't have done it.

297
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:31,780
You know, there's, there's X million number of, of Rocky Linux.

298
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:32,669
Alma Linux sent

299
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:34,650
to whatever machines, you know,

300
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,260
and if we get like 1% of them to convert, we'll have more money than all of some country

301
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,260
-- they are gonna convert.
-- No, they're not.

302
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,700
Like if, if you're already running one of these distributions,

303
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,830
you can probably switch to something else pretty easily.

304
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,780
-- And
-- people don't understand

305
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,010
and what Red Hat sells

306
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,590
and Red Hat doesn't sell Linux.

307
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,530
No.

308
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,299
Well,

309
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,760
nobody does anymore.

310
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,309
There's no,

311
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,419
-- there's no market left while
-- ignoring the fact

312
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,229
that they owe over 100 other products.

313
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:00,830
Right?

314
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:06,229
I was like 100 and 10 when I left, what Red Hat sells is legitimacy and insurance.

315
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,150
They sell the confidence trick. Yeah.

316
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,710
Yeah.

317
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,440
And they also happen to ship as a, it's like mcdonald's

318
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,630
as a consequence of getting their

319
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:18,349
leases to pay the rent on the land. They also sell hamburgers.

320
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,489
But mcdonald's is first and foremost, a real estate company.

321
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,359
Red Hat is first and foremost, an insurance

322
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,919
slash confidence trick company, but also happens to ship pretty good software.

323
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:32,619
Well, and you have to remember that back in 2004, let's say

324
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,830
like running, I'll never forget. So the story I love to tell people is.

325
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,609
So I graduated from college in 2001 and I went to

326
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:42,469
work for this little life insurance company because at that time,

327
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,739
it was like the middle of the.com explosion.

328
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,070
And I'm like, I just need a job like I have to live.

329
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:48,809
So I got,

330
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,520
I was an a IX system administrator working for

331
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,710
a company that wrote life insurance software in Cobal.

332
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,030
Like it was,

333
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,059
it was pretty crusty

334
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:57,849
and that's fine.

335
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:01,929
It was a cool place and they were lovely people, but I was obviously any time

336
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:06,020
there was an opportunity I was talking about open source and trying to get us to like,

337
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,080
convert everything to Linux

338
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,809
and we should be using whatever and I'll never forget that.

339
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,130
I had someone sit me down at one point and they're like, look, you're a smart kid.

340
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,479
You are throwing your life away on this open

341
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:15,969
source crowd.

342
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:16,369
I

343
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,169
-- told that all the time. Yeah.
-- Get out of here. Like a IX is great.

344
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,260
You know, you should, you should work on that

345
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,960
you should have seen because, like, back in the olden days I actually

346
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:26,919
went to the

347
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,510
Unixes group meeting locally at the university

348
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,440
and the disdain and the

349
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,799
just general,

350
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,950
like, straight up that here's a nickel kid by yourself. A real computer.

351
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:38,479
It was like,

352
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,960
it was real, it was legit. And then of course, like,

353
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,320
yeah, 10 years later, ha ha, who's laughing now?

354
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,130
Well, we know how that worked out. But anyway, here's the point. So in like 2001

355
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:54,599
ish to 2004 people went to Red Hat because they were wanting to do open source stuff,

356
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:57,400
but they were afraid of it and they didn't know what to think of it.

357
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:59,080
And Red Hat was basically,

358
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:01,354
well, we weren't even sure if the legality of it.

359
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:03,465
Well, that, yeah, that's right. That's right.

360
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:06,994
Like I straight up had people kind of saying like, is this legal, I'm like,

361
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:07,364
what do you mean?

362
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,554
Is it like, is it somehow illegal to give this away? For free. And I'm like,

363
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,155
I don't think so.

364
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:15,465
And you had, you had the fud of, oh, if you had open source,

365
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,265
you have to give away all of your software for free.

366
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:18,924
And it's like,

367
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:20,174
yeah,

368
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:25,515
of course, obviously. And so it was a scary place and Red Hat took away the scariness.

369
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:28,715
But here's the thing now, let's fast forward to today. 2023.

370
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,239
-- Open source isn't near as scary as it used to be. Well,
-- you don't have a choice now.

371
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,080
Well,

372
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,780
everything is so complicated. You cannot build it yourself.

373
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,400
Here's the second part of that.

374
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:44,349
I think it's not just that open source is more accepted. The Linux

375
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,119
distribution

376
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,780
has become functionally a commodity like no one

377
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:51,190
is going to make any money selling Linux

378
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,520
ever again.

379
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,559
-- Like that's just the reality
-- of it.

380
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,799
Like on a worldly map, it's firmly in the utility space of like electricity,

381
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,150
clean water. It's uh

382
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,280
concrete

383
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,099
-- tires.
-- It's,

384
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,760
yeah, it's a commodity

385
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,719
thing that exists now. It just is and you can get like a zillion of them for free.

386
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,180
Well, not even that you can get them for free. It's just baked into everything.

387
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:15,790
Like you use a platform as a service.

388
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,589
That's true. Unless it's one of those weirdos basing on top of, of free BS D.

389
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:24,040
It's, it's Linux under the hood like everything is Linux under the hood.

390
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,160
You buy a cheap

391
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,578
network device. It's probably Linux under the hood. You buy a Mercedes car,

392
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:33,409
-- there's like a whole pile of open source licenses.
-- Oh, for sure. That's right.

393
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:35,038
That's right. So, anyway, ok,

394
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:36,729
so let's take all of that.

395
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,749
We'll mix it all up in the pot and that kind of brings us to today

396
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:44,489
where Red Hat has cut off the clones,

397
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:46,489
the clone makers probably don't know what they

398
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,848
can do and there's basically no legal way

399
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:53,598
they can continue producing clone operating systems because

400
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:58,569
the, the license agreement says you cannot distribute the source code.

401
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,859
If you do, you are violating this license agreement

402
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,959
-- and you get cut off.
-- My one thought.

403
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:07,280
I remember when we were talking about this uh before a few days ago how I was like, wow,

404
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,910
you know, like red hat turned the knob up to 10.

405
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,040
There's no 11 but there is D MC A takedowns. I,

406
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,219
I

407
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,250
mean, it's, you know, like,

408
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,449
because we were talking about, you know, I was like, oh, well,

409
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:20,920
-- they could just turn through accounts,
-- they can't do that.

410
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,930
So here's the thing, if

411
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:23,694
I sign up for a red head

412
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,344
and Redhead has like a free tier that you can sign up for.

413
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,505
So let's say, let's say I sign up for a free tier,

414
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:31,244
I can download all of the source code to.

415
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,854
I'm not breaking any rules.

416
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:38,145
I can give it to you. I'm not breaking any rules. They can't D MC Amy for that.

417
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:40,135
-- I haven't broken any copyright. But
-- if you

418
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:42,824
but I'm talking like a, like if Alma Linux

419
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:46,265
has the packages and they're distributing them on a public website anyways.

420
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:49,864
-- I, I was just, it was a random thought
-- there's, but that's not illegal.

421
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,599
What that says is the license agreement says I get cut off.

422
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:59,150
It doesn't say I can't distribute them. It says if I do, I get cut off.

423
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,239
Right.

424
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,290
-- That's true. Yeah, it doesn't retroactively revoke, which is
-- why

425
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,520
Alma could if, if they get them. But, but you have to remember

426
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,535
there's still that like legal angle and whoever giving it to them

427
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:15,864
and is violating the license. That that gets weird.

428
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:19,775
But once you have that source code, you can do whatever you want with it.

429
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,255
That's how open source works.

430
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:23,234
Well, once, yeah, once you've been given the binaries,

431
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,435
you have to have the source yada yada, they can't revoke it.

432
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,015
But again,

433
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:32,375
this is that Red Hat has like they're standing on the edge of the cliff of the GP L

434
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,869
and this is as, as weird as it can get,

435
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:38,229
I'm OK with it because fundamentally

436
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,819
like, has anybody ever widely deployed sent off and been like, hey,

437
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:42,469
this is really good.

438
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,589
We should pay for all of it.

439
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,569
Like they might buy a few licenses,

440
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:49,010
but I don't think so and they only buy a few licenses just to get

441
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,030
that kind of support for the few boxes that they can then apply to sent off

442
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,670
right.

443
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,719
There were people who would buy like one Red Hat license and then deploy thousands

444
00:19:56,729 --> 00:20:02,353
of sent us licenses or machines licenses and they would leverage that one license,

445
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:04,532
which means they were probably actually a net negative

446
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,642
for Red Hat in terms of support costs,

447
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:07,652
unquestionably.

448
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:07,772
Right.

449
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:09,392
Because the thing to remember is, and here's the thing,

450
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:10,532
I think most people don't get,

451
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:12,822
almost, nobody actually buys Red Hat

452
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:17,333
Linux in the sense of I don't go and buy, I don't even know who makes my two by fours.

453
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,993
I'd have to guess wire hauser just because it's a big company. But

454
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:22,113
the point is I don't buy Red Hat Linux.

455
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:24,993
I buy an accounting package that runs on Red Hat Linux

456
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:25,713
or I buy,

457
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:26,306
apply. It

458
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:27,995
is Red Hat Linux

459
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:33,345
or I buy a Dell Poweredge server that I need to like shove files out or whatever.

460
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,076
-- And my choices are windows are Red
-- Hat.

461
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:38,515
That wasn't how it worked a couple of decades ago, right? Like

462
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:41,436
you would buy Red Hat Linux because you needed

463
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:44,406
a UNIX operating system to be a web server

464
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:48,276
-- and they had it and they had support.
-- And that was the other trick is

465
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,946
the other trick Redhead did back in the day is

466
00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:51,855
they killed. So,

467
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,719
and the way they killed so

468
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,219
is by driving down development costs so low.

469
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:57,959
But

470
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,060
well, essentially your choices were,

471
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:03,900
you can sell this Linux for like 200 bucks per server per year, which

472
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:06,819
I don't think people understand how ridiculously cheap

473
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:08,780
that is when you're talking in 2000 terms.

474
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,800
Like these were like $40,000 computers.

475
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,979
-- Like it was ridiculous
-- running

476
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,939
an Os that you paid several 1000 bucks a year for.

477
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,660
Like you didn't just buy it and get updates. You had

478
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:20,810
a,

479
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:26,025
a yearly re up. It was so expensive and, and to add insult to injury, even if you

480
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:27,635
were willing to pay for Sun Os,

481
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:30,354
you still had to download all the open source to make the damn thing work.

482
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:32,344
Like to get bash and Apache and everything.

483
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:35,675
You know, that was the whole point of Suns site, right? All the sun sites.

484
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,234
Oh, sun site. That was the name of that. I'm trying to remember that

485
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:39,604
there was a local one,

486
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:42,574
there was a Sunset at U Alberta run by uh anyways and it

487
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:45,275
also ran the mirrors for a bunch of other Linux distro and stuff.

488
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:48,354
But yeah, the deal with Sunset is Sun would send you a sun

489
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:52,474
like pizza box back in the day with a bunch of drives and you'd racket and

490
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:56,170
given an IP address and boom Suns site dot U Alberta dot C A or whatever.

491
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,959
And it would have a collection of all the Sun software plus, you know,

492
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,209
whatever else you wanted to put on it.

493
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,209
But like, people really don't understand like,

494
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:03,890
oh,

495
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,010
a

496
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:09,290
really horrible example. I paid money for Os Two and I paid money for the TCP/IP A

497
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:09,699
on Pat

498
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:10,260
was

499
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,989
like, I'm going to forbid you from telling the story. You talk about

500
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:13,849
it almost as much as

501
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,280
-- you. Do.
-- You think that was expensive? So

502
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:15,709
Os

503
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:15,890
A

504
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:17,979
20, we know it was very expensive.

505
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:20,719
And so Red Hat drove down development costs to a point where so

506
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,500
os and

507
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,770
all the major unixes died

508
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,839
in the sense of

509
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,189
they're not dead but they're dead ends. They're still running

510
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,189
your, your life insurance company is still running a IX with that

511
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,489
-- coal.
-- Well, and look it, no, it wasn't just Red hat that did this.

512
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,489
This was all of open source because

513
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,609
open source when it started was slow and weird and scary.

514
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,910
And eventually the rate of development eclipsed

515
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,410
the development pace of,

516
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,069
-- of commercial UNIX
-- son's website like glass fish and stuff, you know, like their,

517
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,520
their stuff like so

518
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:52,550
tried

519
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,280
to, you know, make a Java web server and all these other things.

520
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,339
-- Well, of course,
-- they tried, they had to try like it was try or die and I mean,

521
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,390
they did both but

522
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:01,839
go to sun.com.

523
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,439
Oh, there's your answer.

524
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,689
But yeah, and that's the thing people forget is like this is,

525
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,280
this was a time when like we literally were building the internet,

526
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,640
but everybody takes for granted now

527
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,560
anyway. OK. OK. So Red Hat cuts off the clones, clones are gone.

528
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,199
Lots of people get upset.

529
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:18,619
Now,

530
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:18,959
now

531
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,849
I think it's ok for people to be upset. As well.

532
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,069
Here's the thing I don't get is the vast

533
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,619
majority of open source software I use is like,

534
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,469
it doesn't care if it's on Ubuntu or Debian or Red Hat or Fedora or whatever.

535
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:35,109
My one thought is what software packages are people running that actually, really,

536
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,150
-- truly sort of need to run on top of rel,
-- well, there, there's,

537
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,109
there's things that are free.

538
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,750
Oh, that are free. Nothing that's free.

539
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,670
See, and so here's my thought is like, if you're willing to, like,

540
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,660
these are not cheap applications by and large,

541
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:48,780
like this isn't like you're buying $10

542
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,260
applications and be like,

543
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:50,880
oh, I'm the

544
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,140
same with buck by running, sent off instead of real.

545
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,500
And that's the thing I don't get is this

546
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,739
like idea of it's like penny wise pound foolish.

547
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,979
Like I worked at a place they, they had,

548
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:02,290
it was a construction company. So the accounting system is like, so bizarre.

549
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,349
So there's all sorts of strange accounting magic in there,

550
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,819
like holdbacks and all these

551
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:08,540
ways of charging money and not charging money anyways.

552
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:09,880
The point is it runs on Skull

553
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,810
UNIX back in the day.

554
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:13,089
And I'm like, oh, we could run it on Linux with the skull emulator.

555
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,250
And then I realized, or

556
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,689
Kirk could not be yelled at on

557
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:18,719
a Friday afternoon because paychecks aren't printing.

558
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,380
So we're gonna, we're just gonna pay the vendor for the,

559
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,520
for the accounting package and everything

560
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:26,660
-- that comes with it.
-- You're talking about a different universe. Right.

561
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,449
-- That's not how things work anymore.
-- Well, no, no, no.

562
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:28,849
But that's,

563
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:31,530
that's my kind of thought is that's the market where sent off

564
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,030
and all that stuff came from and it doesn't exist anymore.

565
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,829
-- No, it doesn't. Exactly. Right.
-- And

566
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,734
that's what I'm getting at. Like, this doesn't matter anymore.

567
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:41,905
-- No,
-- it, it, it's, the world is so different now and I think if you're a company,

568
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:42,724
like Red Hat,

569
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:46,744
it's really about building like an ecosystem and an infrastructure

570
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:49,104
and an experience for the people using your stuff.

571
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,594
Right? No one is going to pay Red Hat for enterprise Linux.

572
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:56,444
They're going to pay Red Hat because they have a problem to solve.

573
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,479
And Redhead has a collection of tools that

574
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,479
will solve their problem because like you just,

575
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:04,170
I mean, you said a little while ago, Redhead has what, 100 and some products,

576
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,020
probably 200 products or more at this point because that was cris we left there for,

577
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,319
I mean,

578
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,119
I left Redhead in like 2016. That was

579
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,439
a million years ago at this point.

580
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,359
-- And
-- the other thing is people forget is Redhead

581
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:18,000
has expertise because I remember my favorite bug was

582
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:19,319
essentially this.

583
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,520
It was something like once every couple of days,

584
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,640
the server slows down for a few seconds and we can't have that happening.

585
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,680
And I'm like, what?

586
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,589
And it was a high frequency trading system.

587
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,630
And so they're like, yeah, it can't be slow for a few seconds.

588
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,569
And so there was some spin m text that would, like,

589
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:35,520
every 50 or 100,000 iterations it would not lock or unlock properly.

590
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,709
-- And like Red Hat fixed it in like two days. Yeah,
-- because they could,

591
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:39,500
you know,

592
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,260
I mean,

593
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,079
and this is why the likes of Intel and a MD

594
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:46,250
would partner with Red Hat because Red Hat had the ability

595
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,469
to do things No one else could do.

596
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:51,439
They have some of the best kernel talent in the world.

597
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:53,900
Well, remember with the Intel hardware bugs to like,

598
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,040
make software patches that didn't perform or hit a what?

599
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,619
30% performance

600
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,709
degradation.

601
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,589
Right. Right.

602
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,290
-- That
-- was,

603
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,550
yeah, this patch is sponsored by AWS.

604
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:05,464
Yeah,

605
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:08,925
I think part of it is anybody that is still relying on

606
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,594
like a bit for bit compatible free Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

607
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:14,645
like they're, they're probably also using

608
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:18,795
-- coal or something like they're just so old at this point.
-- No, not necessarily.

609
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:22,685
There's lots of reasons people would want Cento S because part of it as well.

610
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:26,415
-- Red Hat does bring a certain amount of stability.
-- Ok. Fair.

611
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:28,234
If I'm going to run

612
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:31,810
-- something else, it's going to be much less stable.
-- That is true.

613
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:33,760
13 years of support is a long time

614
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,280
and, and so here's, here's what,

615
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,599
here's what you're going to end up with now is I can either basically

616
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,660
incur the cost and deal with it myself or I could pay Red Hat

617
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,160
and I don't think people are going to pay Red Hat because I think

618
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:50,319
anyone capable of getting to this point can incur the cost and it's probably

619
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:54,079
going to be cheaper than paying Red Hat if you have a reasonably sized fleet

620
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:55,839
-- that we're talking about here.
-- Right.

621
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,430
Or, you know, they'll do what I do. Which is, I ran Fedora,

622
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:00,079
I ran one version of Fedor

623
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:01,609
in production for like four years.

624
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,640
Don't do that

625
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:04,640
to do

626
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:06,819
it end of life after a year

627
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,209
for

628
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:07,560
12

629
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,619
-- months of support. That's like a quarter of the way there.
-- I run it on my laptop.

630
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,900
Every, every release I'm like, I'm not gonna upgrade on the day it comes out.

631
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,489
And actually the last release I did not upgrade the day it came out.

632
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,900
I did it for the first time ever. Do you know why?

633
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,030
Because I was in California and my laptop was powered up in Wisconsin

634
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:29,459
because they released a week early and I wasn't ready.

635
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,020
But anyway,

636
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,714
no, I think, I think there's going to be a lot of kerfuffle about this.

637
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:35,094
But you know what this reminds me of is,

638
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:38,645
remember when I think it was Oracle was the first one to do this where they were like

639
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:40,614
they added to the end user license agreement that

640
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,984
you can't benchmark our stuff and release the benchmarks.

641
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,435
-- Uh
-- the dot

642
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:47,744
-- Clause, I think we call those
-- and I just checked and like Sousa does that now.

643
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:50,314
-- And like, a lot of software vendors do.
-- I

644
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:53,555
bet a lot of people have those duet clauses and why not?

645
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:55,494
If you have a lawyer writing your, your

646
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:58,055
ya just throw it in. It doesn't cost anything

647
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,500
well, more to the point. If, if you don't do it and your competitors do,

648
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:06,500
then they will benchmark your software and maybe make some mistakes,

649
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,180
making air quotes here as possible and then release that data and be like,

650
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,920
ha ha we benchmark this and like, look how terrible it is compared to our solution.

651
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,099
Yeah, I mean, that's fair. That probably does happen.

652
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,579
-- And I, I hate that kind of stuff. Oh,
-- it happens all the time.

653
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,530
We had that problem. Um Well, I'll tell the tale

654
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,219
in open shift. So part of being security at Red Hat is we would assign CV ES to

655
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:27,500
issue

656
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,339
the moment.

657
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:30,390
We figured out it was a security related issue

658
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,329
and

659
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:33,910
the vast majority of our security bugs were public

660
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,969
like we didn't hide them. They just weren't worth it like they weren't that bad.

661
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:39,910
And I actually got told off because

662
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:42,650
there was a rival company that was basically saying,

663
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,079
look at all these open security flaws and openshift,

664
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:47,199
they've been open for X number of days.

665
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:51,319
Our stuff only has security flaws for a few number of days because they were one

666
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,760
of those vendors that only assigns a CV

667
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,410
identifier like the minute that they release the pass

668
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,069
-- one of those,
-- you know, and keeps everything hidden.

669
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,069
And I was like, ok, well, sorry,

670
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,790
I mean, ok,

671
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,430
so I want, I want to use that as a good example, action.

672
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,359
This is still something Red Hat does.

673
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:13,140
Red Hat has been ridiculously open, especially around security to the point of

674
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,329
just hilariousness sometimes

675
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,979
and a lot of competitors would never do that.

676
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,849
I remember like, this always got under my skin.

677
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,150
You

678
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:22,670
can't.

679
00:29:23,189 --> 00:29:24,109
And, and it just,

680
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,939
it always irked me when you'd have the likes of Microsoft and Sun and Oracle.

681
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:31,170
-- And I'm like, oh, you know,
-- look, redhead has 3000 open security box.

682
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,959
-- I'm like, yeah, I know I filed them all.
-- I know I hated that.

683
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:37,469
All right. I feel like we're just telling tales of redhead at this point.

684
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:40,790
-- That's part of the thing that is how, that's how we got here.
-- It is.

685
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,349
It's totally how we got here

686
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,339
and look, here's, here's how I will end this.

687
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,050
Here's kind of my parting thought on this is the first blog post. Red Hat released

688
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,430
was a little weaselly and kind of crappy.

689
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:53,500
And when I saw Mike mcgrath had a second blog post, I was,

690
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:58,699
I opened it fully expecting it to be declaring how this is good for open source,

691
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,239
right?

692
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,089
And when I saw at the end where he basically said we did this to cut off the clones.

693
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:04,239
I was like, well done,

694
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,790
Mike like that is the only thing you could have said

695
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,420
in this to do the right thing and well done like

696
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:10,420
100%

697
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:12,810
and more to the point. I like,

698
00:30:13,135 --> 00:30:15,806
I'm sorry, but this is a massive free rider problem.

699
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:20,245
Part of it too is to remember is not just missing revenue for Red Hat, but like

700
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,125
there's this, I think to some degree, there's some perception issues as well,

701
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,895
which I, I know at Red Hat, I was always a bit frustrated.

702
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:28,975
I want to stop this conversation right now.

703
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:31,166
We literally a few minutes ago just talked about

704
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,426
how this probably won't increase Red Hat's revenue.

705
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:37,131
I don't think this is a free rider problem.

706
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:41,552
I think this when it boils down to, it feels like an issue of fairness.

707
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:46,511
It's not fair when someone takes Red Hat's hard work and uses it

708
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:51,511
sometimes against them, which was what Oracle Enterprise, Linux for a long time.

709
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:53,222
-- Well,
-- what I was about to get to is like the,

710
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:57,171
the having these clones actually incurs a cost to Red Hat

711
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,579
in some ways because I've had people complain about Centa stuff and I'm like,

712
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:02,359
I can't fix that.

713
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,670
I work at Red Hat. I don't work at Sento.

714
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,439
Here's

715
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:04,849
back

716
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,680
before. No, no, I don't think it matters. I think this is one of those issues.

717
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:12,229
There are many times that something doesn't feel fair

718
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:13,030
and

719
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,099
we as humans like to take actions that we feel like

720
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,239
levels the playing field and this is like one of my favorite

721
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,770
examples of this is when you see like public assistance for the poor

722
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,000
saying you have to take a drug test or you have to

723
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,260
try to find a job and you have to do this thing,

724
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:28,560
right?

725
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:32,209
And at the end of the day, it actually ends up hurting everybody,

726
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:36,459
but it feels more fair and, and, and that's what it comes down to.

727
00:31:36,469 --> 00:31:37,689
And I think this is what that is.

728
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:40,410
This feels more fair to the Red Hat people,

729
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,280
but it's actually going to hurt everybody.

730
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,089
It's going to hurt Red Hat and it's going to hurt

731
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,560
the not Red Hat people.

732
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:45,770
Well,

733
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,609
and the one argument I saw was that I think

734
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:52,119
is about the only argument against this that holds water is

735
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:52,839
people stand

736
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,074
on the shoulders of Red hat,

737
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:58,915
-- not fair, blah, blah, blah. Well, I mean, Red Hat, no,
-- we all stand on Red Hat.

738
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:03,614
-- How much freaking open source does Red Hat contribute to? And
-- Red Hat

739
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:05,714
also stands on the shoulders of Giants.

740
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,535
And one thing that really annoyed me is somebody was like, oh Red Hat doesn't,

741
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:09,665
you know, write the Linux Colonel.

742
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:13,824
-- I'm like, actually, yeah, like 13% of it,
-- like, strange contributor to the, every

743
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:16,935
year, like, consistently, about 10 to 13%

744
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:18,375
is from Red Hat.

745
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:19,415
Like that's,

746
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:21,449
that's massive. So that really annoyed me.

747
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:21,650
But the,

748
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,329
but that's kind of the only argument that even holds a little tiny bit of water.

749
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:25,849
But

750
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,969
I would say to that argument of like, there's a huge difference between

751
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,569
taking a bunch of open source and just reshipping it bit for bit versus actually

752
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:37,089
adding a whole bunch of value, putting your heart into it,

753
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:41,719
paying literally thousands of people to fix the software and to produce,

754
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,869
to produce security patches on a Saturday afternoon and

755
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,229
-- not hang out with their kids
-- been there,

756
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:49,130
you know,

757
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,900
and I, I think that's a big part of this is like,

758
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:55,500
the people really have no idea about the amount of work.

759
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,459
No, I, I think this is the fairness argument again, Kurt, like,

760
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:00,750
I don't think it's a matter of,

761
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:05,260
is, is this good for Redhead? Is this bad for redhead? It feels unfair.

762
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,829
And so a thing has been done to make it fair.

763
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:14,430
And I think I, I, my suspicion is it's going to hurt everybody

764
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,150
because that's what fairness often is.

765
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,770
-- Yeah. Well,
-- people don't like something

766
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,790
that they had for free being taken away from them.

767
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,420
And that's part of it too.

768
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:28,699
Look, it's not just that I really think like the chosen one perspective, like Red Hat

769
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,199
doesn't feel like the chosen one anymore.

770
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:32,359
Another company.

771
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,630
I, I think you think, and that's the thing, right?

772
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,319
Compared to literally every other company, they're still doing better,

773
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:41,020
I think for open source than many other places.

774
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,319
But again, the chosen one, right?

775
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:46,869
It's like when we look at the Jedi, like, there's probably a bunch of dirt bag, Jedi

776
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,420
and we're like, oh, whatever. But you, you were the one you were going to save us all.

777
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,189
And then you

778
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,430
-- entered everybody.
-- The one thing that's always kind of wild to me is like

779
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,619
Sousa just sort of kept a low profile. Right. Like

780
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,900
-- they're still around.
-- Oh, no, they're still around. But like, when's the last time

781
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:06,060
you kind of heard about them or thought about them?

782
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:08,320
And that's goes to the point of the chosen one. Like

783
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,020
there are other Linux companies like

784
00:34:10,188 --> 00:34:10,418
ubuntu.

785
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,739
Well, uh huh.

786
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,850
I, I know,

787
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,790
but Red Hats, the one, they were always the one

788
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,649
and now they're just like everybody else.

789
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,070
Yeah,

790
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:19,790
that's it.

791
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:22,217
Maybe that's why everybody's so upset is Red

792
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,467
Hat is just another software company now.

793
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:26,279
-- It's the
-- end of an era, you know,

794
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,197
and,

795
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:31,289
and it is what it is and Red Hat is a company and they're going to do what they think is,

796
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:31,717
right?

797
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:33,239
-- And there's nothing we can do
-- about it.

798
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:33,489
I mean,

799
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:36,197
maybe that's part of the problem is Red Hat is a company that is now

800
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,717
going to behave like a company and not behave like a bunch of open source

801
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,168
zealots. I mean,

802
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,879
-- which 20 years ago it was,
-- it's been on that path for a long time and

803
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,540
in 2004, like, we would have burnt that place down.

804
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,070
They

805
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,860
have something like this.

806
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,340
I, I remember my induction for Red Hat.

807
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,040
There was me another technical person and then a bunch of, like,

808
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,340
15 sales people that had just been hired

809
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,709
and they had to teach them about the GP L and open source.

810
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,080
And of course, me and the technical person are like, oh,

811
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,520
ok. They don't know what this is fair.

812
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,399
Yeah. Right. And, you know,

813
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,550
they really didn't understand open source and they really didn't, like,

814
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,679
get it because it,

815
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,639
yeah, I mean,

816
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:16,320
we didn't have to do that when I started because it was just a bunch of tech nerds.

817
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:17,679
Everybody else.

818
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:20,129
I mean, would have sat through it and be like, oh, it's a,

819
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:22,360
it's a multilevel marketing scheme or a cult.

820
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm out. Right.

821
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:29,949
And maybe that's, maybe that's what's really poking at people.

822
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:32,100
Is it, is the end of an era. It's the end.

823
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,719
It's been two decades and Linux one, it's boring. It's a utility.

824
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:38,679
It is that, that's just it. Linux one. It's boring.

825
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,679
I'm sitting here

826
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,280
on a Windows 11 system with, I think. How many open Linux?

827
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:44,600
A bunch of open Linux

828
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,600
VM?

829
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:48,629
Si mean, I still run Linux because every time I try running windows,

830
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,364
I make it a couple of months and then like, I rage quit

831
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:55,064
but I mean, I'm not even running VM. So I'm running Windows subsystem for Linux

832
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:59,425
-- version two. Like, it's baked into the Os. It's technically
-- a VM.

833
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:03,334
Well, no, my point is it's not a third party. App, it's baked into Microsoft.

834
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:06,534
-- That's true. That's true. They, they, you had
-- told me that 20 years ago

835
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,465
the Linux would be baked in.

836
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:12,975
Oh. And if you go to the Microsoft store, they also removed all the fake Linuxes.

837
00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:14,590
So, when you used to go to the Microsoft store

838
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:16,780
five years ago and you typed in like sento s

839
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:20,649
there was a bunch of scammy ones that came up that cost like 50 bucks or 100 bucks.

840
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:21,090
And I was like,

841
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:22,929
I remember they're all gone now.

842
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,699
It's just, it's clean and pure.

843
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,010
As far as I know,

844
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:27,409
that's the way it should be.

845
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,419
And which, which variant of Linux

846
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,169
do you run in your WSO

847
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,540
-- open
-- to LTs

848
00:36:32,669 --> 00:36:32,719
and

849
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:33,580
two? OK.

850
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:39,209
-- I'm just, I want to be boring. I want it to work.
-- That's fair. I get it. I understand.

851
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,719
-- And
-- what I love is I can type things like X clock and it just pops up on my screen now.

852
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:44,659
I know. Right. Like, it's amazing,

853
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:49,050
-- dude, 20 years ago, I couldn't even get that thing working on Linux.
-- That's true.

854
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,310
That's

855
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,580
actually why I ran Sousa for a while.

856
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,399
Remember because Sousa had the X config program and I didn't have to

857
00:36:54,409 --> 00:36:56,850
guess at the values that may or may not break my monitor.

858
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,649
I remember.

859
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:58,889
Yeah, because if you did it wrong,

860
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:01,810
your monitor would do scary things and make weird noises.

861
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,955
You could overdrive the, the, the V sink or the H sync and that's right. You could,

862
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:07,445
you could make the magic ker

863
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,235
chunk, stop k

864
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:08,885
chunking.

865
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:09,284
Yeah.

866
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:14,435
That was the, the days of C RT monitors and people have no idea how good we have it now.

867
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:14,985
It

868
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,074
was so bad.

869
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:20,514
I can just tell my monitor to display stuff and I probably won't break it.

870
00:37:20,844 --> 00:37:24,314
I have, I haven't thought about configuring a monitor

871
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,514
in so long I can. It, it's not even funny.

872
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:29,929
Yeah. Anyway. All right, I'm gonna call this one.

873
00:37:29,939 --> 00:37:33,080
We're getting long winded and just telling stories of the days of yore.

874
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:34,939
Like I have a different podcast for that.

875
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:35,689
