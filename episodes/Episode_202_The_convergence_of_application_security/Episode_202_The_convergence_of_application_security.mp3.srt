Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,390
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:11,119
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,630
So, what's new? I've actually managed to fix the grass on my lawn.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,930
What does that mean? How do you fix grass?

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,760
Well, where there's dirt,

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,530
you put seed and more dirt and then water it and then you get grass.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,049
Ok. And then you pull all the weeds out and then you

8
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:27,504
that for like five days and then you just hire somebody

9
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:29,684
with a giant truck full of chemicals to come by and

10
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,665
spray down your yard.

11
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:33,744
Which, and it was great though because like the next day,

12
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:36,555
all the dandelions were like wilting and dropping dead and then it rained.

13
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:38,145
And then the next two days after that,

14
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,985
there's like this super fresh crop of healthy dandelions.

15
00:00:41,044 --> 00:00:44,715
-- I
-- must say, I love the way Canadians say dandelion.

16
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:46,665
You say dandelions.

17
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,424
-- It's marvelous. Well,
-- because it's always plural. Have you ever seen just one?

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,275
Yeah.

19
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:52,860
Ok.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:53,959
Um,

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,759
and then, you know,

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,409
I also had my ant guy come by and there was only two ant hills

23
00:00:57,419 --> 00:01:00,529
in my yard this year compared to like 10 or 20 the first year.

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:00,970
So

25
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,750
again, you know,

26
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,750
unrestricted chemical warfare is working on the ants because at this point,

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,739
like the powder you buy at, like Home Depot, I think it's just food for them.

28
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,639
They, that powder has always killed my aunts.

29
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,870
-- But I don't know, we might have lax laws in the US.
-- Oh,

30
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:19,620
yeah, we have pretty, like the, the, the stuff that they use on my yard.

31
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:22,419
I'm not allowed to buy unless I have like, an exterminator's license.

32
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,559
Oh,

33
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,910
that's exciting.

34
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:27,370
-- Yeah. Well, we're also not allowed to use herbicides. Like,
-- not at all.

35
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,529
-- Yeah, that's pretty much banned in most major Canadian cities.
-- Interesting.

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,525
-- But you can hire someone to come and do it for you.
-- Yeah.

37
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:37,785
And it's kind of a grayish area in that they use herbicides that are

38
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:41,544
legally compliant and they're definitely not as good as the old timey ones.

39
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:42,864
But, I mean, like, the old timey ones are, like,

40
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,404
round up and stuff where it's just like scorched earth, you know,

41
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:47,504
you put that stuff down and everything's dead.

42
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:48,745
We still have that here.

43
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,864
Yeah. Oh, yeah, you can get that here if you're a farmer.

44
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,745
-- I see. But again, like, in the city you
-- can't,

45
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,084
I mean, that seems fair.

46
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:56,410
So, I've,

47
00:01:56,419 --> 00:02:00,620
I've given up caring about my lawn because the people on the radio said it's good

48
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,220
for the bees to just let all the weeds grow and don't mow it too often.

49
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,400
So, I feel like as a lazy person.

50
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,960
That is the optimal explanation for the state of my yard.

51
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,750
I'm not going to disagree with you there.

52
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:12,570
No.

53
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,320
Like if honestly, if we had more beads,

54
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,500
I would probably plant some more wild flowers and stuff because like,

55
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:20,850
you can get Cheerios will send you a packet of wild flower seeds, the cereal company

56
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:21,649
because they need,

57
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,000
well, look at their logo. Their mascot.

58
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,289
Oh, that's true. Their mascot is a bee

59
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,750
honey nut Cheerios. Like

60
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,929
no honey, no honey nut Cheerios.

61
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,550
I'm confident they could use old motor oil or something and, and work it out.

62
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,809
Anyway,

63
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,529
what are we talking about today?

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,580
Well, this kind of leads into the whole app security thing.

65
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:45,259
So what triggered this is as you know, like I was updating a wordpress instance,

66
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,449
you know,

67
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,339
I go to the normal page and it gave me

68
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,529
a warning on the update thing about my security checkup.

69
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,940
And I'm like my what now? Yeah, that's pretty cool.

70
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:54,300
And so I go and look at this web page.

71
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:57,250
Wordpress is complaining about a couple of things

72
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,860
a couple of which were actually legitimate.

73
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:01,809
Somehow I managed to not install zip or image magic

74
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,259
PHP libraries.

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,080
It was complaining that PHP was out of date and that's because it's on a,

76
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:07,850
on an ubuntu LTs, right?

77
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,009
So that the actual semantic version of php that it shows is seven point whatever old,

78
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,789
you know, and the newest version is, I don't even know anymore. 07.3.

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,970
No, wait, more rows. Oh, no, 7.3 coming

80
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,660
out next year anyways.

81
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,559
And then it looked and what was really cool is it not only told me the problems I had,

82
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,750
but it told me that the checks I passed

83
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,630
somewhere.

84
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,869
I can talk to wordpress.org and make sure that we're up to date or what I

85
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,479
wouldn't have thought of is I can talk to myself on local host and like,

86
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,830
send myself requests to like, tell myself to do stuff.

87
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,240
Right.

88
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,119
And some cool ones too, like it actually complained about my file permissions,

89
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,529
which are a bit wonky because the whole thing is it's actually a G

90
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,520
repo, you know, checked in whatever.

91
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:45,190
And it was smart enough to know that it was smart

92
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,279
enough to say your wordpress is managed like it's a Git

93
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,679
repo. So it's probably managed wild, like to be aware of that. Right. Because

94
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,960
if I do like a wordpress update, then I also have to, you know,

95
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,919
check those updates to get otherwise.

96
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,449
Well, they're going to disappear someday.

97
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,449
And conversely, the, you know, the get

98
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,380
repo, you could update stuff in the get

99
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,039
repo manually or whatever and then, you know,

100
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,330
do a check out and get an up to date wordpress.

101
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:07,039
It got me thinking because, you know,

102
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,750
traditionally apps have sort of just passed the buck on

103
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,449
that is the system up to date or not,

104
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,369
who can say nobody cares.

105
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,608
Right. Like, really? And it got me thinking,

106
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,540
is there a way to kind of get like a health score on an Os

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,320
in the sense of for an operating system to say to an app?

108
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:28,269
Look, I'm like 95% up to date or, you know, like a great example.

109
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,480
My Windows 10 gaming machine.

110
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:31,899
I religiously keep that thing up to date because

111
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,399
the kids use it for school now and I don't

112
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,200
want it stalling out and having to reboot for an

113
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,179
update when the kids need to get on school.

114
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,920
Sure. Right.

115
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:40,480
So, like every couple of days, I like sit in front of it,

116
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,809
log in type update and it's like last check for updates, you know,

117
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,859
usually a recent time

118
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:48,579
and I'll manually force updates just to make it stay up to date.

119
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,089
And is there any way for like, because I know, for example,

120
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,799
there's no way for an app to be like, hey, I'm, I'm talking to the network.

121
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:57,019
-- Is this encrypted
-- since you mentioned this the other day?

122
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,540
I've been, I've been thinking about this topic a lot and I think

123
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,179
in order to have a functional conversation,

124
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,570
we have to set the ground rule of, let's ignore the fact

125
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,970
that today,

126
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,529
an app needs an extraordinary level of access to the

127
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,850
operating system to be able to make this decision.

128
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:15,890
Let's pretend

129
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,769
there's an API

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,480
that can say these are all of my updates or something.

131
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,730
Well, or just general system settings.

132
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,989
Great example, I mean, I think Red Hat just rolled the soda.

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,329
You have system wide crypto policy now, right?

134
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,679
Whereas traditionally, it was like, if I have, well, if I have a website

135
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:31,890
server

136
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,720
running, how's that web server configured?

137
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,089
Well, the web server knows none of the web apps under it.

138
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,299
-- No,
-- or even more importantly is

139
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,450
you could,

140
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,890
there would, there would be no way to tell the web server

141
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,359
we only want to use TLS 1.2 or 1.3.

142
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,290
And then to also tell, let's say the mail server

143
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,209
that we also, you know what I mean,

144
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,470
where you had to configure everything independently and it was a huge headache.

145
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,910
I know with email, for example, there's now headers that so that the data gets

146
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,790
appended to and you know, so for example, when I open up my email and gmail,

147
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,390
I can see that

148
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:10,540
this email came from a remote system to gmail over a TLS connection. Right? Yes.

149
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,320
Generally speaking,

150
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:15,279
I don't have a way of really firmly knowing

151
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,820
that with most other apps and types of data,

152
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,859
this database connection was it encrypted?

153
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,290
Ok. Let's, let's start at the beginning and

154
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,130
wordpress

155
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:27,429
gave you kind of a little check up

156
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,649
that said here's some things you should investigate.

157
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:32,369
-- It was actually about 40 or 50 items.
-- That's a lot.

158
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,839
Yeah,

159
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:34,329
I was pretty shocked actually.

160
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:35,369
-- Like I
-- said, now,

161
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,839
here's where I think wordpress is special is they have been beat up for a long time

162
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,730
over many, many security problems.

163
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,829
And I would say in the vast majority of cases it is

164
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,980
people running outdated versions of wordpress that they haven't updated in years

165
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,549
and it makes wordpress look bad.

166
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,679
So they have an incentive to kind of do the right thing here.

167
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,959
-- Well,
-- and they're also something like 30% of websites by numbers. It's

168
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,119
-- a lot.
-- Yeah.

169
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,899
It's weird to me.

170
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,160
They're like the biggest little app you never heard of,

171
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,720
but everybody uses constantly.

172
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:07,350
Yeah, because it works

173
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,029
well. I mean, you ended up moving our

174
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:09,279
web,

175
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,920
like the open security podcast episode.

176
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,429
-- Do you even know what our domain name is?
-- Open

177
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,829
Security podcast?

178
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,760
You ended up moving it from Blogger to wordpress because it was such a, you know.

179
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:23,440
Yeah, because blogger was broken and the thing I still love is like

180
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,239
I moved it

181
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,549
in a fit of rage

182
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,190
and I just exported all the podcast content and I imported it into wordpress and like

183
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,660
it just worked.

184
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,260
There were, there were a couple of little niggles I had to fix.

185
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,079
But generally speaking, I was shocked.

186
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,459
-- I
-- think that's why wordpress one is somebody like our

187
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,119
parents can manage it and administer it and use it.

188
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,529
I wouldn't go that far.

189
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,500
But

190
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,929
anyway, anyway, let's move away from them.

191
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,079
Maybe because I think wordpress is too easy. Of an example.

192
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:54,660
They have a lot of incentive to do this and they have a lot of history behind it.

193
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,480
So let's, let's move to something different and say, I, I don't, what,

194
00:07:58,489 --> 00:07:59,399
what should we pick on?

195
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,410
Let's pick on a web server.

196
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:05,440
Is it the web server's job to look at the system it's running on?

197
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,839
Let's ask that question.

198
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,376
OK, let's say, for example, let's pick on Apache,

199
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:13,795
you configure Apache to use TLS 1.21 higher and to not use SSL, right?

200
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:16,656
Which I think is actually the default. Now, I would hope it is.

201
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:18,286
And let's say you're running on a system that

202
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:21,075
only has TLS library support up to version 1.1.

203
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,835
-- Should Apache care or should that be your problem or
-- no,

204
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:28,335
it should bail if you try to do that because it should have the ability.

205
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:30,066
It's, it's asking for the ability.

206
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:33,392
It's not requiring it because it can still do TLS 1.1.

207
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,192
But if you explicitly forbid it in the configuration

208
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:39,351
-- file,
-- I'm saying you explicitly allow TLS say 1.1 and higher.

209
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:42,671
But the system underlying libraries say only support TLS

210
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:45,252
1.1 and they don't support TLS 1.2 and higher.

211
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:50,111
OK? Apache is now limited. It can't do TLS 1.1 and higher. It can only do TLS 1.1.

212
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:54,421
-- OK? Well,
-- should Apache bail or warn or air out or something?

213
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:55,531
Does it?

214
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:56,671
I have no idea.

215
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:57,791
It should

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,409
work because if you specify 1.1 or higher

217
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,619
in that Venn diagram you've met your requirements.

218
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,960
Let's, let's ask this question a little differently.

219
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:08,770
Maybe that makes more sense is,

220
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,419
should Apache know

221
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:15,280
that basically you want TLS 12 or 13 and everything else is trash and,

222
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:20,320
-- and should it look for that and issue a warning if you're say using TLS 1.1
-- I,

223
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:21,460
I guess part of it

224
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:26,013
decomposes to where do you sort of look at the system and,

225
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:30,612
and and apply policy like do you do it at the system level external to Apache,

226
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:32,372
like editing its config files or you know,

227
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:35,132
like wordpress does Apache have some built in intelligence

228
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:38,572
and for example, a Apache now is smart enough to like

229
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:43,312
query its open SSL library or whatever and say like what do you talk, what can you do?

230
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:45,442
What are you capable of? And for example,

231
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:46,575
has a flag that says,

232
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:50,125
you know, I am required to do TLS 1.1 and higher.

233
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,476
So TLS 1112 and maybe 13,

234
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:56,216
I think 1.3 is mostly supported now it should be completely supported now.

235
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,005
And so basically, you know, if you can't do

236
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:03,565
TLS 1112 or 13, I'm going to bail at start up and say TLS 12 and 13 were not available.

237
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:04,716
So I'm bailing out,

238
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:09,185
you need to update your OS or change a config setting to allow this.

239
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:10,125
So

240
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,729
the historical view on this is that it is

241
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,510
the system administrators problem to set this up correctly.

242
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,320
And that's functionally how Apache works today.

243
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,119
-- And I
-- get past the B because it's, it's a solution that works,

244
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:25,320
-- it does
-- work.

245
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,510
But I, I wonder so in the context of Apache,

246
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,400
I think it is slightly different

247
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,989
because

248
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,239
you are expected to do a lot of configuration just to get to that point.

249
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,030
And so that might be

250
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,679
a less than ideal

251
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,659
situation.

252
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,750
Nobody runs Apache for the sake of running Apache,

253
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,559
you run Apache because you have an application on it.

254
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,159
Whereas wordpress, you run for the sake of running wordpress

255
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,840
-- and,
-- and that's a good point is I think maybe,

256
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,320
maybe part of the trick here is

257
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,679
to identify the difference between infrastructure and

258
00:10:57,229 --> 00:11:00,159
application or, or useful thing, maybe.

259
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:03,619
Well, the thing that you want versus the thing that no offense, but I can run

260
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,830
well, Wordpress,

261
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,609
I can run wordpress or I don't run wordpress.

262
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:10,969
There's not a lot of things that are functionally identical to wordpress.

263
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:14,429
Whereas web servers, there's a lot of things that are functionally identical,

264
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,539
right?

265
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,960
-- It's just infrastructure like
-- engine X versus

266
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,299
Apache literally took me like five minutes

267
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,604
reading the website to be like, oh OK.

268
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:26,585
Here's the syntax, here's a slightly different view of how the world works.

269
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:29,294
Like as far as syntax goes. OK. Done, it's working.

270
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,104
OK?

271
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:33,854
So I would define this as infrastructure versus solution

272
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,304
I think is a nice way to put it.

273
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:38,575
There are solutions like let's say I need email, right?

274
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:41,835
Saying I need email is different than saying I need to set up send mail

275
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:44,744
because no one should ever set up, send mail again.

276
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:45,544
But

277
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,369
you know what I mean?

278
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,520
And, and this is a case where let's say you have an email solution.

279
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,309
Should your email solution have the ability to say you've configured?

280
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,260
You know, like, like D Mark is a great one.

281
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,570
You can tell everyone about what happened when you set up D Mark in your domain.

282
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,929
Well, I had D Mark set up on my domain but I had a policy of none. So it was just

283
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:05,390
whatever, like I have dear

284
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,299
policy but don't. So your three options for

285
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,500
dar policy are none

286
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,539
quarantine and reject.

287
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,770
None is none. Like just whatever quarantine is

288
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:17,599
send this email to quarantine on your like,

289
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:21,849
so if you receive email from me that is supposedly spoofed or something,

290
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,489
you know, shove it into your quarantine and maybe take a look at it, maybe don't,

291
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,359
I don't know whatever.

292
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,700
And then your third option,

293
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,710
which is the the harsh one is the reject where I'm saying like

294
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,570
if you get email that claims to be from

295
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:32,250
cre.org

296
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,479
and in my case, I have SPF with a minus all

297
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,989
and I have DKIM set up to put it bluntly.

298
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,909
Cre.org email only comes from my G suite account. Anything else is not right?

299
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,520
Reject.

300
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,510
My male client knows nothing about this.

301
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,950
And maybe that's the problem is that these apps

302
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,690
and these levels have historically never talked to each other.

303
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,590
That is true.

304
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,710
But I think this again comes back to the solution versus infrastructure aspect,

305
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,070
right?

306
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,609
I think when you have a solution,

307
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,770
you expect things to work together in ways that infrastructure might not.

308
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,200
Here's a great example. Let's say I have a solution.

309
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,700
Let's say it's a blog platform and I'm not going to

310
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,369
say wordpress because I don't know how wordpress actually works.

311
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,630
I just pay Wordpress to post wordpress. So I'm lazy and it's way less work.

312
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,530
But let's say, for example, you have a blog platform and you need a database.

313
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:23,719
There are certain ones that can support a multitude of databases.

314
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,909
So in that context, it's going to reach out,

315
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,979
but it's not the job of the database to say, oh,

316
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:30,270
you have to connect with TLS necessarily, it's,

317
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,809
it's going to be up to the application to say I'm not using encryption.

318
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,669
-- And
-- conversely, people do do that at the database level sometimes like you,

319
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,320
you can set your database to only accept hes 1.2 and better connections.

320
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:43,780
And and maybe that's kind of the answer is that we, you know,

321
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:47,270
we historically a long time ago gave up because these apps don't talk to each other.

322
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,380
So you just keep slapping duct tape down at every layer that

323
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,070
you can like you can't necessarily fix every client connecting to you

324
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:56,030
and have them all talk to us.

325
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,409
So you do it at the database server level, you know,

326
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,309
and just reject all plain text connections.

327
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,950
I mean, to a degree, this also comes back to the we, we had that episode.

328
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,669
Oh, it's been a couple now where we kind of talked about this,

329
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,530
this concept of back in the day.

330
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:14,070
It was common to be generous in what you accept.

331
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,909
And I think this is similar where it was historical

332
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,789
that we would accept like any incoming client and whatever,

333
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,780
it's not our problem.

334
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:25,150
And, and maybe that time has to change.

335
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:28,309
You know, we've talked about this in the in the space of like app updates or you know,

336
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,229
device updates,

337
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,739
you know, do we want to punish people for having old out of date systems?

338
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,250
Well, maybe, I mean to a degree. Yes.

339
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,770
You know, this is why I'll never buy a smart appliances.

340
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,619
People are all of a sudden discovering that their dishwasher, what was it

341
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,460
not a dishwasher, a clothing washing machine

342
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,010
now just shows

343
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,169
e where it used to show your calendar and weather.

344
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,369
And my first thought was why doesn't everybody

345
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,840
have a smartphone to look at that stuff?

346
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,340
You would think so?

347
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,729
Like I got a new bathroom scale. It's a smart scale.

348
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:55,679
And the reason I bought a new one is

349
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,539
because this one actually talks to Apple Health Kit.

350
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,419
My old, you know, smart scale didn't talk to Apple Health Kit.

351
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,450
You had to pay like eight bucks for an app to

352
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,169
export the data and put it into your Apple Health kit.

353
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,960
And I'm like, so it's clearly possible.

354
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,849
Just fitbit has chosen not to do it.

355
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:11,450
So, ok, I'm ditching their ecosystem because it doesn't play well with others.

356
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,530
And so my bathroom scale is configured to show my weight and my BM and stuff.

357
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,950
And it also shows me like the weather and I'm like, why I have a smartphone for that.

358
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,609
And one thing I realize is really with cars, drives home,

359
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,070
I don't want my car to be smart.

360
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,229
I want my car to be an accessory to my smartphone.

361
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:32,650
I mean, that's a good way to look at it. So funny enough, my parents bought a Ford car

362
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,679
probably like five or six years ago and it came with this terrible in,

363
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,890
in car entertainment thing and it was like Windows

364
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,289
Auto or something. I forget what it was even called. It's made by Microsoft

365
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,619
though and you look at it now and it's a piece of junk and nothing works with it.

366
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,210
And I keep thinking this is the dumbest thing ever.

367
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:51,929
-- Yeah,
-- I basically want my car to be a Bluetooth speaker, microphone,

368
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,309
maybe a screen to show me the map.

369
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,049
Yeah, I agree with that. It's, it's madness.

370
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:59,150
But ok, so anyway, I,

371
00:15:59,679 --> 00:15:59,710
I

372
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,419
don't feel like we've come to any conclusions. I I guess

373
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,659
here is,

374
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,820
here is my thought on all of this is, I feel like

375
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,219
we are reaching a point in the world of computing and this

376
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:14,219
is partially thanks to containers and cloud and everything that's going on.

377
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:17,419
Where I think historically, people would buy infrastructure,

378
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,380
they would cobble their infrastructure together

379
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,630
and they would create a solution for, to solve the problem they had to solve.

380
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,765
And I think we've reached a point now where you can kind of buy solutions.

381
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,606
And I do think it's up to the solutions to do the right thing.

382
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:33,426
I think, for example, let's say I have wordpress and I'll pick on them here.

383
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:35,645
Uh I would expect if I would say getting

384
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:38,385
wordpress that it would set up TLS correctly and it

385
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:41,005
would encrypt things correctly and it would use secure

386
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:43,505
connections to databases and all that kind of stuff.

387
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:46,205
Versus if I was literally like creating an art

388
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:49,211
tal blog platform, it would be my problem

389
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:52,351
supporting that would actually violate a lot of company security policies and that

390
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,802
the web application shouldn't be allowed to like talk to the web server,

391
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:55,981
config files and change them.

392
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:59,572
-- I
-- I wouldn't view it like that though. That's, that's a stupid policy.

393
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:02,231
Then this is a solution I acquired

394
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,031
and

395
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,942
it effects,

396
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:09,511
it's kind of funny you mentioned that is I see this with all the container scans I get

397
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,098
where historically before people were like, you know,

398
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:16,348
opening up a container and looking inside you could do anything you wanted

399
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,868
and nobody knew or cared. And now they're saying, oh, why do you do this?

400
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,630
Well, we did the same thing with operating systems for the longest time.

401
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,848
Yeah, that's very true. I mean, it's exactly the same thing.

402
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,368
The way we shipped operating systems 20 years

403
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,880
ago now would possibly result in a lawsuit

404
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,260
that's reasonable. And I feel like you look at operating systems now and

405
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:39,459
they generally, at least from the consumer perspective, they auto update.

406
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:42,380
They, it, it's all just kind of magic, right? You can't,

407
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,540
if you download a web browser and you're connecting to a site without,

408
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,859
without a real certificate, it's nearly impossible to get to it.

409
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,349
Now, remember the good old days?

410
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,140
Oh, I had, I had my own self signed certificates on everything because man,

411
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,619
I couldn't afford to pay for those things.

412
00:17:57,739 --> 00:18:02,650
That's right. I did. Now that you say that I remember that I did run on my website. I ran

413
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,770
my own self science certificates because,

414
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,180
-- because certificates were expensive, well,
-- not just expensive, but like,

415
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:10,489
I actually bought one for seared.org back in the day and

416
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,920
they didn't really know how to sell it to me.

417
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,020
They're like, can we have your business number?

418
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,760
And I'm like, not a business, I'm an individual and they're like, what I'm like,

419
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,380
I am Kurt

420
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:17,280
Seri. I own

421
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,219
creed.org. I want a certificate for c.org and they're like,

422
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:24,130
you have to prove that you like own seafood. And I'm like, it's my last name.

423
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,050
Photo ID work and they're like,

424
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,479
and they mold it over for one.

425
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,319
They're like, yeah, a passport, not a driver's license.

426
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,750
And I'm like, ok, and I literally, you know,

427
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,599
sent them a copy of the front page of my passport, which I mean, no offense,

428
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,000
but I'm pretty sure Photoshop could have,

429
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:42,150
you know, manage that back in the day even. Right. But yeah, I mean,

430
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,430
it just, it was such a chore and such a pain. And now of course, again,

431
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:49,250
well, there's an actual Apache module or whatever for let's encrypt that just

432
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,180
like literally that me snapping my finger and going poop.

433
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:53,589
That's about how long it takes to set up.

434
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,170
Oh, it, it's trivial. It's so easy to do.

435
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,089
I think you answered three questions, your domain name,

436
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:01,150
your email address and whether or not you want updates or warnings or something.

437
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,069
That's it. You're done.

438
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,310
Maybe it's one of those things where the time has finally come.

439
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,819
Not only that this needs to happen,

440
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:10,729
but that it's possible to happen because software has matured a bit.

441
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,479
Yes, I think that's a big part of it.

442
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:15,540
And so the example I like to always use here

443
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,189
is in the sixties humanity went to the moon,

444
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,109
then we didn't

445
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,310
ever again.

446
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:23,199
And so why was it? Right?

447
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:26,969
It was because we could go to the moon with the current technology.

448
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:30,400
But it was the equivalent of cobbling everything together

449
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,380
and holding it there with tape and praying,

450
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,400
nobody died.

451
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:39,719
Whereas today we actually have the technology to actually go to the moon.

452
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,520
We actually have a space truck now.

453
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,680
Elon Musk.

454
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,920
Right. Right.

455
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,260
And that's a huge difference.

456
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,040
Or I love, have you seen the, I'll try to dig this up and I put it in the show

457
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,709
notes, but there was a picture of the

458
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,069
Apollo kind of instruments in the capsule.

459
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,829
There's a picture of the space shuttle

460
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,869
and there was a picture of the dragon capsule

461
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,229
and the dragon capsule is like an ipad like,

462
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,130
I mean,

463
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,170
and you know what else I love is I was watching.

464
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,910
So the, the for anyone maybe listening in the future, maybe about a week ago,

465
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,869
the dragon capsule carried the first humans into space and it was successful.

466
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,430
Thank goodness, nothing went wrong.

467
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,770
And it was fascinating to listen to everyone though because they kept talking about

468
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,089
how much automation there was and how little the astronauts had to like.

469
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,760
Well, no, it, it kind of, but the thing is actually so in the early space program,

470
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:33,810
the scientists wanted to basically build a tin can for the

471
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,930
astronauts to sit in and they wouldn't have anything to do.

472
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:38,380
And the astronauts were like, no, we're going to fly this ship,

473
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,560
you're going to put a stick in it.

474
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:40,339
And in fact, they,

475
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:42,770
if they didn't do that a bunch of them would have died

476
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,780
because they ended up flying in and saving their own lives.

477
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,030
But

478
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,079
like the point is that it is a very different mindset of,

479
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,959
I want to fly this spaceship to.

480
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,260
-- Oh, no. Please don't let me touch anything. Well, that's
-- the old Airbus joke. Right.

481
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,550
When Airbus came up with fly by wire, when it was new,

482
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,569
the joke was, you know,

483
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,810
that Airbus planes will ship with a dog and the dog's

484
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:02,060
job is to prevent the pilot from touching the control.

485
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:04,780
That's great.

486
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:09,439
You know, and, and I mean, fly by wire, you know. Yeah, I had teething problems and,

487
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,930
-- you know, some unexpected stuff and then, well, we got it mostly working.
-- Right.

488
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,199
Right.

489
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:20,140
And I even, even cars now are, I, I wouldn't say they're all drive by wire,

490
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,880
but things like the accelerator

491
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,839
is just a switch these days.

492
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,359
It's not like the good old days where when you push the accelerator,

493
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,489
pull a little cord that was attached to the engine

494
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,660
that pulled on something and made more gas go in.

495
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,609
Like, that sounds insane.

496
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:33,380
Now,

497
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,050
I remember when I first saw one of the first cruise controls and

498
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,339
it literally was like a wire hooked up to a little sensor,

499
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,979
like a little mechanical Doohickey that literally

500
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,729
if it spun too fast, it pulled the wire and if it spun too slow,

501
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:47,040
it released the wire or vice versa, you know, to, like,

502
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,270
actually give it more and less gas to the engine.

503
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:49,910
So,

504
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,449
so my dad had this old motorcycle a long time

505
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,550
ago and do you know what the cruise control was?

506
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,439
It was like a little clip that just held the, the throttle in the same place.

507
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:01,189
I, I do the same thing on my lawn mower. I have a binder clip. Yeah,

508
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:04,189
because I hate having to hold that thing down for it to run, you know,

509
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,510
if you release it, it turns off.

510
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,209
-- Yeah.
-- But then how do you turn it off?

511
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,250
Well, I take the binder clip off

512
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:10,579
binder clip.

513
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:10,900
I

514
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:11,680
zip

515
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:11,869
tie.

516
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,420
Ok.

517
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,439
Now, of course, there are safety concerns because if,

518
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:18,810
for some reason you fall down in front of the lawn mower, it's going to eat you.

519
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:19,770
But whatever,

520
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,030
I know

521
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,010
it's been like

522
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,290
25 years of mowing the lawn. I'm, I mean, I would never

523
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:27,135
this on a tree chipper, but

524
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:28,555
I will do it on my lawn mower.

525
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:31,055
That's right. That's right. Ok. Ok.

526
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:35,415
-- I
-- guess the moral of the story is that, you know, certain safety systems are good,

527
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:37,974
but it is a maturity curve, right?

528
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:38,324
Like,

529
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:39,604
like the fact that

530
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:41,785
I was shocked when wordpress was like,

531
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:42,574
here we go.

532
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:43,895
The folder slash blah, blah,

533
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,584
blah was detected as being under version control dot Get.

534
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,954
That's a really cool check. Somebody at wordpress,

535
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,469
you know,

536
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,589
they put some real thought into these checks

537
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,630
and like this was a nontrivial amount of work

538
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,359
and here's part of the benefit though is

539
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:58,099
now some other web application that wants to do this.

540
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,989
They don't have to start from scratch anymore. Right?

541
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,500
They can just look at this wordpress page and see like, OK, you know, oh, for example,

542
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,310
you check for scheduled events are running, you know,

543
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,890
so I guess Cron Tab or whatever or

544
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,329
whatever wordpress's internal version of Cron Tab is,

545
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:10,469
you know, things like that, right.

546
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:14,109
They're not starting from scratch of like what do we have to check? It's ok.

547
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,589
Well, here's some basic your s

548
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,439
servers up to date, things like that.

549
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:19,140
And so maybe we'll see more of this now

550
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,250
that somebody broke ground and proved it's possible.

551
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,859
I mean, I,

552
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:25,969
I think it's inevitable and wordpress obviously deserves a

553
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:28,079
bunch of credit because this is a cool idea,

554
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:31,829
but I, I do think the world is just generally moving in this direction.

555
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,199
I mean,

556
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:37,479
I see this even in places where if you try to deploy certain horribly out of date,

557
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:42,270
ami S for example, in clouds, it's, it's common to get warnings that you've done

558
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,810
something exceptionally stupid.

559
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:46,280
I mean, I, yeah, I, I think this is where it goes, right.

560
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,890
We're, we're well past the point of artisanal it

561
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,920
and when you have a solution,

562
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,569
I think there's certain expectations and this kind of stuff should

563
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:57,089
be one of them where a great example is if,

564
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:00,849
if I go and buy a car built by a car manufacturer.

565
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,930
I expect it to have relatively few problems.

566
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:07,010
If I built a car myself, I would expect it to be broken all of the time.

567
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,849
-- You
-- know, that's what always gets me when you watch those

568
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,229
where people build like a custom car and it works.

569
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:12,979
And I'm just like, wow, now, granted they're,

570
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:15,380
they're using like off the shelf components that are reliable.

571
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,770
Like, they don't build their own engine

572
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,060
still. Like getting,

573
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:21,189
well, it's like assembling a PC. Right.

574
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:23,050
I remember the days when you assembled a PC and if it only

575
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,189
took three or four attempts to post it and we wires and,

576
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:26,750
you know,

577
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,739
stuff you were considered success and now it's like

578
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,329
the last PC I built was kind of like,

579
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,459
-- oh, that was uneventful and not,
-- it's

580
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,810
not even fun anymore. No.

581
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:39,439
You know, I had one cable, I had one power cable. That was it, everything else.

582
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,869
I've gone to the motherboard.

583
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,709
It's, it's something else. No, I, I totally agree.

584
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:48,689
It's, it's a very different world to say the least, but I, I think that's ok. Right.

585
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:50,089
That's what progress looks like.

586
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:51,119
Where

587
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,250
if you want to be on the bleeding edge of something now it isn't really it anymore.

588
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:57,119
You got to go find something else.

589
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,239
Well, it's, I mean,

590
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,160
there's still those corner cases where people do crazy bleeding edge stuff,

591
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,260
you know, and, and build bespoke systems.

592
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:04,609
But a

593
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:08,800
lot of that too is they're operating at scales or in corner cases where, like,

594
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,099
you'll never have widespread support for that.

595
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,609
-- Yeah.
-- And that's, I mean, look, you have that today. Look at, look at race cars.

596
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:18,920
Race cars are amazing creations that are

597
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,420
held together with bubble gum and chicken wire

598
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:23,479
and they wouldn't have it any other way.

599
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:28,339
And that's great. But I don't, I don't want that. Right. I, I want my boring car.

600
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:29,099
Ok.

601
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:34,000
I, I feel like we've come to a logical conclusion here, which is just around,

602
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,750
this is the expectation of solutions.

603
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,619
And I guess

604
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:38,650
there's,

605
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,530
there's two sides to this is if you're building a solution

606
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,650
and you're not looking into some of these more advanced features,

607
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,530
someone else will obviously.

608
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,810
And I think also if you are still relying on like artisanal infrastructure,

609
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,290
you probably need to take a hard look at what you're doing

610
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,969
because I bet in a lot of cases you shouldn't be.

611
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,750
It's funny that you mentioned that because we're just in

612
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,930
the process of getting rid of all our infrastructure like infrastructure

613
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:05,675
at the CS A and we're moving to platform as a service.

614
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:08,994
And it's funny because the Devs are now like, holy crap. This is amazing and great.

615
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:10,125
And I love it. I'm like, mhm

616
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:10,685
Right.

617
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,584
They just, I want this version of Ruby,

618
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:14,385
everything else happening underneath of it is

619
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,724
the responsibility of a large professional organization.

620
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:17,045
Cool.

621
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,744
It's not curt anymore.

622
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,045
And I'm OK with that.

623
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:23,484
-- And
-- that's the way it should be because developers should develop.

624
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:26,675
They shouldn't like, like the whole concept of devops has always been,

625
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,255
you're making one person do two jobs.

626
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,540
It's not making a lot better.

627
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,979
You know what it reminds me of?

628
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:32,859
It's IKEA,

629
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,449
we save money by making you assemble the furniture.

630
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,280
That's what Dev

631
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,010
Ops is, Dev

632
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,770
Ops is IKEA.

633
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,020
-- It is.
-- And the furniture falls apart in five years and then you have to find you

634
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,060
-- and nobody knows how it was built. Yeah,
-- that too.

635
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:47,099
That too. I do love IKEA furniture though.

636
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:47,319
Well,

637
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:50,780
I love when you see people try to take IKEA furniture apart to

638
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,739
get it back through a door and move it and it's like,

639
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,050
nope.

640
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:53,964
Yeah. Don't do it.

641
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:56,844
It doesn't come apart and you're not moving with it, just throw it away,

642
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:57,364
like,

643
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:02,035
pretty much. And sometimes that's ok. Right. Sometimes that is acceptable.

644
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:06,234
But I, I feel like if, if you want furniture for the grandchildren,

645
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,734
-- it's not from
-- IKEA.

646
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:09,775
That's funny because my parents actually we have some old

647
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:11,675
IKEA furniture up at the cabin that's done pretty well.

648
00:27:11,685 --> 00:27:12,954
It's like 2030 years old, but

649
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,474
it's that old IKEA stuff that's actually built out of real wood.

650
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:18,435
It's not like everything is value engineered now to be

651
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,989
like they got rid of metal parts where possible. They use plastic plugs.

652
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,670
Like my kids' beds are like 50% metal parts to hold the frame together

653
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:29,069
and then plastic plugs to hold like the slats and stuff together. Like it's,

654
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,000
it's comical. But yeah.

655
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,750
No, it's, I, and I think part of it is, it's also,

656
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,270
I think the infrastructure people have a bit of a duty here

657
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:40,449
to maybe expose the configuration information a

658
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,760
little bit more easily or consumable.

659
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,130
Maybe, I don't know, I got to think about that

660
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:48,089
but I, I feel like ignoring all of that.

661
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:52,180
-- If you are building a solution, the bar is continuously
-- going.

662
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:54,119
I think you're expected to provide a solution.

663
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,229
And the more solution it is like wordpress is now

664
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,260
-- the, the better.
-- Well, and let's face it.

665
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,859
I mean, the world of it is the curve is complete,

666
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:06,189
right where, where we filled in all the gaps with early adopters.

667
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,359
You've got the, the, I forget what they're all called.

668
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:10,770
But then there's the laggards at the end like

669
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,359
it's, it's just done.

670
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:12,839
And

671
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,250
I also, I know we don't have time, but this is,

672
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:19,280
it always, I get a chuckle when I hear people talk about digital transformation

673
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:23,550
because it's like at this point, if you're not doing all digital everything,

674
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:27,910
you're just going to go out of business. So why even bother having this discussion?

675
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,819
Yeah, I mean, it, it's,

676
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,760
well, it's like people that say the web is a fad. It's like

677
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:35,599
who

678
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,380
says that anymore? Nobody, nobody says that anymore.

679
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,849
-- That that hasn't been said in 20 years.
-- I bet,

680
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,810
I bet you I can anyways

681
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,810
if you find one, send it to me, I'll put it in the show notes.

682
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:48,719
Otherwise I'm calling this one.

683
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:50,319
We're

684
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,920
on the precipice of

685
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,459
turning it into a nut house. Anyway. Alright, I am.
