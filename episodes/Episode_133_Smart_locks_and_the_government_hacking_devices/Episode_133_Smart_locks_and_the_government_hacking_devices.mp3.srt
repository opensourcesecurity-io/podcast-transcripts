Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 133 with myself,

1
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,010
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,510
and my partner in Thought crime. Josh Bresser, man.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,870
It feels like the world is more on fire than usual right now,

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,709
which is pretty bad because it's generally pretty on fire.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,329
Yeah, I mean, it's,

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,790
there's even stuff that we won't talk about because of the political side of it now.

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,409
Right? Like the world, the world burns all of it.

8
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:31,819
It's pretty much getting nonstop radio on the news radio here.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,240
Although our news radio is CBC,

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,590
-- which is quite boring and respectable
-- versus it should be boring and respectable.

11
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:40,819
I don't want exciting news radio because that means either something

12
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:42,915
terrible is happening or more likely

13
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:45,875
it's just a bunch of annoying idiots yelling at each other.

14
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,884
Speaking of annoying idiots yelling at each other.

15
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,424
Welcome to the podcast, everybody.

16
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:51,735
Yeah.

17
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:52,034
Well,

18
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:54,415
so it's interesting because we were going to start this

19
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:58,665
one with that whole piece about the Japanese government scanning.

20
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,365
I don't know what word to use exactly their network

21
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:03,145
networks within Japan

22
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:06,260
IP blocks registered to Japanese companies

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,400
or not so much Japanese companies, but Japanese network providers.

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,040
And it's not like they were, you know, using zero days.

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,110
They, they literally were going to take a list of known

26
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:19,000
default passwords for devices and, you know,

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,430
see if they were, had been changed or not

28
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,180
and then something came up on Twitter, which I found quite horrifying.

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,419
I'm going to leave her name out of it,

30
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:30,300
-- but it's not hard to find,
-- everyone knows who Leslie Carr

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,040
-- is. Hacks for pancakes. You don't need to leave her name out of it.
-- Ok. Well,

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,129
so,

33
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:38,779
and apparently this is happening to a lot of people, not just her,

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,349
but I guess she's the first one to kind of really not be ok with it.

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,360
So the premise is basically she lives, it sounds like in an apartment building

36
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,050
and when you live in an apartment building,

37
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,239
you don't

38
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:51,800
have as much control over the building and stuff in general as maybe you'd like.

39
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:52,779
You know, for example,

40
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,279
I know a lot of us apartment buildings will

41
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,500
sign an exclusivity agreement with a network provider,

42
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,739
like say Comcast or Verizon.

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,139
-- And that's your only choice as
-- opposed to me living in a house where I have

44
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,010
one choice. Yeah, in my neighborhood.

45
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,569
Yeah. So basically it sounds like this com

46
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,460
this, the company that owns the apartment building

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,929
is essentially changing all the locks

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,729
which, ok, that's

49
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,110
kind of abnormal because that costs quite a bit of money,

50
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:23,250
but they're going with smart locks. What's interesting to me.

51
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,210
Well, there's two sort of main aspects of this.

52
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:28,160
Number one, normally when you replace a mechanical lock,

53
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,729
then you give the person a key and that's it.

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,850
There's no sort of additional cost to them or ongoing

55
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:37,660
maintenance or ongoing fees to keep that mechanical lock working.

56
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,020
And that's not the case with smart locks with a smart lock,

57
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,229
it needs to be able to talk to the internet.

58
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,740
Right.

59
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,339
And number two is the the safety and security aspect of it.

60
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,009
I've been looking into smart locks from my house

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,539
and to be blunt,

62
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,550
I have not found one that will reliably unlock and let

63
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:58,809
me in every single lock I've researched has had incidents,

64
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,300
shall we say where for example, glitch in Yale, smart lock security, uh

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,470
Yale smart security system sees Brits locked out of homes.

66
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,259
Now, I live in a house.

67
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,860
So I have a front door and a back door and,

68
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,710
and part of my plan was I was going to put a smart lock

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,220
on the front door and leave the mechanical lock on the back door so that

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,119
if I come home and the smart lock is not working or the internet's out or whatever,

71
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,169
I can go to the back door, use the mechanical key to get in.

72
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,399
And that's wonderful if you live in a house with two doors.

73
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,250
But typically when you live in an apartment,

74
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm not really aware of any apartments that I've ever seen with two doors,

75
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,880
you know, to

76
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,229
both doors to the same hallway.

77
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,410
So

78
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,679
the second thing here is, you know, is this lock actually safe?

79
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,050
Is it reliable enough?

80
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:42,649
-- All right,
-- I'm gonna interrupt you for a minute because you,

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,809
if you already have a key for your backup back door,

82
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,089
like why even have the freaking smart lock,

83
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,369
then isn't the whole point to not have any keys?

84
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,210
-- For
-- example, I could allow my cleaner in

85
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,220
when I'm not at home.

86
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,199
That's fair. Ok. I mean, that, that's a good reason. Right.

87
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,759
I could allow my cleaner in or my kids could use their phone

88
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,699
instead of a key point being is the mechanical locks I've had,

89
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,300
I've only ever had a mechanical lock once, fail to let me in my house.

90
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:05,649
And that was because somebody tried to open it with

91
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,869
a screwdriver and just beat the bejesus out of it.

92
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,160
Right.

93
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,440
You know, like it was pretty clear when I looked at the key way.

94
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,520
It's like, oh, it's all mangled and there's scratch marks and it's,

95
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,149
it's kind of bigger now.

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,690
It's about the size of a screwdriver.

97
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,858
Whereas with these smart locks, you Google it, they're,

98
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:22,108
they're terrible and that's assuming that the apps even work.

99
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:22,220
Right.

100
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,119
You go in the app store and look at the reviews of these apps and, and their garbage.

101
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,709
Um, we stayed at an airbnb

102
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,850
and it was an ordeal to get this smart lock to, you know, we had to, like,

103
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:34,679
we had to download an app, we had to get it registered.

104
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,279
We have to get the key,

105
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,519
the key to work.

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,190
And it,

107
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,890
there were times where it would take us upwards of five minutes

108
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,350
after we left the apartment to get the door to lock,

109
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,750
it just did not want to lock.

110
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,329
They didn't have just like a lock thing. You could twist on the outside to lock it.

111
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:47,619
-- No,
-- the

112
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,500
-- whole
-- point was just a smart lock.

113
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,880
I mean, that, that's just dumb.

114
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,809
Well, a lot of these smart locks were not well made or designed.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,549
They're, they're dumb, they're all dumb.

116
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,799
And I'm just gonna say that we, we're at a point where the,

117
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:02,149
the people making these things clearly don't know what the heck they're doing.

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,089
-- And it's very
-- sad but they don't need to because people keep buying them.

119
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,859
-- I, I guess
-- I, like, look at the lock picking lawyer that, that biometric,

120
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,119
uh smart lock. Where, what was it? If you unscrewed it, you could just open it

121
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,160
like the lock itself wasn't really physically secure.

122
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,309
-- Uh
-- It had, you had to take off one screw on, I think it was on the back and then

123
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,179
you basically had unfettered access.

124
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,540
It was supposed to be a padlock that unlocked with the fingerprint and it sucked.

125
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:28,959
And the company's response is, oh, well,

126
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,619
bad guys typically don't have screwdrivers.

127
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,470
-- Like what? No,
-- what they, they all have screwdrivers.

128
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,769
I don't know, I, I guess here's my take on this. Right.

129
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,359
And, and I'll make it short and sweet.

130
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,040
We have automatic locks on automobiles. We have for a long time.

131
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:46,059
They also have manual locks on automobiles and they have pretty much,

132
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,720
I think since day one because not having one is dumb.

133
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,160
Right.

134
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,200
Carmakers know this,

135
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,179
I have a suspicion that the carmakers are also

136
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,079
somewhat controlled by the Department of Transportation or somebody

137
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:59,880
because they can't sneeze without having to fill up paperwork and,

138
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,880
and that's a good thing, right?

139
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,559
I have no problem with that. I,

140
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:06,859
I don't think the home lock market

141
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,320
is controlled by anyone really.

142
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:12,250
I imagine there are insurance companies that will say,

143
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,679
what kind of locks do you have?

144
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,220
And if you say I have a lock made by Hasbro, the toy company,

145
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:19,679
they will say you're gonna have to fix that.

146
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,290
But I mean, fundamentally, yeah,

147
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,640
these things suck and you know how you're going to get them fixed is

148
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,269
the insurance company just need to show up and say like this lock sucks,

149
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,440
get it off your door now.

150
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,839
And because I, I don't see another way and these lock companies, like you said,

151
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,010
if people are buying them, they're gonna make them right.

152
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,440
We're basically building

153
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:35,695
out a very

154
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,915
sickly ecosystem of internet of things, devices. You know,

155
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:43,744
these devices. This is and assuming for a moment these devices will even get

156
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,304
software updates, which a lot of them won't.

157
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:50,005
And even the, you know, quote unquote air quotes, good ones from, you know,

158
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:54,424
large American brands like Yale Lock or Quick Set or

159
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:55,024
Mode

160
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:56,265
o or whatever. Right.

161
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:58,204
You know, these are not tech companies, uh,

162
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:01,625
you and I both know and a lot of people listening to our show will know,

163
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:05,079
maintaining a piece of software and shipping updates to it is difficult

164
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,410
and making sure you don't break somebody's front door lock

165
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:12,239
is hard and, and that has happened where, you know, software updates have bricked

166
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,540
a percent or two of the smart lock population for a given vendor.

167
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:18,959
-- Every
-- software update is going to

168
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:23,279
deactivate some low percentage of devices just because there's,

169
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,880
there's a million reasons why.

170
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,480
And I'm going to point you at De

171
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,890
Bold as the poster child for companies struggling

172
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,959
to switch kind of what they're doing now,

173
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,910
for those of you, I know de

174
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,290
bold anyone in, in security, like you say the word

175
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,679
Deol and they, they start frothing at the mouth and go into a rage and that's ok.

176
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,320
But like so historically speaking at

177
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:44,660
my bank,

178
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:48,670
the the lock of the the safe safe deposit box I have

179
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:49,549
is made by De

180
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:53,459
Bold, right? Like they make most of them and they do a nice job. It's a very nice box.

181
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,529
The ATM outside is probably made by De

182
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,220
Bold. Again, they do a nice job

183
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,040
and

184
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:01,630
I have a feeling the company just thought voting

185
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,119
machines that can't be any harder than an ATM

186
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,869
guess what guys it is.

187
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:10,250
And, and I imagine these lock makers are the same deal like locks.

188
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,239
We know how to make locks.

189
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,399
We'll just like, put a raspberry pie inside of it and, and plug it in or whatever.

190
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,559
I don't know. Just make it work.

191
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,279
Yeah. And it's like, yeah, those are two really different skill sets.

192
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:19,899
Well, I mean,

193
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,959
your car lock analogy was a great example

194
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,540
because most of them use various radio technologies

195
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,940
that are actually quite trivial to intercept and

196
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,119
hack with about 60 bucks worth of electronics.

197
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,479
-- Uh,
-- yeah. And it's just having SDRS were hard to get before

198
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:32,799
and,

199
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,320
-- and I know some of them have gotten a little better
-- software to

200
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,349
find radios for those of you that don't know what an SDR is.

201
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:38,909
That's true.

202
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,469
-- That's true. I, I just assume everyone
-- does. I had to think about it for a moment.

203
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,179
-- Yeah.
-- They're like 20 bucks go get one they're fun to play with.

204
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,179
Yeah. So

205
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,150
this, this

206
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:48,780
Japanese government,

207
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:52,469
uh project which apparently starts in a month or two so, quite soon

208
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,510
where they're going to, at least,

209
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,789
I mean, at a minimum if you have devices on the internet. Yeah.

210
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,679
Change the default password that allows you to control them.

211
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,479
That, that's a minimal start

212
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,750
except the people who need to hear that message

213
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,859
are not going to listen to this podcast.

214
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,140
But

215
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,890
then my second thought was Ok.

216
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,200
So they scan the, they scan the Japanese portion of the internet,

217
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:17,510
they find all these devices that are, you know, insecure that.

218
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,750
What, what's step two? Right.

219
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,609
We've talked about this before with the law of large numbers.

220
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:22,289
Like, do you hunt them all down and tell them

221
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,299
to fix it?

222
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,549
Do you, do you block their network access?

223
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,109
So, from what I've read,

224
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:30,590
they're going to try to contact the device owners.

225
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,299
Now, I don't exactly know what that means and

226
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,380
I haven't actually found and I don't read Japanese.

227
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,150
So everything I'm reading is either come through Google translate,

228
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,510
which I'm sure is doing a bang up job

229
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,950
or I'm reading American

230
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,710
authors that have written news stories which again,

231
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,280
probably got their info from Google translate.

232
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:49,979
And so

233
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,780
I have a suspicion, there's a lot of things we don't understand.

234
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,280
But from everything I've read,

235
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,950
there seems to be a consistent message of humans are

236
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,750
going to look at this stuff which obviously humans don't scale

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,719
and then they're going to try to contact the owners of

238
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:05,270
the devices and the devices could be owned by people,

239
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,469
they could be owned by corporations, it could be owned by I SPS.

240
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,359
Like, it doesn't matter who owns it,

241
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,039
they're going to try to get a hold of them. And then

242
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:16,130
I don't know what step two is because it's like high,

243
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,369
high old person who can barely use the phone,

244
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,609
you have to change the password on your router.

245
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:22,460
Good luck.

246
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:25,109
And this isn't a social engineering attack.

247
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,330
Right. Exactly.

248
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:28,609
That's right.

249
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:32,169
And, uh, if you could send me some itunes gift cards, that would be great.

250
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:35,950
Yeah, because we've been through this before with old D MC, a takedown thing where,

251
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,250
you know, record companies and whatnot would

252
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,229
contact the I SPS and the IP S would send

253
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,369
nasty letters to people based on their IP address.

254
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:42,599
And

255
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,419
that

256
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,119
works except for all the cases where it didn't work where the

257
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,669
wrong IP was attached to the wrong person or the person's like,

258
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,099
oh, I have an open wi fi point.

259
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:51,809
Sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.

260
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:56,599
Uh, I don't know what the deal in Japan is with, for example, open Wi Fi access points.

261
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,229
Hopefully it's not that bad anywhere in the world now. But,

262
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,950
yeah, fundamentally

263
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,140
given an IP address, tell me who I need to talk to,

264
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,489
to get the thing that's doing that fixed.

265
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:11,309
-- Yeah, that's a nontrivial problem.
-- Well, ok, let's ignore that problem. Right.

266
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,380
Let's back it all the way up to the beginning.

267
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:17,700
Is it ethical to essentially hack into someone's stuff? Because let's face,

268
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:20,125
even if it didn't change a password, it's still,

269
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:23,424
well, are they hacking it or they just, they're testing the password?

270
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,775
They're not necessarily changing anything. A court.

271
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,815
Well, at least from the US perspective,

272
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:31,434
if I log into your device with default credentials, I'm hacking it.

273
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:32,974
Right. And I have a suspicion.

274
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,734
Nearly every legal jurisdiction on the planet agrees with that.

275
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:40,440
So, fundamentally they're hacking. Is it ethical to do what they're doing?

276
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,479
Two arguments? I would have number one and I hate to use this argument.

277
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:46,440
It's kind of the, what about is argument is, well, effectively,

278
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,000
the bad guys are already doing this.

279
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,640
If the good guys do this, then potentially, maybe some good can come of it

280
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,549
and we can make the situation better.

281
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,049
-- And now we're at the ends justify the means philosophical argument.
-- Exactly.

282
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,919
And, and that's a, that's a, that's a very slippery slope.

283
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:06,539
It's not a slippery slip dude. It's like a drop off the face he had,

284
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,530
yeah,

285
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,020
I remember um,

286
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,429
the, the University of Washington guy that used to deal with the

287
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,619
of service attacks a lot. I apologize for not remembering your name.

288
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,559
But

289
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,820
people were asking him like, oh, these machines that are just spamming all packets,

290
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,380
why not just turn off the network access?

291
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,940
And he's like, because it might be an MRI scanning a patient.

292
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,849
It was a teaching hospital in a university and whatnot.

293
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:29,419
You know, we just can't turn off internet to that thing and maybe kill somebody

294
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,539
that would be bad.

295
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,200
Tm. Right. Yeah. Exactly.

296
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,510
So, I, I don't know, I mean,

297
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:40,469
the reality is, this is such a low level of hacking.

298
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,799
I mean, this is literally reading the manual,

299
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:46,489
like I've literally had to do this where I've reset a

300
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,450
network device like my PF sense firewall back when I had it

301
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,880
and I reset it and then I was like, what is the login? I have no idea.

302
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,190
So I had to like Google,

303
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,809
you know, PF sense default password. And I'm like, oh, it's, it's admin PF sense. Ok.

304
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,090
That makes sense. Type that in, I'm in, ok, reset it. Great.

305
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,510
I'm just, I'm not sure much good will come of this. That's kind of,

306
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,440
that's the second part of the argument, right?

307
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,640
Is in theory some good can come of this, but I'm not

308
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,820
sure any good will come of this. And

309
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,099
-- mostly because of scale,
-- I

310
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:15,260
-- think
-- good will come of it.

311
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,299
And the reason I think that though is convoluted and bizarre.

312
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,500
So

313
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:23,169
I would, I would compare this to

314
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,159
Leslie's Locke story in

315
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:33,359
regards of both of those are early adopter situations where the the people

316
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,630
implementing these smart locks are early adopters

317
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,809
and what they're getting is garbage.

318
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,700
And unfortunately,

319
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,650
a nontrivial number of people deploying them don't realize their garbage.

320
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,260
Well, no,

321
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,799
I think a lot of them do realize their

322
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:45,150
garbage and they don't care because for example,

323
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,030
the apartment company,

324
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,109
honestly, I've lived in apartments, run by big apartment companies.

325
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:52,450
They don't really care about their renters beyond getting the check on time.

326
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,890
That that could be too.

327
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,729
I mean, I, I don't know the answer to that but,

328
00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:00,109
but let's assume that let's assume that the apartment company knows it's garbage.

329
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,369
Right? Does, it doesn't change the story. Now,

330
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,609
we look at the Japanese government,

331
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,859
what they're doing is going to suck. It isn't going to work.

332
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:10,710
But

333
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:14,020
what they're, they're going to gain knowledge they need

334
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,979
for,

335
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,140
we'll say acceptable change in the future.

336
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,909
One of the things we fail to understand in security a lot of times is

337
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,179
the, the pioneers get the arrows

338
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:28,270
and I don't mean that figuratively that's like,

339
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,429
quite literal is the first people to do things.

340
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,020
They usually have a bad time,

341
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,979
but they're the ones that are paving the way for the rest of us.

342
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:40,539
And now I'm not going to use that as a justification for say,

343
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,255
putting smart locks in someone's apartment because I, I don't like that.

344
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,575
And like, I know if you read,

345
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:47,955
we'll link to Leslie's Twitter feed,

346
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:50,515
but basically she's moving and I don't blame her either because

347
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,375
it's like I would not want to live like that.

348
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:56,304
This is one of the reasons I won't live in an apartment or even a condo anymore is

349
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:59,775
II, I want to have a certain level of control over my living space.

350
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:03,974
For example, the locks, the security of the building.

351
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,934
I don't know, man, I'm sick of fixing things.

352
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,450
Apartment sound pretty good to me right now.

353
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,729
That's because you moved into like a money whole house.

354
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,820
-- Money pit.
-- We call that

355
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:12,960
money

356
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,309
pit. And

357
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,929
I think calling this a money pit is doing a disservice to money pits.

358
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,880
But yes,

359
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:23,330
anyway, anyway, right from my perspective, like,

360
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,830
yeah, whatever. Give me, give me smart locks, you know, leave the windows open.

361
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,919
I don't care, just as long as I'm not paying for things.

362
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,289
Yeah.

363
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:32,080
-- But
-- she's moving because real and, but the problem is, I mean,

364
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,940
straight up unless she buys a house, this is a risk and II,

365
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,719
I suspect this will become more and more common.

366
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:41,700
Probably so.

367
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,080
Yeah, it's a, it's an ugly problem and an ugly situation.

368
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:46,239
Uh, right.

369
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,539
So anyway, let's focus on, on the Japanese story because I think that's depressing.

370
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,229
So,

371
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,270
so we can say that there,

372
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,400
it's ethically questionable to be doing what they're doing right

373
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,390
now. The second part of it that I, I latched on to when I read it is

374
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,830
there, there seemed to be a stress on humans doing it

375
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,109
and I don't know if that's just a weird translation problem or if that is

376
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:12,229
one of the things they're focusing on because I can see that in two ways.

377
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,549
Right. There's a number one,

378
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,340
you could say humans are doing it. We're not automating it.

379
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:19,539
So we hopefully won't crash anything because obviously if you just like,

380
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:22,599
set some bots for doing this, it's gonna be crazy town.

381
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:22,919
Right?

382
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,590
Because obviously a bot can scan the whole I PV four space in what,

383
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,590
like an hour or something now.

384
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:31,179
-- It's
-- crazy. It's about 15 minutes now.

385
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,080
Right. That's

386
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,940
exactly actually funny story.

387
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,150
I'll tell you is I was recently talking to someone about showdown

388
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:38,960
and explaining what it does.

389
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:42,219
And they said, well, how, how long does it take him to scan all of the internet?

390
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:46,799
I said a couple hours probably they're like, what? Like they couldn't fathom.

391
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:49,409
Well, and, and the thing to remember is they do it a coup.

392
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,280
Like, I think they do it weekly or more.

393
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,549
-- I bet
-- it's kind,

394
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:52,965
it,

395
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:53,085
it

396
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:55,094
is. Well, no, the date is up to date.

397
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:58,765
Like II, I used to buy access to it just for, to see what was out there.

398
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,145
And it was, it was quite shocking.

399
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:02,755
-- Right.
-- Right. So, so anyway, anyway, uh

400
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:07,614
Japanese scanning the internet, humans are doing it. Humans don't scale

401
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:08,685
and

402
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,483
my suspicion

403
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:14,005
is what they're going to do with this is they're going to let people do it,

404
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:15,645
they're going to collect a whole bunch of data

405
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,473
and then they can make some,

406
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,964
we'll say informed decisions about what to do next.

407
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,550
And I think this will tie into the ethical argument at the beginning of

408
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,618
maybe it would be ok to say

409
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,760
this group who is sanctioned by the Japanese government

410
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,160
has permission to look for these kind of devices.

411
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,250
But then what's next?

412
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,329
Because obviously, ok, so you tell people to take them off the internet,

413
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:43,650
I bet less than 10% are going to be

414
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,890
taken off the internet or have the passwords changed.

415
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,569
And I think that might be a high estimate.

416
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,430
So in a couple of years are, you're going to say if we find your device,

417
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,680
we're just gonna shut you off.

418
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:54,359
Right.

419
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:57,369
Well, what does that mean? Right.

420
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,699
What happens when it's, like you said, if it's hooked up to, you know,

421
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:04,890
somebody's smart lock, they need to get into their house and it's, I don't know,

422
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,380
-- cold outside or whatever,
-- or even more simply an IP address typically at home now

423
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:11,770
is matted.

424
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,369
Right.

425
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:16,250
You know, when I think about how many network connected devices are in my house now,

426
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,050
it's about 40 or 50.

427
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,410
And, you know, I only have one IP address

428
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,170
actually, that's not true. I think my I PV six is actually real. I PV six.

429
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,209
I have to check into that.

430
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:26,079
I don't think it's an adding,

431
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:30,050
I think it's actually proper IP S but regardless you start shutting stuff down,

432
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,500
you're not just shutting down the IP of one device.

433
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,489
You're probably going to be shutting down the IP of a house or an entire building.

434
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:40,750
Right. So I just pulled up my uh I have, I have a Google Wifi

435
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:45,449
and it says it sees 19 devices on my network at this

436
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,410
moment and I know it should be much higher than that.

437
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,930
So a bunch must have turned themselves off, which is, which is fine.

438
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,550
-- Uh
-- Oh, mine says zero devices. Oh, it's

439
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:54,810
quite,

440
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:58,760
-- you might want to fix that.
-- 0, 26. Here we go. 96.

441
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:01,969
See, that's what gets me is if we could actually properly

442
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,699
determine this IP address who to talk to, to get it fixed. Sure

443
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,550
that, you know, do that easily.

444
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,219
Maybe what action do we take that is both safe and effective.

445
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:15,699
And I can't think of any action that is safe and effective.

446
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:20,469
That doesn't suffer from some like 10% chance of really doing a lot of damage,

447
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:24,140
like just turning off network access or, but I think having data might be good

448
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:25,729
in the sense of then maybe, you know,

449
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:29,900
-- which manufacturers to go after and you say look, you have, I,
-- I think data is key.

450
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,939
Like that's just, even though I don't think this is going to make any

451
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,500
real difference in any way, I think they're going to learn a lot from it,

452
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,260
which is why I totally approve of this

453
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,219
even though there are moral and ethical and all kinds of other questions here.

454
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,109
-- I, I think it's a good idea. Well,
-- so, I mean, we have similar things here in winter

455
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,530
where you're not allowed to leave your car running with the keys in it.

456
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,640
I think there's actually specific laws against that in

457
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,430
most jurisdictions because it's kind of dangerous because,

458
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:59,689
you know, it's really easy to steal a car that's running and unlocked,

459
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,020
right?

460
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,199
And so the cops will occasionally go around

461
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:05,930
ticketing people for doing this and what they'll

462
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,920
also do sometimes is just try to open your car door and if it's unlocked,

463
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,819
they'll kind of leave you a warning note like this

464
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:13,359
is for cars that are not running but just unlocked.

465
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:13,800
Right?

466
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:16,800
And they'll leave you kind of not a ticket, but like a warning note saying, you know,

467
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,010
we find your cars unlocked.

468
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,150
You, please lock your car because

469
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,589
people keep complaining to us about their cars being broken into.

470
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,959
Well, now here's my question for you

471
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,880
and I'm going to, this is a, a huge leaking of sensitive information on my part.

472
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:32,589
But

473
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:37,079
in the winter, I don't lock my truck door because the locks freeze.

474
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,010
So

475
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,439
yeah, for real, like, like they freeze constantly there for whatever reason.

476
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,839
Like when Ford built this truck, now, mind you as well.

477
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,920
I don't drive it very often because I work from

478
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,699
home and I feel like selling it would be a disservice

479
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:52,290
to the environment because somebody who owns it might drive it

480
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,969
and the thing like consumes gas at an alarming rate.

481
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,430
But anyway, anyway,

482
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,719
I don't lock it because like literally the lock is frozen

483
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:03,589
shut for nearly all of the winter and it doesn't work.

484
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,270
And,

485
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,349
and so like this is an instance where the police would give me a note and I'd be like,

486
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,880
I'm not locking my door.

487
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,709
Like when I lock my door, I can't get in the last time I got locked out. I had to, like,

488
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,099
I went and got a hair dryer to melt the front

489
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,000
lock. Like

490
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,030
-- I don't, I don't
-- care. They actually make these special electric heater things.

491
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,550
It looks like a key and it's got like an electric wire running through it.

492
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,469
So it gets hot. So you stick it in the key lock in the lock and it warms the lock up.

493
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:27,199
They're battery powered.

494
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:30,989
-- You might want to get one of those
-- or I could just not lock my door, which is way easier.

495
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,109
Well, so the reality is there will always be some corner cases.

496
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,660
For example, if everybody that can reasonably lock their doors does. So

497
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,089
then, well, it's not gonna help crime.

498
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,430
I mean, recently in my neighborhood we had a couple of car break ins

499
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,010
and they actually broke into my neighbor's car and tried,

500
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,829
like they broke the window and tried to hotwire and luckily they couldn't.

501
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:53,449
But, you know, if they left the car door open,

502
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,839
maybe they would have had a bit more time and been felt a

503
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,900
bit more safe and they would have spent more time hot wiring it.

504
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,239
Right.

505
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,400
That's actually a joke I have too with my kids is I don't lock my doors,

506
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,969
so no one will break my window trying to steal the nothing I keep inside of the car.

507
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,069
No, I think we definitely need more data and I think

508
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,339
at some point

509
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:15,260
I'm hoping we'll see regulations that say things like for

510
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,910
this device to go on the network and fully activate.

511
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,380
It needs to be securely set up.

512
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:19,819
So I've had,

513
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:23,170
I've seen a number of devices now where you basically turn them on and

514
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,229
they have very minimal limited functionality and until you actually log in and,

515
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,030
and configure them securely,

516
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:32,390
they, they don't do whatever it is they're supposed to be doing. Right.

517
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,609
So until, for example, you set a secure password,

518
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,109
the device, like, for example, it's a light bulb, like it won't turn

519
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,310
on and off until you set a password on it securely

520
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,829
or you register it or whatever, you know.

521
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:45,569
And I think things like that

522
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:46,989
are the solution because

523
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,989
you make these things be secure by default and only

524
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,069
work if they're securely deployed and that solves the problem,

525
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:54,229
right?

526
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,189
Because if we're relying on everybody buying these

527
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,010
things to take some action to secure them

528
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:00,180
that will fail a certain percentage of the time

529
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:01,380
and by a certain percentage of the time,

530
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,819
I'm guessing somewhere between 20

531
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:06,130
-- 80%
-- I bet 8080 or more

532
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,109
was the number I had in my brain.

533
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,790
-- Yeah,
-- it's, I, I wouldn't be uncomfortable with that either.

534
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:12,780
Uh Let's go with between 20

535
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:13,959
95%

536
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,530
-- right? Because humans are bad at technology
-- and more the

537
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,650
point how do, how do I securely deploy this stuff too? Is that in the manual?

538
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,439
-- Probably
-- not.

539
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:21,739
No, you,

540
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,369
you can't expect people to do anything because even the smart people screw it up.

541
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:31,410
And so expecting normal people to get it right. Even 20% of the time. It's probably

542
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:31,589
in

543
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,770
acceptably high bar.

544
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,709
Well, and a software update might mess something up in reset settings.

545
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,650
We've had, you know, remember for example, II, I

546
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:40,449
had, hey Siri disabled on my phone. Remember that one time?

547
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:42,530
And then I said, hey Siri and my friend was like, yeah, what do you want?

548
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,369
I'm like, I what, you know, and I found out software updates, disable that.

549
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,209
-- So it's
-- really weird and it's annoying me to no end is on my android phone.

550
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:52,400
It keeps disabling like the hey Google

551
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,689
and like, oh crap, my phone just did stuff. Um

552
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:57,449
No way.

553
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:57,900
Oh,

554
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:58,770
that's good.

555
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,060
I I've been meaning to record that myself saying it to

556
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,390
see like if I could unlock my phone doing it.

557
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,369
So I'm gonna actually process the podcast,

558
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,859
put it up and then suck the audio out and see.

559
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,839
Uh my phone does not unlock when I say the

560
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:13,560
words.

561
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,699
But if, if it's unlocked and obviously like, if I'm driving the car,

562
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,530
I need to send a text message to my wife.

563
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,020
Like it's a lifesaver there because I'm, I'm like crazy anti texting in the car.

564
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,520
I yell at people if they're driving, I'm like, no, like I will drive,

565
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,900
get out of the freaking driver's seat or put your stupid phone down

566
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,569
-- because I,
-- yeah,

567
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,680
but it's pretty crazy dangerous. It's like half of all collisions. Now.

568
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,449
-- It
-- not only that man you, like,

569
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,410
you look at people and they're just staring at their phone.

570
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,300
It's like there's a red effing light, like, come on

571
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,540
-- and they have no idea. It's, uh, it's terrifying. I hate
-- that.

572
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,339
Wait, aren't you supposed to be stopped at a red light?

573
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:47,859
Now, if you're looking at your phone, it's fine then just keep going. No big deal.

574
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,089
Anyway. Anyway. Anyway.

575
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:51,170
So. Right. I,

576
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,670
I, like I said, I think

577
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,469
what the Japanese are doing

578
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,670
while I'm sure will be a disaster for multiple reasons.

579
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,520
It's actually going to be really funny when they break into like, uh, you know,

580
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,520
a Norwegian government server or something accidentally and

581
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,680
there's some sort of crazy diplomatic incident.

582
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:09,719
Oh, there's a good point. Right.

583
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:13,623
Because all the embassies would be in Japan on Japanese networks most likely.

584
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:15,782
-- And
-- even if they're not, man,

585
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:19,853
how many there's IP addresses that you think should be somewhere that aren't

586
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:23,373
-- right. Like, that's super common actually,
-- you know what Japan could,

587
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:25,812
in theory, Japan, they're an island nation.

588
00:25:25,822 --> 00:25:28,383
They could check the latency to the IP and say, for example,

589
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:30,133
we're only going to do IP S that are within

590
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,822
the latency of not going through the undersea cables,

591
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:38,836
just have to add latency to my network and then the Japanese government can't find it

592
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:41,336
exactly because they think it's offshore.

593
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:42,975
I'm just saying like there are ways to make it

594
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:45,475
reasonably safe and to make a good faith effort,

595
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:46,235
but more to the point.

596
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,316
If you have devices that are exposed to the internet and are this fragile,

597
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:52,946
-- they're gonna get popped at some point anyways
-- probably.

598
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,215
And that's,

599
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,336
well, yes and no,

600
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:59,630
I think they will and many of them maybe have.

601
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,719
How sad would you feel for me if I left my wallet out

602
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,560
on the street instead of bringing it into the office with me.

603
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:07,949
Like if I literally went to work every morning and put my wallet on

604
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,589
a park bench in front of the building and then came out at lunchtime,

605
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,239
picked up my wallet, went and bought lunch,

606
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,219
put it back on the bench, went up to my office.

607
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:18,510
And then when I went home, I went out, took my wallet off the bench.

608
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,229
That's not a reasonable comparison though because you know, better.

609
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,959
Well, how is putting a device on,

610
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:27,410
you know, the internet full of every state actor any different?

611
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,550
-- And most people don't know better. I guess I'm not saying it's
-- right.

612
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
It's, and to be clear, I'm not trying to blame the victim here.

613
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:34,089
I'm just saying realistically, like, for example,

614
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,750
even though I typically have the right of way

615
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,589
when I cross the street at the pedestrian crosswalk,

616
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,790
I still look both ways.

617
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,709
-- I hear
-- you, man. I don't know. Like I said, I think this is going to be a mess,

618
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,219
but I applaud them for doing it because I

619
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,810
think they're going to learn a lot of crazy things

620
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:52,969
and my hope is it just doesn't start like World War Three because they scan

621
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,060
the wrong country, something

622
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,170
and then, and then broke into it.

623
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,439
Uh,

624
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,869
so anyway, yeah, I, I don't know.

625
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,209
We'll see, I guess, and, and I guess on, in terms of smart locks, II, I have no doubt

626
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,170
there will be a time in the future

627
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:10,050
when smart locks are acceptably safe.

628
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:13,459
-- But it is not here yet. Cars
-- became acceptably safe.

629
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:16,650
-- I mean, it took Ralph Nader in the sixties and seventies.
-- It took

630
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:17,439
what,

631
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:21,290
100 years almost to make cars safe.

632
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:21,810
Yeah.

633
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,819
So we got what? 80 years to go everybody?

634
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,030
Woohoo.

635
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:30,229
Oh man, I, I think about that actually, that's something

636
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,630
I forget why we, oh no,

637
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,949
I was talking to my wife about Netflix and Amazon Prime and all those things and,

638
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,880
and actually, if you've never seen it, the show,

639
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,430
uh the Marvelous Mrs Maisel and on Prime video is fantastic.

640
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,349
I highly recommend it,

641
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,939
which is what we're watching and it's in like four K and it looks amazing and it,

642
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,180
it consumes an enormous amount of bandwidth.

643
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:53,020
My bandwidth graph is, is hilarious right now. But anyway, we're talking and like

644
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,910
you think 20 years ago,

645
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,310
if you would have told people about the

646
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,479
streaming services and all the things we have,

647
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,400
I'd have been like

648
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,400
no way, no way.

649
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:05,214
Oh, I remember what streaming video looked like 20 years ago. It was a postage stamp.

650
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:08,155
Yeah, right. It was like 100 by 100

651
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:11,194
it was super grainy and it was like one frame a second. Exactly.

652
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:15,655
And my hope though is that all of this iot garbage

653
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:17,255
the mess were in

654
00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:20,175
the unsecured devices, all of it

655
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,810
in 20 years. We look back and think those were leeches and bloodletting.

656
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:27,560
I think the, the problem though is, is with streaming services,

657
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:30,650
you have to keep people happy because they pay a monthly fee.

658
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:33,069
Nobody wants to pay a monthly fee with their

659
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,464
locks because the mental getting over the mental hurdle

660
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:40,405
of why do I have to pay $10 a month to unlock and lock my front door,

661
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:40,734
you know,

662
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:43,224
ring doorbell and all these nest cameras and stuff have

663
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:45,354
the same problem where I have a security camera.

664
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:46,785
Why do I have to pay a monthly fee?

665
00:28:46,795 --> 00:28:50,994
Oh, so you store the data for one year and make it easy? Ok. Well, maybe I'll do that but

666
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:54,935
no offense if you're going to sell me a door lock and you want a monthly fee out of me,

667
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,589
-- it's gonna take a lot of convincing. And
-- that is a perfectly reasonable

668
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,540
argument

669
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,050
and it is possible we never solve that and we just always have door locks.

670
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,829
I, I guess the, the comparison perhaps is

671
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:12,290
I love watching Star Trek when they have their crazy futuristic glasses they use

672
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:16,219
yet. Yeah. Pint glass is a pint glass man and it's been a pint glass for 100 years.

673
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:18,880
Right. And I, I have a suspicion in 100 more years.

674
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,280
We're still gonna be using pint glasses. You know why?

675
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,660
Because it works, they hold beer, right. Which is super important

676
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:26,339
anyway. Anyway.

677
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,869
All right, man, I'm going to call this one. I feel like

678
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,550
I, we've answered nothing.

679
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,469
We've, we've brought up a bunch of crazy, philosophical and strange arguments

680
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,109
and I guess that's ok because I think much

681
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,189
like my suspicion about the Japanese government just discussing

682
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,569
these things and thinking about them and revisiting the

683
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:47,709
topics on a regular basis is very important because

684
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:50,839
answers to questions like this are not simple.

685
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:55,910
It's kind of like you, you imagine in the days of your, when philosophers and,

686
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,119
and even scientists to a degree would just sit around and

687
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,079
talk about hard problems like that's how you solve hard problems.

688
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:03,359
You don't solve them by whining and complaining

689
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,719
on Twitter about how dumb everyone else is.

690
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,150
It's, it's all about like this is what's happening now.

691
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,790
Let's have a reasonable discussion about it.

692
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,839
Well, one thing just,

693
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,920
I think the thing is first we need to understand these hard problems and I

694
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,530
don't think we're even there yet with these things with a lot of these,

695
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,439
that Twitter thread.

696
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,430
-- I learned a lot from that Twitter thread. Right.
-- Yeah.

697
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:20,609
Go,

698
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,520
look at it but not only the other important

699
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,959
thing is there's tons of people that are like,

700
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:24,949
oh, this is no big deal.

701
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,280
Just do this. It's like it is a big deal. And what you're suggesting is dumb.

702
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,729
Like no read, what's happening and empathize you idiots. Right.

703
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:33,780
Don't solve the problem. You can't fix

704
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:37,114
now. Some of the suggestions for solutions just I'm like that, that absolutely

705
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:37,305
doesn't

706
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:37,594
address

707
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:42,135
profile at all. Seriously. Right. Like you're dumb. Go away anyway. Anyway. Right.

708
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:44,954
-- I'm dumb and we should go away. So. Right. I'm
-- calling it Invest in

709
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:45,895
Sunglasses.

710
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:46,405
Right.

711
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,045
That's right.

712
00:30:48,204 --> 00:30:51,165
