Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,750
Kurt Siefried and my partner in the New Year, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,420
It is, yeah, this will come out. Of course, it comes out in the New Year.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,649
-- Technically, every year is a new year.
-- I have a very amusing story to tell.

4
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:18,709
So a

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,680
listener

6
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:22,209
by the name of, of Michael, I think it's Michael.

7
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:25,430
If I'm mispronouncing your name, I apologize. Sends me an email

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,920
and it says in the last two episodes you published

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,709
there is

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:32,009
a, a high pitched wine in the audio.

11
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:34,580
-- I'm like, what
-- did you not see the wave form?

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,439
-- Like when you edited it wouldn't have shown up.
-- I don't look at the spectrum.

13
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,599
So I load up the

14
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:45,585
and I'm like, sure enough at 11,700 Hertz,

15
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:46,925
-- there's a line
-- dude,

16
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,285
my hearing is like,

17
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,995
exactly. And I'm like,

18
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,145
I'm too old to hear this.

19
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:53,335
And so

20
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:58,596
then I proceeded to tear my entire recording studio apart to figure out what this is.

21
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:01,476
And it was a new led light I had

22
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:02,992
and

23
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:05,461
I had no idea because I couldn't hear it.

24
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:08,821
I still have if anyone has heard the, the wine. I do apologize.

25
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:11,111
I have not fixed the, the MP threes yet,

26
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:13,622
-- but
-- couldn't you just set up the filter to

27
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:16,622
like everything above probably eight K or six K?

28
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:17,031
Just,

29
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:22,141
-- yes, I, yeah, I can. Yes, I can.
-- It would never occur to me to need to do that though.

30
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:25,262
Well, right. It hadn't before. It'll be done now.

31
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:28,662
And I'm gonna make sure I look at waveforms from this point forward as well

32
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,309
just to make sure, like

33
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,739
there's nothing weird in the, in the, because it never occurred to me. Like

34
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,900
there are things other people can hear. I can't.

35
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:39,569
So I bought a dog whistle and it's a really nice

36
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,860
dog whistle in that it's adjustable like you screw it.

37
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,970
So it gets shorter and longer. And so you can basically,

38
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,379
basically you can,

39
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:50,209
uh, at its lowest pitch, it totally audible and at its highest pitch, of course,

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,660
I assume a dog can hear it.

41
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:56,120
I don't know, I don't have a dog. But what's funny is there was like a good range where

42
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:58,410
I can't hear it. And my son Felix is like, please,

43
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:02,894
because I, I have some 6 to 8 K hearing loss in my left ear here and not in my right ear.

44
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:05,864
So I've, I've actually had my hearing professionally tested now twice because I,

45
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,474
I have some weird loss on the one side.

46
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:08,304
Sure. Sure.

47
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:08,735
Yeah.

48
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:09,544
So it's, it's,

49
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:14,205
I feel bad for those people that get older and still hear mosquito tones

50
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:16,764
because, like, that's a thing. No, that's a thing in, like, Britain.

51
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:19,095
A lot of countries now where they use these high

52
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:22,145
pitched tone generators to drive away younger people from,

53
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:22,865
like, stores and stuff.

54
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:27,089
-- So they don't loiter there.
-- I've heard of that. Which seems cruel to me.

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,330
Right.

56
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:30,039
And I'm just, like, that is such an antisocial, horrible thing to do.

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,449
-- Yeah, I agree.
-- Ignoring that. Like, and I, I don't even like teenagers

58
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,740
and I'm still, like, that's a terrible thing to do to them,

59
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,960
let alone to the older people that can still hear it.

60
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,940
So, anyway, it amused me.

61
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:43,009
There, there, there is no wine anymore because now the,

62
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,610
the nice light I bought unfortunately is in a bag on the floor next to me.

63
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,434
-- I'm
-- curious, what brand was it or what?

64
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:51,895
It was a Logitech, I think light. It was

65
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,044
not like, super expensive.

66
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:57,595
It wasn't cheap and it was kind of nice because it had a real nice, warm light.

67
00:02:57,604 --> 00:03:00,164
So it would have been like the transformer or something in it. Hey,

68
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:03,214
-- it's led. It probably has some, yeah,
-- they have transformers and B,

69
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:07,235
or basically the moral equivalent of a, of a voltage exchanger thing.

70
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:11,675
It's probably just a PWM signal that's driving an led is my guess.

71
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:14,690
And it only shows up when I turn the brightness down.

72
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:17,220
It's not present when I turn it all the way up.

73
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:21,050
-- Oh,
-- so probably something to do with voltage regulation or whatever as

74
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:21,630
well. Pw.

75
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,800
But anyway,

76
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,770
needless to say

77
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,210
that I spent in quite a bit of time figuring this one out.

78
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,630
You know, I was just thinking because, like, remember Linus Tech tips,

79
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,270
bought that Anechoic Chamber to sound test stuff.

80
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,850
Right. Because they wanted to test how loud are computer fans?

81
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,720
I didn't know they did that, but that's cool.

82
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:40,220
And it just occurs to me like, I wonder if they're also testing for, like,

83
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,470
high pitched or very low pitched noises that

84
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,580
could annoy animals or people with good hearing.

85
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,990
See, that's the beauty is I have terrible hearing. So, like, it doesn't bother me.

86
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,830
Right. Right. Exactly.

87
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,580
-- But anyway, so
-- speaking of old things. So

88
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,490
I was

89
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,199
-- thinking the other day, I didn't
-- even do that on purpose

90
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,550
the other day is there's been a lot of open source security

91
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,460
related software over the last

92
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,500
forever

93
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,839
and some of it has been hugely successful and we still use today.

94
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:12,179
Like SSH is a good example and, and to be clear, I want to talk about software,

95
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,380
I'm not gonna talk about standards very much.

96
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:17,660
Like, I'm not gonna talk about TLS or implementations of TLS. So it's not super,

97
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,925
I was looking at this and because there are things that are

98
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:25,175
-- like, here's a great example. Has Se Linux been successful or
-- not?

99
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:27,105
-- I don't want to say no, but I think it's no.
-- Yeah.

100
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:27,716
Right. And

101
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:30,415
so, and that's the other thing I was looking at some of these and it's like, they're,

102
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:34,936
they're ubiquitous, but at the same time, they're not popular or

103
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:37,936
well loved or well used.

104
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:39,876
And se link is a great example of like, yeah,

105
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:42,915
it's kind of on by default and like pretty much my interaction with

106
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:45,006
se links for the last 20 years has boiled down to like,

107
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:46,332
OK, I'm just gonna turn it off now.

108
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:47,802
So a thing works.

109
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,332
I actually used to

110
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:53,411
have like write Se Linux palsy to try and make stuff work and you know,

111
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:54,772
read Dan's blog and be like, oh,

112
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:57,212
that's how he got the printer working in firefox on blah, blah, blah.

113
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:58,062
Right.

114
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:58,872
Yeah.

115
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,092
So I was looking at because somebody else mentioned App Armor and I'm like, oh man,

116
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,032
App Armor, like I haven't heard that in forever and it's,

117
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,772
it's actually on by default again in a couple of Linux

118
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:07,441
distro.

119
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,462
Yeah, like a

120
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:08,701
bunch.

121
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:09,372
It.

122
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:13,231
Exactly. And I'm like, oh yeah, it's, it's installed there.

123
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,130
I kind of forgot about it.

124
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:17,730
So I, I think App Armor

125
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,010
and Se Linux

126
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:24,309
are a good example of a technology that started with one purpose,

127
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,290
but we're actually using a lot of that functionality somewhere else

128
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,899
because a lot of what makes like Se Linux and

129
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,089
App Armor work is what makes containers secure now,

130
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:34,619
right?

131
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,170
So a lot of this technology might start in one place,

132
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:41,404
-- but we actually still end up using it somewhere else or
-- there's

133
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,804
like a new or better way of doing it like containers because

134
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:45,945
a perfect example.

135
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,665
So storytime openshift version,

136
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:50,334
one from Red Hat started out as a bunch of bash shell script and

137
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:54,484
C groups and Se Linux stuff and I found a couple escapes from it because

138
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,415
well, that's how that's gonna work.

139
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:57,165
And of course,

140
00:05:57,174 --> 00:06:00,834
then they moved over to like darker style containers and then ultimately

141
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:01,125
Kernes

142
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:02,084
which

143
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:03,704
quite a bit more secure.

144
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,100
And

145
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,480
what's fascinating to me about this is that, for example,

146
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,559
we, computers used to be expensive. So we put everything on one server.

147
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,380
We had to, we,

148
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:15,959
we put the FTP and the email and

149
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,839
-- the web on one server because we could only afford one server.
-- OK.

150
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,299
So it's funny you say that too because I was talking to someone over the,

151
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:25,720
the Christmas time break

152
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,070
about this

153
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,140
because do you remember like that was the selling point of Linux

154
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,359
and UNIX is, you could run everything,

155
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,040
the web server and the mail server on one machine

156
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,899
and DNS and DH CPD and like straight up everything.

157
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,140
But if you ran Windows, you could only run one thing on a Windows computer.

158
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:43,850
It's

159
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:44,410
true.

160
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,940
-- I know people didn't but you know, you know what I mean?
-- No, no.

161
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,359
Like until Windows 2000 and Iis.

162
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:53,006
Yeah. No, that thing could not really be reliably made to do much.

163
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:57,647
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. Like Windows nt even 2000, I think. A lot of people didn't.

164
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:02,527
I have an M CS E in Windows, NT four so I actually can speak from authority on this topic

165
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,316
in that. Yes, you could get NT four to serve. But

166
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,506
part of it was

167
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:12,816
Windows just had so much overhead and compute hardware was not that powerful.

168
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,213
Ok. Anyway, anyway,

169
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:18,204
-- so
-- this is like, so in my mind it's, it's weird to me though. So

170
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,053
I think we would both agree on the facts.

171
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,514
Se Linux and App Armor are everywhere, but at the same time, they're not successful.

172
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,414
And I would say a large part of that is because

173
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:27,954
the real use case,

174
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:29,873
it turns out that we want is containers where

175
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,794
we have a single privileged level within the container.

176
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:34,433
So we have like a database in the container or a

177
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:37,121
web server in the container or the application in a container.

178
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,140
And then we have very well defined

179
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:41,230
communication between them over network sockets,

180
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,651
which are actually really easy to secure

181
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:45,411
and it's hard to do shenanigans,

182
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,540
you know, whereas if I have access to the file system, your database is running on,

183
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,821
there's a whole lot of weird shenanigans I can do to break into it.

184
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,580
Exactly. So, OK, so that, that's interesting. Now, here's another one.

185
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,140
Why did open SSH succeed

186
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,721
and open BS D

187
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:01,360
kind of didn't

188
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,821
I have a better example of that I think? And they may be related.

189
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,609
So most people don't know this

190
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:09,339
but open SSH wasn't the first SSH,

191
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:09,660
it was

192
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:10,070
not.

193
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:15,500
-- The first SSH was, what was it, ssh.com?
-- I think it was. No, no, it was SSH by Tattoo

194
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:16,570
-- Yon.
-- OK.

195
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,670
I wrote a lot of articles about this guy and this topic. So,

196
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:21,200
but, but

197
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,369
-- what there was, there was a
-- tattoo wrote SSH, he invented it like he

198
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,415
-- was it GP
-- L what was his original license? Did it have? I don't

199
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:29,876
even know.

200
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:30,716
it was a weird license.

201
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:32,075
And then he tried to take a commercial and

202
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:34,046
close source it and that's where open SSH would

203
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:37,236
open the VSD forked and took off and then they improved it

204
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,486
a bunch and made it more reliable and to put it bluntly,

205
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:41,296
it worked better and it was free

206
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:45,786
and ssh.com tried to sell some things and add some enterprise stuff

207
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,981
features. Granted this is like 20 years ago,

208
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:49,752
then they ended up being bought by Tech

209
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:50,122
Tia

210
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:52,892
and uh it just sort of, it still exists but it kind of fizzled out.

211
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,981
And as far as I can tell, they went after the mainframe market,

212
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,901
which kind of makes sense because mainframe people are just like they have

213
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:00,252
money and they just want stuff to work and somebody to yell at.

214
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,182
No, it's a market like,

215
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:03,831
hey, we both work for restaurant

216
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:06,021
that's market adjacent.

217
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:08,822
Ok. The original was freeware.

218
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:10,851
It was freeware. It was not open source.

219
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:14,221
Yes. Ok. That sounds more familiar to me. Now, my brain

220
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:15,320
my brain isn't

221
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,710
going

222
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,489
back 25

223
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,159
-- years. It's
-- a long time ago.

224
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:20,630
I remember, I remember when it came out

225
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,820
because I worked at an ISP and I was like, oh, this is awesome. You need to use this.

226
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,500
I wrote articles comparing the benefits of SSH versus SSL telnet

227
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,880
uh or just regular tal

228
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,440
net, which is what most people use.

229
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:34,789
I mean, then there was Curarize

230
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,320
tal

231
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:36,289
-- net. There were some
-- and

232
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:36,869
the best

233
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,289
thing is

234
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,150
you cur

235
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:38,640
tail

236
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,280
net secured your login, but you could still inject characters into the stream.

237
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,020
See this is the beauty of telnet because it wasn't encrypted.

238
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,119
You could, if you could spoof packets,

239
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:50,010
-- you could inject keystrokes.
-- Well, that's harder.

240
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,000
-- But you could at least eavesdrop on
-- a local land in the olden days when it was hubs.

241
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,830
-- It was
-- all hubs, injecting keystrokes was still hard because you had to hijack the T

242
00:09:59,205 --> 00:09:59,635
P

243
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:03,195
-- connection.
-- That's really easy in a hub situation because

244
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:05,185
you have all the traffic

245
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:10,476
you, you do. But there's still the isn't there? There's the weird prediction of the

246
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,765
sequencing number stuff. But the thing is you have all the data.

247
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,085
Yeah. OK. Anyway, whatever, I'm not arguing with you about this today.

248
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:20,366
Well, again, this is like so old that before the era of switches

249
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,166
-- it is,
-- it's my brain doesn't,

250
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:23,666
my brain can't remember how any of this

251
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:25,926
works anymore because I haven't done any of this

252
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:28,122
fire without rocks, even

253
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:29,892
without rocks

254
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:31,481
but ok, but here's,

255
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:34,291
I think what makes it interesting when we look at something like SSH,

256
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:38,642
like SSH, the protocol wildly successful. SSH,

257
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:39,961
the application,

258
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:44,021
I think SSH is probably a good example of something that if it wasn't open source,

259
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,242
it was destined to fail.

260
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:49,802
Right? Because the reality is like, what made SSH better than Telnet?

261
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:52,231
The killer app was the encryption, right?

262
00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:56,271
Well, and then very shortly when SSH had file transfers

263
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,020
because the thing to remember is file transfers used to be

264
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:01,169
a

265
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,229
-- nightmare
-- without SCP, you had to FT oh It was horrible.

266
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:08,400
-- I remember
-- this is why FTP actually has

267
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:13,150
you can connect to FTP server A and tell it to interact with FTP server B

268
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:13,619
and

269
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,500
-- move files between A and B without the client even
-- anyway.

270
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,840
OK, we're not talking about, we're not

271
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,989
talking about FTP is also dead, but here's, here's what I think, right?

272
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,090
And, and this is where I think SSH is a really good example is

273
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:26,049
if SSH

274
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,210
was proprietary and you had to pay for it and

275
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:32,049
the only true benefit at the time was encrypted communication.

276
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,880
I don't think anyone would have bought it.

277
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,359
I don't think today anyone would buy it because

278
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:39,369
I think security is one of those things that

279
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,679
it's a really hard sell to get people to pay just for security.

280
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,929
You need other features for people to actually pay you money

281
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:47,429
and even

282
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:47,719
more

283
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,619
so like there's the exact corner cases of,

284
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,460
there are a handful of people that would pay for it, but so few that,

285
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:53,710
that basically proves your point.

286
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:54,580
It's,

287
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,309
it's enough to maintain a small company, but that's it.

288
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,469
-- But
-- now I think Open BS D, which you mentioned at the very beginning of this section

289
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,070
is the same story, right? Like is Open BS D more secure than Linux.

290
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,429
I mean, it was back in the day. I don't know if it still is.

291
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,989
-- I couldn't tell
-- you it's more secure if you don't turn anything on

292
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,289
-- which it means it's useless.
-- Here's the point, right?

293
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,289
If, if the only difference is more security,

294
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,400
but some of the other features are hampered which they were

295
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:23,840
that no one's gonna buy that.

296
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:27,880
And then by, I just mean use in this context, but it's, it's the same story. Like

297
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,890
if your only benefit is security,

298
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:32,330
you've already lost.

299
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,789
You need other reasons for people to care about and use the thing.

300
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,349
I mean, Se Linux is kind of the same story, right? Se Linux by itself can't stand

301
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,030
but all of the benefits you get from, you know, things like containers.

302
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,450
Now, we've got a story.

303
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,049
Well, and the other thing to remember is

304
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,289
Se Linux came from the NSA specifically

305
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,270
that the dod had use cases of, we have a humvee with seven computers.

306
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,849
We would like to buy one slightly faster computer and

307
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:02,169
run seven workloads on it that don't touch each other.

308
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,304
-- That's Right. And, and
-- I'm sure they're still using in, in bizarre and amazing ways.

309
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:09,114
And that's great because, but again,

310
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,585
now they are a very special use case that will

311
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:15,705
pay garbage trucks full of money for their particular need.

312
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:18,784
Well, that actually leads to a really a good example of

313
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:23,075
-- why wasn't mod security more successful?
-- I think it was successful.

314
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:26,604
-- I just don't think we need it anymore.
-- Well, so, ok. So what is mod security?

315
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:27,544
Do you want to take that one?

316
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,809
It was a plug in for

317
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,229
a, I don't know if it ran other things other than Apache, but it ran on Apache.

318
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,099
It runs under engine

319
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,940
-- X as well now and a couple others.
-- Oh, it does run on engine

320
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,929
-- X. OK. And
-- IIS.

321
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,250
-- No,
-- seriously

322
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,080
like that's

323
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,119
-- it.
-- It's oh my goodness. That

324
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:47,049
is po that's poetry. You can't make that up. But

325
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,090
mod security was, it was a plug in that it would,

326
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,250
we'll say stop bad things from happening.

327
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,659
You could add rules to it to prevent like

328
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,169
cross like scripting type traffic from coming in.

329
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,030
It could look for common attacks, it could stop.

330
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,830
Well, actually it did a couple of things.

331
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,909
What's really fascinating is it could filter incoming data,

332
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,570
it could filter the

333
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,309
outgoing stuff from the web server to the application site.

334
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,950
It could filter based on logging,

335
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,109
it could filter based on then the input from the

336
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,950
application back to mod security to the web server.

337
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,469
And it could filter outgoing and modify it.

338
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:24,750
So for example, you could do things like, wow, we changed our contact email address

339
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,419
and you could like create a MOD.

340
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:29,815
That's very

341
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:30,155
clever.

342
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:31,405
And that's the thing is it could,

343
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:37,474
it could rewrite both incoming and outgoing data at multiple stages of the request.

344
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:38,085
That's fair.

345
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,934
It was really just a magic regular expression engine is

346
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:45,505
-- fundamentally was that
-- had hooks into about six spots,

347
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:45,794
right?

348
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:50,174
And I think the thing that made Mod security powerful wasn't even the plug in itself.

349
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:51,724
It's the fact that it came with some pre

350
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:55,505
canned rules that people could just basically turn on.

351
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,659
And I think now if you're using basically any cloud provider on the planet,

352
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,229
all of this stuff is just b

353
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:03,780
well, they've, they've,

354
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:06,640
they've built something that is morally equivalent to mod security

355
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,780
written in a much faster language with much more capabilities,

356
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,219
right? And they take care of

357
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,510
for you and they're watching for new attacks and all kinds of stuff like that.

358
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,070
And that's what's fascinating to me is so mod security itself is kind of like,

359
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,150
but it spawned

360
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,590
not just not really an industry I'm going to say,

361
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:25,330
but it spawned essentially a feature that is now

362
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,340
the standard.

363
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,239
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

364
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,989
I mean, I think MOD security I would,

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,619
I would say was incredibly successful at what it was, what it did.

366
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,679
Like MOD security itself is. I mean, it probably still exists.

367
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,020
-- I haven't run it in literally decades. It is.
-- It's still around.

368
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,250
Like I remember I tried pitching it at a red hat

369
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,979
so that we could basically,

370
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,760
if we had like a cross site scripting flaw in one of our web-based products,

371
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,020
we could just ship them on security rule

372
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,940
and have it fixed right away with very low risk because it's just a mod security role.

373
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,799
But, and here was my real reason.

374
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:01,500
I wanted to do it because of all the government customers and stuff

375
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,140
where it's like if you want us to make a change to software,

376
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,530
we have a change process.

377
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,390
If you want us to make a configuration change. Yeah, we can do that.

378
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,359
And so they would have been able to deploy

379
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,590
the configuration change immediately.

380
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:15,440
Whereas if it's a software, a security update,

381
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,219
there's like a whole process for that.

382
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,950
And I,

383
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,340
and I think this goes to your selling security.

384
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:23,580
I wasn't even able to sell that internally at Red Hat is a good idea.

385
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,619
No, I'm serious.

386
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:28,369
-- Like I failed.
-- You need other reasons like by itself, it's probably

387
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,820
-- not
-- worth

388
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:28,950
it.

389
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,000
It's not so much that I was trying to sell them on security,

390
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,119
but I was trying to sell them more on this, on this, on.

391
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:33,570
This

392
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,460
will make life a lot easier,

393
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:37,369
especially for these customers and regulated

394
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,159
industries where a configuration changes,

395
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:39,869
no problem

396
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:44,679
-- and a code changes. Well, that's new software. We have to test it.
-- I have a suspicion

397
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,349
that you did a bad job explaining it that way

398
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,570
and you probably focused too much on security.

399
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,080
-- I've known you for a long time and I
-- own that.

400
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,280
But at the same time, like,

401
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,200
man, it just,

402
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,669
it's something that well, I mean, Clouder

403
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:02,820
does it by default. That's nice of them. Like the log for J thing. Right. Where

404
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:05,920
Kloer is like, oh, we figured out log for Jay and so we blocked it globally

405
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:06,920
and

406
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,319
here's the other thing to remember. Kurt is

407
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,020
that was back in the day of security,

408
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,640
just stood around and said we'll be sorry someday to everybody

409
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,800
and they never were.

410
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:17,650
But

411
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,410
yeah,

412
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,920
-- it happens. Anyway, what else we got on this list? So,
-- ok, so second last one

413
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,589
and I'm going to lump these in all three together is gonna be snort and map and Satan.

414
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,079
Oh, Satan, that's a term I haven't heard.

415
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:33,170
See what's fascinating to me is not just

416
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,130
all three, Satan and mappin

417
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:38,010
smart all had kind of rough childhoods, let's say,

418
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,010
well, what are, what are these tools? What do they do? Right.

419
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:45,770
So, Satan is security analysis tool for networks.

420
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,329
Wow, I'm impressed. You remember that? I have no idea.

421
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:52,760
S being security is the only letter I remember. And

422
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,199
um, and you know, the guy got fired from.

423
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,079
So because

424
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,890
-- Dan Farmer, right? That was his name. He
-- got, yeah, Dan Farmer, he got fired from. So

425
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,890
anyways and

426
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:03,689
map uh

427
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,050
network mapper.

428
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,329
That's easy. And snort is just, it snorts up packets

429
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,959
like

430
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,670
-- doing a line of, I mean, snort
-- still exists, right?

431
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:15,739
This is what's fascinating to me. It's not that these tools. OK.

432
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,729
Well, N map, not so much but snort and Satan.

433
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:20,510
And actually, instead of N map, you know what I should have gone with was um

434
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,750
NUS which was a security scanner but

435
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,510
snort, Satan and Nus and by extension N map,

436
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,689
not only are still successful and quite widely used, but they've spawned

437
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,750
not just entire industries that are quite successful,

438
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,060
but they are now required by many information, security regulations to be used.

439
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,020
-- Sure,
-- like PC I says you are required to scan your network.

440
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,420
You are required like in the finance industry

441
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,150
specifically, like there's a bunch of tools

442
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:48,880
NP

443
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,819
kind of got this all rolling or like looking at snort,

444
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:54,349
there's a lot of finance industry regulation that says you

445
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,449
have to be able to decrypt the data and,

446
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:01,930
-- and, and archive it or look at it or otherwise make sure it's OK.
-- Tools do that now

447
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,729
and snort was the progenitor to all this

448
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:06,219
and technically like D

449
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:09,410
sniff and ssh, sniff and stuff like that from Doug Song. Remember that.

450
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,569
-- But,
-- but snort isn't just about decrypting traffic as well.

451
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,489
It's about like logging and understand, I mean,

452
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:19,209
if you look at you, you got like Splunk and, and

453
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,949
there's a million SIM type tools and they all do a

454
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,989
lot of this stuff and you can write like rules to

455
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,729
look at the data and the network traffic. And it's, it's amazing now.

456
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:32,969
I mean, we could, we couldn't even imagine then what you can do with it today.

457
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:39,790
I think Satan is a more interesting example because Satan kind of died on the vine.

458
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,229
-- I think it never really got its true go
-- well.

459
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:47,709
But things afterwards like Nessus came out and Nessus was quite successful,

460
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,729
-- not
-- just Nessus.

461
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,069
I, I think Metas

462
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,410
Flo is closer to like the, the spirit of Satan

463
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,839
than any of those other tools maybe Nus.

464
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,599
Well, they all have plugins and,

465
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,900
and Nus had plugins and actually went to that wonky license where

466
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,910
if you didn't pay for NUS,

467
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:05,180
you couldn't distribute your plugins,

468
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,849
open source or whatever,

469
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,349
if you paid for the license or rather if you used open source, Nus,

470
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,430
you had to basically give your plug in back to them.

471
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,949
And if you bought it, you didn't have to because they, to put it bluntly,

472
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:20,829
the original author of it got tired of these contractors and consultants

473
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,410
making literal dump trucks full of money off of his open source

474
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,479
code and he got not even a bug report and return.

475
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,699
And so he went to a commercial company and they

476
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,790
wanted to monetize it because they wanted to buy food and stuff.

477
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,020
All right. Well, I keep

478
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,199
coming

479
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:35,449
back,

480
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,780
people keep wanting to buy food and so they

481
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,520
change their licensing so that they can do.

482
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:39,869
So

483
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,660
I, I get it. It's a tough one. There's a, there's actually a new story.

484
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,890
We'll have to talk about it at some point.

485
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,260
But Bruce Perens is beating that drum again about,

486
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,030
like what comes after open source so

487
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,140
good for him. I hope it goes somewhere.

488
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,670
I've been. Yeah.

489
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,189
Yeah, that is definitely another topic. Um,

490
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,069
but so,

491
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,989
so what's fascinating to me is like I said that these not only mostly succeeded, but

492
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,180
they spawned

493
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,750
success to the point where they are now required elements for

494
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:05,880
a

495
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,719
-- lot of information security.
-- Well, it works and

496
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,349
we like it,

497
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,339
data is cool. You can do amazing things with it.

498
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,060
It doesn't surprise me.

499
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,829
I feel like this is kind of the story of good security tech is you invent something.

500
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:25,630
And then a decade later it spawns like new industries and products

501
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,859
that aren't necessarily having anything to do with the original tool.

502
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:32,750
But it's kind of the basic idea of it, right?

503
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:36,829
Although S SSH didn't, did SSH spawn

504
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,560
a product, not really. It just changed the

505
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,199
world.

506
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:41,589
Like

507
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,040
I think it was what got us rolling on the, hey,

508
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,229
shouldn't everything be encrypted all the time everywhere?

509
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:50,430
-- I
-- mean, it might have part. No, you know what, you know what SSH really did

510
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,819
without SSH, we couldn't have had like colo type environments really.

511
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:59,930
And the colo environments eventually turned into the cloud

512
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,910
and without SSH,

513
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,989
we couldn't have managed any of that stuff.

514
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,199
I mean, look at things like answerable, literally use SSH as their transport layer.

515
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,520
This is back to the thing where

516
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,770
it's a, it's a subtle but important distinction.

517
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,390
SSH is not just telnet, SSH is telnet plus our command

518
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:19,959
plus FTP.

519
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:25,439
You can, you can still do SSH dash capital Y to have X windows,

520
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:27,380
things like remote over SS A

521
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,239
and you can do X window forwarding, you can do socks proxy. So I've actually used SSH,

522
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:36,640
I, I've actually used SSH as a VPN while I'm on the road because

523
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,810
I can ssh over. Well, back in the day, I always ssh over.

524
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:42,510
I had one running on port 80 because nobody ever blocked that

525
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,859
and then 4443.

526
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,430
But that's the thing, right? SSH is this pipe between end point A and end point B

527
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,359
and

528
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,280
how do I say this nicely VPN S suck and don't work 20 years ago.

529
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:57,030
Ok.

530
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,030
Nowadays VPN S are great and we actually have a couple

531
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,420
of standards like wire guard and open VPN that actually work.

532
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,119
But 20 years ago, we did not have that.

533
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,880
And if I wanted a Linux machine to talk to a BS

534
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,829
D machine or a UNIX machine or a Windows machine securely,

535
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,520
my only choice was SSH,

536
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,650
that was the only cross platform thing.

537
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:17,209
Ignoring you're right because ignoring the encryption, it gave me

538
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,739
I can interactively log in I can transfer files, I can send commands.

539
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,449
It did have magic in it. It was amazing what it all picked up.

540
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:31,040
So I still use it for running X Windows applications on remote systems.

541
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,959
Like I use it all the time, which amuses me.

542
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:38,459
So I think maybe the lesson here is that well, actually, because how do sort of,

543
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,410
well, if the lesson is you have to do more than security,

544
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,010
you actually have to be useful

545
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,939
for, to have success.

546
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,229
That's not really like with snorting and map and Satan, those things,

547
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:50,689
those things are kind of fundamentally just security things

548
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,609
that don't really give you a new capability.

549
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:54,890
How come they were so successful?

550
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,329
I don't think they were,

551
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,810
I don't think they were particularly widely used outside of the security industry.

552
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,010
But then you saw them birth some of this other technology,

553
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:07,270
you know, things like Sims

554
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,339
and logging class

555
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:09,920
just for the record. What are SIMS again?

556
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:13,310
It's si em security information and event management.

557
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,910
It's like Splunk and elastic search and

558
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,790
basically it's more logic data. There's like millions of them

559
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,469
and they,

560
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,469
they ingest tons and tons of data

561
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:23,709
and then they, you can do magic things with them.

562
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:26,630
Well, the biggest thing that gets me is the correlation aspect of like,

563
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,680
oh here's a TP connection followed by a weirdly running process,

564
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:31,010
followed by outgoing data.

565
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,189
That's an attack.

566
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:35,010
Versus if I look at those three things separately, I have no idea what's going on.

567
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:39,250
That's right. And you have to be able to correlate these things because if you don't,

568
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:40,469
you know, it, it,

569
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:44,089
-- maybe it's an attack, maybe it's
-- every time you hear that story, it's like, you know,

570
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,569
they ex filtrated a terabyte of data from Boeing to China.

571
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:47,170
It's kind of like,

572
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,609
-- how did you not catch that
-- because people aren't watching

573
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:55,560
the network logs and there's probably someone torrenting porn already.

574
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,250
So it doesn't matter. So

575
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:00,339
that's generally how it goes

576
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,500
anyway. Anyway. I mean,

577
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,550
this, this topic amuses me.

578
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,810
We'll have to revisit it with some other things because I feel like

579
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,770
I feel like there's some interesting history behind all of this

580
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,579
and I especially love some of the things like, you know,

581
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:18,020
how did ssh kind of get to where it is today?

582
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,459
And it, it's like it's magic today. I mean,

583
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,000
dude,

584
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,819
it's on everything by default and it's the

585
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,819
only thing that's turned on by default anymore,

586
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:25,260
right?

587
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,099
It's like the Ed of its day.

588
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:31,619
Remember when Ed was the only editor on Cisco routers, you know, you had to learn Ed.

589
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:35,369
That's why I still know vi I know how to escape from vi I know how to delete lines,

590
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,819
-- find stuff because,
-- oh my goodness.

591
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:36,920
I,

592
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,109
I have a very funny story to tell you. So the uh Obsidian the, the Note Taking app,

593
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,209
it has a V I mode they added

594
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:48,599
and to turn on V I mode it says, please type

595
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:52,030
what you like, please type the characters to exit V I

596
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,339
and if you get them wrong, it says something like I'm sorry,

597
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:57,199
we can't enable this to protect you.

598
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,589
That's actually not the worst idea because like

599
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,310
that can be frustrating. You get stuck in there.

600
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:10,170
Like um my old keyboard had uh if you hit control, left alt number,

601
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,280
it would change the keyboard mode

602
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,729
and there was another, I forget what the magic key control was,

603
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:17,170
but it would disable the windows key and

604
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,020
I would accidentally disable the windows key once every

605
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,390
month or two and then be like hit windows L to lock my computer and be like,

606
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,900
oh, it broke great.

607
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,310
And then I'd have to like Google how to, you know, get this to work again.

608
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:30,729
And because I can't remember what key code.

609
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:32,750
So anyways, I replaced it with a nice corsair keyboard

610
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,390
that doesn't do dumb stuff like that to disable the windows key.

611
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,430
It actually has a dedicated lock key on the thing.

612
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:40,989
Why would you disable the windows key when you're, it's a gaming keyboard?

613
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,089
So you don't want to accidentally hit the Windows key and like

614
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:43,959
get

615
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,630
out of your

616
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:45,510
game.

617
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,719
It's actually got a tournament mode, check it out.

618
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:52,069
So it's got this little switch here with a hardware tab that like locks over it.

619
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,449
So you can put it in tournament mode and

620
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,339
that disables like all the preprogrammed key combos.

621
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,270
And stuff. So it's just a keyboard.

622
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,900
Yeah, it's a nice keyboard.

623
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:00,790
Yeah.

624
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,430
I mean, I feel like that makes sense anyway. It's the magic of technology, man.

625
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,550
All right, I'll give you the last word on this one.

626
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:11,150
I still think that we don't do enough post mortems on both

627
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,650
failure and success and we don't know why things fail or succeed.

628
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,030
That's just human nature, man.

629
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,130
I'm not gonna.

630
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,750
-- But I
-- feel like,

631
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,099
don't you think security businesses would do this more

632
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,939
to figure out how to build better products and

633
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,069
succeed? Right? Like that.

634
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,890
-- That's,
-- well, that's a complicated question,

635
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,699
I think with a complicated answer and the way I would answer it is simply,

636
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,609
I think there's an enormous number of security things that

637
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,449
exist that are terrible garbage and should have failed.

638
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,670
And there's an enormous number of awesome products

639
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,920
that did fail and it's really the whole,

640
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,550
you're just, if you're in the right place at the right time, you can get lucky.

641
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,089
I think there's definitely an element of that.

642
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,390
But yeah, I, I just,

643
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,709
I feel like it would be nice to understand why things fail

644
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,119
and succeed a bit more so we can maybe do better.

645
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:57,930
Like that's this recent thing on Mastodon about, you know, sites that disable

646
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,959
pasting and you can't use a password manager with them. And I'm like,

647
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,650
right,

648
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,530
that sounds not only like a security vulnerability because I'm forcing you to use

649
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,689
bad passwords or cut you know, do some weird stuff

650
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,729
but also from A US,

651
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,089
-- you
-- know, the, the New Firefox has a force paste

652
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:14,650
good. That's actually a show.

653
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,239
II, I actually wanted to cover ad blockers on the show, but I actually,

654
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,209
what I think we need to do it somewhat is a future show about

655
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:26,719
how web browsers are essentially having to protect us from websites and bad stuff.

656
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:30,849
I mean, it's kind of turning into that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Anyway, anyway,

657
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:34,310
uh I would, I would love to say everyone should do post mortems,

658
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,329
but it even postmortems are complicated

659
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,089
because the obvious reason the security product succeeded is because I'm awesome.

660
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,969
And I built it right. That's why, that's why it did.

661
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:46,400
It's, it's hard to do a proper postmortem

662
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:50,469
without letting like personal opinion and ego get in the way

663
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,910
also premortem. So I've started doing some premortem stuff and it's like, oh,

664
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:54,699
yeah,

665
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,939
-- I don't know what that means.
-- You basically, what are my assumptions?

666
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:59,410
What could go wrong? What could go, right?

667
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,900
-- What might this look like if X that's
-- product management?

668
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,849
Like?

669
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,810
