0
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:02,789
It doesn't matter, leave it at the end. Maybe I could put it at the beginning.

1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,078
I don't know. We'll see what happens.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,280
There was no episode 214 and at first we were talking about, oh,

3
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:09,970
we'll make a joke about how the government censored us or something.

4
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:12,850
And I realized we live in tumultuous times right

5
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:14,569
now and I don't want to make this joke.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,590
So the reason there's no episode 214 is because I can't count.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,989
And that's all like there's no conspiracy. Just

8
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:26,405
I typed 215 into my system and there was no 214 and I made a mistake.

9
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,635
Well, I'm fixing, it would have taken like three or four minutes.

10
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:29,764
-- No,
-- I don't think so though.

11
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:31,754
Because of the way podcast networks work,

12
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:34,125
I think we would have ended up with episode 214 and

13
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,365
episode 215 both being exactly the same published on their sites.

14
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,404
So I thought it's easier to do nothing.

15
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:42,205
And more importantly, the most important part of this

16
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,580
I have changed my,

17
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:49,299
what do I have a process? Yeah, the process sounds good. I have changed my process.

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,729
To make sure I cannot make this mistake again,

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,150
which is the most important part of making mistakes is

20
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,139
doing something to make sure it never happens again.

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,939
So, there you go.

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,339
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

23
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,540
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Breit.

24
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,720
This week's bias is anchoring.

25
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,900
The first thing you judge influences your judgment of

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,959
all that follows what we're gonna be doing.

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,489
Biases. Logical biases

28
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:16,769
are,

29
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,069
yeah, they're good. Well, they're not good. They're a problem.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,989
-- Actually,
-- this week's sponsor is

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,459
Anchors Anchoring.

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,440
Also, we would, uh, an anchor sponsor would be fine because, you know,

33
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:26,050
it's annoying to me.

34
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:26,440
I finally

35
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,809
learn how ship anchors work

36
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:29,900
because, like, as a kid, I just sort of thought they,

37
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,080
like dug into the bottom of the ocean and like

38
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,709
anchored you, it turns out no, what anchors you is,

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,580
you have the anchor and a length of chain and then a

40
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:41,720
cable and it's the length of chain lying on the ocean floor.

41
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,559
Simply put friction from that is what keeps the ship from moving.

42
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:46,919
I have no idea.

43
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:49,629
I did not know that. I thought like the anchor was dug into the

44
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,239
dirt or the silt or whatever.

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,260
-- And so I always, you know, kind of wondered like, how do they get it back out?
-- Right?

46
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,440
Why, why do they even have an anchor then?

47
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,349
-- Why don't they just throw a piece of chain over the side
-- my understanding is you

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,709
need something at the end with a little bit more like that has more friction.

49
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,739
-- So it digs in a bit.
-- It's possible. I have no idea. But,

50
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,860
yeah, anchoring. Ok.

51
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,559
What about anchoring? What are we talking about?

52
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,820
-- This
-- news of life on Venus is a great example of everybody hears life on Venus

53
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,110
and

54
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,919
yeah, the poor scientists that the actual report is a

55
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,470
-- little bit less sensationalistic.
-- I think

56
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,039
I would say it's substantially less sensational.

57
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:30,630
So I am a huge space nerd and I love all space news in every possible way.

58
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,720
And

59
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,020
I saw this article headline of scientists detect life on Venus.

60
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:39,490
And I thought, I bet you that the article has nothing in it.

61
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,039
And you know what it always reminds me of is my comparison here is water on Mars.

62
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,940
How many times have scientists discovered water on Mars? Probably 40

63
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,369
the

64
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:50,565
-- everywhere but,
-- but sorry, are we talking liquid water or

65
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:56,365
-- whatever
-- anything? Right? Or like how many times his Voyager left the solar system?

66
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:57,244
Like

67
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:04,425
it's one of those situations and this, I think is completely relatable to security

68
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:09,485
in the context of there's what the scientists are saying

69
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:13,304
and there's what people hear and they're not the same thing

70
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:14,485
at all.

71
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,619
No.

72
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,210
Yeah.

73
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,860
No, these, when I first saw this, I was like, ok,

74
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:23,600
somebody with a title or is making stuff up and then I actually read it and I'm like,

75
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,770
oh, this is actually completely reasonable.

76
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,619
-- Yeah,
-- it is. They found a gas that

77
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,020
on earth

78
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,539
in our current

79
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,779
-- perspective of science,
-- I would say understanding of science not perspective

80
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:37,369
in

81
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:37,779
a

82
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:38,710
right.

83
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,869
They, they found a gas in our current understanding of science

84
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,789
on a rocky planet.

85
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,490
-- This gas is only created by bacteria.
-- Well, uh so it's on earth

86
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,289
and under earth conditions, it's only created by

87
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:53,850
like

88
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,399
um life.

89
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,839
It can also be created in a laboratory, obviously.

90
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,050
But my understanding is because I read a little bit about this,

91
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,320
the conditions needed to create this gas in a laboratory

92
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,600
are generally not sort of naturally found on earth.

93
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,399
And, and,

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,720
but here's the thing, right?

95
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:12,800
And here's how I would, I, I'll, I'll frame it in this context.

96
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:14,770
I don't want to dwell on specifically Venus for too

97
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:17,250
long because I think there's so many interesting parallels here.

98
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,950
But I was listening to an astronomy podcast. Uh This has been like a

99
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,808
year, it was a long, long time ago

100
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:27,308
and they were talking about like weird stars and the

101
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:30,967
host basically said these are stars that shouldn't exist.

102
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,118
And of course, as soon as you say that in astronomy,

103
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:35,768
we find some because when you have,

104
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:38,888
when you have a universe that is so monstrously large,

105
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,608
you can't possibly imagine it.

106
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,817
Everything that you claim is

107
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:45,507
is never going to happen because it's too rare.

108
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:47,768
There's probably millions of them out there.

109
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,678
Well, like they say, you know, one in a,

110
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,096
is eight times a day in New York

111
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,735
and, and this is the same deal of something was found

112
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,656
on a strange place.

113
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,055
And so

114
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:01,346
maybe it's normal there. We don't know.

115
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:02,716
And, and, and so anyway, here's,

116
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:05,536
here's a parallel I think we should draw is when

117
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:10,855
security people try to talk to normal people about anything,

118
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:14,295
anything at all, the people don't hear what we say.

119
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,575
-- Well,
-- nuance is hard.

120
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,406
Like that's the thing, you know,

121
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,794
pick a good password. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man.

122
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,783
I just want to start punching stuff because I'm like, no,

123
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,973
you know what my password manager is going to do it for me.

124
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:28,403
-- And then I know it's good. And
-- so the way, the way I would explain this to people is that

125
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:33,914
if you want to prove to me life is on Venus. Make me a hamburger from a Venus cow.

126
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:35,104
That is the bar.

127
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:36,144
Well, and I love that, you know,

128
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:38,944
they basically people were talking about it and it's like, well, you know,

129
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:40,993
what really needs to happen is we need to have a sample returned

130
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:43,424
to earth and get into the hands of a bunch of humans.

131
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,014
And like my first thought from like a pro

132
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:48,511
-- principle is like, no,
-- yeah, that's how movies start.

133
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:51,071
But now here's, here's the other part of that though.

134
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:55,361
You can, you can't even claim that because we could send a craft to Venus.

135
00:05:55,601 --> 00:06:00,372
-- We could capture a sample, we could bring the craft back,
-- crashed into earth.

136
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,652
Like that previous one.

137
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,652
There was a sample return mission that,

138
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:07,812
-- like crashed into the Australian Outback or something that
-- was for comet stardust.

139
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:08,631
I think that was.

140
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:11,782
And yeah, it crashed and they recovered a little bit of stuff but it was,

141
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,761
they were supposed to catch it with a

142
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,209
helicopter sky hook. Like it's an amazing,

143
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,660
it's a Rube Goldberg machine.

144
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,059
-- Like none I've ever seen
-- what kills me is like they were

145
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,559
doing this stuff in the Cold War all the time for satellite.

146
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,950
-- Anyway.
-- Anyway. So, so here's the thing though, right?

147
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,600
We bring our sample back to earth

148
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,239
and if the sample we get looks anything like stuff we find on earth,

149
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,160
they're going to say

150
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,660
maybe we accidentally sent bacteria on the spacecraft and

151
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,059
now we just brought back what we sent.

152
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,119
Well, look, they've had tardigrades go on

153
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,559
missions to outer space and come back alive.

154
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,127
Well, I mean,

155
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:44,597
and it's really cool because from a scientific perspective, like, hey,

156
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:45,118
we just proved t

157
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:45,477
grains

158
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:46,187
for five other

159
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,947
didn't mean to. But you know, there it is.

160
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,898
And so anyway, like this is part of the nuance of science.

161
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,208
And like you pointed out saying,

162
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:57,717
pick a strong password is the same problem that to a security

163
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:01,247
person who understands the industry and understands some of the nuance,

164
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:01,608
you can say,

165
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:02,958
pick a strong password and you're going

166
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,528
to immediately go to something insanely long,

167
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:08,007
randomly generated stored in a password safe.

168
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:08,328
Right.

169
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:11,440
But a normal person gonna hear, pick a strong password, they're gonna be like,

170
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,829
fluffy seven,

171
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:15,739
the seven makes it strong

172
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,000
and I'll put a question mark there, you know, like, no, your password sucks.

173
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,670
You can't name it after your dog.

174
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,119
The thing that really gets me is

175
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,690
these poor scientists are actually really trying, you know,

176
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,459
if you read the actual sort of guts of the

177
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,059
article and I don't mean like article in the news,

178
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,299
but from the actual, you know, science type people, basically, they're saying,

179
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:35,619
like, look, here's what we found

180
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:39,779
and here's like six probable ways to disprove this and that we're wrong.

181
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,429
And, and then of course, people are like, ah, see the scientists aren't

182
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:45,743
and it's like, that's the whole point of science, right? We come up with this,

183
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,042
you know, this idea

184
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:49,423
and we, we make a hypothesis.

185
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:52,342
We, we, we basically try and understand the world a bit better

186
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:54,683
and then we test the bejesus out of it so that

187
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,592
we actually do want to disprove it because if we disprove it cool,

188
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,882
then we move on to the next thing.

189
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:02,072
But if we don't disprove it, huh? Maybe this is true and it works

190
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,406
and always gets me about science above all other

191
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:07,786
things is science lets you predict the future,

192
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:08,686
it lets you

193
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,555
make predictions. Like

194
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,615
I'm going to put a hole in the ground here and oil is

195
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:16,256
going to come out because this data says so and my understanding of,

196
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,805
you know, geology says that there's like a,

197
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:22,575
an oil deposit here or we can design a car this way with crumple zones

198
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,145
and people will die less

199
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:28,480
-- and get less hurt
-- now. But here's the magic part of it as well.

200
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,809
And this is a lesson for us and we'll tie this

201
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,520
back to passwords momentarily is sometimes when science is wrong,

202
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,469
that isn't a failure.

203
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,070
It means you just have more data now to make better decisions in the future.

204
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,750
And a better understanding of the underlying thing, like, you know, for,

205
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,989
for the longest time we had Newtonian physics, which, you know,

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,049
if you're playing billiards.

207
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,900
Absolutely.

208
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,539
But then you want to make a nuclear reactor and

209
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:55,309
-- things get a little weird
-- or relativistic speed travel,

210
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,590
right?

211
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,250
I mean,

212
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,700
yeah, not a problem for us yet.

213
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:02,734
I mean, no, but it is a problem. I mean, think about like the GPS, right?

214
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:04,005
Like the GEOS station or not,

215
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,234
but the satellites for GPS need to take

216
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,494
relativity into account because of the earth's gravity.

217
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:12,094
I bet that if they did not take relativity into account,

218
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:13,934
we would just end up in one of those classical, like, ah,

219
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:17,335
there's these weird glitches with our navigation system but, you know, whatever.

220
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:21,265
-- No, it would be unusable. The margin of error. Would it actually be
-- bad enough to be

221
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:22,525
-- like
-- meters,

222
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,849
like tens of meters? Is the, you'd be

223
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,549
not

224
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:25,690
really

225
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,270
if you don't take

226
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:30,919
my understanding of all this is quite poor

227
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,440
and I'll be the first to admit that.

228
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,900
And by understanding of this, I mean, basically everything, not just gps. Right.

229
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,159
My understanding of pancakes,

230
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,510
pancakes. Anyway. Ok.

231
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,119
So here's,

232
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,679
here's where I want to bring this before we end

233
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,640
up on some crazy tangent about whatever bears or something.

234
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,270
Pancakes.

235
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:45,510
Yeah,

236
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,159
I love pancakes. Maple syrup. It's maple. Oh, I love maple. Anyway. Ok.

237
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:54,260
So if we look at passwords specifically in the context of science and learning,

238
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,979
my favorite example is Nist released password guidance

239
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,570
and we all followed it. And then one day someone actually did real science

240
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:06,380
-- using real data
-- also at NIST.

241
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,890
-- Yes, I know
-- that well.

242
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,789
And people did this prior to Nist as well, but he's

243
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:11,780
-- never
-- right. They basically said

244
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,409
the guidance Nist has been giving is wrong

245
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,500
and here's the data showing it's wrong.

246
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:21,900
It's one of those situations where Nist actually did the right thing they said, ok,

247
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:22,809
we made a mistake.

248
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,539
We shouldn't be doing this. Here's some revised guidance,

249
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:28,349
but there's like there's still and it baffles my mind

250
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:30,010
where there are people I talk to that say,

251
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,750
yeah, I read that.

252
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,650
I, I disagree. And it's like, no, you can't. Like this isn't an opinion piece.

253
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:39,030
The the data shows this doesn't work. You can't

254
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,349
-- like no,
-- I think a lot of people conflate facts and opinion

255
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:44,559
to put it bluntly,

256
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,690
-- I'm shocked for you to say that in our current political climate
-- curt.

257
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,890
I know, man. Oh my God.

258
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,650
But yeah, it, it really blows my mind that these people literally think that they,

259
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,030
I have anecdotal evidence.

260
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,909
Therefore this peer review study with a, you know, a sample size of 10,000.

261
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,140
Yeah, I'm just going to

262
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,880
it. But the kid down the street told me that.

263
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:05,380
Yeah.

264
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:09,820
And, and I've been wondering about that for a few months now.

265
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,669
And I just,

266
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,460
it's a human thing because I think in past the world was generally simple enough

267
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,780
that most people could wrap their head

268
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:21,409
around the world and generally understand it.

269
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:25,619
But a great example would be traffic light patterns.

270
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,409
I did a bit of research into that because I

271
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:29,500
was kind of annoyed by some of the time they changed

272
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,940
some of the timing of the lights on some major

273
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,250
roads near me that really makes it kind of screwy.

274
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,849
But it's clear that the point of this

275
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,200
was to get people to stop running the red lights and having accidents.

276
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,700
Like there's, there's enough,

277
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,700
let me put it this way.

278
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,219
I've personally witnessed, I'm gonna say, well, the, the minivan,

279
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:50,780
like I've personally witnessed the outcome of four accidents

280
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:54,039
and I mean, one of them was pretty bad, like I was driving up stony,

281
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,460
saw the double flash of the red light camera, this was at night,

282
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:59,340
you know, a couple blocks away because it's pretty, pretty bright

283
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,549
pull up and there's a minivan on its side, there's another minivan off to the side.

284
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,940
There's people out helping making phone calls, blah, blah, blah.

285
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:05,919
But, you know, it was,

286
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:08,710
it was pretty bad or another time there was a Cooper mini up on the, um,

287
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:11,059
on the landscaping, smashed into the big sign.

288
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,640
And so,

289
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,090
you know,

290
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,979
it's a set of major interchanges where people run red lights and cause accidents.

291
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,599
And so they've changed the timing of the lights

292
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,580
and it sucks because you can't,

293
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,190
you know, hit the green and hit the next screen and get through,

294
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,460
you hit a green, then you hit the red or you hit the red and

295
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,989
you know what I mean? Like, so they've basically staggered it

296
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:30,250
and it has really

297
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,150
made it about

298
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,809
1530 seconds slower consistently,

299
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,729
but there's probably going to be less accidents.

300
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,820
And that is a huge external cost like that is a huge cost. Like one accident is

301
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,229
hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills borne by the taxpayers. Exactly.

302
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,250
That's huge. You know, compared to wasting 15 to 30 seconds of people's lives.

303
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,070
And that's the thing. Right.

304
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,309
So something as quote unquote, simple as a red and green light timing

305
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,280
it,

306
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm guessing there's somebody working for the city of Edmonton with a spreadsheet

307
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,219
and, you know, and,

308
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:04,419
-- and a model of how intersections work and how people abuse them that made that
-- call,

309
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,789
I would assume that is the case.

310
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,559
I obviously don't know for sure.

311
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:08,919
And I mean,

312
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,400
if traffic lights are that complicated how the heck

313
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:13,700
can we expect people to handle information security?

314
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,919
Well, we can't. And that's ok.

315
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,229
Well,

316
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:21,250
if they listen to the experts and the experts are good and true then the system works.

317
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,349
But the problem is this anti intellectualism thing where people don't want

318
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:27,034
-- to listen to experts
-- and it's more complicated than I think though.

319
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:30,075
And I'm going to not address this in the

320
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:33,625
broad universe today because I think there's some other

321
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:36,234
socio-economic problems around all this.

322
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:38,635
But let's just focus on security specifically. And

323
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:43,715
-- my argument is that our experts suck is what I'm going to call it.
-- Yeah, they do.

324
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:44,515
How long did that

325
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:47,594
password guidance go for before somebody checked it out and went, whoops,

326
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:49,385
-- this is wrong a very
-- long time.

327
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:54,690
And so the way I like to always look at this is when I viewed the security universe,

328
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:56,059
there are

329
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:59,570
the experts and I'll put this in air quotes here.

330
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,000
You can't see me, but I'm making air quotes in my fingers.

331
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:05,809
So there's the experts and what most of these people are experts at

332
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,409
is is making themselves very public where they give lots of interviews.

333
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:10,809
They,

334
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,929
they do keynotes at conferences and all this stuff

335
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,280
and the vast majority of them say very little.

336
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,049
And then you have people who are like the

337
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,489
scientist experts that are publishing the papers like,

338
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,210
well, we found this

339
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:22,744
obscure gas on Venus

340
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,864
and a lot of those people are doing, you know, like the work,

341
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:29,744
but they're not in a position to communicate the work they're necessarily

342
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:29,984
too busy

343
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:30,885
doing

344
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:32,544
-- or they're not
-- good at

345
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:32,835
communicating

346
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,664
here's and not to pick on the password guide,

347
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,424
but he kind of messed up because he wanted to do password guidance,

348
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:40,835
which is commendable, right?

349
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:42,294
We want that, we want expertise.

350
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,224
But, and I quote, he had wanted to provide guidelines based on real life data.

351
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:47,934
Cool, great. That's what we want.

352
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,479
But there wasn't much empirical data on password security 15 years ago. In the end,

353
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,239
he had to rely heavily on an outdated white paper

354
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,479
on computer password security written in the 19 eighties.

355
00:14:57,489 --> 00:15:01,219
And so I would say part of this is on him in my mind, I hate

356
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:02,479
making

357
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,440
generally broad large scale recommendations when I don't have data.

358
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:09,450
And, and I've had to do this a few times in the past.

359
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,140
And I've literally said, like, look, I don't have data,

360
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,580
but my gut says this and it's possibly wrong for these reasons.

361
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:18,280
But here's what I think and, and more importantly, why do I think this? Because

362
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,200
if I say here's my decision and here's why I

363
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,280
made my decision and here's what it's founded on.

364
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,799
Hopefully somebody's going to go uh Kurt, that's not correct and point that out and,

365
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:30,780
and you need to revisit that on a regular basis.

366
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:33,440
But now how many security decisions happen

367
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,000
because they're based on data

368
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,390
and how many happened because of their opinion

369
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,520
-- and how many are ever revisited, how many
-- happened? Because you need a decision and,

370
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,070
and some of them do. And that's ok.

371
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,419
And ok, actually, sometimes, so one of my favorite arguments in this space is so

372
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,570
I actually just had a meeting

373
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,369
with,

374
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,270
it was github.

375
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,169
It was, it was yesterday, man. It feels like it was a year ago. But anyway, so github,

376
00:15:59,419 --> 00:15:59,780
github

377
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,989
has, you know,

378
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,760
they've got their advanced security features and all

379
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,020
this stuff and they were basically saying,

380
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,739
oh, look at everything we've done.

381
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,500
Uh We want you to use some of this.

382
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:12,659
And I said, OK, here's the deal, right? Like I can't use this because of this reason.

383
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:16,070
And, and like an example is they've got their dependency checker,

384
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,679
but the dependency checker, the, the way

385
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:22,369
the organization is set up too many people are getting the dependency checker mail.

386
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,440
So he turned it off and I'm like,

387
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,469
I need the ability to just send the mails to like me and not everyone.

388
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,679
And the guy says,

389
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,250
oh, but you just need to reset up your organization like this.

390
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,359
I said, you don't understand

391
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:36,880
that is not on the table. II, I cannot do that. And more importantly,

392
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:41,299
as a security person, I'm unwilling to stick my neck out and say,

393
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,320
like we have to do this like no screw it.

394
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,619
I will do nothing before I will try to do that

395
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:51,820
re architecting how the users and groups and permissions and whatnot

396
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,289
are set up in a cloud service once it's working.

397
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,380
-- No, the answer is no.
-- Exactly.

398
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,109
But, but I mean, this is what ends up happening in a lot of cases.

399
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,320
And I think a lot of security people will say, oh,

400
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,459
we have to do this for reasons and sometimes no, you don't.

401
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,250
And sometimes if you try to force something through you actually damage

402
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,618
what you're trying to do more than just doing nothing at all.

403
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,420
-- This
-- also assumes that what you're trying to do is actually useful and helpful,

404
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,459
which it isn't always.

405
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,959
-- Dependency
-- scanning is definitely a mess

406
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,569
and a perfect example is so OK,

407
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,858
dependency scanning cool.

408
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:24,598
So I'm going to get a report of like all my

409
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:27,098
out of date dependencies is that actually going to be helpful.

410
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,569
I know

411
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,680
we have a process in place to actually do deal with this uh using some external tools.

412
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:38,209
And as much as I would love to leverage what github has or, or my other favorite

413
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,670
is they're talking about

414
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,839
automatic dependency resolution where they have a tool that basically says, oh,

415
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:45,359
this dependency is out of date.

416
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:49,239
-- Here's a pull request that'll update it. It's like, holy crap.
-- No.

417
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,880
Well, and again, if you're,

418
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,459
if you're just hacking on some open source software that you run on your laptop,

419
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,060
that's

420
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,359
OK.

421
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,349
But if you're running a company on top of that or worse yet,

422
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,469
you're pitching that software over the fence to other

423
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,750
people to run and they care about it working

424
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:08,430
well. And here's what actually happens because we tried to use a tool like this

425
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,989
and basically

426
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,329
the tool would submit the pill request, then the C I would run and it would fail.

427
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:17,290
And then so now you have a choice.

428
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,430
Does a human look at the failed job and decide what happened and how can we fix it?

429
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,020
Do we ignore it completely?

430
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,260
Like, like where do you draw the lines in making this stuff happen?

431
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,020
You obviously can't auto commit if you're failing your build tests,

432
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,829
but now that you failed it,

433
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,479
whose job is it to figure out why it failed?

434
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,280
So you're creating stupid, annoying work.

435
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,310
Well, and the reality too is any automated system that can handle.

436
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,219
This is pretty much by definition going to be,

437
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,719
have to be pretty much as complex as a human being.

438
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,760
Yeah. Exactly. Right. Because this is,

439
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,939
yeah, I've looked into this too, like my devs, you know, again, they're like, hey,

440
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:54,099
Kurt, you know what's the best way for us to monitor CV S in the rails ecosystem?

441
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:55,060
Like, don't.

442
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:58,260
Right. And they're like, what, what do you mean? Don't? And I'm like,

443
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,369
you guys update the software, like weekly and ship updates, like every two weeks.

444
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,959
They're like, yeah, and I'm like, well, keep doing that

445
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,189
and I'm like, if there's a big emergency,

446
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,660
it'll show up in the news and stuff.

447
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,949
You know, if there's an actual, like, really bad flaw, that kind of matters.

448
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,839
Yeah, we'll probably hear about it and I'll poke you guys with a stick and

449
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,780
see if we're affected and if we need to update or not,

450
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,390
you know, and that works for us because we're just, you know,

451
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,130
we're the only ones running the software that they built.

452
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,890
But by and large, you know, for a lot of these companies, like,

453
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,890
can you ship an emergency update in less than 24

454
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,329
hours without making everybody drink seven pots of coffee.

455
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:33,420
And the answer to that in almost every organization is no.

456
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,510
Now, can you do it in a week or a month?

457
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,689
A more reasonable time frame, in my opinion, and most can't do it in a month.

458
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,199
-- Ok.
-- A month is too long, obviously, but a week is probably fair. Now, I

459
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,140
will say,

460
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,329
I think this goes back to the kind

461
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,520
of security people blowing things out of proportion and

462
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,729
not communicating correctly is if you think you need to push an update in 24 hours,

463
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:56,739
you're probably confused or

464
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,630
not living in the real world because I can think of very, very few instances

465
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,949
where making an update happen in 24 hours is actually necessary

466
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,339
-- and reasonable.
-- Well, and the simple fact is what

467
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,989
an organization will typically do is just turn that off.

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,430
I mean, that's happened here in Canada Revenue, Canada, sorry,

469
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:18,989
the Canada Revenue Agency got hit by three separate attacks this summer,

470
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,140
basically just turned off a huge swath of features on the website.

471
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,349
Like,

472
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,569
and these are major features like the one is tying your service accounts into

473
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:29,949
cr A so that like you can access your account and they just,

474
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,579
we definitely got hacked through this.

475
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:35,589
So we're turning it off and it's been off for a while and that's ok.

476
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,489
I mean that during heartbleed

477
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,390
they had to get an exemption to lengthen the time people had to file their taxes

478
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,280
because again,

479
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,609
revenue Canada or Canada Revenue Agency shut down their

480
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,949
website like two days before all taxes were due.

481
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,670
-- You couldn't e
-- file Harpley is a great example.

482
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,670
So there's a security issue and we know it's maybe bad, maybe not bad.

483
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,329
-- Yeah,
-- it turned out it was pretty bad. It,

484
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,280
it could be.

485
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,010
I mean, it depends how you're using it though.

486
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,949
There were so many weird what ifs around heartbleed

487
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:05,750
and

488
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:11,479
it is, it is a situation where I think trying to rush a patch out in 24 hours

489
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:15,599
-- is not, not that this happened, obviously heartbleed is different but, but,
-- well,

490
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,560
it happened with shell shock.

491
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,079
We ended up with like four or five patches.

492
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,780
Yeah, because there was like, the story is ridiculous, of course.

493
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,994
But it's one of those situations where by trying to rush stupid

494
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:29,875
mistakes got made instead of standing back and being all right,

495
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:31,675
what's actually going on here?

496
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:36,444
And part of the reality is Shellshock wasn't that big of a deal because you

497
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:40,974
needed such a bizarre combination of things to happen to exploit it that again,

498
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:43,734
if people would step back and say, ok, here's what's actually going on.

499
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:45,969
I don't think it would have been near as nuts.

500
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:50,050
I suspect the patching was more disruptive than any attacks. Like, globally.

501
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,449
Seriously. 100%. Yes. Absolutely.

502
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,569
You know, again, I don't have data to support that,

503
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:58,459
but based on what happened to the industry at that time

504
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,050
and the number of people who, you know, pulled all nighters and stuff,

505
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,530
definitely the, the cure was worse than the disease.

506
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,609
Absolutely.

507
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,859
Well, the way the cure was done,

508
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,140
the way it was released, right. That's the thing. It's like, here's this vaccine

509
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,920
-- except it's in a pill the size of a basketball. Good
-- luck.

510
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:18,140
And you have to swallow it all at once.

511
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,489
Oh, no, it's, no, it's not that kind of pill

512
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,050
-- anyway.
-- Wait, you can swallow pills now,

513
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,089
some of them.

514
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,849
But, I mean, so again, kind of coming back to

515
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,119
the news on Venus

516
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,250
and what's happening

517
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,689
and just kind of the way security exists.

518
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,810
I'm actually more excited if the news from Venus

519
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:41,530
is our understanding of how chemistry works is incorrect

520
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,969
because that would actually be quite useful.

521
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,459
-- It totally is,
-- you know, if there's ways to synthesize this chemical on earth in,

522
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:51,189
well, essentially Venusian conditions.

523
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,280
You know, we don't understand that yet.

524
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,849
Like if it's not life and it's an actual mechanical or whatever you want to call it,

525
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,969
chemical reaction is Venusian.

526
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,699
A word Venusian. Yes.

527
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,739
Anyways, and conversely, if there is life on Mars or on Mars, on Venus,

528
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,079
see that shows how old I am.

529
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,930
-- Right. It's always about life on Mars
-- we'll

530
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:10,400
take either.

531
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,550
And if there is life on Venus, that is also pretty damn cool.

532
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:16,560
It would actually be hilarious if it turns out there is life on Venus,

533
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:20,040
but not on Mars because we've been looking on Mars for so long and like, oh, look,

534
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,630
it was over here all along

535
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,609
anyway. Anyway.

536
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:24,750
So, ok,

537
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:25,589
I wanna,

538
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,650
I wanna tie this all up together when we look at security people and we

539
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,329
look at the way we're messaging things we often speak in a manner that doesn't

540
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:38,619
make it known that there's nuance in what we're doing or saying and,

541
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,010
and additionally, even if we do, it's going to be misunderstood just like this,

542
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,209
this Venus news is where

543
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,469
the reporters say one of the ways this gas could be created is life.

544
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,680
And the headline says life found on Venus.

545
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:52,060
I think part of the problem though is if

546
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:55,199
you try and make a properly qualified statement,

547
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,099
number one, it's going to be too long for a sound bite.

548
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,439
And number two people aren't going to understand it anyway.

549
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:01,890
So you have to make these declarative, simple statements.

550
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,589
Like for example, on Windows 10,

551
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,400
I will use the Built in Microsoft Defender stuff

552
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,930
because it probably won't make my system worse.

553
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:11,790
Whereas third party A V will almost certainly make my system worse.

554
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:15,550
And on my Macs, I just don't do A V.

555
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:17,939
And what's interesting is apparently Apple agrees

556
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:19,420
because Apple is doing that whole,

557
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,290
you know, code signing, code

558
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,349
checking hack

559
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:22,920
is right.

560
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,040
There was that whole thing a few months ago where they turned it on and all

561
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,459
of a sudden everybody's scripts take like an hour to run the first time they run.

562
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:32,339
And so, you know, Apple, I think, understands too that how do I put this nicely?

563
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:35,520
Number one, you've got defaults and people almost never change defaults.

564
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,839
And number two, then when they,

565
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:39,869
when they do start to change the defaults or install third party software,

566
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,569
is this going to make the experience significantly worse?

567
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,780
And the reality is for a V software, the answer is absolutely yes.

568
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,369
A V software always me

569
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,140
is up your system. And how often do people complain?

570
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,089
And I'm talking like people in corporations with

571
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,280
like expensive V about how this is like,

572
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,359
totally messed up systems.

573
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,250
So I think, well,

574
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,920
what I'm saying is I think we have to speak declarative and in some cases,

575
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,839
-- I don't want to say lie for the good, but
-- no, we don't lie out of the question.

576
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:08,339
Well, I don't want to say lie but, you know, we simplify things.

577
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:10,069
-- Let
-- me ask you a better question. Does

578
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,880
work.

579
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,900
-- Sometimes
-- the only the answer you can give is, I don't know because we don't,

580
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,920
there's data but the data is crap.

581
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,800
And I, I, I'm, I'm very skeptical anyone's done like a legitimate honest study of.

582
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,000
If A B even works at all.

583
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:30,050
I've seen people do demos where they test it and it like blocks a virus, demos

584
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,640
don't count.

585
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:34,079
Does it statistically make things better seatbelts

586
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,290
statistically make things better for everybody.

587
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,599
Yes, one or two people will

588
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,500
to a pond and die.

589
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:40,400
And that's very sad,

590
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,069
but the majority of people wearing their seatbelt won't

591
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,400
go flying out of their car in dots.

592
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,040
Now,

593
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:47,520
does it statistically make things better or worse? I don't know.

594
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,660
And you have to remember there's,

595
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,199
there's big picture here too because it's not just about stopping viruses.

596
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:56,920
It's about overall system performance about wasting time dealing with broken,

597
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,000
but there's many things to consider.

598
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:03,910
And again, this is where security kind of fails is we, we a lot of this data.

599
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,800
There's nobody looking into this and saying yes, this makes sense or no,

600
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,500
this doesn't.

601
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,020
-- And that is, I think a huge problem
-- even a simple

602
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:14,599
and I'm air quotes, big air quotes, a simple study about a V,

603
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:18,319
what is the failure rate of A V in the sense of not like it fails to detect something,

604
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:19,000
but in the sense of it,

605
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,479
like screws up the system and ends up costing you time and money to recover it.

606
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,579
We have no idea. None at all.

607
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:27,760
I know for a fact most companies don't track this kind of data. I mean,

608
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:32,729
you know, I've worked for companies where we did activities that were core and,

609
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:33,189
you know,

610
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:36,839
we both talked about measuring these activities and finding out what they cost

611
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:41,969
-- and we're very quickly told, no, don't do that.
-- I, I remember that where

612
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,670
we'll say a,

613
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,270
a company I used to work for.

614
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:51,069
No one knows who I remember. I said, like, how much does a security flaw cost us?

615
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,750
-- And they said, don't, don't look at it.
-- Let's use an example.

616
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,489
We can talk about the government, right? I, I've worked for

617
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:59,040
the provincial government once upon a time for six months.

618
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,770
And I, I know lots of people who work for the provincial government

619
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:03,489
and literally

620
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:06,329
like they do jobs where they're paid like 80 or

621
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:08,469
90 grand a year to do something where I'm like,

622
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,479
you know, like you can make that a fillable PDF.

623
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,660
And the best response was, yeah, that's what they did in BC.

624
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:19,300
Like the province next to us has that process like automated.

625
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,599
You have to do it or not. It's not a fillable PDF. You do it through a website, right?

626
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,489
You have to fill out this form on a website.

627
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,280
Whereas in Alberta, like you actually talk to a human being,

628
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,479
but we're paying an ungodly amount of money to

629
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:32,420
type your answer into a computer for you.

630
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:35,300
And, like, this kind of thing is totally common and of course,

631
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,790
you know, is the government ever going to measure that or, or deal with that?

632
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,030
No, of course not. I, my goodness, we can't do that. Right.

633
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,130
Doing these kind of studies is,

634
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,189
-- is actually quite time consuming and expensive and it's
-- hard,

635
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:48,630
it's really hard to do studies like this.

636
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,530
Well, yeah, to get to do it correctly,

637
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,119
you know, to make sure you don't have sample bias,

638
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,229
to make sure you have a big enough sample size and at the same time not to be like, ok,

639
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,699
well, do we need a sample size of 1 million?

640
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,050
Well, crap, we can't do this.

641
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,359
We are basically out of time and I guess

642
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:05,430
here is my closing thought on this matter of everything

643
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,609
is

644
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,449
one of our challenges

645
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:10,790
in the world of security

646
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:11,869
is

647
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,300
our messaging is often too nuanced

648
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,619
and our data

649
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,680
-- is rotten.
-- If we don't have data, let's let's stop pretending.

650
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:21,510
-- But
-- you know what I mean?

651
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,020
This is,

652
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:26,339
this makes for a very difficult position to be in as a security professional.

653
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,040
-- And
-- when we do have data, we ignore it.

654
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:31,189
Like a great example is our passwords, a good strategy. Well,

655
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:31,780
you know,

656
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,755
the website have I been pwned with 10

657
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:35,834
billion records would seem to indicate otherwise.

658
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:38,474
Yeah. Passwords suck. Everyone knows. Passwords suck.

659
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:43,474
-- You know, 10 billion failure scenario examples.
-- But it's hard to change.

660
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:47,844
So it's easier to pretend everything is fine and that is where we are at.

661
00:28:47,854 --> 00:28:52,234
I guess the solution is we just pretend everything's fine. Like the dog in the fire.

662
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:55,055
-- No.
-- Look, this is how progress starts.

663
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:55,675
I mean,

664
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,755
think about medicine

665
00:28:58,449 --> 00:29:02,949
200 years ago, they, they thought people's blood was poison and they would drain it.

666
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:06,800
And it's like now we look at that and think these people are idiots,

667
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,589
but they thought they were doing the best thing and

668
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:12,189
we have people who think they're doing the best thing.

669
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,709
But the, the answer to this is rather than saying, oh, I'm doing my best is to say,

670
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:18,910
let's figure this out

671
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:22,239
and that's what we need people to start doing more of is just saying,

672
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,500
let's figure this out.

673
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,989
And that's,

674
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,790
that's one of the more common and simpler types of things I think we should be doing is

675
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,719
what are we doing? And what is the actual effect of what we're doing?

676
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:34,199
Like, is it effective getting people to do that is essentially impossible.

677
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:39,079
It is not impossible. It is step one. We're still bleeding people to death

678
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:42,040
instead of saying, let's figure this out.

679
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,000
-- So
-- what you're saying is we just need better leeches.

680
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,560
Sure. Maybe.

681
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:47,479
I mean, we've got plenty of those.

682
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:50,609
We got a lot of weasels. Are those useful

683
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:53,390
anyway. So

684
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,949
anyway, all Right. I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt.

685
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,469
Thank you, everyone for listening.

686
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,270
You can go to opens sources, Security podcast.com. Head up the show, not, it's U

687
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,709
Pound Os S podcast. Hashtag do hit us up on social media. Kurt.

688
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,150
-- Have a fantastic rest of your day. You too.
-- Thanks everybody.

689
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,349
There's one thing I'm going to add here at the very end for anyone who made it

690
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,400
this far who's probably nobody because I always skip

691
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,189
the last like 10 seconds of a podcast.

692
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:14,459
But

693
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,609
we're gonna do, I take,

694
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:15,849
I

695
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:19,030
don't know, whatever it doesn't matter. Leave it at the end.

696
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,819
Maybe I could put it at the beginning. I don't know. We'll see what happens.

697
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,670
There was no episode 214.

698
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,949
And at first we were talking about, oh,

699
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:27,650
we'll make a joke about how the government censored us or something.

700
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,369
And I realized, uh,

701
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,449
we live in tumultuous times right now and I don't want to make this joke.

702
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,390
So the reason there's no episode 214 is because I can't count. And that's all like

703
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:38,385
no conspiracy.

704
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:44,234
Just I typed 215 into my system and there was no 214 and I made a mistake.

705
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:46,545
-- I'm,
-- I'm well, I'm fixing. It would have taken like three

706
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:46,785
or four.

707
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:47,645
No, I don't think so though.

708
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:49,625
Because of the way podcast networks work,

709
00:30:49,635 --> 00:30:53,035
I think we would have ended up with episode 214 and episode 215.

710
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:55,234
Both being exactly the same published on their sites.

711
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:57,275
So I thought it's easier to do nothing.

712
00:30:57,285 --> 00:31:00,074
And more importantly, the most important part of this,

713
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,479
I have changed my,

714
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,589
what do I have a process? Yeah.

715
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:05,810
Process sounds good.

716
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:09,829
I have changed my process to make sure I cannot make this mistake again,

717
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,280
which is the most important part of making mistakes is

718
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,250
doing something to make sure it never happens again.

719
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,569
-- So there you go.
-- Root cause failure analysis.

720
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:20,699
That's, that's why planes mostly stay in the air

721
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,339
when they're

722
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:24,489
supposed to. That's all, that's all. Thank you. Maybe I'll put it at the beginning.

723
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:24,930
We'll see

724
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,560
the.
