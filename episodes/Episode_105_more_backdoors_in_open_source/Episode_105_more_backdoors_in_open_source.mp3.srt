Hello and welcome to episode 100 and five

1
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:09,779
of the open source security podcast with myself,

2
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,369
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,680
So I don't think we'll ever stop asking this question or answering it

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,399
is open source software secure.

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,260
Hey,

6
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,479
that would be my answer.

7
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:25,569
The answer is no,

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,450
nothing secure is the right answer. But

9
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:37,169
we bring it up because in the span of what like three days, there were 22 events

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,849
in open source projects

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,529
where there was what our, our clinics had.

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,470
The Adobe Reader had a like back door installed by,

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,569
by some nefarious actor. And then we've got a no Js

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,319
problem

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,240
with the ES Lint package

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,540
that, that installs essentially a credential stealing

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,650
Trojan. I don't know.

18
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,919
That makes sense because I was kind of a glance and I was like,

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,470
but who cares about a virus on a Linux machine?

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,190
I don't get it.

21
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,440
And so that makes more sense. So it's serving the Linux

22
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,669
virus to web clients or

23
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,349
-- sorry, it's erving a virus
-- to

24
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,440
no, no

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:13,910
ES

26
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:14,519
Lint dash

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,680
scope is a tool you run against your projects to,

28
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,739
to give you information about them,

29
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,459
you know, like a lin. Exactly.

30
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,400
And so anyway,

31
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,040
this particular package had

32
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:28,580
a,

33
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:33,709
a basically like malicious code put into steal credentials and send them off to pay

34
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,819
-- from
-- your.

35
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:35,389
Right.

36
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:37,800
So.

37
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,720
Right. Right. And, and it's,

38
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:41,919
this is one of those things that

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:42,980
actually

40
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,160
it is, it's fairly clever

41
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,440
and, and here's the thing,

42
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,330
I hate Linus's law for a variety of reasons.

43
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:54,730
But man, every time this happens in open source, it gets caught in a couple of hours

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,489
and it's actually

45
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,449
there's a really simple solution to this

46
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,050
so related topic, DNS. Uh I did a DNS webinar the other day

47
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:06,330
and one of the guys uh pointed out from a security point of view.

48
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,350
There's almost never a truly legitimate reason that

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,979
a user needs access right away to a newly registered domain.

50
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,470
So like, you know, a newly registered domain blah, blah, blah.com comes online.

51
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,710
Nobody absolutely needs access to it for the first

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,949
few minutes or even hours typically or even days.

53
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:27,160
And so, uh what a lot of these DS security appliances are doing are simply,

54
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,490
you know, looking up the age of the domain and going. Oh, wow.

55
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,220
That's like really fresh. And, you know,

56
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:34,309
I'm going to block access to it for now for like a few hours or days

57
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,899
until

58
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,119
reputation services,

59
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,740
uh get to know it and, or, you know, that just kind of gives it

60
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,779
time for the bad guys if they do,

61
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,500
do something bad with it for them to get caught and hopefully booted.

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,289
Right. And so you're not affected.

63
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:51,500
And I mean, I think that's really because I'm trying to think,

64
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,929
I was trying to think of some legitimate corner case where I would register domain

65
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,509
and then masses of users would need to use it right away.

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,360
And the only thing I could really come up with is like um a telegram, right?

67
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:01,690
Because they've been bouncing through domain names

68
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,020
trying to avoid that Russian block.

69
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:08,050
That that's basically the only legitimate case for something like this.

70
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,039
Yeah. But even then all they have to do is pre

71
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,580
buy

72
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:12,770
domain,

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,139
just buy the domain, sit on it for a week and then use it.

74
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:16,720
Yeah, exactly.

75
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,360
So there, there literally is no legitimate

76
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,520
need for this and

77
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,000
in the context of, of using these open source software libraries.

78
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,520
I, I think this is also true in that

79
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,210
99% of the time,

80
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,449
there's actually really very few reasons to upgrade

81
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,330
to the latest version of a library.

82
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,570
No, I'm not saying you shouldn't upgrade. OK. Let's be clear.

83
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,360
I hate it when people pin versions

84
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,610
and then I end up, you know,

85
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:43,399
getting some piece of software that has like some six year old library

86
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,880
which I now can't update because the new version of the

87
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:49,000
library is so fundamentally different that it like breaks everything.

88
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,279
But here's a thought

89
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,550
maybe, you know, unless that software update has a specific, you know,

90
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,699
security fix or like a bug fix that you really need.

91
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,539
Like, your system is crashing every five minutes,

92
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,199
you know, don't

93
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,089
run the absolute latest, greatest, like, give it a few hours or a few days.

94
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,279
And I was thinking,

95
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,610
are there any dependency managers that allow you to say something?

96
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,970
Like, get me the latest version minus one?

97
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:15,809
I don't think there are

98
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:16,510
any,

99
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:18,170
-- but
-- that'd be kind of a cool feature.

100
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,209
It's not a terrible idea. And, and you're kind of right where,

101
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,399
I mean, there,

102
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,459
there are some updates that fix critical security issues

103
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,559
or critical bugs that you want right away,

104
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,600
but I can count on one hand probably the

105
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:35,399
number of times that's happened pretty much ever,

106
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,679
not, not per year

107
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,640
ever.

108
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,720
And generally speaking,

109
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:44,690
hopefully, you know, when an issue is that bad, whoever's

110
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,269
distributing that software should kind of make a big deal out of it, you know,

111
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,510
put it in a change log.

112
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,640
And also ideally

113
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:52,829
that that should be like the only change for that version, right?

114
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,579
Like, ideally they're, you know, just like, ok, we like,

115
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,579
absolutely need to fix this bug as soon as possible.

116
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,910
So we're only fixing that bug, pushing it out. Boom. Done.

117
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:05,089
Well, I think the, the things you really need to care about,

118
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,489
you, you generally find out about them outside of

119
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,649
the normal communication channels,

120
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,100
right? It's because it's like on Reddit and Twitter and CNN

121
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,559
-- see
-- the downside is like,

122
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:21,200
looking at these dependency managers, there's no easy way to automate this. So,

123
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,829
uh what I encourage and have been encouraging most people to do is, you know, what,

124
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:30,059
just grab the latest and like if it breaks, then deal with it, either downgrade or,

125
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,820
you know, file a bug and get it fixed or what whatever.

126
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,100
But now in light of this, I'm kind of thinking, you know,

127
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:39,850
wouldn't it be awesome to be able to say like give me the latest but one, you know,

128
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,970
and let these other crazy bleeding edge people or, you know,

129
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,420
use the absolute latest in your dev environment, you know,

130
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,940
but not in production maybe.

131
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,239
Yeah, I mean that's fair. Yeah.

132
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,790
-- So
-- for, for those of you, you know, building systems like glider

133
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,339
or rake or whatever, all those dependency managers.

134
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,329
Uh Yeah,

135
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,529
please add this as a future because I would love to see if it

136
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,709
is useful or not and I suspect it might be kind of useful.

137
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:06,489
I think, I think it could be, although you could argue if more people

138
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,450
or rather if the number of people looking at things decreases substantially,

139
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,929
then the the likelihood someone will notice something bad

140
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,420
probably decreases as well. My guess is there's a certain,

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,820
I, I have no doubt there's a correlation between the number of people using a thing

142
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,339
and the, the speed at which

143
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,940
will say problems are found.

144
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,369
-- Well,
-- the other thing to remember is just because a problem is found,

145
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,739
doesn't mean it's properly reported,

146
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,040
right?

147
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:32,529
Like, I've,

148
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,820
I've had people tell me stories about them finding a bug in software and I'm like,

149
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,019
cool.

150
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,040
Did you report it? And they're like, uh, no. And I'm like,

151
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:39,690
you know,

152
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,320
it's like people who complain about potholes but don't phone the city or actually,

153
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,000
in my case,

154
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,730
we have an application

155
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:49,200
for our phone where you, like, take a picture of the pothole.

156
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,450
It asks you, do you want to include the, like your current location?

157
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,130
And you say yes.

158
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,769
And then you hit like,

159
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,609
send and then a few days later the little pothole filling truck comes out,

160
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,829
you know, so like,

161
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:02,600
or it's like the people who complain about politics but never know.

162
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,019
You know,

163
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,720
that's the only reason I felt so I can't complain.

164
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,750
But that, that's my one thought is that, yeah, I mean,

165
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:15,220
I suspect you're right in that the people mature enough and wise

166
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,160
enough to maybe use this are also the people that are,

167
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,480
you know, also hopefully mature enough and wise enough to realize if you find a bug,

168
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,279
the best way to get it fixed is to report it so that it gets fixed, you know,

169
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:26,760
upstream. So you don't have to carry your own patch,

170
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,880
right?

171
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,589
Because like, that's one thing I've, you know, when I deal with devs, I'm like,

172
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,119
you don't want it.

173
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,230
Like, you do not want a monkey with the software unless you absolutely have to.

174
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,369
Right. Unless upstream is refusing to do something that you absolutely need, like

175
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,679
grin and bear it.

176
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,339
Oh, I

177
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,700
have a funny story. I'll tell you many, many years ago.

178
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,809
This was back in the day when people were unsure

179
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,059
if this open source thing was going to catch on.

180
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,570
Right. That's, we're talking like more than 10 years.

181
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,209
I was at this conference and it was just a security show,

182
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,359
like a symposium type thing real small, maybe, maybe 100 people, maybe.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,589
And

184
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:07,910
I was talking about open source security and just kind of how it works, what it means,

185
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,459
who's looking after this stuff.

186
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,950
You know, all, all the usual sort of questions that, that people had back in the day

187
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,109
and there was

188
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,559
a, a developer from a very large organization.

189
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,480
OK?

190
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:22,859
And

191
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,010
I, I remember the topic of contributing patches back came up

192
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:29,369
and he says,

193
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,200
why would I just contribute patches back?

194
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:32,739
And

195
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,058
I

196
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:33,440
looked at

197
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,619
him for a second, I thought

198
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,270
because otherwise you have to take care of it yourself forever.

199
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,289
And he said,

200
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,619
but no, you don't understand. I'm not,

201
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,590
I don't want other people to get this.

202
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm not, it's like paying them that I'm not, I'm not paying these people.

203
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,130
And I'm thinking

204
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,760
you're taking their like literally millions of dollars worth of software,

205
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,000
you're using it for free and you're complaining about paying them with patches.

206
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,500
And it was,

207
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,799
it was one of those instances where I just shook

208
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,799
my head and moved on because there was no way

209
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,880
I was going to have a productive conversation with that person

210
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:06,400
and

211
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,739
man,

212
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,469
-- but anyway, yes, report, report
-- issues.

213
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,400
And the thing to remember folks is

214
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,059
you don't have to fix it.

215
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,979
I mean, it would be nice if you did, that would be super awesome.

216
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:20,140
But more fundamentally like, please report these issues because,

217
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,070
you know, I've seen so many cases where,

218
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,229
you know, some user has a slightly different setup or,

219
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,059
or maybe they have a really big setup that, you know,

220
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,070
the developers can't replicate and you know,

221
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,070
so they'll run into stuff that quote unquote normal people don't, you know,

222
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,250
so yeah, please do contribute bug reports and,

223
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,010
and I hate to say this because I hate bad bug reports,

224
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:42,390
but even a somewhat bad bug report is still better than nothing,

225
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:46,390
right? Because with nothing, it's like completely, why are you all complaining?

226
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:50,500
Right. There's, we got nothing in the bug tracker about this, like, go away.

227
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:53,229
But, but anyway, anyway, that's not the topic today though.

228
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,119
I think, I think it's important to note

229
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:56,510
that

230
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,140
people are noticing the security problem because there have been a handful of

231
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,140
attempted back doors

232
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,900
on what didn't even say attempted, there have been some attempted,

233
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:07,789
some have succeeded.

234
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,559
But I feel like I can't think of any instance

235
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,770
where it lasted for any significant amount of time.

236
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,539
And when we look at like the gen two incident

237
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:18,099
and the GEN two incident was literally half an hour before they,

238
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:19,500
they did something about it.

239
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,260
And then

240
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,099
this, this uh es Lint thing

241
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:25,020
was a couple of hours.

242
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:26,640
I don't know what the ARC ARC

243
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:27,000
lineage

244
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,590
a problem was, how long that took. But regardless, like

245
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,070
this stuff is being noticed.

246
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:33,570
Well,

247
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,940
I think part of it is the reporting channels now are so efficient and effective and

248
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,590
most importantly, most of them are public, right?

249
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,200
Like when you file an issue in github,

250
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,669
not only can the project see it, but like everybody in the world can see it.

251
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,049
That's true. Actually, that's really true.

252
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:51,109
Right? And if you file a juicy bug report, like, hey,

253
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,859
this thing has like a credential stealing Trojan,

254
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:56,270
I think technically is the correct term, not a virus but whatever,

255
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,750
you know, not only are other users and developers going to see that,

256
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,369
but then like somebody from the register is going

257
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,780
to see it and write an article about it.

258
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,580
That's true. That's actually really true. And in fact,

259
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,969
how did I find out about this? Oh, the, the snake guys,

260
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:12,469
uh they, they put a thing on Twitter and that's how I saw this.

261
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:16,989
They had like an emergency update sort of, of notice and like,

262
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,520
that's really cool, you know.

263
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,340
Well, the beauty is, I mean, these things are rare enough that they still get press,

264
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:21,559
right?

265
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:21,909
It's,

266
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:25,299
it's the things that happen like 10 times a day that don't get press,

267
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:25,960
you know.

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,700
And so,

269
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,229
to me that's actually a good sign that people are

270
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,260
still reporting on this because it's rare enough that,

271
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,799
like,

272
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:34,900
yeah, it's literally like, once or twice a month.

273
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,520
Maybe that it happens.

274
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,179
Yeah.

275
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,099
Well, although, although

276
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,059
it used to be once or twice a year. Right. And I feel like it's speeding up.

277
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,200
Well, it's, I think it's part of it is, it's not so much speeding up,

278
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,530
there's just more software and there's more community involvement and

279
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,630
the communities are much bigger and much less trusted than they used to be. Right?

280
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:53,989
Like,

281
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:56,150
I literally remember the day when like,

282
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,030
like when Linus knew all the developers personally

283
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,909
because there was like 50 of them,

284
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,200
you know, I remember like the open BS D camp was like

285
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,309
20 guys

286
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:06,969
still

287
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:07,369
is.

288
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,030
Yeah. You know, I mean,

289
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:10,190
yeah, I mean,

290
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,010
these communities used to be really small and really high trust and now,

291
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,820
you know, we're letting almost anybody in,

292
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,890
which is awesome because we've got so many more developers and so many

293
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,419
more people and so many more viewpoints and different things going on,

294
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:23,010
which is, you know,

295
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,320
ultimately a lot better than just having a bunch of grumpy old people.

296
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:29,239
But at the same time,

297
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,760
no one's hosting their source code out of an FTP site anymore either.

298
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:34,520
Right.

299
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:35,929
And

300
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,299
that's, that's where I think without github,

301
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,010
-- we couldn't exist the way we do today in open source,
-- the ability to clone a project.

302
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,799
It's one command line that takes like five seconds now. And everybody has a machine

303
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:49,359
and more of the,

304
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,760
everybody has a machine fast enough to check out

305
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,280
a couple of 100 megabytes of source code.

306
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:53,969
No problem.

307
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,729
I do remember the days when that was not true.

308
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,719
Those were,

309
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,359
-- those were dark
-- days

310
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,000
when unpacking the Linux Tar ball took, you know,

311
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,539
the better part of 1015 minutes on my machine, let alone,

312
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,309
-- I
-- remember I had a machine once that took three days to build the Linux kernel

313
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,789
three days

314
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,000
anyway. Anyway.

315
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:13,950
But, but here's the thing,

316
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,119
I guess I feel like security is kind of hitching a riot in a lot of these places,

317
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,679
which is really cool though because

318
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,469
I think that the, the security of open source is a really important topic and,

319
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:28,000
and my fear now is we're going to see more and more fear

320
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,580
mongering from some of the closed source people which ironically not Microsoft,

321
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,669
but there, there are some groups I see that,

322
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,320
that talk about this and it's like

323
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,619
you guys, well, not only that, their stuff is full of open source,

324
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,080
they're just pretending it's not.

325
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:46,469
Well, the beauty is it doesn't matter because the economics of it are ok.

326
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,539
You can either write

327
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,840
your own library and

328
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,909
maintain it and carry the cost of that

329
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,280
or you can go download curl or Apache or

330
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,169
no Js Library F

331
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:58,369
and

332
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:58,969
and

333
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:03,609
-- have it up and running in like, 10 minutes.
-- I think it's more esoteric than that.

334
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:05,549
The, the thing I'm seeing is

335
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:11,140
there are companies that will, I don't want to name any names because, like,

336
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,919
if they're doing this, they're also probably the sue

337
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,520
type.

338
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,239
Right. I don't need to be sued.

339
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:18,750
But there's companies basically saying, you know, this,

340
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,049
this alternative product is either open source or uses open source.

341
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,479
Like our product doesn't, even though, um,

342
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,000
in one instance I did do some research and yeah,

343
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,849
they have an open source page and it's full anyway.

344
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:31,429
They say like our,

345
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,965
the product is an open source and it's much more secure because of these reasons.

346
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:35,604
And it's like,

347
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:39,065
-- well, you're full of crap and everything you just said is,
-- well,

348
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,445
the beauty is that they'll probably be proven wrong.

349
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:43,645
And economically they're, you know, like,

350
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:45,905
remember when IBM had their own web server and

351
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:47,705
then they gave up and started shipping Apache,

352
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:49,140
right?

353
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,780
Everyone had their own web server, man.

354
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, not only that, I guess you're, you're probably right because I mean,

355
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,049
Microsoft couldn't get away with this.

356
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,109
They lost at the end of the day. And they, they luckily saw the light,

357
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:01,450
-- oh
-- I on,

358
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,049
on the CV board called the Microsoft person flat out said because I was

359
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,780
asking obviously about open source and Microsoft

360
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:07,960
and how that's going to get handled,

361
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:08,359
you know,

362
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,690
and, um, like she flat out said that you know, it's, it's not from on high,

363
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,590
it's from the CEO, like,

364
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,530
use open source,

365
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,099
you know, the Reddit A MA they talked about having 60,000 developers at Microsoft

366
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,140
doing stuff related to open source. Like,

367
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,510
no. Yeah, that's just how it is now. Like everything is TCP/IP networking,

368
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,309
everything will be encrypted,

369
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,109
everything's open source, everything runs on electricity. Like that's just,

370
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,869
that's, you know.

371
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,679
Right. We don't drink toilet water, we drink from the tap.

372
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,150
It's the same water but, you know,

373
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,419
like it's just held with the same water.

374
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,900
But yeah, I mean, that's just,

375
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,659
-- that's just how it is. Right?
-- Ok. Ok. So you, you've got me thinking now,

376
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,869
let's assume

377
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:56,830
the, let's say you've got a dirt

378
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,510
company talking about open source is insecure and they're,

379
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,150
they're probably only going to trick a couple of people, but let's face it.

380
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,929
I, I have a suspicion at this point.

381
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,140
-- Well, they'll
-- be able to find specific instances where it is

382
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:07,799
a

383
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,710
problem.

384
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,270
But statistically on the average,

385
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,989
I would put a large amount of money that it's

386
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,549
as good if not better than most

387
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,809
qualifying that most closed source,

388
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,159
there are a handful of close source things that I know

389
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,289
that are actually quite secure,

390
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:25,330
but these tend to be very small things that do a very specific job

391
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:28,059
-- and are not widely different.
-- That's different.

392
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:31,270
Ok. So, so let's, let's think about this. Now,

393
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:34,729
everyone has accepted the fact that open source is basically

394
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,409
the same as everything else.

395
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:40,450
I'm not going to say more secure because it's not, and I don't think it is.

396
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,859
Everyone's basically using it and there's no way you're gonna stop it now.

397
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,750
So, even when there are security problems, like we're looking at right now,

398
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,070
it, it doesn't matter

399
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:53,059
-- really. It's, people are still going to
-- use

400
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:54,030
what, what

401
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,219
in theory might matter is. Ok. How fast does open source patch this stuff?

402
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:59,849
They patch it pretty quick in general? Cool. So that results in sort of

403
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,150
software churn where you have to like get on this upgrade train and it,

404
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,719
that costs money, right? Like,

405
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,510
you know, I remember the olden days where apps were updated like once a year

406
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,930
on CD, right? No, like you

407
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:11,660
and,

408
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,829
and here's the thing like that software churn has become

409
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,489
part of the process for anybody building decent software because,

410
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,920
you know, customers are like, I want this feature.

411
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,979
If you don't get me this feature in two weeks, I'm going to, you know,

412
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:24,060
cancel this test and go with your competitor,

413
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:25,648
right? So,

414
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:26,249
so that,

415
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:30,458
that cost of software churn is kind of built into building software now because

416
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:31,619
well,

417
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:34,088
customers expect bugs and stuff to be fixed

418
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:36,928
quickly and new features to be added quickly,

419
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:39,438
you know, especially if your competitors have that feature, you,

420
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:41,418
you better get that feature out quickly.

421
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:46,109
And so I think one of the main downsides to this, which is that software turn

422
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:50,769
is, is essentially ok now because it's a cost you have to carry anyways,

423
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,479
you know.

424
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,290
Yes, I do think you might be correct

425
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,729
thinking about this.

426
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:00,209
It's, it's just the way it is now, isn't it?

427
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:06,449
But ok, so, so let's take all this together. Then. We've got the, the churn aspect.

428
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,930
We expect a lot of updates. Where,

429
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,680
how does

430
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,109
is there? I guess, I guess let's answer his question then.

431
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,420
Is there a way to stop things like people

432
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:21,069
checking in malicious code either because they're a dev gone

433
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,180
rogue or they've stolen credentials from the DEV, I mean,

434
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,930
in theory we would have code reviews but I mean, I,

435
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,500
you know,

436
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,859
by the 4/100 code review that week your eyes are going to start to glaze over.

437
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,699
Um,

438
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,890
yeah, that one, I don't, I don't think humans, well,

439
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,520
not only that you've seen the underhand,

440
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,780
right? I mean, there's people that,

441
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,170
that some cool

442
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,609
off by ones are always my favorite because like in hindsight. Oh, yeah. Whoops.

443
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:45,199
Wow, that's like really obvious.

444
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,719
But, you know, obviously it wasn't at the time where they wouldn't have done it.

445
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,119
And so I, I think fundamentally,

446
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,839
I mean, and, and in a way, code,

447
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,739
like when somebody spots this after the fact and says, well,

448
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,099
that's a bad chunk of code, you better remove it.

449
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,160
I mean, that is a code review.

450
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,239
It's just, well after the fact before it got formally accepted

451
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,280
and it's this also kind of speaks to the economics of it, of,

452
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,750
you know,

453
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,300
code reviewing and properly vetting every single submission.

454
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,920
That's actually quite expensive. Right.

455
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,829
If you think about a human being's time,

456
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,089
if it's going to take a human being half an hour of time,

457
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,959
that means if you had a human being doing this full time, they could do.

458
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:23,640
Like, what is that? Like, 16 code reviews per day.

459
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,750
Right. A

460
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:28,520
lot of these projects, we're talking like 16 commits an hour

461
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,609
or more.

462
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,760
Yeah, there's no way. Well, not only that, it's,

463
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,260
there was a study done about, like,

464
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,290
auditing software and basically after one hour of looking for bugs,

465
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:41,500
you're done for the day.

466
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:46,709
-- So really people can review two code commits per day, not six.
-- And then

467
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,280
the thing too is, is that, you know, kind of once I'm using this code,

468
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,839
I actually do have more incentive

469
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,689
to review that commit because I'm now using it. Right.

470
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:59,839
Whereas if I'm a user of the software, I, why would I do code commits?

471
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:03,099
Because that software is not like that commit isn't in the software yet.

472
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,630
It doesn't, it's not my problem yet.

473
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,069
So, unless it's like a bug I really care about,

474
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:10,449
you know, unless it's a bug or a feature, I'm really like, damn it,

475
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,270
I need this fixed because like, production crashes every 27 minutes.

476
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,640
Um, you know, I, I'm not going to care about somebody else's commits.

477
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,719
Right. And that's just fundamentally, you know, why am I going to expend

478
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,479
time and effort on something I don't really care about. And so,

479
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,000
you know, once it makes it in

480
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:28,339
and so, I mean, a lot of projects do this, right?

481
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:31,719
They'll have like the stable version and the DEV version, you know,

482
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:35,400
um or the LTs long term support version and then the more

483
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,890
kind of quickly moving version, right?

484
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,719
You know, like Jenkins is a great example of it, right?

485
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:42,089
Like they have their current version which gets like,

486
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,900
holy heck, you read those release announcements, like they're,

487
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,699
they're doing a lot of work all the time

488
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:50,369
and then you've got your boring LTs version, which is kind of frozen

489
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:51,569
ish in time and gets like

490
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:55,280
really critical updates and stuff, but it is kind of boring and stable. And then

491
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:57,829
the thing is you use that LTs version for one

492
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,079
or two years and chances are you're gonna be like,

493
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,829
well, this thing is terrible because it's missing all these features now and you,

494
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,000
you know, upgrade to the next one

495
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,489
and, you know, for some people that's fine, right? They can like, you know, they can,

496
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,199
they're fine with that one or two year kind of upgrade cycle and then,

497
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,040
you know, you've got all these start ups where they're like, yeah, we're,

498
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,439
we're going fast and, you know, hard

499
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:19,560
and I, I think that's kind of the best of both worlds, right?

500
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,619
Because there's a lot of enterprise type software where you

501
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,400
don't really need to be on the bleeding edge.

502
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,209
Like if it's, you know,

503
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:27,199
an accounting system or controlling the plumbing of a large building.

504
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,800
Yeah, you, you can be a few days or months out of date.

505
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,680
-- Generally speaking. That's ok.
-- Right.

506
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,199
Right. Right.

507
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:36,609
Interesting.

508
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:39,520
-- But, yeah, as to this,
-- I think you,

509
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,209
I suspect part of it too is you gotta remember there's a lot

510
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,189
of people working on automation tools to find this kind of stuff,

511
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,000
you know, I mean, my, my favorite example is the guy that wrote that

512
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,449
piece of code that

513
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,140
uh it

514
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,000
looked for passwords in source code.

515
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:56,599
But the way it looked for passwords was by looking at the entropy of the strings,

516
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:56,719
right?

517
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:59,520
Because in theory, good passwords will have a high degree of entropy, right?

518
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,660
They'll be very random.

519
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,920
So, well, it's, it's so that's called Truffle

520
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:04,489
Hog.

521
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,000
-- Yeah. Truffle Hog. That's the one
-- and I,

522
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,869
I've, I've,

523
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:12,790
I've run it more than once and it does a lot more than just entropy now.

524
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,859
They have certain regular expression. So the problem being

525
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,189
looking for just entropy, in fact,

526
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,000
I know this because I did some research when I

527
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,060
was looking to see if uh backdoors have more entropy

528
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,209
than, than regular code.

529
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,180
And, and anyway, uh

530
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:31,530
so the, the problem being that

531
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:35,810
looking at just entropy has a very, very, very high false positive rate.

532
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:36,489
And so, in fact,

533
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,369
I think they turn off entropy by default

534
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,079
-- now and they only use a regular expressions
-- and

535
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,349
that's

536
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:41,630
a

537
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,930
good point is that they made it better,

538
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,290
they made it less false positive and more

539
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,510
correct.

540
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,229
And,

541
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,849
and that's how software works.

542
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,800
Right. That's the beauty of software is

543
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,030
generally speaking outside of a few terrible projects. Software gets better.

544
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,630
It almost never gets worse. Right?

545
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,010
Because by definition, if you start making your software worse,

546
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:02,469
nobody's going to use it.

547
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:05,270
Right?

548
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,430
And like, no sane rational developer actually wants to do that, right.

549
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:11,310
Most of these people actually want to make stuff that's good and useful.

550
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,859
You know, that's a very fundamental human desire.

551
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:17,829
So that's the beauty to me of software. Like when I look at, you know, like I'm using,

552
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,869
I've been using some software packages now for over 20 years,

553
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,699
like emacs Apache http D you know,

554
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,040
wait, you're an emacs user,

555
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,300
you seem so

556
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:33,119
uh I do know V I because it's on every system but who cares anymore?

557
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,449
Emacs is on every system,

558
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,810
not mine.

559
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,229
But uh

560
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:40,699
no, I mean, the the thing is basically, you know, when I look at all this software,

561
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:42,310
the stuff that's died is the stuff that didn't

562
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,369
get better or didn't get better fast enough,

563
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,750
right?

564
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,010
And all the stuff that has survived by definition is

565
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,040
like pretty awesome. Like, you know, you look at the capability of

566
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:51,609
like this.

567
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:55,869
I Yeah.

568
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,089
No,

569
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,300
when I think about the default software stack

570
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,810
and operating system typically gives you now,

571
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:00,910
plus what you can get for free.

572
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,530
It's like

573
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,290
that stuff used to cost millions of dollars.

574
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,449
So, you know, you know what I'm, I'm thinking about here now is

575
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,760
maybe

576
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:12,949
we're never going to fix the problem

577
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,569
because if you look at it

578
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:20,729
right, that's exactly it. It's, well, no, it's not good enough. It's getting better

579
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,530
but it's getting better in a boil of frog sort of way

580
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:27,770
where we're just not noticing it getting better.

581
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:30,729
But it is. And, and I feel like

582
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,250
things like

583
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,839
malicious code inserted into open source projects now that open source is kind of

584
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,250
come into its place in the world and it won.

585
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,930
I have a suspicion that's one of the next hills we need to climb because I mean,

586
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:48,280
by definition, security always lags reality

587
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,689
because it just has to, that's the way it works.

588
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,449
And this is our next challenge and I have a suspicion it's going to get solved,

589
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,439
but it's not going to get solved in the ways we think it is where I have a feeling,

590
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:01,319
things like

591
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:04,589
the scanning tools are what are going to solve the problem,

592
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,979
not reviewing everything

593
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,339
into a project. There's already

594
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:11,349
like there's already a huge market for these companies,

595
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:15,300
but, you know, look at the source code you're generating and,

596
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,930
or pulling in from other places and basically say, you know, like, ok,

597
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,719
this has known flaws or this has suspicious

598
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,579
flaws or this has really suspicious code,

599
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,099
you know, and you can wrap business rules around it, like,

600
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,619
deploy it or don't deploy it.

601
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:31,099
And so those companies have a huge incentive to,

602
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,160
you know, squash their competition by coming out with like,

603
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:37,119
something, a major thing in magic, like an A I

604
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,880
security flaw finder. I don't know. Right.

605
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:41,579
I'm sure they're working on it.

606
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,290
And so to me the beauty is there's economic

607
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,239
incentives here to solve the problem to solve it.

608
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:46,660
Well,

609
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:50,489
so I'm becoming sort of a market proponent in this way and that I'm,

610
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,170
I'm kind of not really worried about it anymore because

611
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,569
to put it bluntly, there's like gold in them, there,

612
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,250
hills and people are going to go find it.

613
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,910
Well, some of them will, I mean, this is

614
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,979
what I think we were arguing about this just the other day and flak or something

615
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,130
or, or signal

616
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,060
where there are,

617
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,969
there, sometimes market incentives will exist.

618
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,449
And I think for like an enterprise, it's going to be there.

619
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,760
But if we, if we talk about our iot light bulbs,

620
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,619
I don't think there's ever going to be a

621
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,449
market incentive for security of iot light bulbs.

622
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:23,130
And it is conceivable. It will never.

623
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,130
So, so in that case, if there's no market incentive,

624
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,449
it's, it's all about regulation

625
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,839
and it is conceivable that no one will ever care enough to regulate them either.

626
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,060
And so we're just going to live in a

627
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:37,119
world where like IOT light bulbs are completely terrible

628
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:38,719
and that's just the way it is.

629
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:42,530
-- No,
-- I suspect for the cheap stuff, regulation will have to be part of it.

630
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,520
Like, every time I buy screws and nails at Home Depot, I'm like, man, I, I, like,

631
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,579
I hope these are made out of the right metal and not like plaster.

632
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:51,119
Like, I don't know. Right.

633
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,050
-- I have never once thought that, you know, like,
-- when I'm buying construction

634
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,119
shoes

635
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,380
and up

636
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,099
-- to 50
-- pounds, I'm like,

637
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,319
I hope so.

638
00:26:59,250 --> 00:26:59,709
Right.

639
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,890
Do you know, I never even look at that.

640
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,150
I couldn't tell you what any of the screws I have in the garage are rated for,

641
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:05,520
like,

642
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:05,680
I

643
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:07,329
don't know.

644
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,790
So then it kind of matters.

645
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,310
You just put in a lot of,

646
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:13,319
yeah, true.

647
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,300
But, um,

648
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:17,869
but yeah, so, I mean, you know, and on the flip side too there's been a lot, like,

649
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,130
cars were horrifically insanely dangerous until,

650
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,800
you know, public perception changed.

651
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,219
And now there's even car companies like Volvo, that market based on safety.

652
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:27,760
So,

653
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,260
and now they're only most. Exactly.

654
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:34,479
And so I, I suspect with IOT light bulbs that, yeah, it's going to take a long

655
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:37,569
time comparatively to the life cycle of these iot

656
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:39,849
bulbs and companies for it to catch up.

657
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,969
But again, um,

658
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,189
the flip side

659
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:43,589
is, I

660
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:43,939
don't know

661
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:44,209
if it

662
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:44,510
will.

663
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,859
And that's, that's my next comment is

664
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,189
I'm, I'm not sure it's going to be really a problem.

665
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:51,810
Right.

666
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:52,569
Right.

667
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,780
Maybe my light bulbs, mine Bitcoin

668
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:56,890
and maybe

669
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:57,989
they don't. Who

670
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,459
knows?

671
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:00,380
But, uh,

672
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:05,290
yeah. No, I, I think open source obviously has one. It's here to stay.

673
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,189
You know, even, I remember like 20 years ago Microsoft trying to, you know,

674
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:08,989
it's a cancer.

675
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,109
It's the Halloween memos and all that.

676
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,030
And even Microsoft

677
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:18,829
-- is rational enough to realize that. Ok. No, that, that war
-- is over, it's over.

678
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:22,920
I know, man, I used to argue with them so much. It was,

679
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:24,989
I guess you're right. That's,

680
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,660
that's the right way to look at this is,

681
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,390
it's not even argument anymore. And if anyone, it's like

682
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,400
people

683
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,510
-- to even
-- say it's straight up like flat earth people, it's like, no,

684
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,089
that's just not how reality is.

685
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,729
That's exactly what it is. Right. You, you're either, you're either trolling me

686
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:47,579
or you probably have some sort of disconnection from reality that that needs

687
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,380
help. I can't give you right. And that's basically the same sort of thing here with

688
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:55,500
is open source security. You're either trolling me and you know it

689
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:58,829
or you probably need like professional help.

690
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:02,680
-- Those are, those are my guess the two options we're looking at
-- pretty much.

691
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:04,270
I like that. That's,

692
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,000
and more to the point I would say the

693
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,959
question itself is even wrong because like is any software

694
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,099
secure? Is any hardware

695
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,459
business

696
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,880
process secure? The answer is

697
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,959
no, but most of them are good enough,

698
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,420
right?

699
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:19,910
In fact,

700
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,349
it's funny you say that because my kids for

701
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,349
some reason were talking about bank robberies the other day

702
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,250
and I explained to them why bank robberies today

703
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,349
aren't possible because of course they were talking about,

704
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:33,010
you know, wild west cowboy style bank robberies

705
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:37,589
and I explained to them like, just, just the security things I know about banks.

706
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,369
And I said there's plenty more they have that

707
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,709
I don't know about because they don't do people

708
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,489
and my kids were like, this is crazy.

709
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,660
And I said, see this is, but at the same time,

710
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,219
banks have money like they have real tangible loss if, if they get robbed.

711
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,699
-- So they have incentive to
-- fix.

712
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,979
They're insured

713
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:59,109
to a degree. If you get robbed every day for two years, no one's going to insure you.

714
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,229
Oh,

715
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,189
your insurer is going to drop you. Yeah.

716
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,869
But I mean, recently we had, uh, what was this like two weeks ago?

717
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,160
Alberta RC MP is, ah, jeez, this is terribly written.

718
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,219
Are asking for the public's help to identify two

719
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:11,729
armed men who robbed the Saint Albert bank.

720
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:12,469
Saturday morning.

721
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,660
Uh, police were called to the C I BC, blah, blah, blah.

722
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:17,949
But here's the fun thing. Ok.

723
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,500
One of the men held a black handgun and

724
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,670
demanded the staff hand over money from the tills.

725
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,910
The two men fled the area with an undisclosed

726
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,130
amount of cash and here's the funny part,

727
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,650
one of them fled on foot and the other one and rode away on a bicycle

728
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,479
and they still haven't caught these

729
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,489
and they got away though. I mean,

730
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,099
good for them.

731
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:35,319
But more fundamentally, like,

732
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:37,589
I know how much money they keep in the tills at these banks now.

733
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,209
And it's like,

734
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,349
not a lot. It's not a of

735
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:41,619
money.

736
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:41,920
It's,

737
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,979
yeah, it's not, it's not worth robbing banks. Like, go get a job, jobs are better

738
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,589
and you don't go to jail

739
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:53,719
anyway. Anyway. All right, man, I think we should call it.

740
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:57,000
So I guess we're going to end it with open source is totally

741
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,160
not insecure. We'll say I'm not going to call it Secure.

742
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,310
It, it's not insecure at

743
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,229
the

744
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,479
same time. Anyone who asked that question

745
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,530
large and varied like

746
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:09,989
that's true.

747
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:13,430
It's the same deal. So there we have it. We, we, we figured it out.

748
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:19,060
The problem isn't people asking is open source secure. The problem is people

749
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:19,709
again.

750
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,689
