Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:11,939
episode 140 with myself and this other guy.

2
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:12,960
What, now,

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,840
what's the deal with that intro? Who are you?

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,760
I wonder that a lot prove to me that you're Josh

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,940
Reser. Uh How about you? Prove to me you're Kurt

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,229
Siefried.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,239
I can't,

8
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,280
I, you know, you want to know a funny thing.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,540
I, I can't spell your last name still.

10
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:29,950
We've been doing this podcast for how many years and I still have to look up how

11
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:33,919
to spell your last name just to give you an idea of how a difficult identity is.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,180
Well, in fairness, I, I do have to check if your last name has that last s or not.

13
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,259
It does. And I am quite often referred to as Josh Bresser,

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,319
which is what

15
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:43,470
I

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,720
called

17
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:45,330
anyway.

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,659
Anyway, so for those of you listening,

19
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:51,979
we're going to spend some time talking about identity today

20
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:57,490
and we're also going to kind of use it in the context of good enough security.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,330
And

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,810
I'm gonna, I'll, I'll kind of

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,610
think of a sliding scale in your mind where there's no security on one end.

24
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,610
There's perfect security on the other end. Perfect security.

25
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,370
It basically just wraps around no security because it's impossible.

26
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,209
And then there's, we'll say a security theater and there's

27
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,489
enough security.

28
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,010
Maybe security is on a sliding scale. But it's like a Mobius strip.

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,419
It's a Mobius strip. I like that. Yes.

30
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:24,379
That's right. That's right. It, it, man, that,

31
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,449
no, I'm not going to go down that red hole,

32
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,069
but I don't think you're wrong anyway anyway.

33
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,589
And, and the kind of the, the thinking being

34
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:32,309
that the,

35
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,720
the reason this all comes up is Kurt and I

36
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,830
talk a lot about just security in general and obviously there

37
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:41,269
is the kind of traditional way of looking at security

38
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,010
of it has to be perfect if it's not perfect,

39
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,510
you might as well not do it, which means you just don't do it usually.

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,269
And you look at many of the things happening today

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,330
and

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:50,970
there's,

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,879
there's kind of a level I'd call good enough

44
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,529
and in some places we're getting better at that.

45
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,089
Like, I think password security is getting there where you look at the N

46
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,669
Guidance and I think it's approaching good enough

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,930
versus it was just like crazy before.

48
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,489
Right.

49
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,639
Well, I,

50
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,000
I think a better example of good enough

51
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,849
security are mechanical locks on like your house.

52
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:09,380
Yeah, that's a perfect example actually because

53
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:13,604
like the lock picking lawyer can get through those in about 10 seconds, 20 seconds.

54
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:16,324
Anyone who's ever picked a lock before can get

55
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:18,115
through most of those in less than a minute.

56
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:21,565
The locks on our houses are terrible.

57
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,494
This is one of the reasons I got a ring doorbell is at

58
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:26,554
least now I have video to show the police and my insurance adjuster

59
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,285
that, that is fair. That's true.

60
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,139
And, and again though, that's,

61
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,000
I would say, you know, from kind of just the context of security,

62
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,080
that's what we'd call a compensating control.

63
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:40,440
Right. You know, that you have this other security control that is

64
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,660
insufficient,

65
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,979
but you have a secondary thing

66
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,089
that will

67
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:50,070
not so much fix the first one, but at least make your life easier in the event.

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,660
The first one fails. Right.

69
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,039
Well, it's a classic case of, I've chosen to accept the risk. I'm insured.

70
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,360
You know, I have house insurance

71
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:58,389
like most people

72
00:02:58,809 --> 00:02:59,639
and, um,

73
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,190
because realistically

74
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,759
I could put on, you know, a $500 door lock on my door.

75
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,050
Um, but then I'd have to like what break over all my windows.

76
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,970
It, exactly. Exactly. It, for what it's worth.

77
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,250
It's kind of one of those situations where just having

78
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,949
a regular door lock is going to be good and,

79
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:20,600
and it's going to stop the vast majority of just simple opportunistic crime.

80
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,000
And what was surprising to me is I was,

81
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:26,360
I was binge watching some firefighting videos on forced entry into buildings

82
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,679
and there was a really fascinating set on forced entry through walls.

83
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,149
So, like where you just go through a wall

84
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,270
and the techniques to go through different kinds of

85
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:38,270
walls and things like how you avoid cutting power lines

86
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:41,009
because, you know, walls contain power lines,

87
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,789
right. Yep, wiring and stuff.

88
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,119
And, and, but more to the point like with manual tools,

89
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,720
so not even with like air tools or pneumatic tools,

90
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,789
these guys were like bashing their way through walls in under five minutes.

91
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,350
I totally believe that,

92
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:53,830
you know,

93
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,350
and how many industrial areas and whatnot have places where

94
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,919
you can make a ruckus at two in the morning

95
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:00,649
and nobody will notice or care physical security cracks because

96
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,990
fundamentally somebody with a sledgehammer can get into the building.

97
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,539
Right. Right.

98
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,589
Yeah. I mean, and you think most houses

99
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,259
in North America

100
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,539
are built with,

101
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,589
with wood and plywood and they don't even use plywood on some of them anymore,

102
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,779
at least in the US.

103
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,720
Yeah. They, it's, it's really shady.

104
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,579
They use like a, it's a, like an insulation board kind of, and it's,

105
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,920
you could easily get through it with a hammer.

106
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,640
00, that synthetic stuff.

107
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah. Right. Right.

108
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,279
And so what happens is if you wanted to get in, I bet, like,

109
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,869
34 whack with a sledgehammer and there's a hole or just bring your

110
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,839
saws all which by the way is my second favorite tool in the world

111
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,950
because it saws everything just like it says.

112
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,670
What's your, what's your first favorite tool in the world my crowbar. Ok.

113
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,339
That's fair

114
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,750
because honestly trying to do something that needs

115
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,429
a crowbar without a crowbar is impossible.

116
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,029
And a crowbar makes it easy. That is true.

117
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,709
And it's just such a great, simple tool, like leverage.

118
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,309
Right. Who knew physics class was? Right. Right. Half life too.

119
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,070
And you can bash your head crab in with it. So. Exactly. Right.

120
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,429
It's good for everybody and they're cheap and they never break,

121
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,700
they never run out of battery.

122
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,899
It just works

123
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:12,239
right now. Think about it. Right. It is true. It's a great tool.

124
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:14,440
Can you imagine life before crowbars,

125
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:17,579
I would bet you crowbars were probably the second

126
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:21,059
or third tool ever created after a rock,

127
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,019
used to bang things.

128
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,250
Well, crowbar is much better than stick.

129
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,440
But anyway, back to good enough security and identity. So,

130
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,299
yeah, because I, I've had this thought before is like, how,

131
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,100
how do I prove?

132
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:39,109
I'm me and outside of, I think some very constrained cases, like, for example,

133
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:43,920
I just flew to the US and back and I have a nexus and to get my nexus, I had to go to

134
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,140
not the TS A, the, the DH S

135
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,000
office here at the airport.

136
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,170
On the Canadian side,

137
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:53,200
you get a retinal scan and on the US side they take your fingerprints,

138
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,380
all five fingers on one of your hands or both hands. I thought

139
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,089
I, I seem to remember doing both hands. Did they do? They might have done both.

140
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,619
I, I had to get it done when I got my TS a precheck. And

141
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,260
yeah, I think they did do both hands now that you say that I'm remembering

142
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,170
not just that, but I also had to bring photo ID, you know, passport blah, blah, blah.

143
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,989
And I was just thinking like outside of a

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,739
situation where like a border agent has access to those

145
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,809
back end systems to actually make sure my fingerprints

146
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,940
and or retinal scan match up with this record.

147
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,420
And you know, I look like me the photo in the thing

148
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,579
outside of that very specific case,

149
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:29,510
it's very hard for somebody who's like checking my documents or whatever

150
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,369
to actually with 100% guaranteed certainty know that I am me.

151
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:37,299
I have a hilarious story for you about this.

152
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:41,350
So a long time ago, my wife worked for a company

153
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:42,980
that employed

154
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,000
it. Kind of anyone they could get to work in a warehouse, right?

155
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,500
And as part of that,

156
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,579
they would always photocopy the I DS that people brought into them.

157
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:53,109
Oh Lord.

158
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,700
And one day they photocopy an ID and it has a void written all over it.

159
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,290
They're like, what is this?

160
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,790
And

161
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,320
one of the other managers looked at it and said, oh, that's a real one.

162
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,559
And they said, wait, what?

163
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,609
He's like, yeah, the ones that don't say void, those are all fake I DS.

164
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,399
So they're like what?

165
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:15,519
And they were basically were these driver's licenses. A government ID, right.

166
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,079
Which is meant to prove citizenship. So you could get paid.

167
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,959
And so it was clear these were essentially illegal.

168
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,869
You know, people had, had fake I DS and were using it to get jobs and

169
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,959
it's like, holy cow. That is crazy because that's one thing in Canada.

170
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,690
It's interesting to me is,

171
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,760
is we have basically really two choices for identification

172
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:39,170
day to day. It's, you get a driver's license and if you can't get a driver's license,

173
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,584
you can get uh like a, a citizen ID card.

174
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:44,445
And what's interesting is you can't have both.

175
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:47,454
If you have a driver's license, you're not allowed to get a citizen ID.

176
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:52,045
That seems fair though because that way you only have one ID card at a time.

177
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:55,105
Yeah, I guess I don't really see the point of that

178
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,674
because here's the thing, whenever I renew my license,

179
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:59,334
I get that wonky piece of you get like a

180
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,434
little strip of paper with your name printed on it

181
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,244
saying that this is now your ID.

182
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,329
It's like literally like, it's, it's a tear off sheet from an 8.5 by 11 sheet form.

183
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:10,859
And it's only good for like a month and then they

184
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:13,859
send you a real card and then that's what you use.

185
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:15,040
And, but here,

186
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:18,619
so here's where we need to bring this back to the concept of good enough security,

187
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,579
especially in the context of identity

188
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,799
is if you have one of those cards,

189
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:26,570
the bar is fairly high and in most instances you're ok

190
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,299
and you're, you know what I mean?

191
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,640
It's good enough. The problem I found is that

192
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,308
how do I validate an Alberta driver's license? Let alone, how do I validate?

193
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,630
Um, you're in Wisconsin,

194
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,210
right.

195
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,320
I can't, I can't even spell Wisconsin.

196
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,510
So if you presented me a fake ID,

197
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:47,239
I, I would have to like double check that the state name is spelled correctly.

198
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:51,458
And here's the question for you though is what do you need it for?

199
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:53,979
Right? Why, why do you need my ID?

200
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:55,638
Well, for example,

201
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:58,098
I'm now getting involved in a thing where we're essentially

202
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:01,648
providing some identity management to people so that they can

203
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:04,028
associate and claim

204
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:08,169
certifications and activities with their identity with their name.

205
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,258
And so what we found is interesting is

206
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,039
identity is essentially a story,

207
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,090
right? You're born, you live, you die. And throughout that time period,

208
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,450
um things happen to your identity, for example,

209
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,729
maybe you get married and your name changes or maybe

210
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,590
you legally change your name because you don't like it

211
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:28,729
or

212
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,849
you decide, for example, I don't have my middle name on any of my ID,

213
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,570
right? I just,

214
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,780
I never really kind of understood what middle names were for.

215
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,869
I was like, is it a spare in case I

216
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,549
lose my first name?

217
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:42,989
I don't really get it either.

218
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,229
It's very strange.

219
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,890
Ok, so I'm not the only one. Yeah.

220
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,750
And then some people have multiple middle names and

221
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,270
some people don't have a middle name and,

222
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,780
yeah, like Elvis Dumbledore.

223
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,950
What? Uh, so in, in Harry Potter, Elvis Dumbledore's name is extremely long.

224
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,570
His middle name, he has like,

225
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,140
six middle names and I don't remember them all at the top of my head.

226
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,419
Which,

227
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,460
which I'm shameful for not remembering as I've read those books like 100 times.

228
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:04,739
But

229
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,640
uh

230
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:06,190
yeah,

231
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,859
it's, it's very cool and I know a handful of people with, with multiple middle names.

232
00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:11,580
Yeah.

233
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,530
Well, and there are people with no first name, no, last name,

234
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:17,239
people who are a single letter, all sorts of shenanigans,

235
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,780
the artist formerly known as Prince.

236
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,960
Yeah. Or the, what was it? The ANC symbol I believe, I don't know.

237
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,919
And there's also things where, for example, my Reddit account or my

238
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,440
email address is that part of my identity? Uh Yes, it is now.

239
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,700
Well, it's part of my identity at that time, but for example,

240
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:40,094
I used to work for Red Hat and I was KC free at Red hat.com.

241
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:43,315
Well, what happens when they hire, hire Carl Siefried?

242
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:46,585
That's a great question and give him KC free at Red hat.com.

243
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,835
So I, I don't know what they do for that.

244
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:49,054
Well,

245
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,994
let's assume that they recycle email addresses

246
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,414
and that's something to point out is that

247
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:53,275
I,

248
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,385
we, we always, it's funny that we always make the assumption that like your name.

249
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,755
John Smith is not necessarily unique

250
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:02,424
and that even your name and date of birth

251
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:05,645
and place of birth may not be necessarily unique.

252
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,359
You know,

253
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,510
I'm guessing at some point in history,

254
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,250
two John Smiths were both born on the same day in New York City or some other big city.

255
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,840
I would be shocked if they weren't. So actually funny enough, you say this is when,

256
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,789
when, when I worked at Red Hat is

257
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,200
there were two people named Matt Smith,

258
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,210
I would have to talk to on a regular basis and I remember one of them

259
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:25,760
jokingly told me one day was,

260
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,919
he said this is the first company I've worked at where there were only two Matt Smith.

261
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,500
That's

262
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,320
terrible.

263
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,909
But I get it. I mean,

264
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:35,655
it's how it is.

265
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:35,854
I mean,

266
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:38,635
that's where I think you and I are spoiled because I think

267
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:41,304
we're the only people with our names that we know of.

268
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:42,315
No, there's another Kurtz

269
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:45,804
seafood. There are four curtsy foods in the world and we all work in it.

270
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,265
Oh, that's great. I guess you're the only one I ever run across then.

271
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,104
And we all roughly

272
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:52,385
look like

273
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:57,400
the same basically. Are you the same person? Are you just doing seven jobs?

274
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,989
And no one of them is German,

275
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,429
one of them is in America and the other one is also in America.

276
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,000
So I see. I see.

277
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,630
Well, then lucky for me,

278
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,599
I'm pretty sure I'm the only person named Josh Bresser on the planet,

279
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:09,549
which is convenient.

280
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,059
So that's, that's a great example of, you know,

281
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,710
things that are part of my identity and a very personal part of my identity,

282
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,940
like my email address kit

283
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,609
cre.org

284
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,520
that may not necessarily be me in five or 10 years. Uh

285
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,909
It's possible this is actually something that concerns

286
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,710
me always is I obviously own the Domain breast.net

287
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,659
and my email address has been Joshua breast.net for like freaking 20 years now.

288
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,510
And I keep telling my son I'm like,

289
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,849
pretty soon I'm going to need to make you an administrator on this just in case,

290
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:39,390
like I kick the bucket one day so you don't lose the domain

291
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,150
because let's face it, it's a good domain

292
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,440
and since it's, it's not widely used,

293
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,210
like my kids have email addresses that are normal, it's not like, you know,

294
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:53,890
something, something 123795 at gmail.com, which is what all their friends have.

295
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,280
I actually know a

296
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:58,489
lady. Uh I'm not gonna, well, her last name was Smith.

297
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,739
Her first name is very common and she actually had her first name,

298
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,890
last name at hotmail.com and at gmail.com, she was early enough, right?

299
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,750
That's when, you know, you're an early adopter. That's, that's a unicorn.

300
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,489
Well, and you know, it's, you know,

301
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,309
it's kind of funny about this to actually just kind of to bring it all together is

302
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:16,580
from the, like the topic of identity is,

303
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,530
you know, we, we own the domain open source security dot IO

304
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,809
and there's a block there, there's not a lot on it.

305
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:28,039
But anyway, any time I run across an instance to claim the name,

306
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,059
open source security,

307
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,900
I often will just for our nefarious purposes and

308
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,710
I don't want someone else like squatting on it.

309
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:36,289
And, and I mean, I think identity is kind of part of that, right?

310
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:36,979
Is if,

311
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:39,010
if you know there are other people with your name

312
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,440
and you have an opportunity to grab your user name,

313
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,479
do it, you know.

314
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:48,989
So and that's part of what we realized is that identity is kind of like a,

315
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,719
it's like a bundle of things, right?

316
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,500
It's your name, it's your date of birth, it's your social security number

317
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:54,919
now to be clear at

318
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,099
the cloud security lines.

319
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:59,729
We we don't want any of that because that, that's just a GDPR nightmare,

320
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,340
right?

321
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,150
So,

322
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,299
and what we realize too is we don't

323
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,289
actually need your information, right? We just need

324
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:09,909
your information temporarily to maybe validate it and then provide

325
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,020
you with a validation record that we keep and,

326
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,210
and we do like a zero knowledge proof type of thing with a validation record because

327
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,760
it's ask me what my data security strategy is for personal data in our,

328
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,229
in our Blockchain products.

329
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,400
You don't store any of it.

330
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:25,905
Exactly. But I know because you've told me,

331
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:27,304
yeah, and, and even better than that,

332
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,815
we can prove we don't store any of it because

333
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,905
of the way we do hashing and nonsense and stuff.

334
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,484
So we actually mathematically,

335
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:36,755
even if you try to get your personal information into our Blockchain,

336
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:40,015
we can mathematically prove that it isn't, you can't,

337
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,690
you know, because we do some transformations on it.

338
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,590
What's interesting then is that

339
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,450
uh and we're working on a wallet client.

340
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,729
So what this wallet client will allow you to do, for example, is to say things like

341
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,739
I am Kurt

342
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:51,000
at

343
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:51,520
Siefried.

344
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,460
OK, great.

345
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,619
Or I'm Kurt at siefried. And here's a notarized record of somebody who checked my ID.

346
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,010
Maybe because I it really matters because maybe I want to go work for

347
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:03,979
some company that really cares deeply about, you know, validating my photo ID.

348
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:05,830
Conversely, I'm Kurt

349
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:05,969
at

350
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,159
siefried.org and you know,

351
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:11,460
we validated that you had control of that email address and we were talking earlier

352
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,520
and you mentioned

353
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:18,090
the magic word, which is control. The reason this came up actually is my, I,

354
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,450
I have a Mac that I got from work and the disk died.

355
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,140
I had ac file system and bad things were happening. And so I had to reinstall

356
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,500
and as part of that I had to reinstall key base

357
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,140
and I didn't have like any backups of key base or extra devices or anything.

358
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,260
And key base basically flipped out and I had to like recreate my account which is

359
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,419
taking a sledgehammer to it and deleting pretty

360
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:41,500
much everything that was associated with it.

361
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,900
I, I have the same user name but then I, I had to verify it again.

362
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,179
And it's like I, I was thinking that the verification key base uses is

363
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,299
in a way it's kind of silly because for example, I created Gist on

364
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,650
github. And what does that prove? Does it prove? It's me.

365
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:58,320
Well, no, it just proves I have access to that github account.

366
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,109
Well, it proves you have control of that github

367
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:01,719
account.

368
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,659
And see this is what's really interesting is when you think about it,

369
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,190
that could be the account owner or somebody at github could choose to do that,

370
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,880
they totally have control over that.

371
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,739
And that's fair. I mean, in those instances now, of course, I'm sure

372
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:14,190
K

373
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,950
Ace will tell me, well, you should just do this on multiple places,

374
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,099
use Twitter and github

375
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,260
and, and I don't even know what else they support. And it's,

376
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:23,719
but at the same time, kind of,

377
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:27,479
one of the things I keep thinking of is if you have access to someone's email address,

378
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:27,909
you're,

379
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,450
you're pretty much home free at that point for these services. Yeah.

380
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:35,570
And see that's, and that's what we realized is for example,

381
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,000
control of an email address.

382
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,330
Yeah, I mean, that means you have control it.

383
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,989
Well, it's kind of like doing domain verification for SSL certificates.

384
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,815
Like if you control all the email addresses, like host master root at whatever,

385
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,885
or you control the DNS for that domain or you are

386
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,885
able to do whatever you want on the web server.

387
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,445
I, I can't really

388
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,125
disprove it because

389
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:58,905
you have, you have such a deep level of access as a potential attacker that I just,

390
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:00,994
what can I reasonably do to actually

391
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,664
make you do something that would prove you're not an attacker

392
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,844
and that you are legitimately the owner of that domain.

393
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,308
And so, and that goes to the good enough piece of, you know,

394
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,348
realistically if you control

395
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,858
cre.org, you control courtesy

396
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:13,509
free.org.

397
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:16,948
Right. You could be sending and receiving emails me and I wouldn't know.

398
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:18,068
Yeah. Right. Right.

399
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,608
And this is where I think I,

400
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,638
I kind of chuckle sometimes because people

401
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:23,468
will complain about let's encrypt and say,

402
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:23,898
oh, you know,

403
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,029
anyone can get TLS certificates and now they're not

404
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:28,328
secure and it's like they weren't secure before.

405
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:28,909
I mean,

406
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,619
if an attacker has that level of access into your infrastructure you've lost.

407
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:37,280
Right. They, they could have already gotten certificates as you.

408
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,619
It was just honestly, it was slightly more work,

409
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,900
but now your life is 100 times easier too. Well, it cost a bit of money,

410
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,819
which was really annoying

411
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:47,540
and funny story.

412
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,400
It looks like I won't be able to recover my key base dot IO because I

413
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,020
used a GP G key a long time ago that I think I got rid of,

414
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,020
uh, you don't need to do you still can you log in,

415
00:17:56,449 --> 00:18:01,270
you can just like si can log in but it says, OK, a situation is special.

416
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,550
Oh, how exciting.

417
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:03,589
Oh, well,

418
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:04,229
yeah,

419
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,229
you chose to manage your P GP private keys yourself. Nice.

420
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:09,020
And you don't have any key bases devices yet.

421
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,949
I see to prove your first install is really yours.

422
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,760
You must use a computer one that has GP G installed

423
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,310
and two has access to your private key key base.

424
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,459
We'll ask GP G to sign its first device key.

425
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,000
If you lost your GP G private key or would rather not use that key,

426
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,530
you can reset your account, however, you will need to

427
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:22,880
your social identities again.

428
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,160
Oh, so I could just reset my account and just be done with it. Oh, that's easy.

429
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,349
Oh, I'm doing that. Oh, right. Yeah.

430
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:31,589
Yeah. And that's what I had to do too is I had to reset my account

431
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,839
and I don't, I don't think I tied my GP G key to key base because I don't care.

432
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:40,020
And GP G sucks. And I don't want anyone to ever send me anything with GP G.

433
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,660
So that's, that's another story though.

434
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:49,430
But someday I could, we could do a whole episode on how I used to protect my GP G key.

435
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:54,920
It's still pretty bonkers but it's, it's more sane than it used to be these days.

436
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:55,739
But

437
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,030
anyway, anyway,

438
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:01,819
so good enough security and, and this is the thing I keep thinking about,

439
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:06,030
especially in the context of identity and passwords and what key base is doing

440
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,989
and

441
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,729
where do we draw our lines?

442
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:13,770
I mean, like, one of my favorite examples is when I log into one of my banks,

443
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,810
they have this thing that I log in and it shows a picture

444
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,959
and says, I have like, I forget what it even says,

445
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:22,890
but it's a stupid picture and it's some little phrase I made up and they're like,

446
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,199
you know, click here to verify it's you.

447
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:27,979
And I'm like, oh my goodness, what does this even accomplish?

448
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,459
This is the dumbest thing in the world.

449
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:30,750
Well,

450
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,630
basically it allows them on the one hand to say

451
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,060
they have multi factor authentication and notice I said,

452
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:37,300
multi factor authentication and not.

453
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,319
Yes. Stupid is one of the factors, right?

454
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,630
Yeah. Well, it's, it's multi

455
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,310
or it's, it's basically, it's two factor authentication,

456
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,719
but they're identical factors.

457
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:47,719
They're both still a password basically.

458
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:51,699
And the other thing is that in theory it's supposed to prevent,

459
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:53,709
there were some certain malwares that this

460
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:56,560
helps prevent from hijacking your connection.

461
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,599
But I'm guessing that those guys have moved on

462
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,270
and here's part of the problem,

463
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,630
you can do all the identity

464
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:07,209
management security you want.

465
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,239
It doesn't matter if a bank will be like, oh, you say you're Josh B

466
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:13,520
Sure, here's a home loan. See, that's part of the problem is that there's,

467
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,890
it goes back to my story about you know the whole, how do I prove?

468
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,189
I me and I can really only prove, I mean to a very small set of people

469
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:23,449
provably who have access to these like retinal database scans and stuff

470
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:26,640
because I can't like you could give me your driver's license,

471
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,890
your passport, your sin.

472
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,800
Uh What is it in the US? Si social insurance number. Social security number.

473
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,319
No social security number. SSN. Sorry SSN is America?

474
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,040
You could give me all of that. Your fingerprints pictures of your retina

475
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,349
and what would I do with it? How would I validate that? That's you.

476
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,060
But, but why do you even really need it either? I mean, right. Let's face it.

477
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:50,790
The purpose of providing identification in most instances is really about

478
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,880
having some minimal level of risk. You're taking out a home loan.

479
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:59,270
When you do that, they're going to ask for a variety of I DS which are,

480
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,540
you can totally copy them.

481
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,719
But at the same time, banks have insurance to protect against fraud.

482
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:09,920
And if it happens to me, I have the ability to submit claims against

483
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,239
my credit score saying this isn't me and we need to take it off.

484
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,459
So there there's kind of avenues and this is one of those places,

485
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:20,969
let's say the bank needed my retinal scan to like really prove.

486
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:21,650
It's me.

487
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:27,000
The cost of verifying me is now 10 times more expensive for them.

488
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,140
And I'm betting that it would have a minimal difference in the amount of fraud.

489
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,869
They see there's actually a couple of use

490
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,680
cases where that actually works really well.

491
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,339
So,

492
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:39,020
back to the certification thing,

493
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,130
certifications are worth money. Right.

494
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,930
Like, there are certain certifications where you get them and,

495
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:47,599
and you can easily earn 1020 30 grand more a year.

496
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,369
Sure. Sure. From when you didn't.

497
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,410
So

498
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,689
how do you get a certification if you're not able to get a certification?

499
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:55,119
Well, you can pay a test taker,

500
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:55,680
right?

501
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,760
You can pay a professional test taker to get some fake ID and show

502
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,689
up as you and take the test and get it in your name.

503
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,170
So what's happened is some of the higher end certifications now take a biometric

504
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,880
fingerprint or retinal scan of the people taking the test.

505
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,569
And it's the similar reason as a lot of the

506
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:14,229
of the DM of the driver's license place is doing this

507
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:16,170
and it's to ensure one per customer,

508
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,069
right? It's not about identity and it's not about

509
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:21,119
who are you? It's about ensuring

510
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,229
this guy with this set of eyeballs

511
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:24,910
only took the test once,

512
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:25,530
right?

513
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,060
That you can't be a professional test taker or for example,

514
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:30,910
with driver's licenses when they now that they take, you know, the face,

515
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,410
the the fingerprint, whatever

516
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,530
people are unable.

517
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,109
Like they, they did this in Australia where they started taking,

518
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,449
I think it was fingerprints and also

519
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,540
the uh the doing the the face,

520
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,930
the facial recognition stuff and having humans review it,

521
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,530
you know, and they were finding people with seven or eight passports,

522
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,469
all different names and they're like, yeah, that's, that's kind of a problem,

523
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,630
right.

524
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:51,989
So that's,

525
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,369
that's one case actually where this is really interesting is where

526
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,319
we now we have this sort of Venn diagram of,

527
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:57,209
we have identity

528
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:01,280
and we have an overlapping circle that's, it's identity related.

529
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:01,910
But

530
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:03,089
in some ways,

531
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:06,319
we care less about who you are and we care more about properties like saying,

532
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,349
you can only take this test once and if you try to take it again,

533
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,459
we'll know that you already took it and failed or passed.

534
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,670
Sure. Sure. You know,

535
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,369
I mean

536
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,680
that,

537
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,550
so part of me says that makes perfect sense.

538
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,829
And part of me wonders if that's technically necessary. Is it that big of a problem?

539
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,750
Yes.

540
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,489
Yeah. For some of these certifications there, there has been

541
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,170
some of these certifications are worth a lot of money and, and I would point out,

542
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,630
for example, the Berlin Airport

543
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,380
is a couple billion dollars behind and

544
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,579
years behind schedule because the quote unquote

545
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,119
engineer that designed the fire control system

546
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:43,910
uh turns out he's not an engineer.

547
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,890
Yeah, I heard about that,

548
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,030
which makes me sad because the current airport in

549
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,119
Berlin is the worst airport in the world.

550
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,560
Like they need a new one. So bad dude. They built it in like 1920

551
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,089
but

552
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:58,260
even worse than that, just Google, Google C TV, building collapse in New Zealand,

553
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,209
the last earthquake they had the C TV building, the, the

554
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,680
television building collapsed and it shouldn't have

555
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,839
turns out the engineer that designed, it

556
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,079
wasn't an engineer.

557
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:11,920
And what he had done is actually stolen the identity of a retired British engineer

558
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,609
so that he could practice as an engineer and make a lot of money. Interesting.

559
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,750
There's some real world examples where, you know,

560
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,859
we're talking about costs in the tens of hundreds

561
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:25,469
of millions of dollars and in some case, potentially over a billion euros

562
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:28,560
between delays and extra costs for the Berlin Airport.

563
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,359
So some of these certifications, like, are you an engineer or not really do matter?

564
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:34,880
Oh, totally. Yep. Yep.

565
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,880
And what we found was interesting is number one,

566
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,770
it's really hard for me to prove my certification.

567
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,479
And number two, it's basically almost impossible for anybody to validate it

568
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,839
because that's, that's the dirty secret.

569
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:48,880
How, you know, you claim to have a university degree. Correct?

570
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:50,079
Yes.

571
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,520
How do I validate that?

572
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,459
Some random phone number, register's office and ask

573
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,199
you can. Yes, I've, I have,

574
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:01,239
I'm trying to remember. I don't know if I've ever sent my,

575
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,000
my diploma into anybody. I know I have transcripts

576
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,579
that, why have I ever,

577
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:12,020
I needed those for something too because I have two copies of them in my files

578
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,420
and I don't know why I needed two,

579
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,219
but I know I needed two

580
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:17,099
and

581
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:19,500
huh. That's, it's interesting, you say that.

582
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,150
So,

583
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,459
and what's interesting is there's,

584
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:24,449
there's those online universities that will provide you with a fake degree and

585
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,579
they have a phone number that they will answer and be like.

586
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,040
Yeah. No, Josh totally has a degree in, uh, you know, nuclear physics.

587
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,569
Well,

588
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:36,510
I remember when I was in college there was one of the guys I went to school with had a,

589
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,280
and, like, doctored in,

590
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,890
in something that he sent $10 into an online program and he made us call him doctor,

591
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,719
which was really funny.

592
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,119
But it's,

593
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,160
yeah, I mean, that, that's a really good question.

594
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,079
Actually I'm trying to think and yeah, there's, there's no really good way.

595
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:52,520
And in fact,

596
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,000
I know I've heard of instances where like politicians

597
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,199
and celebrities and other people caught where they say,

598
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:59,199
oh, I graduated from the University of blah, blah, blah.

599
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,689
And the university says, no, you didn't.

600
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:06,329
You went here for two years, do we booted you out? And now, you know,

601
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,459
so that's, that's what we found to be a really interesting problem. Is, is not only

602
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,920
can you, is it very difficult for you to prove who or what you are and what you have?

603
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:17,819
But even if you have a good system to prove it, it's,

604
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:20,530
it's commonly very hard for people to validate it.

605
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,160
You know, a great example is we've tried very hard with the CCS KV,

606
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,489
the certificate of cloud security knowledge where you take your exam,

607
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,229
you get a nice PDF and on that PDF, it has your email address and a validation number.

608
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,609
You can go to the website,

609
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,810
you plug in like Courtesy for.org and you plug

610
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,260
in my validation number and it says yes,

611
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,489
courtesy.org got, you know, the CCS K

612
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:39,719
A earned it back in.

613
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,349
It was like 2012 or something.

614
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,050
And that's great except

615
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,260
people's email address changes.

616
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,839
Yes,

617
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,609
that is true. People move to different countries.

618
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:52,069
Uh, companies, their name changes because they get married, they get divorced.

619
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,959
You know, I remember that was one of the biggest things.

620
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:55,469
Uh not to bring up redhead again.

621
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,589
But remember Red Hat,

622
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:59,270
they couldn't change your login name and that drove people crazy who, like,

623
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,030
spent a lot of money in the divorce and then had to type in that

624
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:05,099
name they didn't care for anymore every morning.

625
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:05,900
Yeah. Right.

626
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,829
Or I know this is a problem with, like, transgender folks where obviously they,

627
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,849
they want to abandon their, their old name and in an instance like this, they can't.

628
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:18,359
And in fact, I know this was actually, I don't remember, I,

629
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:19,859
I read an article about this where there,

630
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:22,209
there was a company that actually it was not trivial

631
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:23,780
for them to be able to do this for people.

632
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,819
But obviously it was really important for them. So they did.

633
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:33,239
And well, even simpler example, I, I had a friend who uh he's from China

634
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:37,790
and his daughter, he introduced me to her as, like, Jennifer or whatever,

635
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,300
uh, one day and then, like, you know, I didn't see her for like, a year or two

636
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,680
and then he shows up with this

637
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:46,880
other daughter whose name is Cynthia.

638
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,869
And I'm like, oh, I thought you only had one daughter. He's like, yeah.

639
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,199
No, I only have one daughter.

640
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm like, but wait, Jennifer, Cynthia, he's like, oh, she's trying out a new name

641
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,280
because she had a traditional Chinese name,

642
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:02,540
which was, you know, like, yeah, that's just not going to work so well. So she was

643
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,500
trying on different names.

644
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,199
I thought, you know what, why not? Like what you shouldn't?

645
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,640
People are allowed to pick nicknames. Well, why not?

646
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,979
I mean, legally under documentation issues, whatever or if you're unlucky,

647
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,420
you don't get to pick your nickname.

648
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,329
We just did a show be

649
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:16,810
o'rourke

650
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,030
and I'm like, that sounds like a really funky first name like,

651
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,550
you know, and I Google it and it's Robert Francis o'rourke, you know, like, yeah,

652
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,719
so actually I talked to my wife about this.

653
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,079
She uh

654
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,640
apparently if you're named Robert in

655
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,729
most will say uh Latin American countries,

656
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,910
it would not be uncommon for Bedo to be your like

657
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,479
nickname the shortening because like obviously what you call me,

658
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:41,300
Josh, but my real name is Joshua

659
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,239
and like, but you told me to call you

660
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,790
and I don't care for Joshua.

661
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,510
The only time I hear that is when I'm in trouble.

662
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,439
So if I hear Joshua, I'm like, uh, oh, I look around to see what I've done.

663
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:52,329
What happens when you hear.

664
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,729
Yeah, when you hear your full, like, you know,

665
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:55,589
sri

666
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,319
time to run,

667
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,599
like, don't even look, just go.

668
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,430
Yeah. So, ok, I, I did. Yeah, I guess Roberto be,

669
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,250
yeah, I guess, I mean, who's to say right? It's kind of like

670
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,040
you call people named Richard Dick or people named John are often called Jack.

671
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,439
So I used to, I worked for a guy called Richard and I did not,

672
00:29:16,614 --> 00:29:19,915
that dick was the common nickname for Richard. And so people

673
00:29:20,064 --> 00:29:21,785
essentially thought I was

674
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:21,915
a

675
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,344
moron or something because they would ask me where's Richard?

676
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:28,775
And he would like, literally be in the next room and they'd ask you where's dick?

677
00:29:29,055 --> 00:29:31,425
Yeah, sorry, where's dick? And I'd be like, I don't know who dick is.

678
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:32,505
I don't know where dick is

679
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,849
and they'd be like, but, you know, like,

680
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:37,729
yeah, so that wasn't covered in school.

681
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:39,689
I feel like they should have covered these calls.

682
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,319
Like,

683
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,839
like, ok, what's the deal with William? And Bill?

684
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,650
Who knows?

685
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,949
It probably has some 300 year old reasoning behind it that

686
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,849
nobody understands and that's how most of these names work,

687
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:51,119
right?

688
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,489
It's, it's from some like English King in,

689
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,530
in 1024 decided that he wanted to be called this and now everybody does it,

690
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:01,089
it's like, you know, what I always think of is, you know,

691
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,089
when you wear a suit coat and you have your buttons like you always,

692
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:04,869
but in the top button,

693
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,489
you sometimes but in the middle button and you never button the bottom button.

694
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,189
Do you know why you never button the bottom button?

695
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:11,920
Because King Henry was too fat to button it.

696
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:17,290
And so that became the style like for real, like what the WTF but that's,

697
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,609
that's the world we live in.

698
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,560
Yeah. So, and that's something. So that's one of the reasons when

699
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,839
in, in architecting all of the identity stuff, I've been working on.

700
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,900
I want to let people claim what they want.

701
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,579
Yeah, I, I like that.

702
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,619
It's, it's not up to me to decide that you're Bill or William or whatever

703
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:37,400
and more to the point depending on the jurisdiction or the culture you come from.

704
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,410
I have no idea what the rules are

705
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:43,300
and I don't want to. And, but more to the point, I don't want to know what the rules are.

706
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,729
And so we leave it up to the user,

707
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,930
you claim what you want,

708
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,569
you deal with the people you deal with, you provide them the proof that they require.

709
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:50,510
Yeah.

710
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,089
And I think this is where, I mean, just kind of to bring it all home now is

711
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,030
this is where you go from.

712
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,439
Essentially perfect security, which is impossible to what's good enough.

713
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:03,390
And I'm sure if what you're doing today

714
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:06,920
we talked about that, say 10 or 15 years ago,

715
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,770
people would say that's idiotic.

716
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,810
It's not perfect. Right. When you're dealing with identity, it's got to be perfect.

717
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,750
One more important aspect, which is

718
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,680
we need to let users dial up and down their security because some

719
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:22,400
users will want more security and some users will actually want less security,

720
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,150
more convenience.

721
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:27,069
And that's totally fair. It's kind of the way I always look at this is

722
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:31,079
if you work for, say the intelligence community,

723
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,829
the kind of opsec you need on your computers is much

724
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,209
different than the opsec my parents need on their computers,

725
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:39,579
right?

726
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,579
Because you have very different adversaries coming after you. And I think

727
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,869
that's one of the things where good enough is also a big deal is there,

728
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,469
there's a lot of people that need just barely good enough

729
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:52,670
and there's a lot of people that need really good,

730
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,900
good enough, right?

731
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,869
And we historically just put everyone in the same bucket and it doesn't work.

732
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,949
I mean, I think that's part of our just complete failure in

733
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:05,199
a perfect example of this. The Windows 10 gaming PC I got for my kids

734
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,229
uh to log in, you log in.

735
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:11,319
Well, it wants you ideally to log in with like your Windows live account, right?

736
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,979
Which I've set them with really long passwords

737
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:15,219
because they never use the manager.

738
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:18,689
So, and I also looked, you can set a pin number with letters.

739
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:22,119
So you can basically set a classic password and I'm like, still kind of annoying.

740
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:24,949
Did some research Windows? Hello, you log in with your face.

741
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:29,010
So I'm like, ok, I bought the little webcam for it and now, but here's the cool thing,

742
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:30,989
you basically sit down in front of the computer

743
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,739
and it, the,

744
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:35,030
the, it unlocks the desktop to your desktop. It's awesome.

745
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,280
And I'm pretty sure I could print out a good quality picture and fool it.

746
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,739
But you know what this is for my kids play Minecraft

747
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:42,349
and now they don't have to remember a password.

748
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,459
They don't even have to type anything like this is,

749
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,819
this is great. Exactly. That's exactly right.

750
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:50,339
I mean, when you put it in context it's, it's good enough even more.

751
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:54,140
We get the convenience of you sit down and you get your desktop. I love it.

752
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,285
It just works. That's really cool. I should, I should look into that for my kids.

753
00:32:57,395 --> 00:32:57,685
They,

754
00:32:57,694 --> 00:33:00,244
they have a windows gaming PC downstairs and

755
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:02,244
it's like 80 bucks for the cheapest webcam.

756
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:07,324
It's the, that's the one where I had to download that dot R from that dodgy IP address.

757
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:07,444
Oh,

758
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,984
yeah, I saw that on Twitter. That's awesome.

759
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:10,545
Yeah,

760
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:13,525
it was, but it was, it was just the real tech driver.

761
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,785
So they just took a copy of the real tech driver and put it on some random

762
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:19,344
laptop. It was a really slow download. It's

763
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:19,714
awesome.

764
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:20,334
I love it

765
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:21,035
anyway.

766
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:22,015
But it works

767
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,890
all right. No, I love it.

768
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:24,689
It's good.

769
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,020
It's good enough that, that should be like the new motto of security.

770
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,020
It's good enough.

771
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,619
Which sounds like I've given, we've ever done

772
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:33,650
better.

773
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:37,890
Good enough is, well, it sounds like a low bar in the security world.

774
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,449
It's a pretty freaking high bar right now. Well,

775
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:43,859
you know, I look at how I've been ped and the guy has how many records now?

776
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,010
It's, it's billions. Billions. It's like mcdonald's hamburgers, right?

777
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,430
Billions and billions.

778
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:52,079
We just,

779
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,219
yeah, we took the, we took the numbers down.

780
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:57,689
Indeed. All right, I'm calling this one. So thank you, Kurt.

781
