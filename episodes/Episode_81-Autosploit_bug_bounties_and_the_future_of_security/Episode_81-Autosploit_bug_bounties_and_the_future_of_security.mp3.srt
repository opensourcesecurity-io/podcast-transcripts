Hello and welcome to episode 81 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:12,460
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,920
So, have you heard of

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:15,289
Autos?

4
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:17,680
-- Yes.
-- And the world

5
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,520
-- hasn't ended yet. Not
-- yet. Give it time.

6
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,030
You know, I think,

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,649
I think the problem is we need to start

8
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:25,819
using the Mayan calendar instead of the Julian calendar.

9
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:25,909
It

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,020
didn't, the, the

11
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:31,500
Mayan calendar lied to us. The world should have ended in what, 2012.

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,119
And it did not much to

13
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,639
many people's dismay.

14
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:35,029
Yeah.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,770
But my understanding was there was like an interpretation error or something.

16
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,439
-- I don't know.
-- Oh, is that what it was?

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,500
I think somebody got a date where carried by one or

18
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,959
one of these days. They're going to be right

19
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,090
soon.

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,299
You know what I thought of when I read about Autos.

21
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:54,330
Spit is, well, I guess first of all, just to make sure we, we set the, the

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,770
field here is

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,560
autos

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,340
is a tool that basically you pointed at

25
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:01,950
someone's infrastructure and it looks for problems,

26
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:02,270
right?

27
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:05,559
Using a bunch of automated tooling and this is nothing secret.

28
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,230
It's all just public stuff

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,870
and of course people are flipping out

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,379
and I remember I read this and that my brain immediately went to,

31
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,480
do you remember a tool called Satan

32
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:15,800
from the nineties?

33
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,519
Right.

34
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,260
Right.

35
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,760
Right. Remember how

36
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,639
he did get fired for writing Satan? And I remember all of the crazy

37
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,300
no say like it, it became a corporate,

38
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,720
like it's a, it's a company now and they sell the thing.

39
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:31,180
Well, but more importantly, I think though is,

40
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,269
do you remember all the people claiming like the

41
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,779
world was going to end because of this tool?

42
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,080
Well, I think there was a perception

43
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:39,360
and there still is,

44
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,120
the security problems are hard to exploit.

45
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:46,110
So if people sort of don't explicitly point them out, we're fine.

46
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,940
But then you like, for example,

47
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:51,269
go on youtube and look for the lock picking lawyer and watch him just

48
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,129
break locks open in like one or two minutes that

49
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,110
are supposed to be like good high security locks.

50
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,819
And it's like,

51
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,720
yeah, no, the world, if people are competent, it's,

52
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,559
it's actually nine times out of 10,

53
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,279
pretty easy to exploit the security of a system or of a device.

54
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:10,169
Well, and the thing that gets me always as well is

55
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,339
the vast majority of compromises I see aren't like some crazy zero day attacker.

56
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,550
It's crap like you're running a 12 year old

57
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:23,800
version of wordpress and there's 17 r ce flaws that

58
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,419
I could use against it.

59
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,539
I'll pick the one I like the best.

60
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,339
And this is one of those things that

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
people release tools like this and, and a certain group always flips out.

62
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,979
In fact, I saw somebody put a tool on github

63
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,460
that, that prevents showdown from scanning your infrastructure.

64
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,940
And it's like that doesn't solve anything

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,770
that that's putting a bucket under the leash, proclaiming

66
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,130
the

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,940
noise.

68
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,860
Well, it's ok, but depending on how you run your network and stuff,

69
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:58,419
it can maybe reduce the noise and the false positives in

70
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,979
your alerting system if you actually have people looking at them.

71
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:02,309
Um

72
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,869
But I think part of that would be in general

73
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,630
in general, you'd have to have such a mature

74
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,649
infosec sort of process and infrastructure for that to be a value that,

75
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:14,750
that it almost applies to nobody.

76
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:19,240
I don't even think it needs to be mature. I mean, look if, if you're running

77
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,559
some sort of threat detection system

78
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:27,199
and you can't basically like blacklist or whitelist showdown and say,

79
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,160
stop telling me about these guys.

80
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:33,720
What are you running? Like you do your job?

81
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:35,149
Well, the problem isn't just that showdown

82
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,699
scans it,

83
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,559
but then showdown puts it in the database and other

84
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,380
monkeys and script kitties and whatnot all you know,

85
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:40,750
have

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:40,869
a

87
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,429
and some of those are good to know because let's face it, man,

88
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,860
you can scan I PV four in what, like seven minutes now.

89
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:49,899
I mean,

90
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,460
you're not hiding from anybody.

91
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,139
It's,

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,449
I don't know. II I look at a tool like this and then I look at the outrage and I think

93
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,009
you people are, are, you're bargaining up the wrong tree with this?

94
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,809
Well, this is the classic shoot the messenger, right?

95
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,289
Like how many, uh,

96
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,490
organizations get super angry when somebody points out a security

97
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,809
flaw or a problem in their system or process?

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,640
-- That is true. That happens all the time. Right?
-- I,

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,649
I can't count the number, like,

100
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,970
how many articles have people written online where it's

101
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,209
like I tried to responsibly notify my bank or

102
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,309
something of this flaw

103
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,660
and, like,

104
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,579
they threatened to sue me and then they had the cops show up and take all my stuff.

105
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,799
Right. Definitely. And in fact, I, I've seen

106
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,970
many instances myself of coming across situations like that and

107
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,420
just saying nothing because it's not worth it and,

108
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:44,260
you know, that, you know, there, there's certain organizations that,

109
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,799
that, you know, will not respond in a positive manner to receiving any sort of,

110
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,660
I, I guess, advisory or warning that they're screwing something up

111
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,440
and, and the funny thing is

112
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:59,299
many of those organizations are the same ones, you know, complaining about autos,

113
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,149
spit and at the same time,

114
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:03,109
like, fix your stuff,

115
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:07,480
the solution isn't to complain. The solution is to do things. Right.

116
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:08,570
Think of this as,

117
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,549
as you're being dragged

118
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:13,309
into the future, whether you want to or not.

119
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,260
-- And, and in a couple of years you're going to be glad you did.
-- Yeah.

120
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:20,179
I mean, I remember was it last year

121
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:24,529
or a year, about two years ago? Maybe the General Motors basically

122
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,549
promised not to sue security researchers that came to them with flaws.

123
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,679
And at first I was, like, well,

124
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:31,304
great, awesome.

125
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:34,225
But honestly, no, that's, that's a good step forward

126
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:37,195
because, I mean, a large company like that, if I found a flaw in their car,

127
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:42,554
I would, yeah, either prior to this, I would have either not said anything or two.

128
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:45,885
I would have somehow anonymously, like, you know, put it up on Twitter or,

129
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,214
you know, emailed a bunch of journalists or whatever,

130
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:50,595
but there's no way I would put my name on that because like I,

131
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,609
yeah, no, I just, I don't have no,

132
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,010
-- I
-- totally get it, man.

133
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,809
Like potential hassle and

134
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,739
the beauty is you don't know if it's going to be a hassle or not until you do.

135
00:05:59,529 --> 00:05:59,730
And,

136
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:02,750
and like this is one of the things I will say that I really

137
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,929
like about having a bug bounty program is when you have a bounty program.

138
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,489
That's like you put a sign up that says, you know, researchers welcome,

139
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,850
come and test my stuff.

140
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:13,970
I'm not going to sue you.

141
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,769
And that's, that's a big deal.

142
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:17,670
It's

143
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,809
absolutely.

144
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,170
And,

145
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,829
and I see that as a bigger advantage than almost anything else

146
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,850
in terms of dealing with these guys because they know it's,

147
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:28,809
it's a safe place and they can come and come and work with you and,

148
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,899
and not be worried about, you know, what's going to happen?

149
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,269
Are these guys going to sue me? Are they going to come get me?

150
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:36,369
Because it's, it's scary, man. I, I know what it's like.

151
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:39,519
Yeah.

152
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,950
Yeah. No. And, and the other thing too that this brings up is it used to be

153
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,730
sort of hiding in a school of fish,

154
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,959
used to be a somewhat viable security strategy in that

155
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,510
there were just so many other vulnerable systems and stuff that, you know,

156
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,149
the old Attackers that wanted to build AD D OS platform or, you know,

157
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,720
whatever would basically do, sort of the cheapest,

158
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,910
most

159
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:08,170
quick to return on investment, you know, attacks because

160
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,230
they're on a budget and time constraint, right?

161
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,920
So things like drive by downloads are great because you can

162
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:16,059
serve a bad ad to like a million people in a day

163
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,859
and, you know, if even only 100 of them are exploitable still, that's 100 you know,

164
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,140
attacks in a day with minimal effort.

165
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,970
And I think the reality is, you know, things like autos

166
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,140
flight just really do drive home that you can't,

167
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,570
you know, if you have a public IP. Yeah, you're gonna get scanned

168
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,739
and you're going to get scanned a lot and

169
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,260
especially with IOT stuff you're going to get,

170
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:37,529
you know,

171
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,299
they're going to try connecting to the tel net port and

172
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,450
-- trying like whatever the top dozen or 100 credentials are
-- and,

173
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,029
and it'll take 10 seconds.

174
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah. And

175
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:49,000
there's, you can no longer hide in the school of fish kind of and, you know,

176
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,984
be secured because

177
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:54,065
there's like, well blue whales coming along trawling the entire ocean basically.

178
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:55,385
And I, I don't know what the answer is.

179
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:57,704
I think one of the simplest answers for, especially for home users though,

180
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:01,054
is get like a decent router so that everything is behind it.

181
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:05,364
And you know, as much as I hate Nat and you know, network address translation,

182
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,065
breaking the whole concept of end to end connectivity for the internet.

183
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,244
Now, the reality is

184
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:12,045
especially for home users, you know,

185
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:14,855
you stick everything behind a single IP on that because it's not

186
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,774
like your ISP is giving you much of a choice anyways,

187
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:17,095
right?

188
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,380
I mean,

189
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,140
but uh in the last uh 10 years, uh all the

190
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,260
equipment my ISP has given me basically does not whether I like it or not,

191
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,619
unless I explicitly have a business account and buy multiple IP S.

192
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,839
Um

193
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,719
And the one I noticed actually

194
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,900
by default was giving me a 1 92 1 68 address. So the the, the router like

195
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:41,080
the DS L modem itself was doing the that rather, you know,

196
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,960
and I prefer actually to have my own device doing it realistically for home users.

197
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:46,440
That's, that's probably the best solution.

198
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:46,659
I mean,

199
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:50,169
because we can't fix the IOT stuff like I'm buying

200
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,919
iot stuff a bit now and it's just like,

201
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,919
yeah, this stuff's garbage and I can't secure it,

202
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:57,549
but it's not like I have an option of buying high quality iot that's secure.

203
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:00,909
Right. There's nothing with a good track record. There's nothing.

204
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,359
No, no, there isn't.

205
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,280
And more to the point though, it really shouldn't.

206
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,059
I mean, what, what security settings should my smoke alarm have,

207
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,460
like force http S no, that's like the default and it already does that to some degree.

208
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,830
So. Ok, cool. Like,

209
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,919
really what, you know, this isn't a PC, right?

210
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,739
This is just a thing doing a single thing that happens to have

211
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,820
-- a whole computer on it
-- and, and let's face it.

212
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,479
It's looking more and more like security is not a feature, the market demands.

213
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,359
I mean, my favorite is actually, was it, was it yesterday,

214
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,289
there was a news story saying the,

215
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:34,510
like the investigation into Equifax has been put on ice

216
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:37,169
and it's never going to come back, let's face it. So, I mean,

217
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,059
nothing.

218
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,289
Well, what's, what's gonna happen

219
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,599
even if they investigated Equifax?

220
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,309
I mean, the reality is we, we know what went wrong, right?

221
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,289
They tried to throw that poor guy under the bus saying, oh,

222
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,219
we had one employee who was responsible for this.

223
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:51,460
We didn't do his job. Right. Well,

224
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,549
that means the process is very fundamentally flawed.

225
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,559
You know, if it's a small medium business, like, like if it's my, like my accountant.

226
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,619
If he gave me that story, I believe it because it's, you know,

227
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,820
it's a small accounting firm.

228
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,700
Right. Like,

229
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,380
it's like 10 people

230
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,219
-- but
-- like, there's two sides to that. There's either one

231
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,200
there, it's true.

232
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,219
Which,

233
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:15,669
which is shameful or, or they're lying, which is also shameful.

234
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,799
So there's basically,

235
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:21,640
there's no end to that story that ends well for them. But, but at the same time

236
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,479
it clearly doesn't matter. The market has spoken.

237
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,919
They don't care about security like full stop.

238
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,320
Well, this is why they're called

239
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:28,989
Equifax

240
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,200
already once and they rebranded.

241
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:35,000
So like no, like we this is round two.

242
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,390
Like what really frustrates me about this whole Equifax thing is everybody's like,

243
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,380
oh we should like

244
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:43,679
do something. Ok? Cool. Like what like stop being an Equifax customer.

245
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,609
No, you're actually the Equifax data and you, you, you can't opt out of this.

246
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,820
Ok. Well,

247
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:52,340
get companies to stop using Equifax. No, I mean,

248
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,359
well, in theory they could switch to Transunion or experience or whatever.

249
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:57,820
They're no better, right?

250
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,799
Somewhat like choice point for background checks or whatever.

251
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,450
But

252
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,460
yeah, they don't,

253
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,179
they don't care. It's not like this affects them. I mean,

254
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,979
and that's what gets me about these kind of,

255
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:10,179
it's like an industrial disaster like when you know BP,

256
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,500
polluted the entire Gulf of Mexico,

257
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,549
right? Like what can I do about that? Stop buying gasoline for my car.

258
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,500
You could, but there's nothing you can do and and BP paid what,

259
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,849
like a billion dollars or something which,

260
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,739
yeah, exactly. Rounding error.

261
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,789
And, and this is,

262
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,479
this is one of those things that from, from the research I've done,

263
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,799
there's kind of two paths that make a company carry.

264
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:39,239
You can have the market decides something is, or isn't important.

265
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,580
And in terms of security, the market has clearly decided it's not important.

266
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:48,590
So now the other option is essentially government regulation and we could use.

267
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:51,200
Airlines are my favorite example of this where

268
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,059
where

269
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,570
the customers

270
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,500
probably care about airline safety, but let's face it.

271
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,510
I have a suspicion, most people would still buy the cheap tickets

272
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,770
even if, if one airline had a less good safety record than, than some of the others.

273
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,419
Whereas government regulation has basically forced these guys

274
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,219
into doing a lot of things correctly.

275
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,830
Well, the thing is it's not just government regulation,

276
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,260
it's also things like the N TSB, the National Transport Safety Board,

277
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,369
I count those as regulation

278
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,789
and the FAA and this

279
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:25,039
not just regulation but also a framework of

280
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:28,479
improvement and also people to execute that framework,

281
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:28,859
right?

282
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:31,700
Every time a plane crashes or there's an incident, they investigate it,

283
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,849
come up with recommendations and then ideally implement said recommendations.

284
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:39,229
So you get this continuous improvement and you do that for 50 years and then

285
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:41,460
you get to a point where we are now which is like last year,

286
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,049
-- there were no airline disasters in the US
-- Right.

287
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:47,270
Right. And, and for what it's worth, I, I would put that in the,

288
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,239
the bucket of regulation.

289
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,630
Right, because at the same time, like if the FAA tells you to do something,

290
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,630
you have to do it,

291
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,070
you don't, you can't be like, I don't like that. That, that sounds dumb.

292
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:58,030
Yeah.

293
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:01,919
Well, I think a good example of that though where regulation has failed is like PC I,

294
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,570
right, we have this regulation for the payment card industry

295
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,969
and clearly

296
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:09,500
it's not working like the Home Depot breach, the Equifax breach.

297
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,489
Like we're talking about breaches now with over 10 million people

298
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,840
-- or in some cases like over 100
-- million.

299
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,190
I would argue PC I is doing exactly what it's supposed to do.

300
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:23,489
PC. I isn't to protect us. PC, I is to protect Mastercard and Visa

301
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,909
and, and they seem to be doing ok.

302
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,130
This is, yeah, hard to argue with that.

303
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,200
-- It's
-- completely correct. PC. I isn't for us PC, I isn't for the merchants. PC.

304
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,049
I is for Mastercard and Visa.

305
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,469
No, like straight up, it's,

306
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,869
that's a good point

307
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:39,549
and,

308
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,590
and it is working very nicely for them and, and again,

309
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,830
they have an incentive to protect themselves.

310
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,859
They have no incentive to protect us and they have no incentive to protect merchants

311
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,130
and that's just the way it is.

312
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:56,190
-- Yeah.
-- No, I, I often because I was listening to the radio and they were talking about

313
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:58,929
making changes in sort of in culture,

314
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,869
uh specifically they were talking about head trauma in hockey, right.

315
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,469
That's a big thing here in Canada. Hockey. Right.

316
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:07,049
Like, right now we're aware of how bad it is with football turns out, obviously,

317
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,929
hockey has a problem too with concussions.

318
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:12,239
And they were, they were talking about how,

319
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,280
uh you essentially have two things, you have awareness and then you have, you know,

320
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,239
policy and decisions being made around that awareness

321
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,609
And quite often people are like, oh, we have awareness but

322
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,080
it's, you know, not working. So let's have more awareness, right?

323
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,190
We'll we'll have more awareness and that'll, you know, fix it sometimes.

324
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,750
That's true, right?

325
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,859
Because you only have a little awareness and then you get

326
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,010
more awareness and then people actually take notice and you know,

327
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,890
make change in social policy or tax policy or whatever.

328
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,809
You know, the essentially the government can craft any number of policies to

329
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,750
affect social change, right?

330
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,830
But until they do that, you know, clearly,

331
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,789
it's probably not going to change a whole lot,

332
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,570
right?

333
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,260
And they were talking about how like with this concussion thing, I mean,

334
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,640
clearly we have awareness like we know about this

335
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,119
and yet the politicians haven't done anything. So like, what do we do?

336
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,289
Do we do more awareness?

337
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, you know, it's like, like the best example would be smoking.

338
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,159
Come on, folks, we clearly know smoking is not good for you.

339
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:10,320
-- Maybe more education will help.
-- There's limited things that help.

340
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:10,739
I mean, they,

341
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,229
they increase taxes in some cases and that

342
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,960
does seem to make somewhat of a difference.

343
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:17,479
But let's face it, the only true solution would be to

344
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,320
just outright ban tobacco.

345
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,539
And

346
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,059
I don't know if anyone would ever do that.

347
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,700
Well, it's funny because here in Canada,

348
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,059
I know in the States a lot of the tobacco companies are starting to

349
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,979
not so much divest themselves from tobacco,

350
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:36,539
but they are starting to essentially plan for a tobacco list future.

351
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:39,419
And for example, moving to things like vaping or cannabis.

352
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,940
Yeah. Yeah. II I suspect it's, it's going to happen.

353
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,520
It reminds me of, you know, the fossil fuel industry, it's,

354
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,119
it's the smart parts of the fossil fuel industry are already going like, yeah, no,

355
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,640
this like the golden era fossil fuel is over.

356
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,169
Let's, you know, what's next and you know, renewables and whatnot.

357
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,380
Yeah.

358
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,309
It's kind of like the,

359
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,820
there's a quote I heard once I really like that says

360
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,140
the stone age didn't end because we ran out of stone,

361
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:07,109
right? Just like the oil age isn't going to end because we run out of oil.

362
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,590
Which is funny because when I was a kid,

363
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:11,559
all anyone talked about was we were going to run out of oil and it's like,

364
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,190
uh guess guess what didn't happen?

365
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,909
Somebody gave me a good example of that.

366
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,429
OK, I give you a bucket of paint and I tell you to paint a wall. And what happens? You

367
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,869
paint the wall and what happens if I don't give you enough

368
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,080
oil in the can or enough paint in the can to,

369
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,700
to paint the wall?

370
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,049
Right? You run out. Yes. But there's still a bit of paint in the can,

371
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,179
right. So you get out a paintbrush and you kind of scoop it from the bottom.

372
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,799
The reality is like a paint can, is,

373
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:39,640
is you end up spending more and more effort to recover less and less.

374
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,299
And that's the problem with oil. It's not that it's going to run out completely.

375
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:43,549
It's just that at some point,

376
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,049
you know,

377
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:46,030
recovery of that oil is going to become so

378
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,799
expensive because we'll have grabbed all the easy oil.

379
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,190
You know, we'll have done the tar sands, we'll have done the shale oil.

380
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,719
-- I don't know what comes after
-- that

381
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:54,640
solar power,

382
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:57,270
you know. So, I mean, that's the thing, right.

383
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,299
We, it's not that we're going to run out of oil.

384
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:04,140
It's just that it's going to become incredibly expensive to produce

385
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
until somebody invents some bacteria that does it

386
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,540
-- for damn near free
-- for what it's worth.

387
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,339
I have a suspicion, this is how a security is going to evolve is

388
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,270
what we do today is clearly broken

389
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,630
and I don't see us fixing what we do today that I have a suspicion, new,

390
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,270
new technology and procedures and just everything is going to evolve.

391
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,719
I mean, I'll use cloud as one of my favorite examples.

392
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:34,510
If you're using a public cloud, it changes a lot of your security problems.

393
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,550
I, I won't say it makes it better necessarily. I think it just changes them around.

394
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,079
Oh, it does make it better. Um,

395
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,890
like I'm, I'm, I'm dealing with some, uh, GD GDPR compliance

396
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,000
and honestly a lot of it,

397
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,849
you know, things like physical security. Yeah. No. Amazon.

398
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:56,469
-- That's, that's true. Actually all the physical security goes away.
-- Yes.

399
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:56,910
Right.

400
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,449
There's like a lot of things where it's just like, not my problem,

401
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:01,170
like data is encrypted.

402
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,689
So all that,

403
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,290
you know, like how do you decommission machines? Uh we don't

404
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,449
click,

405
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,770
we click, delete,

406
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:12,569
you know, things like that, you know, so, and,

407
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,849
and it basically then boils down to what's our internal policies and training and,

408
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,849
you know, do we track where the data lives and kind of, you know,

409
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:20,280
make sure it doesn't get all

410
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:21,089
woodle. But

411
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,689
like, honestly for a lot of the really sensitive data,

412
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:26,550
the answer is extremely simple for us sales force.

413
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:27,800
That's it. That's my answer,

414
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:28,890
you know, and it's,

415
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,819
and sales force obviously has a rather

416
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,079
significant incentive, shall we say

417
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,719
to make sure they do, you know GDPR correctly?

418
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,699
That is true.

419
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,270
And, and they, they've actually been working on it for quite some time.

420
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,439
I read some of their documents about GDPR and they're definitely,

421
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,880
they're ahead of the curve. I'm comfortable in saying

422
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,939
-- and, and that's, well, see, here's
-- the beauty, right? It's,

423
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,660
that's one of those things that,

424
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,859
where security then actually becomes a competitive advantage.

425
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,119
That sounds like crazy talk.

426
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:00,000
I know.

427
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:00,819
You know,

428
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:03,140
and that's one of the things like that's one of the things I love about Red Hat.

429
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,979
Right is, is

430
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,030
we've gotten really good at fixing security flaws. Like,

431
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:09,619
you know,

432
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,709
like I remember back in the day not Red Hat, but I remember some vendors

433
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,109
they would take literally years to fix really bad

434
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,469
security flaws like flaws that were publicly known.

435
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,150
There's still people who do that man, look at, look at project zero with their 90 day

436
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:26,150
limit

437
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,550
on security issues. And, and

438
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,880
when you read some of these advisories,

439
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,469
like they hit the 90 days more often than I think they should have to.

440
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:39,790
But there's places that just struggle with this stuff even today.

441
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,579
Well, the good news is like the, you know,

442
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,550
at least the operating system vendors like Apple Microsoft,

443
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,359
all the Linux vendors have generally got their stuff together to

444
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:49,969
a degree that like 20 years ago would have been magic.

445
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,780
Yeah, definitely. And, and I,

446
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,609
so actually you,

447
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:56,930
you're kind of proving my point to me about kind of evolving security is

448
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:01,339
a significant amount of what most people do today is in a browser

449
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,949
and the browser manufacturers do a great job of keeping things updated.

450
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,949
So now we've kind of pushed the security off of my machine

451
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:08,920
onto

452
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,400
the, the service I happen to be using, right?

453
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,310
And some services are better than others.

454
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,140
And so my ability to pick and choose and understand I think is,

455
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,589
is significantly better.

456
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,640
I mean, my favorite example, like the, the, the horse I love to beat is flash player

457
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,069
because its track record is abysmal.

458
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,569
And I remember when like you had to have it,

459
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:33,930
you didn't have a choice and keeping that sucker updated was basically your job,

460
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:34,609
right?

461
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,520
And these days, like, I don't,

462
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,469
oh my goodness,

463
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:42,239
I installed Java the other day and it asked me to enable it in Chrome.

464
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,579
And I was like, nope,

465
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,199
definitely not.

466
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:46,900
And

467
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,199
yeah, I mean, that's another great example, right of,

468
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:53,680
of if you're just using a browser, these guys have an incentive for security and we,

469
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,439
we've moved the security

470
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:00,650
onus off of the user and now it's been pushed into some of the services.

471
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,160
And I think that's,

472
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,959
that's the natural evolution of solving a lot of these problems, I think.

473
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,949
Well, the reality is you have to have

474
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:13,270
secure defaults and not just, I mean, configuration defaults but like secure,

475
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,050
reasonably secure code, things like

476
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:18,400
uh Mozilla just uh in Firefox changing the refer,

477
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,099
I think it was the refer headers or whatever

478
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:23,609
to strip the path or something for third party sites so that there's less

479
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,979
data leakage.

480
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:28,160
You know, like I know you were at ebay, I don't know what you were looking at at Ebay,

481
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,515
right. You know, things like that.

482
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:31,435
And

483
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:35,545
because I mean, the number of people I see that like for example, you know,

484
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:37,444
use the uh the browser extension,

485
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:40,614
no script which completely blocks javascript and then you selectively enable

486
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:41,564
the entire

487
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:41,954
web.

488
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:46,555
-- They're basically also the people who wrap, you know, their cars in
-- tinfoil,

489
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:48,415
what would wrapping your car in tinfoil?

490
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:49,954
Like it's already metal.

491
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:51,805
I don't know that

492
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:52,104
I,

493
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:55,025
you know, I used to run no script and I became

494
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,040
annoyed with the pain and suffering of doing so.

495
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,589
But it's also something I realized the other day

496
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,800
is I haven't used no script in several years.

497
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,040
And I have had literally zero incidents

498
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:07,119
because I didn't have no script.

499
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,819
And I find things like my password manager and two factor off

500
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:14,329
are far more useful to me than no script.

501
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:18,250
Well, I think part of it honestly is 99% of what I want from. No script.

502
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:19,589
I, yeah. Oh

503
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,800
my goodness. I,

504
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,839
so I, I got a new computer for my kids to play games on

505
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,030
and obviously I turn it on and I opened up the web browser

506
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,839
and the first site I go to, I'm like, what is wrong with the internet?

507
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:34,380
And then I thought, oh, I don't have, I don't have you block origins.

508
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,150
So

509
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,040
that was like the next thing I did and then the world was good again.

510
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,410
Yeah,

511
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,109
I actually saw an ad the other day for something I actually was

512
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,329
interested in but then I clicked it and it took me to,

513
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:47,160
-- like, some surveys,
-- of course it did.

514
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,060
So, it was like, I,

515
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:55,239
I find if I do see an ad for something, I often just go to Amazon and type it in

516
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,410
because clicking on ads is, is ridiculous.

517
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,689
And you always end up on some dodgy website.

518
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,400
Yeah. So, speaking of things not being what they appear to be

519
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,750
-- face swapping.
-- Oh my goodness, there's so many crazy stories,

520
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,359
right? So

521
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,959
this I love because

522
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:12,859
I mean, traditionally you could, you know,

523
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:15,939
somebody with good Photoshop skills could easily move, you know,

524
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:19,000
one person's head to another person's body or whatever, right?

525
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,359
Except now of course, computers being good at stuff and

526
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,489
people writing better and better software,

527
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,189
a guy did an open source implementation that basically lets you

528
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,449
face swap for video

529
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,089
and like you basically just give it the image and you're like, you know,

530
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:37,810
go ahead and like make this actor look like this other person or whatever, right?

531
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,369
And you know,

532
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,609
people are freaking out and the best part about the article was that they were like,

533
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,310
and all copies of the video have been removed from the internet and

534
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:49,250
it's like, wait what? That's, that's really not how the internet works.

535
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,040
But this, you know, this software was released as open source and,

536
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,099
and people are again kind of like autos spit, they're kind of freaking out because

537
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,750
this has actually been possible for a long time. It's just, you know, not been

538
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,890
easily done, right. It, it would be quite costly and expensive.

539
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,885
But I mean, the fact that like Gollum, you know,

540
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:06,656
they didn't hire some guy that looked like Gollum, you know,

541
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:09,495
some dude wearing a green suit with like little black and white

542
00:24:09,676 --> 00:24:10,176
-- guy
-- who did the

543
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:11,595
Andy Circus.

544
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:13,946
He was also King Kong and he's been like,

545
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:18,576
he's making a name for himself as being like a character actor where they, yeah,

546
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:21,696
they put him in like the goofy suit and he actually, he did the voice of G

547
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:24,196
as well. I don't think he did the voice of King Kong.

548
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,316
OK. Well, because I've seen some really terrible CG I capture

549
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:30,302
stuff where it's like whoever, you know,

550
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:33,141
the actor doing the motion capture was clearly like

551
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:34,891
stuck in a green room and they're like,

552
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:38,001
pretend there's an apple or you know, whatever, right?

553
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:39,352
And the guy clearly wasn't getting it.

554
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:43,312
Well, that's even assuming they had motion capture for summer. I mean,

555
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:45,381
there's some things you watch and it's like,

556
00:24:45,391 --> 00:24:47,901
clearly they did not use motion capture for this.

557
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,391
The other thing to remember too is we have things like, you know,

558
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:53,462
real time voice manipulation and there was that

559
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,500
um oh I have to find that,

560
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,609
but basically somebody wrote some software again that given, you know, a small

561
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,099
uh relatively small example of you speaking could

562
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,930
then generate your voice for all things.

563
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:05,890
Sweet.

564
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,449
That sounds great.

565
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,680
And so this introduces a whole bunch of things like,

566
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:14,229
well, you know, this person phoning me has the right voice. But are they really that

567
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:19,160
-- humans are quite good at voice detection and recognition? You know,
-- we think we are.

568
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,660
Yeah,

569
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:22,560
this is, I mean,

570
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:26,729
this is a topic we should probably discuss online

571
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:29,569
and really in any sort of media

572
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,709
you can't really trust what you see anymore.

573
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:36,810
And this is like a new problem for humanity because we've,

574
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,010
-- we've been able to rely on things we hear and things we see as being real
-- pictures

575
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:42,040
or it didn't happen.

576
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,510
Yes,

577
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:44,959
like straight up pictures are

578
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:47,670
we're releasing the video

579
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,430
-- and, oh, ok, that's what happened.
-- Exactly. That's exactly right.

580
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:54,790
And so now the chance and of course there's people who say, oh, but you can,

581
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,630
you can detect,

582
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,310
you know, when someone modifies a photo or someone modifies a video and no,

583
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,760
we can detect it today maybe.

584
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,030
But the day will come when we can't.

585
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,069
I think it,

586
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,410
it really seems a lot like doping in the Olympics

587
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,670
where now the strategy is they hang on to the,

588
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,359
uh, athletes urine for several years or something.

589
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:16,540
So that later on when they invent better tests, they can retest the urine and,

590
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,939
you know, strip them of their medals post

591
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,390
Olympics or whatever.

592
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,369
Um, but yeah, I mean that it's, you know,

593
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,339
it's that cat and mouse game where the Attackers will come up with something new and,

594
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:27,130
you know,

595
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,560
uh we may not even know it's a thing and for months or years and then we figure it out,

596
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:34,469
write some detection for it and it's like, oh, ok, you know, this was fake,

597
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:34,989
this was fake.

598
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,609
Those Nixon tapes that came out, turns out they were fake

599
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,709
or whatever, you know, the missing Nixon tapes. I mean, I'm sure

600
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,180
somebody's going to generate those things.

601
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:45,540
They've tried, man, they've tried.

602
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,979
It's, it's gonna be crazy to think about.

603
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,380
At some point.

604
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,819
There will be probably we'll say detection. A I just because that's a fun name

605
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,380
and, and they're going to point to that many things from the past because now we,

606
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,979
we keep everything forever and nothing ever goes away

607
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,640
and it's going to be amazing to say, you know, oh this, this thing here, this was fake

608
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,219
and,

609
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:09,250
and what happens when it was 20 years ago

610
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,500
and it was like some world changing event and,

611
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,660
and all of a sudden now we can say that wasn't real.

612
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,550
Like that's crazy.

613
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,390
Well, we've had things like that happen, you know, where it turns out that this was a,

614
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:21,520
you know, like a

615
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,079
government sponsored event versus, you know, it was terrorists or, you know,

616
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:25,439
whatever.

617
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:27,010
There's been all sorts of crazy things like

618
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,400
the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, right?

619
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,130
Like you read that and it's like that can't be real like,

620
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:32,680
seriously.

621
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:33,250
But

622
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:34,689
I hear you, man,

623
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,550
those crazy conspiracy theorists.

624
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,160
Oh, the CIA is importing cocaine to the US, to blah, blah, blah.

625
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,500
Well, oh, that actually happened like

626
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:43,099
it

627
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,119
is, I don't know, man. I mean, this is one of the things I think about is

628
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,079
in this, this falls in line with security where

629
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:53,160
humans and was it, is it Schneider who said human,

630
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,469
the human threat model is like sub Saharan Africa

631
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,390
and basically anything that,

632
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,290
that doesn't fall in line with that we struggle to deal with.

633
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,530
And like, this is totally one of those things like,

634
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,079
is that a lion?

635
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:05,770
I

636
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,770
don't know. Is it good? Is it bad?

637
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,420
What should I do in this?

638
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,290
And like, I always think about this in the context of phishing emails,

639
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,439
you can't teach people to recognize a phishing email, like,

640
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:21,319
unless it looks like a lion and is hiding in the, in the weeds, they don't know,

641
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,030
I don't know what the answer is.

642
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,719
But, um, I think part of it will be maybe increased transparency, you know,

643
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:29,060
for example, kind of that, um,

644
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,089
you know, where did this

645
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:31,944
come from? Where did this video come from?

646
00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:34,564
You know, here's the guy that claims to have taken it, you know,

647
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:37,084
he's available for interview or whatever, you know.

648
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:38,454
Yeah, maybe, I mean,

649
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:42,275
that's sort of supporting evidence, you know, like the same way journalists do it,

650
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:42,484
right?

651
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:45,055
Like journalists will use, you know, quote unquote anonymous sources

652
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:48,755
but they'll verify it. Hopefully, you know, if they're doing their job. Right.

653
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:51,204
And, you know, well, you've heard those statements where it's like,

654
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:54,780
it's an anonymous source but, like, we've got, like, 17 of them.

655
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,150
Like, we're, we're reasonably certain,

656
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,390
either this is true or it's like such a gigantic campaign to fool us.

657
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,829
We can't tell the difference,

658
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,280
-- you know.
-- But there, there are gigantic campaigns to fool us now.

659
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,469
I mean, thanks to things like Twitter Bots, you can totally do that

660
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,109
again. Like humans,

661
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:16,189
-- humans are incapable of.
-- Well, that's why you actually meet the human in person.

662
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:18,800
Right? There was, do you, we should link to this.

663
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,969
There was a vice news or, or sorry, the Washington Post. Remember

664
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:27,920
they, they, the some person was trying to troll them with a fake news story.

665
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,099
And so they turned it into an article

666
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,189
about this company that actually that's what they do

667
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,390
wild man, right?

668
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,000
And anyways, they actually like interviewed this like they, they, you know,

669
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,270
oh yeah,

670
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,140
we'll meet with you in a coffee shop and then they followed her back to her office.

671
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,020
Yeah, here's a hint.

672
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,599
If you're like pretending to be somebody else don't go

673
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:46,040
back to your office where you actually do work.

674
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,239
And um anyways, it was,

675
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,300
it was a fascinating article about how the Washington Post is basically like, yeah,

676
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,849
somebody tried to fool us and like, well, here's like

677
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,489
what?

678
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,260
That's crazy.

679
00:29:57,239 --> 00:30:00,900
Uh These are, these are rough problems. I'm not gonna lie. I don't,

680
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,099
I, I don't know how we're going to fix it and, and I guess this is part of the,

681
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,319
the great challenge in front of us.

682
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:08,410
-- Now,
-- the beauty is,

683
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,939
some people have already had this problem and already fixed it like journalists,

684
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:11,209
right?

685
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:13,930
People come to journalists all the time with fake stories or

686
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,790
stories that they want to put a certain spin on.

687
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,449
You know, and, and they have a process to deal with that.

688
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:22,619
My argument there is a journalist is a profession and so they have

689
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,219
certain standards and expectations where it's like

690
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:28,010
my grandma looking at things on youtube

691
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:30,099
is very different.

692
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,420
And so I, I don't know, man, this is going to be interesting.

693
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,589
-- Well,
-- even youtube is starting to, um

694
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:37,790
uh for example,

695
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,410
they now have a policy where they're labeling

696
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,229
government sponsored content that they know of.

697
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,069
Yeah.

698
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:46,109
And well, I mean, that's what I mean by part of the part of what will help here is,

699
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:46,699
is that

700
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,500
where did this come from? Like,

701
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,369
you know, for example, if you with a lot of things, you know,

702
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,750
who sponsored this message?

703
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,209
Oh, ok. I see what they're saying now, you know?

704
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:56,790
Sure,

705
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,339
sure.

706
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:57,630
Uh

707
00:30:58,209 --> 00:30:59,670
I don't know, man, I don't know.

708
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,349
-- So
-- I, because we can't tell the fakes from the reals at some point, it is just,

709
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,510
-- it's
-- too good. We're gonna, we're gonna find out, I guess so.

710
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,550
All right, man, I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
