Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 159 with myself,

1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,619
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:13,760
-- What's
-- new man?

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,440
Well, I guess in the interest of full disclosure,

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,920
we should let everybody know what we're talking about

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:19,889
be.

6
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:25,079
That was great. That was the, the worst set up ever.

7
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,469
So, yes, for those of you wondering what's going on,

8
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:33,470
we decided to have an episode about disclosure and I know we've kind

9
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,130
of talked about this in the past probably more than once it's been.

10
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:40,419
I mean, we're in a big number now of episodes. I, I don't remember, but recently

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,360
just the concept of disclosing security issues has become,

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,560
I guess relevant as a current event for a variety

13
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:52,373
of reasons. And so we thought it would be fun to talk about it today.

14
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:54,562
-- Why don't
-- we define the problem a little bit first?

15
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:57,632
Because I was actually thinking about this when you mentioned the topic.

16
00:00:57,743 --> 00:00:59,252
Yeah, that's a great idea.

17
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,792
So I guess my first question would be is, um,

18
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:05,983
-- what's being disclosed
-- whatever you want? Like

19
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:10,333
-- actually that is part of the problem.
-- So we're going to talk about this in the general

20
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:11,572
topic of

21
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,575
-- information, security.
-- Right. Yeah, I, I think

22
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:17,615
security

23
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:18,695
bugs

24
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:19,716
specifically or, or I

25
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:20,825
guess

26
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:22,026
even

27
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,905
security

28
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:26,746
flaws

29
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:28,655
on

30
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,225
you could

31
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:31,625
find

32
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:33,466
a,

33
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,209
like, did you see the most recent one with the master lock thing where you can, like,

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,199
see the gates?

35
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,050
-- So he's like, you can just,
-- does he pay you to be in this channel?

36
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:43,470
Because

37
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:47,519
I honestly though he does a lot, like, who, let me ask you this,

38
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:51,569
who else is out there actually doing good security ratings

39
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,569
work that places like consumer reports or like the standards,

40
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,790
you know, like underwriter laboratories should be doing.

41
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,480
No, II, I agree.

42
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,709
And lock picking is one of those unique skills because doesn't my,

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,849
my favorite is when he, in fact, I, I watch his channel also,

44
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,070
but I love it when he gets out.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,288
He says like, oh consumer reports gave this, you know,

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,830
the highest rating and then he picks the lock in 15 seconds.

47
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,169
Well, I mean, I, I still love this master lock thing where the,

48
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,919
the it's a combination little box lock thing to put your like

49
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:22,589
phone in and lock it up at the pool or whatever.

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,419
So it's a cool idea and I like it like he says he likes it too and it, it is a cool concept.

51
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:26,649
But

52
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,710
the thing is so sloppily made

53
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,550
that you can actually, when you turn the dials,

54
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,300
you can see where the gate is so you can, like,

55
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,080
you just turn it until you see the shiny part.

56
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,119
That's it. Like, that's how you pick this lock. You just look at it while you

57
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:39,399
open it. Cool.

58
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,820
You know, it reminds me that cable lock where they're like, it's Teflon and Krypton

59
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,729
and, you know, um, like Kevlar and Titanium and God knows what else.

60
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:51,440
And he, like, cuts through it with a pair of tin snips in like, four seconds,

61
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,449
right? But so yeah, first thing is what are we disclosing? Ok.

62
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,429
So we're going to talk about

63
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,580
information security, computer information security specifically.

64
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,270
Ok. Second question. Who are we disclosing to

65
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,610
the vendor, the public at large? A select group of industry experts?

66
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,550
I mean, that's part of the discussion, I think because

67
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,149
the term so

68
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,820
to, to back this up even a little more maybe is when we talk about disclosure,

69
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,009
you'll hear terms like responsible disclosure

70
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,169
or co-ordinated disclosure or whatever,

71
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:25,610
there's, you know, pick an adjective and put it in front of the word disclosure.

72
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,850
And for the most part, those are all loaded terms.

73
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,770
They're worse than loaded terms in that.

74
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:33,369
They don't actually have like an official meaning.

75
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,990
-- All
-- right.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,664
Well, no, no, they,

77
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:38,904
they have an official meeting for the people using the word to generally shame.

78
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:40,955
-- Yeah,
-- but everybody uses them differently. Some,

79
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:41,934
they do.

80
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:46,214
I know that's part of the crazy because like responsible disclosure was a

81
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,024
term Microsoft basically ended up inventing because

82
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:50,425
people would report bugs to them,

83
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,244
they do nothing and then people would report bugs

84
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:54,505
to the world on the full disclosure mailing list.

85
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:58,289
And now Microsoft is like, oh, you didn't disclose this responsibly.

86
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,410
It's like, no, well, they did,

87
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:02,169
you just didn't responsibly deal with the disclosure.

88
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:02,770
So

89
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,449
your fault, not theirs.

90
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,429
And I mean, also part of it is then, you know,

91
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,729
how much or what all is being disclosed because, I mean,

92
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,595
there can be I I've had people like disclose to me,

93
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,144
it's like there's a flaw in the loans kernel.

94
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,505
Well, yeah, there probably is. Yeah, we know.

95
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:19,053
Yeah.

96
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:22,304
And then I've also had people like, you know, very specifically

97
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:25,174
there's a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, here's the diesels, blah,

98
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:28,345
blah blah versus also that plus like exploit code,

99
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:29,105
right? And

100
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,329
that's exactly it.

101
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:30,579
You,

102
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:33,940
you get this a lot in the open source world where

103
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,299
someone might try to write an advisory for something they fix

104
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,589
that is lacking on details.

105
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,709
And it's like guys, you know, like the patches right here,

106
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,339
you check to test and then actually exploit this.

107
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,410
What are you doing here? You know,

108
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:48,565
I

109
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:51,125
mean, and that's the problem is these are all dimensions that can you,

110
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,045
you can slide them up and down as it were,

111
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,695
you know, and even within this whole like a group of industry experts.

112
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:58,684
Well, is that like the Linux kernel mailing list?

113
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:02,644
Wait, that's publicly bad example. Oh what was that list? That solar runs? Linux

114
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:06,225
distro list? Yeah. Linux distro, man. I mean, I used to be on it.

115
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:07,565
I should have remembered this.

116
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,630
Well, yeah, there was vendor

117
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,230
se before that and I think, does a Zarda

118
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,760
-- list still exist even? Like, I don't
-- remember,

119
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,220
I don't remember.

120
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,519
And like, so I know there's the districts list and you know, there's like the,

121
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,600
the quote unquote secret stuff goes there.

122
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:22,920
So people have time to deal with it.

123
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,989
And actually, and when I say deal with it, I don't mean like bury it and ignore it.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,364
But I mean,

125
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,545
like some of these things are complicated to patch and fix like they are nontrivial,

126
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:33,605
you know, after the whole shell shock thing where that, that was a bit of a mess.

127
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:37,334
But then there's other industry groups, there's industry specific verticals,

128
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:41,295
you know, where it's like all the banks share stuff or power industry.

129
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:43,825
Uh What is it? NANR A something starts with an N

130
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:44,760
I think it's N

131
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:45,720
Yeah.

132
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,100
And so even within that, you know, I know there's various cloud groups,

133
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,519
there's various vendor groups,

134
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:55,880
there's no doubt there's just lists that are like literally AC C that's

135
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,890
been going on for six months or 10 years in some cases,

136
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,559
you know, I know people have their sort of,

137
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,309
I don't want to call it a list because it's literally

138
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,119
just somebody started an email thread and it just never died.

139
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,040
Right. Right. And with open source, this gets even crazier because now

140
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,760
we'll pick on the Linux kernel,

141
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,630
you have vendor shipping kernels.

142
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,130
You know, you've got people like Debian and Red Hat and Su

143
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,619
and whoever you have people consuming kernels like Google and Amazon are two

144
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,160
phenomenal examples there.

145
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,070
So

146
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:27,269
how does the

147
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,730
-- IOT space T together? Right.
-- Exactly.

148
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,140
Well, I mean, my favorite is always open SSL. Right?

149
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:36,420
Because everybody uses open SSL. Every TV on the planet uses Open SSL.

150
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,940
And I remember they were, you know, some of these TV manufacturers are like,

151
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,140
we want advanced notice of open SSL phones and the Open SSL group was like, no,

152
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,630
like you, you're not,

153
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,380
you think you're special enough but you're not. And more to the point

154
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:48,390
the risk,

155
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,410
how do I put this nicely? A lot of these big vendors aren't

156
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,570
great at security

157
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,209
and I don't mean just like patching stuff but, like keeping stuff secret.

158
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,290
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, there have been more than one leaks.

159
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,010
I know of where

160
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,989
it was an attempt to do some sort of co ordination

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,010
and somebody accidentally did something they weren't supposed to do.

162
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:09,959
And it's like, well,

163
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,940
the cat's out of the bag. Everybody. Here we go.

164
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,660
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I, yeah, I just, I don't know what to say.

165
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,070
We need to say that this is a hugely complex topic

166
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,519
and it's one of those things that people love to say,

167
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:22,619
oh,

168
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,290
if you only have a bug bounty or you only have a

169
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:28,820
disclosure policy on your website or you only do this one thing.

170
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:30,739
It's never one thing

171
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:31,179
ever.

172
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:32,735
Things definitely help though.

173
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:35,055
Well, it certainly does, but I want,

174
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,846
I want to add one other really important point here

175
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:41,376
around disclosure in general. And that is that

176
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:45,496
the world of today is not the world of even five years ago.

177
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:49,885
And there's a nontrivial amount of content I read about disclosure

178
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:53,175
that are from people who have old knowledge and it's,

179
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:57,055
it's not useful and that's also something that muddies the waters here.

180
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:57,415
Is

181
00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:57,645
it,

182
00:07:57,756 --> 00:08:00,055
you know. Yeah, you worked at Microsoft five years.

183
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,611
But like, it's all open source now.

184
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:08,011
It's not even that it's old knowledge so much that there's new knowledge. Yeah.

185
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:10,742
Yeah, that's fair because old knowledge is not inherently bad.

186
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,652
Like, for example, starting a fire with two sticks like a fire bow.

187
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,611
-- That's old knowledge.
-- Have you ever tried to do that?

188
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:20,782
-- Like, it's terrible.
-- No, this is why I always bring two lighters with me. Right.

189
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,522
I bring two lighters, not one lighter but two lighters because, yeah, I've tried.

190
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:24,622
Yeah.

191
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:27,131
No, it's, we're going to be doing this at scouts this year, you know,

192
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,441
the fire starting stuff and,

193
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,500
you know, ranging from like, hairspray and a lighter to, yeah, two sticks,

194
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,130
good luck kid.

195
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,780
And, and that's kind of a good example here is,

196
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,808
it's not that the old knowledge is necessarily

197
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,099
bad or wrong. It's just,

198
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:44,309
there's way better ways to do this now, like a butane lighter,

199
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,239
you know,

200
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:48,739
and same thing with disclosure, like, for example, having a disclosure policy,

201
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,219
well,

202
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,840
that signals to the people trying to disclose to

203
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,140
me that at least I know what disclosure is

204
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,599
and I've thought about it a little bit and I care enough to maybe have an email address

205
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,130
all the way up to a bug bounty where it's like, no, you know,

206
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,250
and depending on how much your bug bounty is, it like not to name.

207
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,809
Well,

208
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,890
you know, that vendor that just came out with, you know, we're,

209
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,570
we're upping our bug bounty to a million dollars.

210
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:07,729
Well,

211
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,669
it's pretty clear they,

212
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,429
they care about disclosure and they want to hear about it

213
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,690
first if they're putting a million bucks on the line,

214
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,090
even,

215
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,809
even that gets funny because there's people complaining about

216
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,169
paying bug bounty hunters is dumb and you should be

217
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,489
using that money to hire better security people and it's

218
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,690
like we can't agree on anything and it's beautiful.

219
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,070
Well, here's the thing I always get with the whole hiring argument is like, cool.

220
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,809
You want to hire people? Great.

221
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,849
Please tell me how you're doing that so I can copy you because man,

222
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:37,150
like finding competent people who are just like looking for work.

223
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:40,049
Oh, my goodness. I know. I know. It's,

224
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:44,510
in fact, at work we, we, we're opening up some security wrecks and

225
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,669
I, I see my future

226
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,340
and it's six months of pain.

227
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,190
That's what it is trying to find people because you're going to talk to a ton of people

228
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:57,630
and it's going to be like, why am I even talking to this person? What is going on here?

229
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,270
Oh,

230
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,219
my goodness.

231
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:03,609
Anyway, anyway, but by the way, if anyone's looking for a job, like hook, hit me up,

232
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:04,859
like just saying.

233
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,229
All right. So anyway, disclosure.

234
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,150
So here's,

235
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,609
here's the one thing I will tell everyone listening to us right

236
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:15,840
now is that everything you're going to hear about is fundamentally opinions.

237
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,710
Kurt and I have been doing this for a long time, but there are no facts in this space.

238
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,900
There are none, anyone who tells you they have facts is lying.

239
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:26,229
No, there's a couple of good facts like everything's messed up and broken.

240
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,729
-- OK.
-- That could be a fact.

241
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,349
The other fact that's really, really bad is

242
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,530
all of these things mean different things to different people,

243
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,450
not just because

244
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:37,674
like they use language differently, but because, well, here's a great example.

245
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,734
You talked about a kernel consumer. What, what like is an IOT

246
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:44,414
guy who just ships a vanilla Debian, a kernel consumer.

247
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:45,924
He's shipping a kernel or,

248
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:50,465
versus somebody who takes a kernel maybe modifies it a bit and ships it versus,

249
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:50,695
you know,

250
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:53,945
somebody who's actually actively involved in maintaining a subsystem or,

251
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,974
you know, 5% of the Linux kernel code.

252
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:57,265
Right. Right. Right.

253
00:10:57,275 --> 00:11:00,815
These are all and, and then it also depends on what you're using it for, for example,

254
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:01,294
Google.

255
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,375
Well, a better example, Amazon

256
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,169
is a huge consumer of, I want to say Zen, right,

257
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,450
the the hypervisor stuff for their cloud,

258
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,530
but they don't

259
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:13,669
like ship it

260
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,450
per se

261
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,500
in the traditional sense of the word. Like

262
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,840
my understanding is like with Amazon Outpost, you can actually get hardware,

263
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:23,109
running it on premises, but it's not like you get to log in there and, like,

264
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,270
run your update on it.

265
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:25,840
You know, my understanding is it's,

266
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,739
it's a piece of Amazon's cloud that just

267
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,909
happens to physically reside on your premises.

268
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,750
Exactly. You know,

269
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,830
so, like, is Amazon shipping, Zen,

270
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,390
they're probably running more copies of it than anyone on the planet.

271
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,070
Right. Right. Exactly.

272
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,150
And, and, well, in fact, even to make it more crazy is I,

273
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,030
I remember reading this was a while ago.

274
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,260
I,

275
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,630
I looked into it at all but Amazon announced they

276
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,270
were going to start moving to KBM for certain things.

277
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,830
So now it's even crazier

278
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:55,010
and they also have silicon on dye doing stuff. So it's like

279
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:55,559
it

280
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,780
-- knows what they're doing at
-- this

281
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:59,130
-- point.
-- Bonkers, everything going on. So anyway,

282
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,309
like this is,

283
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,969
I think one of the fundamental problems were disclosure we, we're putting on our,

284
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:08,390
our security researcher hat is you find a security problem.

285
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,309
What, who do you tell? How do you report this to anybody

286
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,070
-- is question one who owns
-- this thing is not always clear,

287
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,849
you know, uh, like something like open SSL or Apache. Ok.

288
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:22,500
There's like the Open SSL Foundation and the Apache Foundation or, you know,

289
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,919
you find a flaw in a Microsoft product.

290
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:24,309
There's

291
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,789
microsoft.com, like, ok, good.

292
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,320
But you don't know who to talk to yet, but you know,

293
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,169
which general direction to point your email.

294
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,359
Sure. Versus like Lib Jasper,

295
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,479
you know, I hate to pick on Lib Jasper but, you know,

296
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:39,559
it was written as a thesis project and the guy wrote it and

297
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:42,020
it's who maintains Luke Jasper.

298
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,340
-- Uh
-- maybe nobody in some cases it could be a guy, it could be a github

299
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:46,950
repo.

300
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,580
-- I
-- think Google for a while was doing kind

301
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,059
of keeping caring and feeding it a little bit.

302
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,429
But,

303
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,419
yeah, I mean, it's just, some of the stuff is like, it's just abandoned or whatever.

304
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:58,989
It's not clear, kind of who owns it. Like it's in uh

305
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,609
XML XML hash dogs, right?

306
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:04,849
There's a piece of code that's been copied everywhere or like the zip, you know,

307
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,570
zip is copied into all the songs

308
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,210
software. So it will compile on Windows natively without a whole bunch of hassle,

309
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,900
right? Who owns that zip code?

310
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:16,690
Well, you embedded it and it's diverged from, I guess where you copied it from.

311
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,140
Yeah, but ignoring the ownership, I'm a security researcher.

312
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,440
Where do I go?

313
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:24,609
Do I, I mean, you look at like, in the case of the SNCC guys,

314
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,219
when we talk to them about Zip Slip,

315
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:30,119
they actually spent effort reaching out to like literally

316
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,099
hundreds of projects that had embedded the source code.

317
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,289
-- And if I'm just a guy who, who did this,
-- that's an amazing amount of effort. Yeah.

318
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:41,280
-- Right.
-- Exactly. I mean, if you're just a researcher

319
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,559
there, you can't do that. There's no way.

320
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,669
Well, I remember those, the guys that found Http Poxy came and I was like,

321
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,320
do you want me to handle this?

322
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,109
Like the notification piece? And they're like, oh Lord, yes, like, thank you.

323
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,599
You know,

324
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,070
because that was literally my job and it was

325
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,150
literally like these were software guys from New Zealand.

326
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,739
Like they don't,

327
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:03,380
they're not a security vendor, you know, they just found this horrible flaw.

328
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,919
Oh my goodness. We're like, we're like halfway through this episode and we

329
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,650
are still on the very beginning of the very

330
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:11,234
-- and
-- I think that's,

331
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:15,375
that's fundamentally the problem here that I there you go in a nutshell folks.

332
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:16,455
That's disclosure.

333
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:18,294
It's a giant mess.

334
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:20,445
It, it, it's, it is,

335
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,145
it's so hard to do and there's so many

336
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:25,054
opinions and everyone thinks you should do it differently and

337
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:29,419
-- it's just, it's so hard.
-- Well, and then this ignores the fact.

338
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:33,099
Like, remember when a couple of the automakers came out a few years ago saying

339
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,280
we will not sue you if you try to disclose flaws to us.

340
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,140
And you know what that was actually progress.

341
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,979
It was huge. Progress

342
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,565
seems insane when you think about it.

343
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:48,164
But that was a problem where researchers would report an

344
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:50,804
issue to a company and the company would sue them,

345
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:52,765
-- which is, or threaten
-- to sue them.

346
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:53,284
Right.

347
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,325
-- You know, to stifle them.
-- Exactly.

348
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,395
It is, it is something else.

349
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:58,565
It's a thing. All right.

350
00:14:59,289 --> 00:14:59,979
Right. Right.

351
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:04,770
So, anyway, anyway, back to the horrible topic we've decided to talk about.

352
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:08,159
We've got the issue of, let's say I'm a researcher

353
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:14,640
and I somehow figure out who to contact, let's say I contact Microsoft because

354
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,750
they're big

355
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:16,599
and they,

356
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:22,460
it's well known how to contact them. They even have a bug bounty in some cases.

357
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:27,039
Well, even beyond a bug bounty, what I love is not only do they have a bug bounty and,

358
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:27,520
you know,

359
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,570
work well with the researchers now.

360
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,960
But, um, I don't know if you remember, but at RS A or at black hat rather well.

361
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:35,880
And Rs A they had that wall of like,

362
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,280
our most valuable bug bounty participants and like,

363
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,109
they're celebrating them and like, yay.

364
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:46,510
But one issue too, that is more of a complicated problem in the open source space.

365
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,750
Not so much in the commercial space.

366
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,919
In the commercial space,

367
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,840
you typically know which vendor sold you this thing and that's the only

368
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,659
or whatever, who did this software

369
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,520
and they're the only ones that did that software.

370
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,880
Whereas in the open source world stuff gets embedded and copied around a lot.

371
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,679
Or vendors distribute it.

372
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,260
You know,

373
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,880
there's only one entity really distributing Microsoft Word that's Microsoft.

374
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:06,390
But for like openness,

375
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:06,864
well,

376
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,744
those are different problems.

377
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:10,424
And let's,

378
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:12,534
let's just pick on Microsoft here because I

379
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,765
think the story is easier to tell because there's

380
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:17,244
-- corner cases
-- they went from terrible to OK.

381
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:20,325
Compared to everyone else, they're pretty good. I'm not going to lie to you.

382
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:21,044
So here's the thing.

383
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:23,505
You're a researcher, you find a full on a Microsoft product,

384
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,015
you report it to Microsoft.

385
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:29,205
Ideally Microsoft will say, wow, thanks, good job.

386
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,210
You know, here's the money we're going to credit you whatever.

387
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:35,070
They're, they're good about that and then they release an update,

388
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,390
people install the update, everyone, rejoices.

389
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,520
We're all done. Right.

390
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,700
Well, except for the case, you know, where somebody's like,

391
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,270
we have a 90 day disclosure policy and Microsoft, like,

392
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,010
I think it was one case they wanted like 92 days and it was like, well, nope, 90 days

393
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,229
-- and that's
-- fine.

394
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,489
I seem to remember. It made them pretty grumpy.

395
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,780
Probably.

396
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:54,320
I know there was something recently that,

397
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,809
that project Zero reported to them that went over and

398
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:00,229
they were, they were cool about it. They, they did, right.

399
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,979
But anyway, so, right, you can have issues with you could,

400
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,030
you could as a researcher reporting something you could

401
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,630
say you have 90 days or I'm going public.

402
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:10,410
You can,

403
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,290
you can say I expect

404
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,598
that you will wear a chicken suit when you announce this right, you can make like,

405
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:19,709
any crazy demand you want on the person you report.

406
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:22,989
It doesn't mean they're going to listen. But that's one thing to keep in mind is

407
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,780
sometimes when you report something,

408
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,339
some of these vendors are going to try to push you around and here's the deal,

409
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,609
you don't have to take it.

410
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,979
-- Well,
-- unless they threaten to sue you

411
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:33,160
and you. Well, yes, there is that

412
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:37,239
this is not legal advice, but if somebody threatens to sue you,

413
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,479
probably go talk to a lawyer.

414
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,010
Yeah.

415
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,229
Call the eff or somebody in that case, if you're,

416
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,849
if you're doing good working with the open source.

417
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:45,390
But, but anyway, here's the thing.

418
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,900
Now you could build Microsoft and they might say we don't think this is a security

419
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,109
issue or they might say this isn't serious and we're going to fix it in next year

420
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,550
or whatever. Right. It could be some who knows.

421
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,119
And as a researcher that's where things start to get dicey.

422
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,939
So let's say Microsoft says, I don't think this is a security issue and let's face it.

423
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,020
Like with, with that problem,

424
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,589
Tavis just found with whatever I forget the name of the,

425
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,989
the technology and Windows that's been there forever.

426
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,849
It would not shock me if he'd found it not done enough research,

427
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,430
went to Microsoft and they'd be like

428
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,030
this is unexploited. No.

429
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:17,790
Right.

430
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,189
And then what,

431
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:20,329
-- what, what now
-- Well,

432
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:20,479
see,

433
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:23,290
and my thought always there was if the vendor says it's not a vulnerability, cool,

434
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,469
then I am, I'll just publish it publicly because it's not a vulnerability, right?

435
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:32,469
And that is exactly the right way to look at it is if the vendor says not an issue,

436
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,859
then you can take it to the court of public opinion and say,

437
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:37,920
look what I found and sometimes you might be wrong.

438
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,859
Sometimes, you know, the world might look at it and just say you're an idiot.

439
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,260
You know, this is, this is nothing

440
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,040
and that happens sometimes like it totally does. I, I agree with you.

441
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,939
If a vendor says, not a problem, we're not fixing that or something.

442
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:51,489
I think there should be no, no question

443
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,939
that bringing it public is totally the way to go.

444
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,540
But now at the same time,

445
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,140
you can be a vendor and you get a report and it

446
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,410
could be a ridiculous requirement where someone could say in seven days,

447
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,900
-- I'm going to publish this
-- well, or I want a million dollars in a monster truck,

448
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:08,089
which is a fair request.

449
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,739
But right. Exactly. You could end up with some sort of

450
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,880
response like that.

451
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,140
And now at the same time, if you're a vendor working with a difficult researcher,

452
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:21,300
there's also nothing wrong with basically saying, you know, thanks for doing this.

453
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,329
You do. You, we're going to fix this our way

454
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:25,890
-- and, and cutting, cutting ties. Oh Yeah.
-- No.

455
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,280
I've definitely had to deal with people trying to number one report

456
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,260
things that are not vulnerabilities to like the cloud security lines,

457
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,949
you know, saying things like you don't have D

458
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,229
Mark set up and it's like, well,

459
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:39,560
80% of the top websites don't because they don't, you know, we have SPF and DC

460
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,050
MD

461
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:40,589
Mark doesn't

462
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,420
help

463
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,589
and things like that and, and, you know, and also they were wanting money and

464
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,709
stuff for us to pay them and it's like we,

465
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,270
I don't know that we can legally do that without so much

466
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,189
paperwork and I don't even know where to begin with that,

467
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:53,439
you know.

468
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:55,109
W eight Ben and all that.

469
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:55,630
Yeah.

470
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,140
Bug bunnies are great for that because they actually do all the vetting and all the,

471
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,540
the background nonsense.

472
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,260
Who knew doing your accounting legally was hard. So

473
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,560
you're willing to break the law. It's no big deal. But, yeah,

474
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,660
to me it's, it's a continuum of, sort of maturity and capability. Right.

475
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,630
Because there's a lot of places that are

476
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,420
wanting to do the right thing,

477
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,699
but they physically cannot because they don't have the talent or the,

478
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:22,250
the resources and there's a lot of places well,

479
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,060
that have neither the will nor the strength of technology to do the right thing.

480
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:27,540
And there is that yes.

481
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,300
And then there are places that kind of technically should have the ability

482
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,680
to, you know, do things better, like all the skate vendors,

483
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:38,199
the large ones should be able to do security.

484
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:41,959
They definitely have the money. You know, these companies are posting profits

485
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,650
but they generally don't have much of a security team if any.

486
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,229
And, and part of that too boils down to like who you're going to hire

487
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:48,770
it

488
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,520
cost money.

489
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:50,099
Like

490
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,199
it's not even that it costs money. It's ok. So

491
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:59,032
you have, let's say you have the ability to do computer security and skater work.

492
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,713
Are you going to ever be

493
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:02,243
looking for work?

494
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:05,552
No, there's going to be people coming to you trying to hire you constantly.

495
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:09,542
-- Right. There's just not enough people to do this,
-- even if you don't do SK to work.

496
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:09,953
Right.

497
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:14,333
If you're a security person, it's, it's a good time to be employed.

498
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,392
Yeah. If you're remotely competent, you're fine.

499
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,753
Even if you're not,

500
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:20,113
-- you're fine. Yeah.
-- No, that's

501
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:22,505
actually, yeah, that's sadly true.

502
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:27,186
Right. Right. Because if they ever, if confidence mattered I'd be homeless. So,

503
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:28,666
it's right. Right.

504
00:21:28,676 --> 00:21:32,465
Like, II, I just keep thinking in my head what we're talking about here and this,

505
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:36,985
this is all so complicated and so difficult. And I guess that is

506
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,625
the thing I keep coming back to all the time is

507
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:44,066
when you're reporting to an organization,

508
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,319
I think it's easy

509
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:48,949
to assume ill intent right away.

510
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,760
And in fact,

511
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,010
-- I've seen this more than once for someone to report something basically say,
-- well,

512
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,239
the fundamental attribution error.

513
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,640
Right. That guy cut me off. In traffic. He was plotting to do this all month.

514
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,969
The reality is the majority of these vendors that are bad at security are just, well,

515
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:05,180
they're enterprise vendors that are kind of slow and big and not,

516
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:08,430
they're just not great at, like responding quickly.

517
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:11,199
-- A
-- lot of them don't actually know what to do. And in fact,

518
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,500
there have been so many times I've tried to contact

519
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,800
a company and it's like you put on Twitter,

520
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,219
hey, I'm looking for a security contact at this company.

521
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:22,589
Does somebody know anyone? Because it's like I can't even find where to put this.

522
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,079
My son went to a summer camp

523
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,849
and they sent out a survey. How was your summer camp? Would you come again?

524
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:29,260
What would you improve stuff like that? Right.

525
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,219
The usual except they cc everybody who registered like,

526
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:36,160
so there was like over 100 people on this CC list

527
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,280
number two and I was like, whatever archive, ignore it.

528
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:41,449
Hope to God, there's no reply all storm,

529
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,579
but then some of the emails out a virus to it. And so I replied to the original sender

530
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,880
and their hr and a bunch of others pointing out that like, yeah,

531
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,880
really messed up here.

532
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,170
You need to train your employees.

533
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,000
This is, you know AAA privacy violation and a GDPR violation.

534
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,359
And you know,

535
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,569
there's also now this virus running around and it's a liability issue

536
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,219
and like hr you need to like address this because it's,

537
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:04,780
it's a liability issue for you now.

538
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,910
And, uh, it's, you know, it's been a couple of hours. No reply.

539
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,869
Probably not that important.

540
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,510
-- Probably
-- not. They, they,

541
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,910
they, you know what they did, they click the, uh,

542
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,510
this is a crazy person button on you and now you'll never get to talk to them again.

543
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,069
Yeah.

544
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,770
But, uh, it just, you know, and I,

545
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,199
it's funny because I actually know people of this organization who I

546
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:25,650
could talk to and they would understand and probably be like,

547
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,479
oh, God, we did what?

548
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:31,349
-- But if I, like, try to go in through the front door. Yeah.
-- Right. It's, it's hard

549
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:34,130
and I guess at the same time that you can make the argument,

550
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,630
this is part of the value that comes

551
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:37,995
with hiring good security people because you'll probably

552
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:40,475
be able to find somebody at the organization.

553
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,965
-- But that, that's, that's not
-- right.

554
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:42,176
Well,

555
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,036
the problem is not only do you have to hire good security people but you have to

556
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:49,936
let them do their job and a lot of places you sort of can't because for example,

557
00:23:49,946 --> 00:23:50,546
again,

558
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,965
I remember it's like we want to make a

559
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:53,995
public statement explaining what happened and they're like,

560
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,836
well, the lawyers have to approve it first.

561
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:59,625
-- Uh, yes. Right.
-- Because I mean, an admission of liability,

562
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:00,946
that's

563
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:01,472
a

564
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:03,222
-- little bit scary
-- sometimes.

565
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:04,732
So, so anyway, anyway,

566
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:07,182
disclosure, we're nearly out of time. So we'll,

567
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:09,182
maybe we'll do a two parter because there's

568
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:11,291
a lot of open source disclosure things that

569
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:14,942
I think we need to talk about also here because those are super interesting and,

570
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,582
and super important as well.

571
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:19,682
So here's the one thing I guess I always think about when

572
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:24,011
we talk about disclosure is if you are reporting to someone,

573
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,021
be polite and assume the person on the other end

574
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,430
either doesn't understand you

575
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,160
or doesn't know what's going on if they're not talking to you in the way you expect.

576
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,239
Or in some cases,

577
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,040
it could be a matter of like English as a second language for some people.

578
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:42,680
Well, even more simply put as a security researcher,

579
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,140
it's kind of like being a car salesman.

580
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,439
You sell a lot of cars, people don't buy a lot of cars.

581
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:51,420
Most projects handle a literal handful of security vulnerabilities every year.

582
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,349
So they're not really gonna get good at it because they don't, you know,

583
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,310
if you only do something once a quarter.

584
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:58,349
Right. Right.

585
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,150
Yeah, it's, it's new every time you do it versus you do something once a day,

586
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,849
hopefully a little better of

587
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:04,150
it,

588
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:04,920
you know,

589
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,880
have checklists and stuff

590
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,430
and, you know, and,

591
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:11,500
and that to me is fundamentally one of the problems is a company like Microsoft can

592
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,670
have hundreds of products that each only have one or two security flaws a year.

593
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,920
But because they can centralize those resources, they can have the MS RC,

594
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,500
the Microsoft Security something.

595
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,030
Center

596
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:22,810
response center Thank you.

597
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:25,739
Yeah, research response remediation,

598
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,430
whatever those MS RC people can be good at this.

599
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:31,900
Like it's literally their full time job. But you know, you find like some,

600
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:37,489
some random open source project, they probably don't have a security

601
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,589
-- team
-- and, and we will, we will get to that, we will get to that in the next episode.

602
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,949
And now on the other side though,

603
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,349
I want to say if you are a vendor receiving a report from a researcher and

604
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,160
you feel like they are hostile or you don't like

605
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,469
their tone or you don't like what they're doing.

606
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:59,060
It becomes a situation of these people could be grumpy because they

607
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:02,430
just got told off by somebody or they're working with a difficult other

608
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,270
person or company or whatever.

609
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,910
And so again, it comes down to one of those, you know,

610
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,890
be patient and be respectful and be mindful and that can go a long way.

611
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,569
Now, sometimes you can just be working with the jerk and that goes both ways,

612
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,380
be researcher or vendor, right?

613
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,099
And, and sometimes you just have to agree to disagree on some of these issues.

614
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:23,849
And that, that can be just the way it is, but it is,

615
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,810
again,

616
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:27,829
it kind of comes down to just be polite and ask a lot of questions

617
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,800
and communicate constantly when a researcher comes to you as a vendor and says,

618
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,790
-- I found something,
-- oh man, when they go radio silent for a week.

619
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,439
-- Or two at a time.
-- It's terrible.

620
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:39,430
-- So,
-- even, just, even an email saying we're still working on it.

621
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:40,469
Yep. Exactly.

622
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:44,030
Exactly. It is up to the vendor in effect. Like I even think of this.

623
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,510
I mean, I'm guilty of this where I,

624
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,910
I try to reach out once a week to the people who report things to us but

625
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:53,050
it doesn't always happen and sometimes I forget and then of course,

626
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,630
I apologize profusely because it's like I know what this is like.

627
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,939
It sucks. I I'm sorry, but it is

628
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,579
when you are the vendor, it is your job to initiate and hold communication.

629
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:05,359
It is not their job to ask you questions and come to you.

630
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:08,380
They already gave you a gift, you need to do something with it.

631
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,579
And now I will also say though there is the added,

632
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:15,260
I guess complexity of bug bounties that goes on top of this

633
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:20,219
and bug bunnies are special because they give the vendor the ability

634
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:24,170
to coerce the reporter into behaving in the way they want.

635
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:26,689
Well, not even coerce but to signal.

636
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:29,449
I mean, it's one thing to have a disclosure policy that's good,

637
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,660
but to have a disclosure policy and say, and we pay cash,

638
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,810
I'm comfortable calling it coercion.

639
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:39,130
Well, if some do it as coercion for sure, like, you know, well,

640
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,430
to pick on like Apple again,

641
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:45,890
Apple really is, you know, they're all about brand and brand marketing protection,

642
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,339
right?

643
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:49,239
Like and I get it. That's, that's kind of apple shtick. Right.

644
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,729
They're a marketing brand company

645
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,109
that makes technology and they're very good at

646
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,920
it. Yeah, they, they don't want anybody pooping on their brand.

647
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,420
Right. Right. You can get into situations where

648
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,000
I bag

649
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
bni might say,

650
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,689
here's your money now.

651
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:05,839
Never talk about this to anyone ever again under any circumstances.

652
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:06,550
And it's like,

653
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,290
what?

654
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,920
Well, that's how a lot of, like, you know,

655
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,439
you read the old stories about the finance industry, that's basically how,

656
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:15,900
you know, they were infamous for trying to sweep stuff under the rug constantly.

657
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,160
Sure.

658
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,219
-- And there's a lots of industries like that,
-- like, and in fact, right,

659
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:24,390
that's where a lot of the laws came into play that now say you have to talk about this,

660
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,020
you can't just pretend everything's fine.

661
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:28,579
Well, and you still see them discussing like if it's what,

662
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:30,300
what exactly does breach mean?

663
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,069
You know, like,

664
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,979
-- you know,
-- exactly.

665
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,030
-- That depends what the definition of is, is
-- like Equifax with there,

666
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,930
there was no data breached except for the following list

667
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,439
and then they listed out like a million Canadians.

668
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,420
That's right.

669
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:47,300
Oh, I love it. All right. Anyway, let's cut this one

670
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,800
and we will continue on with open source because I

671
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,979
