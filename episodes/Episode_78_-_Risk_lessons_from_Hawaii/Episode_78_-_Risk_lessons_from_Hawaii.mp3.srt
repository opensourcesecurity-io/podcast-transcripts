Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 78 with myself,

1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,329
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,069
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,829
We've been doing this for a while now.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,260
And if, when we started,

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,649
you had told me that we would have an episode where we talk about a,

6
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,629
a missile attack warning.

7
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:26,760
I would have said you're crazy.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,069
Yeah, I, I'd agree. These things aren't supposed to go wrong like this.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,270
I,

10
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:32,400
I

11
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,880
don't even know what to say.

12
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:34,479
I, I actually,

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,259
I wrote a blog post that that's going to be published at some point in the near future.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,869
And like I started out and I'm just like,

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,080
II, I don't even know how to frame this because

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,159
I don't know what I would do if, if something like this happened, it's just anyway,

17
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:50,229
why don't before we get too crazy,

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,759
why don't you explain to the audience what event has just occurred

19
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,040
that has like made all of our heads explode.

20
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:01,119
So Saturday morning, there was apparently a shift change at the

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,519
Ha Hawaii Emergency Management Agency

22
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:08,330
and apparently as part of the shift change, they test

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,120
the emergency alarm.

24
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:13,980
Uh sorry, the emergency alert system and the emergency alert system.

25
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:19,019
Uh, well, the old timey parts are like actual physical, like giant sirens that go,

26
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,580
you know, w or whatever.

27
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,400
Do you guys have that in Canada?

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,180
We used to and actually there used to be one down by the traffic circle on 107 to 1 42nd.

29
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,400
But they removed them about. Hm. I'm gonna go with 30 some years ago

30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,839
-- because quite frankly
-- the alarms,

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,139
the

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,319
physical giant sirens from like the 19 sixties,

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,239
we still have them all over the place. In fact, at noon on Wednesdays they go off,

34
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:42,669
you

35
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,669
-- probably get like tornadoes and stuff. Right.
-- We do. Actually, that's true. The

36
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,790
tornadoes are when they generally go off.

37
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:51,480
I know if it's not noon on Wednesday, like something bad is going to happen

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,080
unless a tornado happens on. No. Well, we'll get, that's another

39
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:54,400
failure

40
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:54,959
we'll get into.

41
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,220
But

42
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:57,150
on

43
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:57,760
Wednesday,

44
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,309
yeah, Edmonton is lucky. We had a tornado

45
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,830
known as the Edmonton tornado. So

46
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,889
we don't, it's not really a problem

47
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,050
anyways.

48
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,669
So, uh, the emergency alert system, uh, is also, you know,

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,960
where you get that horrible noise on your TV.

50
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,440
That sounds like a modem connecting,

51
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,509
which is actually audio encoded information followed by the e,

52
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,320
you know, splitting beat

53
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:20,880
and then whatever message, you know,

54
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,880
and then also now because, you know, we're not living in 1990

55
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,419
although the telecoms are still apparently,

56
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,119
uh, they can just broadcast alerts out to, like, all the cell phones. Right.

57
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,800
Which is, let's face it, realistically,

58
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:35,919
I, I don't know anybody now that,

59
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:36,710
like,

60
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:38,449
doesn't have a cell phone

61
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:39,800
to put it bluntly,

62
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:40,330
except

63
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,220
for maybe my kids and it's more a matter of we're buying them this year.

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,839
There are corner cases. I'm willing to agree to that.

65
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,490
I think fundamentally you're probably covering more than

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,320
80% of the population at this point.

67
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,580
Well,

68
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,940
and more to the point they have their cell phone

69
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,020
with them and it's turned on whereas like a TV,

70
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:55,089
I,

71
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,559
I don't, I haven't had broadcast TV now in

72
00:02:58,899 --> 00:02:59,839
seven years.

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,600
Yeah, seven years.

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,110
Um, I admit I have it but it's rarely on

75
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,529
or the other classic one being radio,

76
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,509
which again, you know, very few people have a radio on, like,

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,830
some people at work or whatever, I guess.

78
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,190
But in general it's not like we listen to the radio

79
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,190
all the time, like

80
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:17,470
whatever.

81
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,649
Uh, so anyways during shift change they test the alarm, the alert system

82
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,550
and apparently somebody literally fat fingered it

83
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:27,309
and sent out an alarm,

84
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,669
an alert saying, you know, inbound missile

85
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,550
which

86
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,020
like, not a drill.

87
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:36,399
And then they sent out another one about two minutes later saying this is not a drill.

88
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,300
This is for real.

89
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:38,830
Right. Right.

90
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,630
And

91
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,960
that's the thing that kind of blows my mind is when I read this story,

92
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,470
the first thing I thought of is like, well,

93
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,309
why didn't you just like send a whole bunch of sorry, just to test

94
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,270
say there's no fire when you said there's a

95
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,649
fire until you officially can say there's no fire.

96
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,580
And that requires for example, getting the military to confirm that there is no.

97
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,270
So, so

98
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,710
yes, that I agree with that, but from what I gather,

99
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,190
they knew within three minutes

100
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:10,419
that it was verifiably false

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,220
and then it took them 38 minutes to send a whoops, sorry message,

102
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,059
which is,

103
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,899
well, this is one of those

104
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:22,980
minutes, man, when you think you're going to die is a long, long time.

105
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,700
Well, a perfect example of this is during the Edmonton tornado back in the eighties,

106
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,369
uh Alberta environment,

107
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,459
basically kind of didn't know what to do

108
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,339
because they've never dealt with this before.

109
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,700
And so, for example, they had a confirmed tornado touchdown sighting.

110
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,540
And uh my mom used to work there and like, literally, she's like, so like,

111
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:40,049
what do we do now?

112
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:41,179
Do we hide in the parkade?

113
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,720
Like do we move to the middle of the building?

114
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,049
Like who, how do we send out an emergency alert? Like

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,859
it literally had never come up.

116
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,779
And so the tornado alert was delayed quite a bit because basically, like they,

117
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,859
they didn't have,

118
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,450
well, there's two parts of this one, you have to have a plan and two,

119
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:01,089
you have to actually test the plan and train to the plan.

120
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:01,440
So,

121
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,070
so you're saying they knew there was a tornado

122
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,269
and because they didn't exactly know what to do,

123
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,760
they didn't tell people there was

124
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,500
-- a,
-- there was no way to tell them really.

125
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,420
There was no plan, there was no training who do we contact.

126
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,910
And more to the point, like, once we've done that do, like,

127
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,320
literally do we all go hide in the park?

128
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,579
Like, what's the deal?

129
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,029
Do we drive home

130
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,179
straight up that?

131
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:22,059
No. Seriously.

132
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,459
Actually, that's the whole point of the blog post I wrote was the fact that like,

133
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,399
I don't know what to do.

134
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,619
Well,

135
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,170
I kind of do now because actually you and I

136
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:32,140
did some talking about this over slack or yes slack,

137
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,730
no signal uh signal yesterday.

138
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,149
But this is one of those things that like,

139
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,149
I didn't know what to do

140
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,540
during a missile attack. So,

141
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,309
like,

142
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,589
what would I have done?

143
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:45,239
And, and look, I'm, I'm

144
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,589
one of the things I've realized is like, basically in almost any situation,

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,140
the best advice is just don't do anything right?

146
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:55,070
Like sit down and cover your head literally like rock in the corner and

147
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,760
-- sob
-- is this literally happened at probably about the best time it could,

148
00:05:58,769 --> 00:05:59,880
which was a Saturday morning

149
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,929
-- because imagine if this had happened when people had their kids at school?
-- Oh

150
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,489
my goodness, man. That would have been crazy. Holy cow.

151
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,540
Although I bet schools have a very defined lockdown procedure for

152
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,059
funny enough, I bet they schools probably have a plan for this.

153
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,489
It's, I'm sure it's in an old binder from the fifties.

154
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:20,739
That's anyways.

155
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,899
Um, but, uh, the real pro, well, for example,

156
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,709
one of the real problems in Hawaii was everybody was going, some of the people,

157
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,040
not everybody, rather, some of the people were going batshit crazy and, like,

158
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:31,179
driving down the wrong side of the road at 100 miles an hour,

159
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,820
apparently trying to get wherever they felt they needed to go.

160
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:39,220
But I believe that because people panic and they, they make poor decisions

161
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:44,019
and no, I, I totally get it. And actually that's one of the things

162
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,510
I talk about as well in, in my post was that look, when,

163
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,000
when you don't know what you're doing,

164
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,399
you can't plan for the unknown and,

165
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,029
and like poor decisions are basically the

166
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,929
-- only decision
-- I'm gonna disagree with you.

167
00:06:55,269 --> 00:07:00,029
You can kind of roughly plan for the unknown by having some general guidelines,

168
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,109
like, for example,

169
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,910
uh having seven days of food and water in your basement

170
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:07,019
because something undefinable bad might happen that,

171
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,230
you know, prevents food and water from being available for a few days. Right.

172
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,600
Um, the real problem is like these, you know, these people had absolutely no plan.

173
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:19,429
Like, what do, what do I do? Do I hide? Do I get my family together? Do I,

174
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,880
you know, what do I do with the pets? Do I let them loose? Do I put them in a kennel?

175
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:24,809
Um,

176
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:25,649
I

177
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,579
mean, it used to be that people would have, you know,

178
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,019
maybe a shelter in their basement and,

179
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:34,019
or at least a few days of food and water or for example,

180
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,760
know that maybe you want to fill out the bathtub

181
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,170
with water so that you have a few weeks of water

182
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,250
in the event of the water supply being cut off.

183
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,910
I mean, you know, I, I won't disagree with you.

184
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,679
There, there are probably certain things you could do and I think you're getting

185
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,059
maybe a little more advanced,

186
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,100
but for example,

187
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:54,519
here we can have a really bad snowstorm that messes up food deliveries.

188
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,140
That, that has never happened.

189
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:59,339
But realistically, I mean, where I live here in Edmonton. Yeah, it could.

190
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,250
Ok. Look, now, you, you just made the point. I was hoping we'd get to eventually is,

191
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:06,619
yes, it is conceivable that could happen,

192
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:09,239
but it is far more likely that you're going to slip

193
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,179
on the ice in your driveway and hit your head.

194
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,579
You have people worried about planning for, you know,

195
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:18,660
crazy events when just like go buy some freaking salt for your driveway, man.

196
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,559
And, and you're going to be way better off than that. Right.

197
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,179
Well, to me, part of it too is like, it's like having a spare tire.

198
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,950
If you have a spare tire and you have a flat tire, then life is annoying but not so bad.

199
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,500
But if you're in the middle of nowhere with a flat tire and no spare,

200
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:34,058
you kind of now have potentially a crisis

201
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,758
-- at the
-- same time though.

202
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:40,347
Are you carrying around extra antifreeze, extra oil,

203
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:44,838
extra transmission fluid and, and you know, a few extra spark plugs just in case,

204
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:45,119
right?

205
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:45,468
Like

206
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,179
those things don't break, but I do get flat tires.

207
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:54,729
Well, they, they do break, but I think flat tires are, are infinitely more common

208
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,739
than many others.

209
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,969
Well, and not only that, like,

210
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:00,330
I guess if you kind of look at the,

211
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,450
the events that could happen to a car because let's face it,

212
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,419
everyone's cars are breaking down all the time.

213
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,799
Uh, flat tire is pretty universal

214
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,840
and then it's like long tail after that, right?

215
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,169
Where, who knows what's going to happen

216
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,969
and the vast majority of other things you just can't prepare for.

217
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:16,549
And that's kind of,

218
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,609
that's the thing I keep thinking of in the context of something like this is,

219
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:20,570
I mean,

220
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:24,369
how do you just, how do you deal with something like that? Right.

221
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,869
It's crazy to think about.

222
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,280
Well, I mean, this is for me where it comes back to, you know, for example,

223
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:30,960
most government, uh,

224
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,799
sort of preparedness websites go with the general guidelines

225
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,400
of having three days of food and water,

226
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,679
you know, so you basically can like,

227
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,919
bunker down in your house for three days and not die or get hungry.

228
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,479
But not only that, I,

229
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:48,260
I think that one is more important because in most emergency situations, like,

230
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,919
don't go anywhere

231
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,789
is the most important thing you can do. And if you don't, unless

232
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:52,929
it's

233
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,159
clear water, you have to go somewhere.

234
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,859
Well, unless it's like one of those, you know, a great example,

235
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,710
being a hurricane where like, no, you need to get out of the way of that thing,

236
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,159
you know. But in general, in many cases, yes,

237
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,909
you know, hurricanes or like a tidal wave.

238
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,940
But in general, like those, well,

239
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,510
hurricanes are a great example because they happen like every year,

240
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,109
several times a year, you know, like we, you know, even, you know,

241
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,640
predefined hurricane season,

242
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:21,770
like this is not some unexpected. Oh my God, this has never happened before.

243
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,460
No, it's like

244
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,919
literally like

245
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,760
those poor islands in the Caribbean statistically

246
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,510
get clobbered by a hurricane every,

247
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,099
you know, number of X decades

248
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:31,280
they do.

249
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:31,799
But now,

250
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,780
like what happened to Puerto Rico is a fine

251
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:36,799
example of that is not a common occurrence.

252
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:37,659
And,

253
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,330
and that was the sort of thing that you couldn't

254
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,270
really prepare for in any meaningful way right now.

255
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,239
Granted, I, I mean,

256
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,929
we could argue and I don't want to get into the politics of

257
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,409
it all because obviously the clean up effort is going very badly.

258
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:49,450
But like

259
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,599
there, there are events you just cannot plan for and, and I think,

260
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,630
well, it's, it's not

261
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,080
for them. It's uneconomical to plan for them.

262
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,739
Ah, yes, that, that does make more sense. Right.

263
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,840
Because actually that's a great point because, like, I could,

264
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,890
I could build a house out of, like,

265
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,559
concrete and lead and probably survive a missile attack.

266
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,799
But the reality is, well, I probably can't afford it. But even if I could, like,

267
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,390
-- I, I probably wouldn't ever see a return on that investment.
-- Right. Exactly.

268
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:17,570
Well, no,

269
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,359
that's why I think something like three days or seven days of food and water,

270
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,229
you're out maybe 100 bucks.

271
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:24,349
And it's one of those things where,

272
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,549
you know, I can also use that to go camping

273
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,059
when I have to rotate in

274
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,070
-- early or whatever.
-- I mean, we have a freezer in the basement and,

275
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,429
and we have like,

276
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,909
like a cabinet full of food down there as well where we put the extra stuff.

277
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,679
Right. Like,

278
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,469
I suspect if you, if you have kids

279
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:40,859
you probably

280
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,359
about

281
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:42,710
-- three days of
-- food.

282
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:46,460
Uh, no, if the electricity dies, well, my freezer would probably, it's,

283
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:47,340
it's relatively,

284
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:47,840
but

285
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,919
it would be frozen for a week. I, I bet I can get a week out of it.

286
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,080
And, well, that's like, uh, who was it? Someone told me once that in Florida

287
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:59,280
when the hurricanes are, like, after a hurricane and everyone lost power.

288
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:02,109
All you smell is cooking meat because everyone's like cooking

289
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,719
all the meat out of their freezer on their grills,

290
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,359
which is pretty sweet.

291
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:11,239
I mean, one of the best easiest ways to do this is just basically, if you go camping,

292
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,880
then by definition, you, you tend to have kind of the,

293
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,090
the minimum to survive out in the middle of nowhere.

294
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,450
I, I camp in a hotel.

295
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,270
I, I despise camping.

296
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,099
So,

297
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,260
um, but anyway, so back to the, the Hawaiian thing, I mean, so it literally, yeah. Um,

298
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,190
yeah, so quoting the thing,

299
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,099
you just pasted here from a drop down menu on a computer program, he saw two options,

300
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,010
quote, test missile alert, unquote and quote missile alert.

301
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,619
And you want to bet they were next to each other.

302
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,630
Well, it would be a pull

303
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,299
down, right?

304
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:45,140
So it would be one over the other and you know, yeah,

305
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,780
you missed that click by a millimeter and

306
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:50,780
I guess there was no like, are you really sure you wanted to click that?

307
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,559
And, and not only that,

308
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,250
how much do you want to bet that the user interface was one of those like train

309
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,469
wreck interfaces that has like 75,000 controls on

310
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,159
it because it can do a million things.

311
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:04,719
It was designed by someone who has no idea what A U I should look like.

312
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,359
Well, and here we're going to put this XK CD in the show notes, but it's, you know,

313
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:11,049
welcome to missile missile launch web interface.

314
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,219
Enter the targets coordinates,

315
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,520
enter your email address for our records into your email address again.

316
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,729
That's great. The coordinates are one, the email address is twice.

317
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,530
I mean, how many times I've seen that on like so many things anyways. But

318
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,690
so yeah, I mean, this is a great example of number one you had,

319
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:29,409
well,

320
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,760
obviously kind of a not great U I that made it very easy to choose the wrong thing.

321
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,450
And then like

322
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,570
when you were doing something that's going to have some real repercussions, like

323
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,619
at a minimum, you know, you do this at three in the morning,

324
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,210
it's going to literally wake everybody up.

325
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,369
Which kind of sucks

326
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,770
actually. So waking people up, that's a really interesting

327
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:50,830
thing you bring up. So, uh, my wife has a friend in Hawaii

328
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,950
and apparently he had like do not disturb on, on his iphone

329
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,250
and it didn't wake him up like he got the alert

330
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,830
and then he woke up and looked at his phone.

331
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,109
It was like, holy crap, what's going on

332
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,450
and obviously everything was like long done by then.

333
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,450
But, you know, like he, it did not wake him up and I'm thinking

334
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,789
on one side like

335
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,010
it won't be so bad, you know,

336
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,929
this will come still sleeping, everyone's happy, but on the other side, it's like,

337
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,590
man, that seems like a huge problem.

338
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,520
Well, the part of the problem is there's, there's not really

339
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,950
all these emergency alert systems were designed and

340
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,989
implemented like a decade or two ago,

341
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,950
right? Like the current one in Hawaii runs on two G,

342
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:31,419
not three G, not four G,

343
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:32,919
probably never five G

344
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,049
um you know, you gotta remember these things were designed back in the day of like,

345
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,859
ok, you know, Conal rad, we're gonna basically interrupt all the radios,

346
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,159
you know, and then they had the TV system with that, you know,

347
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:49,369
clever audio encoded information and some other hackery to kind of

348
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,210
push this thing through the TV system and even those fail.

349
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:52,869
Right?

350
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,570
Um And then you, you know, they try to go to cell phones.

351
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:58,750
Um What's really got me now is, you know,

352
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,729
that official kind of comment of like check the TW like

353
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,169
they, they didn't push out the uh update to the phones as fast as they could,

354
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,090
for example, update their Facebook and Twitter.

355
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,530
So like the emergency management agency,

356
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:15,469
like literally updated their Facebook page and feed saying like, whoops,

357
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,320
sorry about that,

358
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,299
you know, before they could push it out to the phones and stuff.

359
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,530
I mean, and the reality again is as ridiculous as that is, let's face it.

360
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,609
You know, if something goes weird, what do you, what's the first thing you do?

361
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:28,510
You Google it,

362
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,530
you check your Twitter, you check your Facebook,

363
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,289
I check Twitter usually because

364
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,650
what was it?

365
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:39,729
I think I read a thing once that, that some university researchers realized that

366
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,090
they could find out about earthquakes

367
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:46,289
like two minutes faster using Twitter than, than traditional uh

368
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,250
seismic

369
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,489
equipment they had available to them because on Twitter, obviously,

370
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,640
as soon as anyone feels anything they're like, they're all over it, you know?

371
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:56,250
And no, I find that because I remember

372
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,000
there was one time something happened, I don't even remember what it was.

373
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,570
It was a fire or, or,

374
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,369
oh, some sort of event I can't for the life of me remember now.

375
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,830
But, yeah, the first thing I did was check Twitter and sure enough,

376
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,950
like people were talking about it and I figured it out.

377
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,340
Well, I mean, Twitter is sort of the ultimate in that sort of crowdsourcing.

378
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:14,650
You know, you got your trending tags,

379
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,669
right? So as soon as an event has a tag and people start using it.

380
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,030
Yeah, like you're gonna see it

381
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:20,909
-- whether you like it or not.
-- Exactly.

382
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,429
No. Exactly. But, but I will say

383
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:30,210
I remember on September 11th, I was, I was working, it was my first job out of college,

384
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:30,630
in fact.

385
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,590
And like the internet quit working

386
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,469
and now granted, it was a different internet then than it is today necessarily.

387
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,270
But I'm still confident that

388
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,630
if something truly horrific happened,

389
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,469
the internet would probably struggle to keep up.

390
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:44,919
Well.

391
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:46,820
Yes and no, because for example,

392
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,000
you've got companies like cloud flare now pushing stuff out to the edges

393
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,919
and making it a lot more robust. Um, do you

394
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,479
remember CNN was their text only web page you could choose.

395
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,989
I do remember.

396
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:00,640
What event was that?

397
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,690
Oh, that was, that was the recent one.

398
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,719
And it was still like two megs but on 911 CNN went to a text only web page and it was,

399
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,479
at that time it was small but that was

400
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:13,079
before everyone had a million javascript trackers and websites.

401
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,979
But yeah, yeah, there was something that recently happened

402
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:17,858
-- and they went to,
-- it was, it was the hurricane

403
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,280
in Puerto

404
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:18,689
Rico

405
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,630
because, you know, people were on crappy cell phone, you know, with like

406
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:25,699
everybody else on their cell phone trying to figure out what's going on.

407
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:25,858
So, yeah,

408
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:27,819
-- they went to a text only except
-- wasn't the

409
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,380
text only page still like two megabytes or something.

410
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,180
-- It was
-- pretty tight.

411
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,880
Was it,

412
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,050
it was like straight up

413
00:17:33,229 --> 00:17:38,099
like a 1980 well, 19 nineties html web page. Like it was it loaded fast

414
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,119
and that's cool. I mean, I, I think that's totally the way to do it without question.

415
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:44,520
Yeah,

416
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,439
but um so in this case, I mean, apparently one of the big problems is that the uh

417
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,920
the telecom lobby who we all love.

418
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,530
Um,

419
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:58,469
speaking of which I gotta go yell at them about a cancellation fee, they charge me

420
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,260
for upgrading my service.

421
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,699
Um But anyways, um

422
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,189
apparently they've been lobbying against, you know,

423
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:07,819
letting these people have like a proper testing

424
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:09,300
of the alert system and everything because,

425
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,099
you know, it'd be kind of

426
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,420
difficult

427
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,780
to do and it would acquire some new standards and money and stuff.

428
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,060
So obviously they've pushed against it.

429
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,619
Um

430
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,979
And that's part of the problem here too. Right.

431
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:26,270
Uh I'm here to quote telecom companies are currently only required

432
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,979
to offer messages with a maximum length of 90 characters.

433
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:30,609
So that's like half of the old Twitter

434
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,930
uh of text. The one who I sent was 87 characters long until recently.

435
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:38,479
So called alert, originators could not send clickable links or phone numbers.

436
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:41,119
The geographic targeting of the alerts isn't particularly good

437
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,920
and they're presented only in English.

438
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,650
Uh And they don't tell people when an alert should become inactive,

439
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,170
which is a great example of something, right?

440
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,949
Because something like a hurricane or a tornado does kind of have a lifespan,

441
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,130
right. Oh, yeah, definitely.

442
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,599
-- Well, even a missile attack technically has a lifespan, right?
-- Yeah.

443
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,930
And then the systems infrastructure is based on two G cell phone

444
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,079
technology which allows the alerts to be pushed to users simultaneously.

445
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:08,449
Yeah, I mean, so you're, it's the classic thing, you know,

446
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:12,329
this was amazing and awesome kind of when we built it 10 or 20 years ago.

447
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:12,640
And

448
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:13,800
well, here we are,

449
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:18,760
you know, this is one of those things I think about a lot,

450
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,189
especially in the context of security is

451
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,280
it's really easy to try to say let's go to the new hip thing.

452
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,989
And now mind you, I'm,

453
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,010
I'm not defending these people because I think they're way behind the times.

454
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,310
But,

455
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:30,989
but it, it,

456
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,969
it can also be tricky to know where to draw the line and to

457
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:37,550
say this is what we need and this is a level of reliability because

458
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,069
I think uh emergency alerts are one of those examples where they're,

459
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,510
they're aiming for 100% coverage, which of course is impossible.

460
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,979
But let's say they had 75% coverage is that enough is 80% enough is 90% enough.

461
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,630
And of course, it's easy for me to say, oh sure, 80% is enough

462
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,750
until I know someone in the 20%.

463
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,939
And then I'm going to be like,

464
00:19:56,949 --> 00:20:00,839
why didn't you tell my brother or why didn't you tell my uncle or my mom

465
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:01,770
is

466
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,869
lack of society in general,

467
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,930
has become really safe so much so that a lot of people have forgotten sort of

468
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,319
basic survival things like having a few days of food and water

469
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,410
or like having an emergency radio that's like crank or battery powered.

470
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,449
I, I do have a crank radio actually,

471
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,170
I probably need to replace the battery in my

472
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,150
crank radio because the battery is really old.

473
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,800
I wonder if I could get a capacitor thing to put

474
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,729
in there because capacitors charge quickly and they never wear out.

475
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,829
I should do that. That'd be fun.

476
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:31,400
I

477
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:31,979
mean,

478
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,020
it's,

479
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,359
yeah, I don't know, like on the one hand,

480
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,260
I do definitely want to take care of people in society, but at the same point,

481
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,390
you know, how far can we go to kind of

482
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,479
handhold everybody?

483
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:44,650
I mean,

484
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,119
a great example being all these people in hotels in

485
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,770
Hawaii who were panicking and the staff were panicking and,

486
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,199
or going home or whatever.

487
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:52,599
Right.

488
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,780
Some of them, you know, talked about how they felt they had a duty of care to the,

489
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,300
you know, people at the hotel and other people were like, screw this.

490
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,660
I'm gonna go see my family because

491
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,500
what else am I gonna do? Right. It's not like we have a bunker in this hotel,

492
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,400
you know, and, and so even there, like, kind of,

493
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,219
yeah, like what happens if you're, you're not at home?

494
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:11,199
Like Hawaii is a major tourist destination.

495
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,040
How do you like? What do you do for tourists who maybe aren't,

496
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,140
you know, a tidal wave warning comes and do the tourists know what the heck to do?

497
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:22,699
-- The answer is probably not.
-- Uh, no, they, they totally don't.

498
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:27,619
And, and this is something I remember I took a cruise many years ago

499
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,170
and they had like an emergency drill after

500
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,089
one hour after leaving or something like that.

501
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:37,099
And I remember all I kept thinking was

502
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,780
if anything bad happens,

503
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,569
like this place is going to turn into a nut house and none of these people

504
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:44,589
are going to listen or do anything remotely

505
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,329
close to what they're being told right now.

506
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:48,859
Do you remember the cost of Concordia disaster?

507
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:52,040
Oh, yes. Yes. That was the

508
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:53,020
Italian.

509
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,270
That, that

510
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:56,290
wasn't it.

511
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,300
That's

512
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,000
right. Well, its

513
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,250
because, well, technically didn't sink, sink it kind of rolled over and took a nap.

514
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,810
Um, but like, at one point there's that audio of like the Italian Coast Guard, like,

515
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:13,250
being rather annoyed and telling him to get back on his ship and deal with it.

516
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,739
Right.

517
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,130
Because the captain wanted, you know, he was like, oh, I'm evacuating good luck,

518
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,689
everybody,

519
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,770
you know,

520
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,270
and, and that captain was, if I'm, if I'm remembering

521
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:25,969
right. He was a bit of a clown.

522
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,619
And,

523
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:28,449
I mean,

524
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,109
that's different. I think though there are,

525
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,680
there are situations where you have someone

526
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:39,329
in power that is knowingly or willingly incompetent

527
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,849
and that is actually more dangerous than we'll say like an uncontrolled disaster.

528
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:45,819
Something like a hurry

529
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:45,989
or

530
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:47,349
an earthquake.

531
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:48,439
I would like to know.

532
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:49,900
Are there like, so for example,

533
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,910
you have the Innkeepers Act which defines things like if I don't pay my bill,

534
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,030
they can keep my stuff and sell it at auction or whatever,

535
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:56,219
you know.

536
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,930
Uh But for example,

537
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:59,790
is there like any clause in the Innkeepers act

538
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,260
about them having to like take care of me in

539
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,250
the event of say a fire or a flood or

540
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,630
like dinosaurs being released from the local zoo or,

541
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,510
you know, whatever, right?

542
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:08,900
Like,

543
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,150
I don't know, I'm kind of curious about this now because

544
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,910
there was some, you know, I was reading the Reddit threads and this one guy is like,

545
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,910
he tried to shelter in a store and they wouldn't let him,

546
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,949
they told me to get and that's kind of like, wow, dick move.

547
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:20,500
Uh

548
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,180
You know, I would agree with that.

549
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:26,670
II I feel like though at the same time, this is one of those situations, if,

550
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,069
if you are a hotel

551
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,560
and

552
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,199
you have guests,

553
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:37,000
there is nothing you can really do against

554
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,560
a disaster that's going to happen quickly. I mean, like fire is a great example.

555
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:42,880
If there is a fire,

556
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,599
there's nothing you can do. It's up to the guest

557
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:48,209
assuming

558
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:52,359
you even see it, right. Someone will assume can pull the fire alarm,

559
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:55,680
but like you're not going to go find people, you're going to get out

560
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,599
and it's up to people to either get out or

561
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:01,400
for professional help to appear and deal with the situation.

562
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:07,849
And I, I think this is exactly the same and, and I, I wanna tie this into cyber security

563
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:09,900
at the same time because like

564
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,449
we try to plan for ridiculous. Well, ok, let me, let me back that up. Not everybody.

565
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,709
There's always a subset of the population.

566
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:19,229
I think we would call them preppers in many instances.

567
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:22,250
Not, I'm not using that in a negative way. Mind you please don't harass me on Twitter.

568
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,000
Uh There are people who are preparing for

569
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,969
catastrophe and that's fine if that's what something you enjoy doing or want to do.

570
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:30,780
That's great. I have no problem with it. Right.

571
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,439
We look at like a lot of security teams and

572
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:37,119
they often are in what I would call the prepper camp where they're,

573
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,780
they're planning for catastrophe.

574
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,760
When in reality it's like you don't even have a front door in your house.

575
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:43,699
And

576
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:44,209
I

577
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:44,479
think as

578
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,760
well as

579
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:46,300
-- disconnect, they
-- see

580
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,750
we have the same problem in medicine, for example, you know, it's a lot

581
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:52,130
more sexy, especially as a doctor to, like,

582
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,050
fix heart attacks than it is for people to go jogging more

583
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,599
and eat,

584
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,449
you know, less

585
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,609
-- food.
-- Right?

586
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,349
-- No, II, I, yes, I totally like, I
-- look at,

587
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,989
I look at infosec and the number of places where I'm like,

588
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,089
tell me. Exactly.

589
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:08,650
And what version of stuff you're running and the look on their face, they're like,

590
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,290
I'm like, I know you can't tell me that.

591
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,609
Like,

592
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:10,979
just,

593
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,890
yeah, exactly.

594
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,010
You know, like they don't even have a remote inventory of what's going on

595
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,439
but they think they do or

596
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,439
whatever.

597
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:22,319
Um

598
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,540
You know, just, yeah, that basic, you know, flossing is not fun.

599
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,099
Nobody likes to floss,

600
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:30,699
dude. I floss religiously.

601
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:31,579
It is.

602
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:35,270
-- Do you do it because you like it or do you do it because it's good for you
-- because

603
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,359
I do it because it's good for me because if I don't floss and I go to the dentist,

604
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:39,819
my gums bleed and they yell at me.

605
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,869
But if I do floss, I go to the dentist, they say, hey, good job flossing. And I say, I

606
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:44,310
think

607
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:44,550
that

608
00:25:45,189 --> 00:25:48,739
remarkably like how infosec people operate.

609
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,670
No, they don't, they don't operate like that at all.

610
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,060
They don't floss and then they use

611
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,010
for having bleeding gums,

612
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,239
you know, you should have updated, you should have installed this patch

613
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,079
maybe. Yeah, I guess you get some of that. It's,

614
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,790
yeah. Yeah. To a degree. That's fair.

615
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,130
I still,

616
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,270
I still see the infosec people yelling at everybody even though it's

617
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,339
certainly not something in many cases the users couldn't even control it.

618
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:13,780
But

619
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,150
yeah.

620
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:15,790
So,

621
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:16,239
yeah.

622
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,050
So, and then the, the other thing that gets to me about this is just, yeah,

623
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,250
like I said earlier, how much the world has changed from, you know,

624
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,160
things like Conal rad on the radio, you know, the little circle with the triangle,

625
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,630
that's your civil defense station.

626
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,939
Um,

627
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:30,400
you know, to like, check your Twitter and your Facebook and let's face it. Those are

628
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,790
because one thing that really got me is that

629
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,650
new sites didn't pick this up like

630
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,010
you, like, you know, uh you would have,

631
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,810
I would have thought that like cnn.com within three or four minutes of like,

632
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:47,209
oh my God, like our, our Hawaiian bureau is like all hiding in the basement

633
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,250
telling us that they're about to get nuked.

634
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,800
You know, maybe we should put that up on the website and apparently these

635
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:54,819
or, or was it because they were trying to fact check it but they didn't put it up,

636
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:58,449
which could, you know, kind of is a good thing because it turns out it was not true.

637
00:26:58,459 --> 00:26:58,890
Right.

638
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,119
And having that on cnn.com would have panicked the whole pile more

639
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,489
-- people
-- that's ignoring the fact checking part of it because I think

640
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,449
fact checking in journalism today is, is of dubious quality at best,

641
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:12,010
-- but
-- it still happens.

642
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:13,670
It kind of does. But you have to

643
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:14,020
figure

644
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:14,369
out,

645
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:17,430
think about CNN. Right.

646
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,989
The, the, the warning comes out

647
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,680
how long until somebody in a position of,

648
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:26,209
we'll say any sort of influence learns about it.

649
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:29,319
Let's, let's say five minutes, right. Which I think is generous.

650
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:30,949
My guess is it's long past that

651
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:36,060
five minutes, then they're gonna say, all right, like is this a real thing?

652
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:39,479
And they're gonna find some way to double check it. Let's say we're at 10 minutes now

653
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,040
and then they're gonna say,

654
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,640
all right now we need to get something up on the website and on air.

655
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,520
So that's probably another 5 to 10 minutes there and we're already at 20 minutes in.

656
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,280
Right? I mean,

657
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,109
I would bet you the way traditional media works.

658
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,510
Best case scenario is gonna be a half hour turnaround.

659
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,579
Whereas something like social media like, yeah, 10 seconds, man.

660
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,530
I bet the first person got that warning message

661
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,670
and it was on Twitter 15 seconds later.

662
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,469
Guaranteed.

663
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:04,400
I mean,

664
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,180
it's a tough one too because you don't want people to

665
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,540
just grab stuff and run with it because when we,

666
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,000
you know that happens 10, you know,

667
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,099
people tend to make mistakes or put out the wrong thing

668
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:13,290
and

669
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:19,630
is a danger as well because, because what happens if someone puts on Twitter, like,

670
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,500
I, I see a missile coming into Hawaii and now all

671
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:22,800
of a sudden

672
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,349
everyone's

673
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,280
out.

674
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,510
-- Not
-- exactly

675
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,750
-- no.
-- Remember there was that famous webcam in San Diego

676
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,390
and like, they're like, oh my God, that looks like a missile launch. And it was just uh

677
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:40,170
uh it was a contrail from a plane that was just at the sort of right angle and,

678
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:40,910
you know,

679
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:41,890
um

680
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,569
it, it really did look like

681
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:43,939
a

682
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:47,689
Yeah. Right. Right. No, I remember that now. Yes. Yes.

683
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:50,280
You know, so, and, and people were kind of, well,

684
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,869
not freaking out about it because it's kind of headed out over the ocean.

685
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,689
So they're just like, what the heck is that? You know, it's not like inbound.

686
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,150
So, I mean, yeah, these, these things do happen.

687
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,310
But yeah, to have it come from the state agency, you know, and, and be,

688
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,310
and then followed up a minute or two later by like, this is not a drill.

689
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,900
This is real like, yeah, that's definitely a little bit more uh

690
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,910
scary.

691
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,719
Yeah. No, iii

692
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:12,619
I totally get it. It's,

693
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,869
this is a hard problem.

694
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:15,750
And

695
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,750
one thing I'm wondering is how many people are,

696
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,650
are going to actually now do maybe a little basic prep.

697
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,670
Like, for example, like one thing I realize if my phone dies,

698
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,630
I don't know any phone numbers other than my parents' phone number and like 911.

699
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,030
Do you need other phone numbers?

700
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:36,359
Uh, like, I don't know, my parents' phone numbers, like their cell phones. I don't

701
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:36,670
know. I

702
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:39,400
don't actually even know my partner's cellphone number.

703
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:42,910
And when I have get cell phones for my kids, I probably need to, like,

704
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,000
maybe memorize those numbers I feel or print them out on the card.

705
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,709
But if you don't have a working cell phone, do you have access to another phone?

706
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:53,010
So you've never dropped your phone?

707
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:54,890
I have not, you,

708
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,400
I, you would not believe the care I take to not do that.

709
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,420
Ok? But I'm just saying like I could see

710
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:07,010
it's, it's not even like in an emergency, it's like I dropped and smashed my phone

711
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,609
but it's all in the cloud.

712
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:12,410
Can't you just like pull open a computer and, and just log into something.

713
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,199
But I mean, it might also be handy for example,

714
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:17,290
to have a laminated card so I can use somebody else's phone to call them.

715
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:17,660
So

716
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,020
I'm

717
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,800
gonna be late because I gotta go buy a new phone.

718
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,849
Let's

719
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,079
let's go with this because this is something I think about a lot.

720
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,160
And this is a great example.

721
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,609
So you're gonna laminate a card and you're going to put it in your wallet

722
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,020
and

723
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,609
-- the good news
-- is phone numbers don't change anymore.

724
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:33,689
Uh

725
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,020
It's,

726
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:38,640
well, they kind of used to but even then man,

727
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,420
it was a number of changes were pretty rare.

728
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,880
It wasn't a huge deal and

729
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:43,780
I'm less concerned about numbers. But,

730
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,839
so let's say you, you print out this card, you put it in your wallet,

731
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,910
you might need it someday. Uh,

732
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,660
are you gonna remember? It's there

733
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:57,180
-- is it
-- number 17 things in my wallet? So it's going to take up a lot of room and annoy me.

734
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,540
That's fair. Ok. And that's fair.

735
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,650
That's fair if that's the case because actually I

736
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,380
was cleaning up my wallet the other day.

737
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,050
I, uh, I

738
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,500
remember why I was going through it. There was something I was looking for

739
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:12,699
and I found a little print off of what I assume were old two factor off codes for.

740
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:15,430
I don't even know what. Right. Like I'm like, I have no idea what these are.

741
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:15,479
I,

742
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:19,140
I'll just burn this because it's clearly not of value to

743
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,400
me that I couldn't tell you which service they're from.

744
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:24,770
But that, that's what I feel like here and

745
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:26,400
now, now

746
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,989
it's not just about some massive emergency.

747
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,489
-- It's about like I dropped my phone in the toilet. I need to like
-- I get that

748
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:34,109
and let

749
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:34,260
them

750
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,969
know I'll be late.

751
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:36,369
Uh,

752
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:37,540
but

753
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,270
maybe this is one of those situations like putting

754
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,319
a card in your wallet is very low cost

755
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,079
and it's easy to do

756
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,439
and it could have, we'll say moderately high impact

757
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:56,439
in the event of your phone being lost or broken.

758
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:57,270
Which is

759
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:57,770
a

760
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:57,949
great

761
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,630
example. At some point I need to get my kids to memorize my cell phone number.

762
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,459
Uh my kids know my cell phone number

763
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:08,760
and, and they do, they call me when they're somewhere and they need access.

764
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,459
But, you know, you know, I've been thinking is I'm like,

765
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:13,339
wouldn't it be just easier to give the kids like a crap cell phone?

766
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,260
Then they don't have to know my number and they

767
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,819
can send me text messages or call me whenever and it

768
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:19,650
again until they drop their phone.

769
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:24,069
And part of that, you see, but part of that plan is buying them a phone that you could,

770
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,910
like, run over with a truck and it won't matter because it's like some, you know,

771
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,550
like old crappy super durable phone

772
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,239
because I know they're going to drop it and I know they're not going to charge it.

773
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,630
And so I, I wanted to have like a month of battery life and, and you can like,

774
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,869
literally flush this thing down the toilet and then go

775
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,630
fetch it and it still will make phone calls.

776
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,109
Right.

777
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,079
And, and so anyway, anyway,

778
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,109
so

779
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:52,609
I guess here, here's my thought on all of this and I know this will be vast,

780
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:55,780
grossly unpopular. Many people probably even you is

781
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,329
I basically don't prepare for anything at this point because I, I, I've decided,

782
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:02,770
I have consciously decided

783
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,449
that if, if something bad happens

784
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,810
I almost certainly can't do anything about it and I accept my fate

785
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,969
because like, like my favorite example of this is,

786
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,550
let's say you live in this, in a city like a real city

787
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,469
and you have food and water in your basement

788
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,040
and let's say, like society breaks down

789
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,489
and there's a mob outside.

790
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,000
Is that food and water gonna have any value to you? No.

791
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:31,329
So now let's say I buy a gun to protect my food and water.

792
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,709
You're gonna shoot 200 people. No. So effectively

793
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,229
you can do nothing,

794
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,520
right? Like at best,

795
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,170
I'm not worried about that scenario. I'm more worried about,

796
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,459
uh,

797
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:47,170
there's like a disruption or a heavy snowfall because

798
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,270
we have had super heavy snowfalls here that like,

799
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,150
have completely effed up the roads

800
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:54,140
and, you know, it's a complete nightmare to go and buy

801
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,130
anything.

802
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,859
It, it, it is possible that could happen.

803
00:33:57,989 --> 00:33:59,739
But at the same time,

804
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,300
how, how much snow are you gonna have to get?

805
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:06,380
Well, or a great example here in northern Alberta,

806
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:12,438
kind of the top, uh, maybe 10th of the provinces is anyways. So it's a big area

807
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,899
and they had, uh,

808
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,989
I forget what the problem was with their natural gas distribution system,

809
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,199
but essentially the pressure was low.

810
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:19,659
Oh, yeah.

811
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:23,040
It's because we had, they had a cold snap and some of the pipes actually froze.

812
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,370
And so these poor people living way up in northern Alberta had

813
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:28,688
no natural gas which meant like for a lot of them,

814
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,590
they had no heat,

815
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,449
especially in a modern building, right?

816
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,250
Like I live in a house with a real,

817
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,389
you have a fireplace, you have sleeping blank uh sleeping bags,

818
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:41,659
you huddle in a room with a small propane stove and be very careful not to die,

819
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:43,188
carbon monoxide poisoning.

820
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:46,830
Um or in this case, you know, they opened up schools and stuff and heated them to like,

821
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,040
have the people take shelter.

822
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,310
Right.

823
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,688
But for example, well, no, no, just for example,

824
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,149
can I finish, please? For example, if you live kind of in the middle of nowhere

825
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,830
because I know people that live, for example, on acreages

826
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,610
and they do actually

827
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,989
regularly get snowed in for two or three days

828
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,679
because there's like a foot or two of snow,

829
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:06,790
they don't own like a massive jacked up truck and, you know,

830
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,030
the county doesn't get around to plowing them out

831
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,459
for two or three days because they got to do the roads first.

832
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:15,620
I think if you live like out in the boonies,

833
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:18,820
having a couple of days of food and water is totally reasonable.

834
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,110
I think having like a propane tank on site is totally reasonable. Right.

835
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,699
And if I lived in the middle of nowhere, I would totally do that.

836
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:26,020
I live in the city.

837
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:27,199
And

838
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,100
if, if I need

839
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,840
two days of food and water and I can't get it.

840
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,719
Like there are way bigger problems going on

841
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:35,580
than,

842
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:38,090
than anything else. And that's kind of the way

843
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:38,209
I

844
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,110
like the hurricane in Puerto Rico.

845
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,209
But how would you compare

846
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:42,959
to that?

847
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:46,209
I mean, let's face it, man. They haven't had any, any

848
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,500
realistically speaking. They, they've been broken for months now.

849
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,689
Like, if you had seven days of food, like it's long gone.

850
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:55,360
Right.

851
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,739
-- It's long gone
-- now.

852
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:56,899
Well,

853
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:58,679
if I lived in a hurricane zone I'd probably have

854
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,669
30 days of food and water because I mean,

855
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:03,959
you look at even civilized places like Hurricane Andrew in Florida, right?

856
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:04,659
It knocked out

857
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,330
-- power infrastructure for, for weeks and months and,
-- and I agree with you

858
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:10,159
that

859
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:11,199
if you live in.

860
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:12,719
Ok. Ok.

861
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:16,739
Let me, let me rephrase this because I think we're on to something important here is

862
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:19,280
you have to prepare

863
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:23,409
according to where you live, like me preparing for a hurricane would be idiotic.

864
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:23,840
Right?

865
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,260
And I think in the security universe

866
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,419
we have people preparing for hurricanes who live

867
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,479
way up north.

868
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,219
Right.

869
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,550
We need to understand what our potential threats are

870
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,429
and prepare for them as needed.

871
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,850
And like in my case, you know,

872
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,939
my biggest fear is my biggest fear is losing power for a couple of hours.

873
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,919
And so I have like a battery backup that I can use

874
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:47,659
to power my cell phone and computers if I need them.

875
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:48,689
And

876
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:54,389
that's something that has huge impact on my life if it goes wrong right

877
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,439
now, if I get like so much snow I can't leave my house for three days.

878
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,620
I don't think that's going to happen.

879
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:02,040
And so I'm not going to prepare for it and that's just the way it is.

880
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,340
And if it does happen, I'm going to be in a world of hurt,

881
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,570
-- but I don't think it will and it probably won't
-- part of it too,

882
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,370
is to remember that planning doesn't necessarily have

883
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:10,939
to be buying a crazy amount of stuff.

884
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:12,489
It can be something as simple as like

885
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,879
getting the stuff you would need for camping anyways or for example, in my case,

886
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:19,689
we have a lot of extra stuff now for when we go to the cabin,

887
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:24,139
my parents' cabin out in the middle of nowhere, even though it has power and whatnot.

888
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,350
You know, there's still

889
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:30,000
kind of a lot of other stuff that's not available or if you want to go buy it,

890
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,000
you have to go drive an hour.

891
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,669
You can't just pop over to 7-Eleven.

892
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:37,110
-- Uh,
-- yes, I, I can relate to that. My folks have a cabin in the middle of the woods and

893
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:42,409
I had to actually, uh, I re plumbed it for them a couple of years ago because the pipes.

894
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:45,209
It does. Uh,

895
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,340
it does, it is very nice plumbing now,

896
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,820
but it was, it was like pipes from the forties, right?

897
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,500
It was super old and like they were falling apart and terrible

898
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,260
and yeah, I had to put together my parts list

899
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,139
before I left because I couldn't get parts after I'd left.

900
00:37:59,149 --> 00:38:01,100
And I like overbought like crazy

901
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,959
knowing I will just bring everything.

902
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,540
That's exactly, that's exactly it. Right. And like,

903
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,590
that's a good example of being prepared. Right.

904
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,429
And, and this is, this is kind of my,

905
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:12,179
like the thing I keep thinking of and the thing I

906
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,340
want to keep tying this back to is the fact that

907
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:15,870
insecurity

908
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:20,500
I feel like we spend so much time preparing for events that will never happen. And,

909
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,100
and like my, my favorite example of this is, you know, knowing people who are,

910
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,100
are obsessing over,

911
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,889
say having their I DS set up correctly

912
00:38:26,899 --> 00:38:28,469
and they don't have two factor authentication.

913
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:29,350
It's like that's,

914
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,370
that doesn't make sense. Like two factor off

915
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:39,000
will have drastically better results on whatever you're doing than having an idea.

916
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,199
Well, like unquestionably,

917
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,709
and I feel like our priorities sometimes are incredibly out of whack

918
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:49,360
and it hurts us in the end because I think it also makes security

919
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,540
in general look like a bunch of clowns when we're doing this wrong.

920
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,979
Well, I, you know, it reminds me a lot of just in general

921
00:38:58,689 --> 00:38:59,379
um

922
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,830
what the hurricane in Puerto Rico is a great

923
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,729
example of uh Puerto Rico apparently turns out something

924
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:09,000
like 10% of all the uh like IV drugs and what not used in the American hospitals.

925
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:13,060
And um so now there's like major shortages because let's face it if you take out

926
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,530
5% of production of something

927
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,100
like medical supplies, let alone 10% for a few weeks or months.

928
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:25,320
Yeah, that's gonna have a huge impact because, you know, the whole world runs on.

929
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,780
See, that's the other fear I have is the whole world runs on these,

930
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,270
just in time delivery systems

931
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,979
and the majority of cities now have three days of food.

932
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:33,449
That's it,

933
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:34,010
I

934
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:34,419
believe.

935
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,939
And it's efficient and it, it's, it's cheap and it means I can get avocados.

936
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:41,500
I live in Canada.

937
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,209
It's,

938
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,699
I don't think there was probably an avocado in Canada until like,

939
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,459
probably 1970 or 80.

940
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:51,379
-- If I had to guess
-- you should be living off of like seal blubber.

941
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:55,060
Exactly. Seal blubber and wheat and root vegetables. Right.

942
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:57,520
And, you know, and so it's,

943
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:57,639
I,

944
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,290
if there is a major disruption to the food chain,

945
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:04,899
uh, or the food supply system, yeah, I mean,

946
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:07,350
it's probably something has gone really horribly wrong.

947
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,669
But

948
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,090
the thing is, there are realistically

949
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:13,770
ridiculous events that do happen, like the ice storm in Quebec a long time ago.

950
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,290
The main problem there being is, you know,

951
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,050
it knocked down like literally all the power lines,

952
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:21,439
you know, they had heavy ice on them and they, all

953
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,080
the problem was it was all the long distance transmission lines.

954
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:24,179
They,

955
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,169
they fell down and cascaded and so they

956
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:29,159
literally lost thousands of miles of high voltage,

957
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,530
you know, back haul transmission lines.

958
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,250
Which

959
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:34,530
you can't replace that stuff quickly.

960
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,290
You basically have to rebuild it

961
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,989
and they, they showed them rebuilding it next to it.

962
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,870
They didn't even bother to demolish the old stuff.

963
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,739
Right. They just,

964
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,370
well, they didn't have time. Right.

965
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:46,179
You're gonna spend time demolishing this old crap,

966
00:40:46,189 --> 00:40:47,669
or you're just going to build a new one next to it

967
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,590
once it's built and everything's fixed,

968
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,229
then remove the old stuff.

969
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,489
Yeah. Yeah. II, I guess that makes sense.

970
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,010
And like that's another good example of that is a,

971
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:00,959
an uncommon event that sounds like it was dealt with appropriately

972
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:01,840
and, and how

973
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:02,800
you plan for that.

974
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,149
Right. Like how, how are you going to plan for that?

975
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:08,270
-- Could you, could they have in their wildest
-- dreams? What they do

976
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,830
is, for example, every,

977
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,709
I think it's 10th tower is reinforced so that you don't get that cascade failure

978
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,409
and, ok, that's fair.

979
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:19,889
I mean, I, I think that makes sense and that sounds like a good idea. Right.

980
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,320
Right. Because the problem was, it was,

981
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,219
most of the towers are structurally fine.

982
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:28,750
It's just because one or two collapsed, put enough load on the next one

983
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:31,469
and, you know, you had a domino failure basically.

984
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,510
Right.

985
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,340
Which again,

986
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,989
they've never anticipated when they built this thing originally because,

987
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,350
you know, we had never had an ice storm that bad.

988
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,169
Right.

989
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,929
Um,

990
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:43,139
so, but I mean, and that's the thing, right?

991
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:47,360
I think what fundamentally, whatever preparations you make

992
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:50,570
uh, generally speaking, you have to have

993
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,389
some, either a return on investment or be cheap enough that they're not a problem.

994
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:56,449
Right. Like we're not the US government that can keep,

995
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,239
you know, nuclear missiles on standby,

996
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:03,780
uh, or, you know, keep planes in the air 24 7, things like that.

997
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,100
But they did and they had to, because the potential downside of,

998
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,879
like a nuclear strike was

999
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,340
arguably about the worst thing we can have ever in the history of humanity, right?

1000
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,770
And so did it make sense?

1001
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,000
Well, I mean, the fact that mad kept everybody from nuking each other for 50 years,

1002
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,159
I would say it was worth it,

1003
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,709
man being mutual assured destruction.

1004
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,649
Um

1005
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:27,899
You know, for example,

1006
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:31,360
basic hurricane prep like maybe at the beginning of hurricane season, you know,

1007
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:37,399
fill up a 50 L uh or whatever 10 gallon can of uh gas so that when you have to leave,

1008
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:38,979
you don't have to stop for gas on the way out.

1009
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:40,840
Uh

1010
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,689
That always

1011
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:45,169
-- seems to be a problem
-- that that might not be terrible advice. It's,

1012
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,080
and I,

1013
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,320
I guess that's the thing

1014
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:49,469
I I'm

1015
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:50,979
starting to realize with this,

1016
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:54,459
especially after our discussion about because like when we started talking,

1017
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:58,159
I was under the impression most nuclear weapons would annihilate like

1018
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,060
the island of Hawaii.

1019
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,729
-- It turns out that's not the case.
-- Military ones would

1020
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,570
not even

1021
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,050
man,

1022
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,629
like there's only a couple of nuclear weapons that could annihilate the Island.

1023
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:09,250
Like, it's

1024
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,500
-- most of the
-- basically America

1025
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,010
and Russia.

1026
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,050
Let's face it. No, if, if you want to talk about

1027
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,689
real nuclear weapon, like city, like things at a level of city that's,

1028
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,669
that's America and Russia, basically

1029
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:23,949
-- China. And
-- even then it's,

1030
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,340
it's unlikely those are the things they

1031
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,129
would send because those aren't ICBM weapons.

1032
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,060
Right.

1033
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,530
Those are like,

1034
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,459
the submarine is towing it underwater sort of thing

1035
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:35,199
because it has a range of 100 miles.

1036
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:37,649
But anyway, anyway, here's, here's my point is

1037
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:38,860
I,

1038
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,530
my assumption was

1039
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:45,219
a, a missile attack would basically, there's nothing you could do and,

1040
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:47,280
and there is something you can do and you know what it is, it's,

1041
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,959
it's just do nothing right.

1042
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:52,419
Stay indoors and, and get inside your house as far as you can.

1043
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,870
Well, somebody pointed it on a red thread.

1044
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:58,929
The, the, I can't pronounce these Russian names but the, the media in Russia,

1045
00:43:59,399 --> 00:44:02,100
uh member that got like all the coverage because it was

1046
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,360
during the day and people had all their cameras on and stuff

1047
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:07,979
and one of the problems is everybody went to the window to look at it and then the

1048
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:09,310
hit and they all made

1049
00:44:09,419 --> 00:44:13,080
-- a face full of
-- glass that is in my blog post as well.

1050
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,439
Because like, like that's another example,

1051
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:20,610
I would have looked out my window if I saw a bright light like that. And I know now

1052
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,169
that if you see a bright light

1053
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,229
don't look out the window.

1054
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:25,080
Right. Like

1055
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:26,679
maybe,

1056
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,520
uh, yeah, I think she was a very good one too.

1057
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,800
We've all seen Die Hard and, uh, you know,

1058
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:35,270
the scene of the, uh, in the computer room where he shoots out all the glass

1059
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:38,830
and poor Bruce Willis doesn't have any shoes on. Right.

1060
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,699
Yeah, that's fair.

1061
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,590
Uh, but, but I guess here, here's my point. Right. So,

1062
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,909
my new advice is if any sort of thing happens, like, basically do nothing.

1063
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:49,120
-- And I guess what
-- is Check

1064
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:50,179
Twitter

1065
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:51,179
in your bath

1066
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:51,449
and

1067
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,250
tide in the bathroom and check Twitter?

1068
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,370
That is the best advice for any sort of emergency situation.

1069
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:58,669
I think anyone could possibly give. I love that.

1070
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,110
But, but here's a question.

1071
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:00,899
So

1072
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:05,610
in, in, let's face it in 80 plus percent of natural disaster situations,

1073
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,620
like literally hide in the bathroom and check Twitter is probably very good advice

1074
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:11,629
and something like a hurricane will ignore

1075
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:13,239
because you're gonna know about that beforehand,

1076
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:13,379
right?

1077
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:14,659
You're not gonna like all of the sudden.

1078
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:16,949
So anyway, here's my question

1079
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,270
from the standpoint of security

1080
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,540
today in the environment we exist in

1081
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:25,959
what is the equivalent advice or doesn't even exist

1082
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:28,159
of go in the bathroom and check Twitter.

1083
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,840
I would say probably the number one biggest thing.

1084
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:33,879
Uh Well,

1085
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:38,040
basically the two biggest things I keep coming back to are use a password manager,

1086
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,280
which essentially implies that you're using

1087
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,320
good strong unique passwords everywhere.

1088
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,610
Because one of those sites is going to store your

1089
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,919
password improperly and it's gonna get cracked or just read.

1090
00:45:48,689 --> 00:45:51,110
And number two is backups because, and

1091
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:54,280
for me, backups are less about a security thing and more about,

1092
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,870
like dropping your phone in the toilet.

1093
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,590
Yeah. No, I, I agree with that completely.

1094
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:58,830
And,

1095
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,870
and my backup plan to dropping my phone in the

1096
00:46:00,879 --> 00:46:03,459
toilet is just going to be the fact that I can

1097
00:46:03,649 --> 00:46:06,270
log into Google and look at all of my contacts

1098
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:07,300
like

1099
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:08,969
that is the backup plan.

1100
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:10,560
Of course, I, I currently have, well,

1101
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:14,159
and I guess that's the beauty of it too is I have a U two F key now for logging in.

1102
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:17,790
So even if Google authenticator is dead, my U two F key,

1103
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,389
like I could drop that in the toilet,

1104
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:21,580
I could probably flush that down the toilet and then go

1105
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,860
get it and run it over with a truck and,

1106
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,320
and hit it with a hammer a few times and it would still work.

1107
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:28,860
-- Like that's all you
-- have your printed out codes for your Google account.

1108
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:29,419
I,

1109
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,530
because that's something I do every once in a while I go through all my accounts print

1110
00:46:34,689 --> 00:46:34,729
out

1111
00:46:35,179 --> 00:46:35,199
of

1112
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:39,590
-- them in an envelope, put them in my safety deposit box. See it like
-- that for

1113
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:44,169
situations if the code is at the bank, is that helpful? Really?

1114
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:50,520
Well, in general, I would have to destroy my phone, destroy my U two F key,

1115
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:53,139
destroy you know, I mean, like it would be a house fire situation

1116
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:54,520
and so

1117
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:54,760
it

1118
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:54,989
would be

1119
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:55,850
ok.

1120
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,100
That's fair. I guess.

1121
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,870
Also the thing to remember too is this is actually the, the recovery codes

1122
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,899
are not so much for me, but for my next of kin,

1123
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,300
because if I get hit by a bus or something,

1124
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,129
you know, my sons might want control of

1125
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:08,959
creed.org

1126
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:10,719
whatever. Yo.

1127
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:12,500
Ok. That's fair. That's fair.

1128
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,330
Anyway, anyway, we've kind of rambled along with, with this one for a while.

1129
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,260
I think, I, I don't know, man, I just,

1130
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,459
I keep thinking about this in my brain and I feel like

1131
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:21,959
there is,

1132
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:27,699
it is difficult to prepare for nearly anything and, and I just keep thinking like

1133
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:30,750
there are fundamental basics that will have

1134
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,149
the far biggest out impact on whatever is going on and, and it's like,

1135
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:37,969
it's literally like, yeah, go in the bathroom and check Twitter.

1136
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,560
Anyone can do that. Anyone can remember that.

1137
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,750
And yeah, like I think from the security perspective, like

1138
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:47,580
password manager and backups are probably 80% of the game

1139
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,000
and, and after that, and let's face it too. Like

1140
00:47:50,399 --> 00:47:54,820
if, if your threat model includes say China attacking you, like

1141
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,300
you can't beat them,

1142
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:57,929
you're going to lose

1143
00:47:59,129 --> 00:47:59,909
-- the US
-- government.

1144
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:03,310
-- Even those guys clearly can't,
-- I wasn't going to say you can beat them but you can,

1145
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:03,689
you can,

1146
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:05,840
you can deal with it in a meaningful way.

1147
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:09,449
Yeah, maybe, maybe I Yes, I, I think you're right. But again,

1148
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,060
like,

1149
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,300
that's a different universe. Right.

1150
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,179
Like, the military planning for a missile attack is going to,

1151
00:48:15,189 --> 00:48:17,649
their plans are drastically different than mine.

1152
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,510
But that's one thing that frustrates me is where people sort of try and

1153
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,590
view a problem as a single homogenous problem. Right.

1154
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,580
Like, when I look at prepping here,

1155
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,379
I actually view it as several problems. Like, number one is

1156
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,679
something

1157
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,649
likely but not, you know, terribly impactful.

1158
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:36,709
Like, just really terrible whether and I can't get to the store for a day or two.

1159
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:38,760
So, you know what I want to make sure, maybe I have

1160
00:48:39,229 --> 00:48:42,010
like some bottle, like a case of bottled water in the, you know,

1161
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,010
basement in case the whatever Epcor messes up somehow or having things like,

1162
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,330
you know, uh, a week's worth of medication in case, I don't know,

1163
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,169
the pharmacy is closed or the pharmacist is sick and they can't get a replacement,

1164
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,449
you know, whatever. Right.

1165
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,330
Um, but it, to treat it as a single problem, I,

1166
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,889
I don't think it makes sense because for example,

1167
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:04,550
like my house burning down that is something that is statistically, you know,

1168
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,050
much more likely to happen than say getting nuked.

1169
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:08,020
Right.

1170
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:09,810
Um,

1171
00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:12,719
you know, and so do I have a plan for a house fire?

1172
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:15,770
Yeah, I mean, it basically consists of get everybody out and then, you know,

1173
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,209
phone the insurance company,

1174
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:21,949
-- but straight up, that's
-- my plan. I don't know if I'd call that a plan.

1175
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:23,600
Hey,

1176
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,090
I just renewed my fire insurance and there was

1177
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,689
a really sad thing about a guy locally who,

1178
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,500
uh, he rented, there was a fire and he didn't have fire insurance.

1179
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,580
-- Yes. Like you didn't have renters insurance.
-- Fire insurance is good.

1180
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,389
Well, yeah, I mean, it's, and it's cheap.

1181
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,360
Um, but yeah, like you said, some people are pouring it. Really, that's a tough one.

1182
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:47,830
but like literally my plan for fire is ensure and eat the risk.

1183
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,350
Well, you're not getting a risk. I mean, there's just, there's nothing you can do.

1184
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,360
I accept the risk,

1185
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:54,610
you know,

1186
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,310
I mean,

1187
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,669
well, I could actually, I could spend about five or $6000

1188
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,030
and have the house retrofitted with sprinklers.

1189
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,530
God, that's probably not worth it, man. I mean, let's face it.

1190
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:08,979
Well, we're talking about uh, well, not we,

1191
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:10,770
but uh they're talking about it for the new

1192
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,850
building code coming out in 2020 in Canada,

1193
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:16,020
um for new builds because the reality is in a new build.

1194
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,949
Of course, you can, you know, run a sprinkler system without too much hassle.

1195
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:22,030
Whereas with an existing building, right, you got to rip all the ceilings apart,

1196
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,840
which is, that's going to cost a lot of money.

1197
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:25,169
But, um,

1198
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:27,899
like long term would I prefer that?

1199
00:50:27,909 --> 00:50:30,879
Yeah, because for example, most houses now are kind of more open plan,

1200
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:33,290
they burn faster and they're full of stuff with plastic.

1201
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,810
I, you know,

1202
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,479
I, I have no problem

1203
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:37,189
with,

1204
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,699
with doing things that, that can make a difference.

1205
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:42,280
But I guess at the same time, I would want to understand

1206
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:44,209
if you did this,

1207
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:47,500
what is the result going to be? Right? Like, tell me

1208
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:50,830
what kind of return we're going to see on this sort of investment.

1209
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:52,409
Well, more importantly with housing, you know,

1210
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:56,199
the the fire marshal talking about it literally flat out said though, you know,

1211
00:50:56,209 --> 00:50:57,830
we need to be careful though because we can't

1212
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,629
make houses so expensive that people can't afford them. And a few $1000

1213
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,370
is the difference for some people,

1214
00:51:03,649 --> 00:51:07,870
you know, and when you, you multiply a few $1000 times every house in Canada.

1215
00:51:07,879 --> 00:51:10,060
It's like, well, that's a, that's actually a lot of money.

1216
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,149
Well, well, it's, it's bigger than that even because

1217
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,139
let's say everyone starts needing this.

1218
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:16,969
And now are you going to have like dodgy

1219
00:51:16,979 --> 00:51:19,780
sprinkler systems on the market that don't even work?

1220
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,939
And you know, it, I

1221
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,129
mean, this is,

1222
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,229
this is crazy stuff is, is one of the problems and I guess

1223
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:28,949
the fact that we can't have a nearly

1224
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:33,139
hour long conversation about emergency and preparedness and come

1225
00:51:33,149 --> 00:51:36,350
up with anything close to reasonable advice other

1226
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,489
than hide in the bathroom and check Twitter.

1227
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,709
I this is a big hard problem

1228
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,310
and I, I think that's all we can say, man is, it's just,

1229
00:51:46,939 --> 00:51:51,280
it is big and hard and there's, there isn't a good answer and there, there may never be

1230
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:54,199
that, that just might be the way it is. So, I guess

1231
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,239
let's take it home.

1232
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,459
-- Any closing thoughts,
-- uh, go to your local governments,

1233
00:51:58,469 --> 00:52:00,860
get prepared or emergency preparedness website and

1234
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,330
see what they say because honestly,

1235
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,209
I've looked at a few of them and most of them are

1236
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:08,620
quite sane and basically it's just having enough stuff for 72 hours

1237
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:10,800
and it's nothing too ridiculous.

1238
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,689
My advice is hide in the bathroom and check Twitter.

1239
00:52:13,979 --> 00:52:15,199
So there we go.

1240
00:52:15,419 --> 00:52:19,280
Kurt's more proactive, but I bet we both have the same result

1241
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:21,659
anyway.

1242
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:25,120
All right, man. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everybody for listening.

1243
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,850

1250
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,929
will rear its head again and just doesn't have good or easy answers.

1251
