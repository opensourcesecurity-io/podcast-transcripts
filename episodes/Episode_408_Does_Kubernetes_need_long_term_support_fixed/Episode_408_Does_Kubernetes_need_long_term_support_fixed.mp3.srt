Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siegfried

1
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:13,890
and my partner and getting older and occasionally sicker. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,219
How many times have you started the show like that?

3
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:18,459
I suspect it's more than 10 at this point.

4
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,729
Like everyone knows we're old, we know we're old.

5
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,329
It's like three or four times a year. Usually about this time

6
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:25,954
when all the bugs are going around.

7
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:26,834
That's true.

8
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:28,375
You know, the sickness is going around,

9
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:30,514
which is actually directly that time of year

10
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:32,194
related to what we're going to talk about,

11
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:32,755
which is

12
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:35,744
things need maintenance and especially things connected to

13
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:38,555
the internet need to sort of be maintained.

14
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:43,075
I don't know if I would bucket like that. So the, the topic of the day,

15
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:49,409
Kurt found a hacker news discussion where someone said Kubernetes needs an LTs,

16
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:51,259
a long term support version,

17
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,520
which they apparently don't have.

18
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:56,159
I honestly don't track Kubernetes releases very much

19
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:57,889
because I just run whatever I'm handed.

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,319
But the idea being

21
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,650
Kubernetes is an open source project

22
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,400
and people are saying it needs

23
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:06,419
longer term support versus more bleeding edge,

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,629
which is how it works today where it's just kind of like YOLO

25
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:11,669
if you're, if you're trying to keep up. Right.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,110
-- Yeah,
-- it looks like they're given about a year.

27
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,190
Ish.

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:15,690
That's not,

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,309
no, not a year. Sorry. Sorry.

30
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,260
Uh, this is weird. This is gonna, ok, so 126,

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,669
latest release was 2023. 1114, end of life is 2024 02.

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,180
So February, but when was the first release of 126?

33
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,809
Um, it looks to be about a year

34
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,419
ish.

35
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,989
-- Yeah,
-- but I bet you can't stay on like a version of 126 from a long time ago.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,319
-- You need to keep up with the minor versions,
-- right?

37
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,250
Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But in theory, the minor versions are safe to keep up with.

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,949
Right? That's

39
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,809
well and again, see and that's the beauty of this, right? Like again, OK.

40
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,779
So let's let's spherical cow the world a little bit

41
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,790
just to simplify things because otherwise we're gonna rattle.

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,760
So we're gonna go unlike us. Yeah.

43
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,209
So there's this idea of um

44
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:03,150
I'm spa,

45
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:06,839
you know what is Xyz versioning called again? Semantic versioning. Semantic.

46
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,260
Sorry,

47
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:08,490
I was just reading the thing about a guy

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,130
wrote a good article about pragmatic versioning anyway.

49
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:16,199
So semantic semantic versioning is XYZ and basically the promise is X

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,289
makes breaking changes.

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,679
Like if you go from 1 to 2,

52
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,940
we're gonna make breaking changes and give you cool new stuff

53
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,119
and, and possibly also get rid of stuff that you really need quite, quite likely.

54
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,979
Yes. Why so

55
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,940
dot Like 1.2 or 1.3 is like,

56
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:33,399
we are going to,

57
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:36,610
we're committing to supporting what we have

58
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,850
and

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,410
we might add new stuff moving forwards that

60
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,970
you have to do something to take advantage of

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,970
in the sense of like, if you don't change your configuration, it might break. Yep.

62
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:47,610
Yep. Right.

63
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,369
But nothing is going away

64
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,039
in theory. That's right. That's right.

65
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:58,679
And then there's the, the Z which is like, so 1.2 0.01 0.2 0.11 0.2 0.2 1.2 0.4006.

66
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:03,009
And the idea there is is that we're not making any breaking changes.

67
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:09,160
Like it's, it's air quotes safe to go from 1.2 0.3 to 1.2 0.4. And

68
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,919
basically, if you find a bug then

69
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,479
that needs to be fixed, that's an incompatibility.

70
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,720
Whereas if we go from like 1 to 2 and you're like,

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,309
it doesn't talk to this anymore. It's like, yeah. Well,

72
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,149
yeah, good luck with that. Go fix it.

73
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,979
That's right.

74
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,119
And the challenge, of course, like there's a, there's a lot of big issues,

75
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,679
but I'm just going to throw a few of the big ones out here first is

76
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:29,740
number one,

77
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:32,970
people forget that most people don't want software,

78
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,330
they want a solution for

79
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:34,899
sure.

80
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,740
Right. Exactly.

81
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,639
And that's the first thing that always blows my mind where, like like,

82
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:40,779
I don't want to maintain my light bulbs.

83
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm buying light bulbs so I can have light

84
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,960
because I like maintaining software on light bulbs.

85
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,600
That's right. That's right. Same thing with my Wi Fi. I, I finally,

86
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:53,130
you know, I, I went and bought,

87
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,130
I think it's

88
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:54,380
Dlin,

89
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,750
-- you don't know. And it doesn't matter. I think
-- it's delink.

90
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,270
I enabled automatic updates.

91
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,360
I changed the time,

92
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:03,210
the automatic updates happened because that was a fun thing to find out

93
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:04,410
where I would just like,

94
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,160
I would be like working at 11 o'clock and my whole internet would like just

95
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:09,449
poo itself for 15 minutes.

96
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,369
Awesome.

97
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:12,889
So change that to like 3 a.m.

98
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,459
and like, I just, I want like, like that the washer by me has software on it,

99
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,480
but it's not internet connected.

100
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,298
So don't care.

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,350
Now if it was internet connected,

102
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,329
the manufacturer is going to want to make me update it and

103
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,179
turn that off. I don't.

104
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,660
Yeah, like it's like the I have two TV s that are quote unquote smart TV. S

105
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,679
they are not connected to the Wi Fi or anything. They are.

106
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:37,100
-- It's
-- like anyway, versioning, we're talking about versioning in LTs.

107
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:40,489
So the versioning well, but this is implicit to

108
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,640
sometimes I want

109
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:47,279
software that is updated and has new features

110
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,690
-- and sometimes I don't, I just want a solution. I,
-- I think, I think you're too simple.

111
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,679
I think in the context of Kubernetes,

112
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,260
Kubernetes is a giant monolithic monster,

113
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,140
right? Where you need a team of people, often to actually run and maintain

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,559
-- Kubernetes
-- or you need to

115
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:03,855
buy something like openshift,

116
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:07,464
which is Kubernetes under the hood with like a layer of stuff on top of it to

117
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,445
-- make it more usable in a
-- little bit, a little bit.

118
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:10,285
So

119
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:12,255
let's say I want to run Kubernetes.

120
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,964
This is true of like operating systems, right? Where

121
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,945
I, and let's just pretend Kubernetes is an operating system because I think it's,

122
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:21,125
I mean, I, I won't argue with that.

123
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:22,165
It's not,

124
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:24,744
it's a runtime environment anyway.

125
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:25,644
So

126
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:26,769
I

127
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:26,989
have,

128
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,329
I

129
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,529
know. Right. Exactly.

130
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,640
I have Kubernetes

131
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,739
and

132
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:32,920
I have Kubernetes

133
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,269
and I deploy Kubernetes

134
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,850
and now I need to make sure that

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,739
it's working so other people can use Kubernetes to do the things they need to do.

136
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,640
Because fundamentally Kubernetes by itself is a useless application.

137
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:47,920
We need to run things on it

138
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:48,334
for.

139
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,035
Yes, I mean that operating system is a great example, right?

140
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:55,635
An operating system doing nothing is a paperweight. Who cares?

141
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,304
So I've got Kubernetes,

142
00:05:57,454 --> 00:06:01,075
I install a version of Kubernetes and now I have to care and feed it right,

143
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:01,945
and

144
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:02,815
upgrading Kubernetes.

145
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,774
Why do we have to care and feed it?

146
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:06,644
No, seriously,

147
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:09,674
let's examine this assumption because this is kind of a big assumption

148
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:13,744
because I, I'm not carrying and feeding the software in my, my washer back there,

149
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,750
right? Because no one's using that.

150
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,980
Not like you would Ker

151
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,029
-- Neti,
-- I use that washer every day.

152
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,350
No, no, no. You misunderstand me

153
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,100
when I say care and feeding,

154
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,869
you have to do things like, make sure there's enough disk,

155
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,779
make sure there's enough nodes in my cluster.

156
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,989
-- Make sure I don't have pods or containers. I have to put soap
-- in that damn thing.

157
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,149
Right. That's using it.

158
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,910
OK?

159
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:34,390
But

160
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:39,070
-- I, I don't think this is a valid analogy and I think you're mudding the waters.
-- Ok.

161
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,899
Well, the Washington, but in general I'm, I'm gonna say,

162
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:42,339
but

163
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,410
I'm paying you to care and feed Kubernetes Kurt.

164
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,369
If you don't, I'm going to fire you and hire someone who actually does that job.

165
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:51,429
I think you misunderstand the question I'm saying,

166
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,660
why do we have to care and feed it and you're pointing out?

167
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,720
Right? Because for example, the disc fill up, right?

168
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,859
Like, unless people are, you know,

169
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:00,406
unless we have some job running automatically that nukes stuff,

170
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:04,425
which that's not going to be awesome either or for example, my favorite is, you know,

171
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,196
it's a useful solution. So more people want to use it.

172
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:10,876
And so you go from 100 users to 200 users and then they all complain it slow.

173
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,855
Well, yes, that's how it works when we go from 100 users to 200 users.

174
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:17,705
Like I need more budget for ra M and disk and CPU.

175
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:21,816
There's many things, a lot of, I find a lot of times people assume thing.

176
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,332
I'm just, I want to be clear on this, like

177
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:26,812
there are some good reasons as to why you have to maintain it.

178
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:29,381
And sometimes those reasons are things like we want

179
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,131
the machine to do twice as much work.

180
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:33,372
So, yeah, you're gonna have to change the oil twice as often

181
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:33,941
or

182
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,332
put in twice as much memory.

183
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:37,372
Right. Right.

184
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:39,381
Now, I am maintaining

185
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:43,731
Kernes. I have to install security updates. Occasionally.

186
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:45,752
There might be bug fixes I need,

187
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,140
there can be whatever reasons. Right.

188
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,579
And I'm gonna want to do as little work as possible

189
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,859
on operations that could potentially disrupt

190
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,299
the uptime of Mike

191
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,619
Kubernetes instance. Right.

192
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,420
I don't think anyone would argue with that.

193
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:03,619
And now what happens in, in things like the open source world,

194
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,690
it's very common for software to move very quickly.

195
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,130
And so it's conceivable you'll have a major version update once or twice a year.

196
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:13,230
Now,

197
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,290
if I'm operating something like Kubernetes and let's

198
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:19,089
say there's a version update that's downtime.

199
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,730
Right. That's not going to be a seamless magic upgrade.

200
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm going to have to either stand up a new Kubernetes cluster

201
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:27,799
and migrate into it or

202
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,730
I'm gonna have to shut down the one I have do my work and then start it back up.

203
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,159
Well, and I think going back a step, it's worse than that.

204
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,489
It's an unknown amount of risk.

205
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,479
That's true too. Right. Like it's, it might be a really easy, quick update

206
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:47,059
and it might literally catch fire and the update breaks your server because reme

207
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,799
like we've seen that happen where software updates, you know,

208
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,299
don't install that redhead update on your Dells because um

209
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,890
-- it breaks your server.
-- Like I remember when I was a Cis

210
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,570
Edmund,

211
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:02,159
we would plan for major upgrades to infrastructure

212
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,780
and it would be like, we're going to start this Friday night,

213
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,080
we have all weekend to do it.

214
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,809
And sometimes by like 10 pm,

215
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,219
we were at the pub hanging out and sometimes by like 10 am Sunday, it's like, dear God,

216
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:14,119
please let this work.

217
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,950
I want to go home, you know,

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,469
and that is how it happened.

219
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:21,119
You never really knew if it was going to go well or going to go horribly,

220
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,880
horribly wrong.

221
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,229
And I mean, unless you have

222
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:26,710
budget to have like a double it infrastructure and have like

223
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,869
broad and a full working copy of tests that you can like

224
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:32,700
update and install and then cut over. But

225
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,239
realistically,

226
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:37,250
well, I was about to say, first of all, realistically, nobody has that

227
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,260
because you can,

228
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,710
you can't do that for like a network

229
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,450
like a major network. Sure, you

230
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:43,820
can

231
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,820
ask your boss to be like, hey, I,

232
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:50,500
you know, our network budget for last year, I would like to double that, please. Why,

233
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,500
you know, just to make upgrades easier.

234
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:54,099
Oh, no, you won't. Ok,

235
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,349
-- good
-- luck. And I think this is one of the reasons Cloud started to take off. Right.

236
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,369
Because that on demand,

237
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,750
it's like I can actually do this and stand it up for a few 1000 bucks.

238
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,030
But anyway,

239
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,059
back to this.

240
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,780
So, so the part of the problem is,

241
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:08,150
is there's this huge unknown risk and then the thing you forget too is

242
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,530
it's not like you upgrade it and all the problems show up right away.

243
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:11,599
Oh,

244
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,929
right. Yeah, for sure.

245
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,770
Because then you run your quarterly report and

246
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,109
the numbers are off

247
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,609
are the numbers off. They look weird. I'm not sure. What do we have a bad quarter?

248
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,570
Were they wrong before? Right.

249
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,070
So anyway, let's sum it all up. Ok.

250
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,169
-- And then we'll go on,
-- I want to say one important thing though

251
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,250
and something a lot of people forget

252
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:34,820
developers are almost never operational people despite the whole dese

253
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,679
ops thing. But I guarantee you, I'm gonna say something kind of mean

254
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,530
because I've had this experience at Red Hat,

255
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,520
the vast majority of developers working on software that runs at scale.

256
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:48,010
They have never run it at scale or even beyond

257
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,130
one or two systems. And even if they have run a test

258
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,219
like, oh we ran it on 1000 systems.

259
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:56,500
They haven't been responsible for running 24 7 like and I'm

260
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,869
talking like getting woken up at 3 a.m. if it doesn't

261
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,900
work, right?

262
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,929
And so I've literally had the case where the developer like, oh,

263
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,299
it works for me and I'm like, Well,

264
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,059
what about when the use case of 100,000 servers hit it?

265
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,440
And he's like, oh, that would probably be slow. And I'm like, that's the whole point.

266
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,799
It works fine on a thinkpad laptop.

267
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,859
That was actually word for word what he said.

268
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,299
I'm not surprised.

269
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,539
And I was like the use case for this product.

270
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,919
This is why we sell this product because 100,000 clients like

271
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,340
hit the server.

272
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,690
So let's let's bring it all together now, right?

273
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,500
You've got

274
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,700
an application,

275
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,929
you've got someone managing the application,

276
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,419
be it developers or operations or whoever, right, then

277
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,640
you have the forward march of time

278
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:38,619
and

279
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,330
a every application is going to see updates of some manner

280
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,479
and you have to decide when you are

281
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:47,320
going to install those updates in your infrastructure right

282
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,520
now.

283
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:51,099
Things like Kubernetes move very quickly.

284
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:54,979
A lot of applications now move very quickly because we're all like agile and DEV

285
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,090
ops and whatever

286
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:59,059
I have to make decisions about when I'm going to do my updates.

287
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,919
And if the application in question, especially an open source application

288
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,270
doesn't necessarily care about saying we're

289
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,359
going to support this particular version for

290
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:10,520
10 years or 20 years or whatever and they're like whatever YOLO,

291
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,489
we're just gonna steam right ahead and when we break things,

292
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,719
we just change the major version and you're going to deal with it and that's life.

293
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,070
So what's happening

294
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:21,219
is it is not an unreasonable, ask for someone to say,

295
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:23,270
wouldn't it be swell if there is a version of

296
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:26,070
Kernes that was supported for five years or 10

297
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,880
years or some relatively long amount of time,

298
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,349
right?

299
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:31,244
The fact is there is,

300
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,655
I know it's just not available as software, it's available as a service.

301
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:35,744
Well, not just that, I mean,

302
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,375
this is where you can do things like pay a company like Red Hat for openshift and,

303
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,414
and they maintain that for a long time.

304
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,015
-- Well,
-- they abstract it away.

305
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,635
They basically say we will give you this

306
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,844
nice openshift interface and under the hood,

307
00:12:46,854 --> 00:12:49,575
sometimes it's going to be maintained, sometimes we're going to upgrade it,

308
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,284
but you're not going to have to worry.

309
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:51,544
Yeah, we're

310
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:51,905
taking care

311
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:52,804
of the last

312
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:52,984
day.

313
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,135
And this is the part where this goes back to

314
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,989
people want solutions

315
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:02,429
that are free because duh like for sure, for sure.

316
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,530
But that's just

317
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,489
the, the open source community can't always give you your free solution, right?

318
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,960
-- I mean,
-- look at the Linux kernel, right?

319
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:12,270
The Linux kernel used to have their long term support stream and

320
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,710
-- yeah,
-- and it turns out nobody was using them. So they're like

321
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,210
they, they got rid of.

322
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,210
Actually, I bet, I bet a lot of people were using it,

323
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:21,250
but no one wanted to work on it because it's, it's terrible.

324
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,429
Well, also nobody, well, more importantly, nobody wanted to pay for it.

325
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,840
That's probably fair, right? People pay Red Hat all the time.

326
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,510
But you're also, here's the thing

327
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,140
when you work with someone like Red Hat or really

328
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,469
any sort of large vendor that does a good job.

329
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,039
I don't say any vendor because there's a lot of bad vendors. But

330
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:39,400
like when you work with Red Hat,

331
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,859
you're not paying for Linux, you're paying for an experience.

332
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,479
Right.

333
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,760
They're giving you someone to call, they're giving you someone to blame,

334
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,280
they're giving you someone to talk to.

335
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,450
They're telling you

336
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:52,650
we're going to make sure this works for 10 years come hell or high water,

337
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,080
we're gonna make it happen

338
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,909
and then they employ people to

339
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,369
move mountains and, and work miracles sometimes to make this stuff work.

340
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,669
I mean, we were there, we saw behind the curtain like it's,

341
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,239
it's not always fun.

342
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,530
Yeah, it's not always fun, but we got it done, you know,

343
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,390
and, and that's, that's the whole thing.

344
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,969
And I think that's where when I'm a developer

345
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:15,690
working on an open source project like Kubernetes,

346
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,590
I'm not giving people an experience.

347
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:23,549
I'm doing something probably for someone else solving their problem, right?

348
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,049
It's a very different dynamic.

349
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:27,849
And so I think expecting open source or even asking

350
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:30,619
a lot of open source projects for long term support is

351
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,229
well outside of this

352
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:36,804
-- universe or even caring quite often,
-- I'm just going to go back to the market,

353
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:38,025
but the market has spoken here.

354
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:40,885
If somebody really, wow, this is fun. I want to do this,

355
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:41,755
it would be done

356
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:46,695
and it's not, it's absolutely not fun and amazing and exciting work.

357
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:48,215
So people don't want to do it.

358
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,679
And I, again, I get it, I get that you want your solution,

359
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,520
you want to turn your light bulbs on and just have them work.

360
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,710
You want to have your Kubernetes cluster and just have the darn thing work.

361
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:58,760
Your light bulbs are a perfect example.

362
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,640
Remember like you've been, what, two or three years now?

363
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,419
I think you had those horrible cheap

364
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:07,960
-- crap light bulbs
-- from Costco, those that were on the Wi Fi and they, they just,

365
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,320
if you turn them off and on a few,

366
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,679
too many times they would like reset and start blinking and just,

367
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:12,625
and,

368
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,924
and you ponied up and you paid Phillips for

369
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,184
bulbs that are probably 10 times as expensive,

370
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:18,554
but also just work.

371
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:20,994
I'm in the same boat. I paid Phillips a long time ago.

372
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,474
I pay an ungodly amount of money for a light bulb,

373
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,145
but it does exactly what I want it to do and it does it for 10 years.

374
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,265
-- So
-- great.

375
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,455
But so what's fascinating to me is

376
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:34,734
what gets me is I think a lot of the people asking for these LTs solutions

377
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:37,929
haven't really examined what they want.

378
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,719
I, I feel like a lot of them are stuck in this trap of, I, I need this solution.

379
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:44,130
I need to be stable. I need it to be boring

380
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,650
and they're Yeah, boring is great.

381
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,510
And they're, but then they're like, oh,

382
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,729
that means running it myself and doing it myself.

383
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:52,760
And sometimes if you want something stable and boring,

384
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,539
-- you outsource it to an expert at that
-- sometimes for sure.

385
00:15:56,729 --> 00:16:00,159
I pay Epcor for my electricity. Could I have a generator on site?

386
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,190
Yeah, I looked at even having a whole home generator as a backup.

387
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,330
But then I'm like, oh, the power only cuts out like twice a year for 10 minutes.

388
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,780
So like,

389
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,320
right, like who cares?

390
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,840
And now, especially now, you know, I live in a neighborhood with underground lines.

391
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:13,489
It's super duper reliable.

392
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,229
I just feel like a lot of people are caught in

393
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,789
the trap of doing things the old way and doing it.

394
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,109
Like

395
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,429
let's dig harder faster

396
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,239
and the solution might be a bulldozer or the solution might be

397
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,119
like, we don't even need to dig this hole.

398
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,840
Maybe we just like send the package by airplane.

399
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,719
Like, you know what I'm saying? They leap frog to some other thing.

400
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,080
I've seen this happen where,

401
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,609
you know, people get stuck in these,

402
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,989
I have to incrementally fix this problem

403
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:43,030
and they don't step back and say what, what is the whole point of this?

404
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,559
And I feel like a lot of this LTs stuff,

405
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,630
maybe you don't need to run a full Linux kernel with a network ST

406
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,200
stack on this device if you truly want to.

407
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,489
Like there was this um discussion for, uh,

408
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,619
Linux kernel support for 50 or 100 year

409
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,520
old devices for pipelines and for things that,

410
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,880
like get thrown into the ocean at the bottom of the ocean and can't be serviced.

411
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,679
Right. That's right.

412
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:04,420
You know, not reasonably.

413
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:05,199
And look.

414
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:08,890
So here's, here's, I think the, the other end of the conversation, right is,

415
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:09,608
so

416
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:14,449
the hacker news thread goes to, it's, I think it's just a blog post article,

417
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:15,449
whatever doesn't matter.

418
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:16,618
And at the end,

419
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,558
this person talks about the

420
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,659
Kubernetes apparently had an LTs working group which is being

421
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,118
resurrected now.

422
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:28,798
And like this is a cool example of where open source if people actually want this

423
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:30,948
and they're willing to basically pay for it because you're

424
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,899
gonna have to send people to the LTs group.

425
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:34,149
It can happen,

426
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:34,818
but

427
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,699
it's not going to be easy and it's not going to be cheap

428
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:40,680
because you're gonna have to find people and basically pay them like that.

429
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:44,319
You're going to turn money into suffering is what an LTs program is.

430
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:46,380
Well, and I love the spherical cow world.

431
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,040
So I'm going to read straight from the blog posting.

432
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:50,910
I really hope the team seriously consider something like this.

433
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,880
It would be a massive benefit to operators of Kate Kernes

434
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,500
around the world to not have to be

435
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,704
in a state of constantly upgrading existing clusters.

436
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:01,785
It would simplify the third party ecosystem as well allowing for easier validation

437
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,334
against a known stable target that will be around for a little while.

438
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,925
It also encourages better workflows from cluster operators,

439
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,724
pushing them towards the correct answer of getting in the habit of

440
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:13,285
making new clusters at regular intervals versus keeping clusters around forever.

441
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:13,545
Yeah.

442
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:14,805
In a perfect cer

443
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:16,824
world that would absolutely happen. So

444
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:18,324
who's going to pay for it?

445
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,994
Well, and that's the thing, right? I mean, that's basically

446
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,444
the foundation of open source, right?

447
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:24,444
Where

448
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:25,214
if

449
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,780
there, there is open source people will do for free because it's fun.

450
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,060
There's people,

451
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,420
it scratches my itch and it's not that hard and

452
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,060
it goes like, I'm sure that's how,

453
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:38,010
like, literally, that's how stuff like N map and curl and Nessus start is like, I

454
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:41,329
my itch a little and then it just sort of got out of control.

455
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,229
Right. Right.

456
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:44,270
And sometimes it catches on and like we, you know,

457
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,189
we talked to Daniel a while back and he's getting paid to work on curl now.

458
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:48,709
That's great.

459
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,109
It is a complicated and difficult thing and it's easy to just say, oh,

460
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,550
just throw money at it because it's not even that simple.

461
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,349
If you want Kubernetes LTs. At this point, you need to find Kubernetes developers

462
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:01,800
that you can pay

463
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:06,180
-- that are going to work on old dead end code
-- or maybe

464
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:09,280
you need to take a step back and even consider training people

465
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,290
-- like taking a long term investment.
-- I would argue that right.

466
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,489
But you need to find a way to send people because you can't just send money. Right.

467
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:16,849
Like

468
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:17,099
it,

469
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,430
-- it, it's a hilariously complicated problem.
-- That's the thing too. Right.

470
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:25,089
Is, this is not a fungible problem. This is actually a very

471
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,800
skilled artisanal problem.

472
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:31,369
-- Yeah,
-- that's true too. It's really hard to keep some of this old stuff alive.

473
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,319
This, well, this is like we need to renovate the Sistine Chapel.

474
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,439
You don't just put out a tender and take the lows bitter.

475
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:39,729
-- So
-- actually,

476
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:44,427
it's funny you mentioned that a better example is Notre Dame Cathedral, right?

477
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:45,787
It had a fire.

478
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:46,758
It had

479
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,517
enormous losses.

480
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:49,958
And I, I've been like,

481
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:53,277
I love watching documentaries on public television in the United States.

482
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:53,868
It's like,

483
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:56,167
probably I don't watch a lot of TV,

484
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:59,968
but I bet 90% of it is PBS documentaries that I do watch or,

485
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:01,838
and Star Trek is the other 10%.

486
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:02,637
But

487
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,437
when,

488
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:04,478
when I watch it, they,

489
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:08,546
they had this documentary about how they were restoring Notre Dame.

490
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,385
And

491
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:10,385
yeah, like they,

492
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:14,965
they found artisans that did woodworking literally in the style it

493
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,725
was built in from hundreds and hundreds of years ago using

494
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:22,225
on it like the same trees from the same forest that orig like this is

495
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,465
bananas.

496
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:24,946
Well, that's like my cousin in Germany,

497
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:28,145
he's a proper carpenter and he's trained in the old ways of making things.

498
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:28,465
And so

499
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,105
like

500
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:30,984
ignoring all the disease issues,

501
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:33,683
you could drop him off in 1600 Germany he could build a barn.

502
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:40,683
That sounds bizarre and wild to some of us. But there's obviously a demand for this.

503
00:20:40,703 --> 00:20:41,894
We live in countries

504
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,713
that are younger than a lot of the housing infrastructure stock.

505
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:46,894
That's true. That's

506
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:49,093
-- like,
-- right. Like, well, you figure,

507
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,624
I live in a house that is 100 years old and in

508
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:54,693
North America that is incredibly old for a house in Europe.

509
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:54,994
That's probably

510
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,271
-- not
-- old at all. That's new info

511
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:57,722
from,

512
00:20:57,871 --> 00:20:59,942
you know, the last, last war.

513
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:00,462
Right.

514
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:02,521
And I'll tell you now, like, owning 100 year old house,

515
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,011
don't ever buy 100 year old house.

516
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,001
It's a terrible decision.

517
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:07,911
I love every time somebody buys a building more than 50 years old.

518
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:09,612
And they're like, and then we found asbestos

519
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,482
-- and it's like,
-- yes, I did find,

520
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:15,161
I didn't find it. It was wide open in the basement.

521
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:18,322
I got it removed and then I also had the basement removed in the place.

522
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:19,511
But that's another story. But

523
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,219
all right, I'm like, how do you not think that was an outcome?

524
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,050
I totally knew there would be, I knew the wiring every,

525
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,209
whatever everything was old and shot and most of it's been replaced.

526
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,939
I have a lot less money than I would have

527
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:31,520
bought

528
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:31,880
that.

529
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:32,780
But

530
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,069
yeah,

531
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,140
but anyway,

532
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,329
I just want windows 11 to stay the way it is with no major

533
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,959
changes because I hate change.

534
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:41,619
And,

535
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:42,780
you know, like,

536
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,989
but at the same time I also get that Microsoft

537
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,219
wants to move forward and not support Windows 95 forever.

538
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,550
And, and look, this is,

539
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,150
this is always going to be the

540
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,300
yearly fee for it. So that's

541
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,060
Windows.

542
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,339
You have to just run Linux,

543
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:59,459
-- like as cool
-- people probably end up in a Mac world

544
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,140
again because like the thing is like, I used to

545
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,520
need a Windows machine because to get this much CPU and ra M in an affordable package,

546
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,560
couldn't do it in the Mac world, right.

547
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,300
That's

548
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:09,689
a

549
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:11,829
little better now. Well, the,

550
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:14,670
the like the M series chips are,

551
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:16,619
-- that's
-- what
-- I keep hearing.

552
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,599
I still haven't used an M whatever chip and they're on what M three now,

553
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:20,119
-- I think
-- I

554
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,469
-- have
-- an M one

555
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:25,099
that's now about 34 years old and it still feels fast. That's

556
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,209
-- cool.
-- That's nice and

557
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,599
like never felt fast even from day one.

558
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,839
-- Yeah, like
-- it's,

559
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,589
I can't even imagine going

560
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:32,339
anyway.

561
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:32,849
-- Anyway,
-- I

562
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:32,920
tell

563
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,439
you what happened. This is part of it is like just with the

564
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:38,369
Ker Netti, especially by definition, nobody wants to run Ker

565
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:38,819
Netti.

566
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,890
They want the capability that Cooper

567
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,140
Netti provides.

568
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,420
That's it

569
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:43,890
like.

570
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:45,599
And so,

571
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,170
and that's an important capability for most people because the

572
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,750
alternative is running like virtual machines or God forbid,

573
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,660
bare metal servers, which if you thought managing Cooper Nets was bad.

574
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:56,449
That's true.

575
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,829
Just wait till you have to manage a fleet of 1000 bare metal servers.

576
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,630
I mean, that's a really good point because

577
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:03,949
there are worse alternatives. It,

578
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,010
I hadn't even thought of it in that context.

579
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,329
But right, if we want to talk about like LTs, this is why Red Hat

580
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,619
is supporting Red Hat Enterprise Linux for like 10 years

581
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,560
because is it 13 now? It,

582
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:17,540
it's been 13 for a long while. Oh, has it? I, I don't even know

583
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:17,910
why.

584
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,300
And, and, and this is the thing I always bring up with people that forget about

585
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,459
Red Hat has to support software for 13 years with an A B I

586
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,949
and API compatibility promise

587
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,119
that they have

588
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:32,405
and will never see

589
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:34,854
internal software written at some company.

590
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:35,265
A

591
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:36,155
Red Hat.

592
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:38,285
And if it breaks they'll scream at Red Hat

593
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:41,234
and Red Hat's like, what on earth are you talking about? Right. And that's,

594
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:44,234
well, they'll, they'll help them fix it. This is part of the experience. Right.

595
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,515
Well, but that's my point is Red Hat.

596
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,824
Not only has to support the software for 13 years, but they have to support,

597
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:50,954
use cases and

598
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,300
stuff

599
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,849
that they haven't even seen.

600
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,569
I mean, that's how Kubernetes works like that too though.

601
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:57,619
Like, that's just software.

602
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,170
But I think a lot of people forget this because they go, oh, well,

603
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,290
you should use Red Hat this way and not do that with it.

604
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,329
And it's like that's not what the customers decide.

605
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,489
I mean,

606
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:09,530
but, but again, like in that context, right, the reason people pay them and they,

607
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,910
they need that level of support is because, like,

608
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,619
racking and stacking and reinstalling operating systems is very, very difficult.

609
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:15,880
It's,

610
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:18,319
I mean, if we think Kubernetes is a pain in the butt,

611
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,880
imagine having to go and find a computer in a rack with 100 computers in it.

612
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,939
Right. Like, pick out the right one.

613
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:29,099
Hope you didn't turn off the wrong computer, which we've all done more than once.

614
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:31,119
They have indicator lights on the front now, typically.

615
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,910
Well, yeah, they're always supposed to,

616
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,500
but it's still easy to grab the wrong one when there's the indicator lights broken.

617
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:40,000
You've got 100 computers that all look the same and they're all like, you know, what,

618
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,750
2.5 centimeters high,

619
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:43,609
one 0.75 inches.

620
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:43,819
Yeah.

621
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:44,599
Right. Right.

622
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,349
But, like,

623
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,719
that is obscenely difficult.

624
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:51,010
And that's why people want operating systems that last for decades.

625
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:54,739
And fun fact, the hyper scalars now, the majority of them, if a server has a problem,

626
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:57,020
they don't pull it and fix it anymore, they pull it

627
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,349
and sell it.

628
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:02,609
-- Will
-- they wait for the rack to be like, what, 20% dead before they even look at it.

629
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:03,390
Stuff like that.

630
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,569
-- But
-- somebody was horrified to find out that they're just,

631
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:07,250
like selling the stuff as waste.

632
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,930
And it's like, but like, at that scale you can't,

633
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,939
-- it's not worth fixing it. It's really hard
-- to

634
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:12,479
fix.

635
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:15,530
You would need the infrastructure equivalent to a small country.

636
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,959
-- To do this at that scale.
-- Yeah. And, and what's wrong with the computer?

637
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:22,239
Is it the ra M is it the disk? Is it the processor? Is it the motherboard?

638
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,670
It could be any one of a million things that it's going to take? Yeah.

639
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,810
-- And
-- can you trust to put it back into rotation?

640
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:27,569
No,

641
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,000
that's like, honestly. So, you know, that reminds me of as well.

642
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:34,160
I love watching people on youtube like fix old hardware and stuff

643
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,140
and I just keep thinking like I watched this one guy was fixing

644
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,540
like Nintendo switches and saying he's going to sell them on ebay.

645
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,489
And I'm thinking I would never buy a

646
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,699
Nintendo switch repaired by like some guy on, on youtube.

647
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:50,670
Maybe that solder joint with that new capacitor is perfect and will last 100 years.

648
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,170
I don't know. And maybe it's a dry solder joint and it's just

649
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,089
for sure if you ever flex the board, it's gonna crack and poop.

650
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,579
-- But anyway,
-- anyway,

651
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,430
so we're running ourselves out of time and we're supposed to be talking about LT

652
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:04,910
si feel like if I was gonna kind of sum all of this up,

653
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,260
right?

654
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,400
I think

655
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,359
asking an open source project to do LTs

656
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:10,939
is a foolish ask.

657
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,839
I think you either need to do it

658
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,810
or deal with what you've got or alternatively

659
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:18,380
find someone like Red Hat has openshift,

660
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,459
you've got Google has Gke Amazon, what is Amazon

661
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:21,660
Cooper

662
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,359
called

663
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,199
Elastic?

664
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,189
That's an eck,

665
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:27,660
I don't know what that stands for.

666
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:30,219
The K is probably

667
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,479
Kernes.

668
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,020
But anyway,

669
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:32,709
like,

670
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:34,410
I, I think

671
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,979
this is where you either need to fund it yourself and do

672
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:42,349
the work or you just find someone else to deal with,

673
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:44,199
like, the crap you don't want to deal with.

674
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:44,689
-- You
-- know,

675
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,060
I'm gonna summarize everything you said. Which is,

676
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:50,170
if you want a solution you're gonna have to pay for it.

677
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,599
-- I mean,
-- yeah, I agree. Yeah, I think that's, that's exactly what it is.

678
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:54,880
I think you're right. I think,

679
00:26:55,229 --> 00:26:56,319
like, it's,

680
00:26:56,469 --> 00:27:00,569
what is the old JWZ saying? Linux is only free if your time is worthless.

681
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,560
And I think, like,

682
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:05,630
Kubernetes is the same deal where you can pay someone to deal with the crap.

683
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,760
Like, you can pay a company to deal with the crap.

684
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,290
You can pay someone who works for you to deal with the crap

685
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,050
or

686
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,000
that's it. Like those are pretty much the

687
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,880
stuff, stuff that's broken once in a while and

688
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:18,849
it probably won't be broken once in a while. I think it'll be broken a lot.

689
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:19,650
Right. I mean,

690
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:20,969
I think that's,

691
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:23,050
that is one of the things that I find

692
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,439
most interesting and bizarre about open source is we've

693
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:29,880
come to expect all of this amazing technology for free and for the most part it is,

694
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,819
but it's not actually free. Right.

695
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:34,680
Like we're trading something for what we're doing.

696
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:38,459
It could be, we're paying developers, we're paying red hat like somebody. Right.

697
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,619
I mean, we're also sometimes

698
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:40,109
in the,

699
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:43,630
in the beautiful circumstance of like curl where there's enough

700
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,229
people who are willing to pay and pony up that

701
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,050
-- I can absolutely be a free rider. And that's
-- ok.

702
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,630
And I, I think that is the nature of society though. Right. Society is

703
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,739
riddled with people,

704
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,030
people, you know, expect the,

705
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:58,670
you know,

706
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,099
it's funny to me every time the cost of the road infrastructure in Edmonton comes up,

707
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:03,900
it's in the billions of dollars that we spend

708
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,589
this

709
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,349
massive

710
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,829
road network, right?

711
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,900
Because while we would like fire trucks to be able to

712
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,540
-- get cars if it's burning down or the Amazon delivery
-- person,

713
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,140
society relies on like infrastructure,

714
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,939
infrastructure

715
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,550
like,

716
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,989
-- and
-- we all

717
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,260
benefit from it and it just blows my mind when people are like, but I don't pay,

718
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,109
I don't want to pay for those roads because I don't use them.

719
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,910
And I'm like, do you eat food?

720
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:28,670
Oh, man, you know, I've got a really good example of this. So where I live,

721
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,800
we get our water from Lake Michigan because there's,

722
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,420
there's actually this amazing amount of

723
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:38,699
like law in everything like who can use water from Lake Michigan,

724
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,219
how the Great Lakes work it, whatever.

725
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:40,500
And

726
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,849
-- oh man,
-- water rights are one of those things that, that goes back a long time.

727
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:45,160
It's, it's pretty wild.

728
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:45,979
But anyway,

729
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:48,819
I live in a place that can draw the water directly from Lake

730
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,650
Michigan because we're part of the basin or whatever they call it.

731
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,420
And

732
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,719
when they switched from these wells that were high in radium, so,

733
00:28:56,729 --> 00:29:00,050
like the water was literally radioactive and the water bills

734
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,890
like doubled because they were piping water from Lake Michigan,

735
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,810
like literally hundreds of miles to the city because you have to get it like way

736
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:08,209
in the middle of the lake and all this crap and whatever I get it.

737
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:09,510
Right. It's expensive and hard.

738
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,500
They increase the water bills and all these people were like, oh,

739
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,449
this is ridiculous.

740
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,079
It's like you need water to be in a functional society in the old

741
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:19,609
water was radioactive, like shut up. This is just how it works.

742
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:20,290
There's actually,

743
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,089
it's funny because this is one of the ongoing sagas in Canadian politics where

744
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:27,650
a lot of the indigenous communities don't have access to clean safe water.

745
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,170
They kind of point out that like if this happened in Toronto

746
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,270
it get fixed.

747
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,260
Right. Right.

748
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:36,020
For sure. There was a community that lost their water many a decade or two ago.

749
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,530
And the, the member of parliament,

750
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,719
that area literally wrote a long article pointing out that one of the quickest,

751
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:44,420
fastest ways to kill a community is not have clean water.

752
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,579
Oh, I have no doubt.

753
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:47,699
Yeah. Yeah, you need water. I mean,

754
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,619
like water, sewer roads, power, internet now.

755
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,589
Like these are,

756
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,739
I wouldn't move

757
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:55,979
-- without any of those, you know,
-- logistics. Like

758
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,569
when I hear these small towns in the middle

759
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:59,339
of nowhere complaining that people won't ship to them.

760
00:29:59,349 --> 00:29:59,979
It's like, well,

761
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,189
yeah,

762
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,790
it's hard. But,

763
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,339
but the

764
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:03,689
post office,

765
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,630
I mean, but this is another good example of where

766
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,949
the post office of a country usually lose money because it's the same,

767
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:14,709
like if I mail a letter across the street or I mail it across the country,

768
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,180
I pay the same amount,

769
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,910
but it obviously doesn't cost the same amount

770
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,989
to move that letter to those two places.

771
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,949
Well, and that's the thing.

772
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,530
Historically,

773
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,170
the post office was also one of the things that drew the country together.

774
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,699
It helped glue the country together.

775
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,810
It's one of the things that defined you as a country as having a proper post office,

776
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,520
just like having a military or law enforcement or a judiciary system.

777
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,290
Now, here's how I wanna, here's how I'm gonna end this. This is my last word. I think

778
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,910
a lot of open source is becoming

779
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:40,939
infrastructure.

780
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:41,510
It

781
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:41,959
does, it

782
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,579
-- is,
-- it is infrastructure

783
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,750
and I think

784
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,630
it is

785
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:48,369
in a similar manner to how we fund

786
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,630
our infrastructure through taxes and other things.

787
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,130
I, I'm not saying we should be taxed, the open source tax or something.

788
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,510
But like, I think this is where,

789
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,469
like the governments of the world need to start recognizing that

790
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,150
this is infrastructure

791
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:01,709
and we can't just ignore it.

792
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:04,579
And I don't know what that looks like and I don't know what that means,

793
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,060
-- or
-- we ignore it and hope somebody else fixes it.

794
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:08,579
That's probably what's going to happen.

795
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:11,400
-- But, because
-- that has worked in the past for almost every other problem.

796
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,939
It, it often does until

797
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:14,319
it,

798
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,819
whatever lights on fire.

799
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,829
All right, I'm, I'm calling this one.

800
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,599
This is a wild man. I don't know.

801
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:23,099
-- Or
-- somebody sinks a barge full of oil next to your intake pipe.

802
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:23,709
It's fine.

803
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:24,459
Everything's fine.

804
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:26,199
I don't, I don't know. We'll see.

805
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:29,819
I, I, I'll be interested to see what this Kubernetes LTs working group does in,

806
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:30,920
in six months or a year.

807
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,640
I don't think it's gonna happen because it's,

808
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,079
it's the thing people forget is it's not a lot of work.

809
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,010
-- It's a lot of work on an ongoing basis forever.
-- Well, and that's just it. Right.

810
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,030
It's easy to start. It's hard to keep going

811
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,199
and that'll be the trick

812
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:45,189
like it's like getting six cats

813
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:50,729
right, start it now and talk to me in a year, right? Or five years. That'll be. Well,

814
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,660
that's true. Probably. I mean, five years is the true test. But

815
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:57,459
yeah, I get it. I get it. All right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you for listening. Go
