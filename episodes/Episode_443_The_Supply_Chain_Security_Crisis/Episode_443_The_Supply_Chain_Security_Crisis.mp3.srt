Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:11,810
Kurt Siefried and my partner in thinking about supply chains.

2
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:14,569
-- Josh browsers.
-- We do think about supply chains.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,260
And it's funny because we've been thinking about them

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,450
-- for probably 20 years
-- before they had a name.

5
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:20,780
Yeah, because you know what,

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,049
my favorite thing about open source used to be was trying to find it.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,770
-- Uh
-- That's true. It could be difficult

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,729
-- like
-- legit, right?

9
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:32,240
And in some cases it was easy because it's like, oh, I need a DNS server.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,470
Well, there's bind.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,360
That's it.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,750
Like, uh,

13
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:37,439
yeah, pretty much.

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,990
-- That's true. That was the only game in town in
-- the late nineties.

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,360
You had Bind and DH PD. That was it, you know, to get your network up and running

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,779
-- and, and, or a web server. Well, there's Apache.
-- Was there more? Yeah.

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,299
-- No, that was really the only open source web server, wasn't it? Yeah,
-- that was it.

18
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,470
-- And then,
-- and then because the other ones were what?

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,319
-- Iis and the Sun web server and
-- there was a couple of like Zeus and stuff that,

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:01,700
that was the

21
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,638
commercial explosion, but quickly like glass fish and all those that

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,050
went away eventually because

23
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:09,620
it turns out building web service is quite expensive.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,510
It's funny because now, you know, it's so easy.

25
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,870
Like I, I need a random library to do something in my.

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,790
Well, first of all, which language do I want? I have a plethora of choice

27
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,989
and then I go to pi pie or rust crates or whatever.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,870
And I find like the top five results, let's say, look at, you know,

29
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,839
make sure they've been updated in the last six months

30
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,489
or a month or year or day or whatever.

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,459
And then I pick one or two, try them out and they

32
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:30,699
always work

33
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:34,379
-- to some degree. I
-- don't think that's how most developers work.

34
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,220
No, it's not.

35
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,010
-- No, they just most go to
-- stack overflow

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,540
and they copy and paste the solution for the particular problem they have and,

37
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,900
and I do that all the time.

38
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:47,760
Well, I just had that experience where I was looking for something and the answers.

39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,139
Uh oh, it was, how do II I have now, I built a backup True

40
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,349
Naz Box. And so I want to synchronize the first True

41
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,900
Nas Box, some of the data pools to the second True Naz Box. So if the first True Nas Box

42
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,069
craps out,

43
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,980
I can just stand up the second box with

44
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,940
pluck and the other things because they're fully synced at

45
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:04,900
the, at the volume level

46
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:08,479
and like it's actually it's built into the interface but

47
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,419
the documentation is a bit out of date and of course, if you google it,

48
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:13,990
all the answers are from like 2016 and stuff and they're like,

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,679
hilariously out of date

50
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:16,395
or they mentioned our

51
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,134
sync, which has actually been taken out of true

52
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:19,304
as now as a service.

53
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,104
Oh, nice. Yeah.

54
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,904
And also it's the wrong way to do it right.

55
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:26,014
You want to do it at the volume level, not manually,

56
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,714
synchronizing a bunch of random files.

57
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,544
Sure. Sure. I mean, that seems fair.

58
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:30,705
Yeah. So it's,

59
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:33,054
but, yeah, you know, you're right. Like most people don't.

60
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,320
Yeah, they,

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,710
you know, it always reminds me of, it's like shopping for cars.

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,039
We all, a lot of us have a car but we're never taught how to shop for a car.

63
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,940
We're never taught what to look for in a car and then everybody's like,

64
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,830
kind of at the point now where I'm going to go buy a

65
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:47,729
used car and it's just a question of how badly I get gouged.

66
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:51,020
-- Not whether or not it happens because,
-- but we do it like, what,

67
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:53,089
10 times over the course of our lives.

68
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,220
Yeah, exactly. And they do it 10 times a day.

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,619
-- So,
-- obviously,

70
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,639
well, that reminds me of this whole black hat thing.

71
00:02:58,649 --> 00:03:00,729
Like, so I wanna, I wanna to set the stage

72
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:06,636
before we go on. So there is a security boulevard. Is it a blog post or an article?

73
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,856
-- I don't know what it counts as it
-- has a date in the title. So I would say blog,

74
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:12,587
OK, it's titled Black Hat USA 2024.

75
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:16,856
Key takeaways from the premier cybersecurity event. I thought that was Defcon.

76
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:20,227
Defcon is the premier cybersecurity event. I thought so,

77
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:21,376
I don't know.

78
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,617
-- Isn't
-- that the one everybody

79
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:23,097
likes?

80
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,537
I mean, it depends who you're talking to. Are you in sales then?

81
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:27,746
No, no, you don't like that.

82
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,033
Well, that's the thing. Blackhead is the corporate one.

83
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,764
Defcon is the more technical one, let's say.

84
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:34,384
-- So
-- when I was at besides,

85
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:36,244
I went to besides Las Vegas and only besides

86
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,694
Las Vegas because everything else is a zoo and

87
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:44,233
I was talking to someone at lunch one day about just everything going on.

88
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:50,574
And this guy had a marvelous insight. He said, Defcon isn't a conference.

89
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,613
Defcon is a festival

90
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,333
and I think when you think of it that way, it makes perfect.

91
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:58,130
-- It makes sense because it's like a, well, the
-- hackers village,

92
00:03:58,311 --> 00:03:59,330
it's tons of people.

93
00:03:59,341 --> 00:03:59,391
Yeah,

94
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:02,070
there's all the little villages and there's all this weird stuff

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,201
going on and you have no idea what's happening and,

96
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,330
and then it's, it's utter chaos.

97
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,041
Well, my understanding is I always felt like

98
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:11,151
Defcon was more participatory. Whereas blacks,

99
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,621
you go, you listen, you walk the sales floor.

100
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,321
Uh what do you call that floor, the conference hall thing.

101
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,971
-- I
-- don't know

102
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,661
the show hall,

103
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,950
-- whatever it's called and you're like the place that
-- used to have swag

104
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,769
-- and then you try and pack the swag or throw it out
-- but there's no swag anymore.

105
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,170
It's all garbage now.

106
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,739
Like, it's terrible. None of the conferences have swag worth even getting anymore.

107
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,929
That's why I don't. Yeah,

108
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,950
the thing, I never, they always used to give away laptop bags and stuff and I'm like,

109
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,019
doesn't, by definition every, you know, it's like buying luggage at the airport.

110
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,079
-- Most people have luggage when they get to the airport.
-- Yeah.

111
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,440
But if you, so actually you say that

112
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,529
my suitcase broke

113
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,700
and I get the trip

114
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:51,904
corner cases, but like giving everybody a free suitcase seems kind of silly.

115
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,464
I have received many laptop bags and

116
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:57,065
backpacks that have gotten use from conferences.

117
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:01,424
I bring them home. I give them to people, my kids use them whatever. Like do I use it?

118
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,424
Absolutely not. I have a very nice backpack.

119
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:07,515
But, but anyway, ok, so inside of this blog post,

120
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:11,174
there is a section titled The Supply Chain Security Crisis,

121
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:12,894
which is such a marvelous type.

122
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,390
-- I applaud you.
-- I know because it just happened. Finally. It's never,

123
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,630
-- it's not been a crisis before. I
-- mean,

124
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,230
I,

125
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,929
I know what it's not a crisis.

126
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,029
It's, this is like it's not, this is like the pothole crisis or the

127
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,869
trying to get people to wash their hands after using the toilet crisis.

128
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,859
I think it's I like Clickbait titles and so

129
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,940
I'm almost definitely going to use that title for this podcast episode

130
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:40,644
because I know we're going to get lots of

131
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:44,464
clicks because it's a marvelously click bait title.

132
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,554
Sorry, I just read it. Oh my God. Sorry.

133
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:47,714
Crowds strikes, prompt,

134
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:49,554
an effective resolution of the outage was met

135
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,434
with praise as they minimize the disruption,

136
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:52,654
reinforced community trust and their

137
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:55,075
capability to manage unexpected challenges.

138
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:58,125
-- A what does that have to do with supply chains?
-- No, no, it does.

139
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:00,855
I think it does and I think it's good that crowd strike,

140
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,994
-- but
-- that's not how I remember that event going.

141
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,820
I was at an airport on the Wednesday after that and we were very delayed

142
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,029
on a Wednesday because I was flying Delta.

143
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,679
I'm just glad the plane got to where it was supposed to go.

144
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,720
Like

145
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,959
that was pretty much.

146
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,730
-- My concern is like, I don't want to spend the weekend in Atlanta.
-- No.

147
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,079
-- But
-- anyway, good food though.

148
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,640
-- Those have good food.
-- Every, every large city has good food now

149
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:26,839
they got crawfish.

150
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,200
I do love crawfish.

151
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,480
-- Ok. Before. Ok. No, no, not right now.
-- I can't get that up here. You can't get,

152
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,705
well, they're growing in the river now but they're not safe to eat.

153
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:37,786
You have, you don't have crawfish in your rivers and stuff.

154
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:38,026
Well,

155
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:40,235
we do now in the North Saskatchewan River because

156
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:42,246
somebody released God knows what into the river.

157
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:43,735
We also have a goldfish problem.

158
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:47,846
We've always had them in Wisconsin like I used to eat tons of them. When I was a kid.

159
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:51,425
We do go catch them and then eat them. It's nice. Winter.

160
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,585
We have winter.

161
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,835
It's not quite your winter. But, ok. Anyway. All right, we're, we're

162
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:56,726
ok.

163
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:58,805
Here's the thing. I think the fact that

164
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:00,765
there are people willing to call,

165
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:04,571
we'll say crowd strike incident and we'll put incident in quotes,

166
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:08,411
a supply chain attack or not attack but a supply chain event.

167
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:11,661
Right. Not an attack. It was not an attack, it was an event.

168
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:16,652
Yes, crowd strike is part of the supply chain for numerous organizations.

169
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,891
A lot of organizations that we found out

170
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,731
and this is the sort of thing you absolutely need to think about.

171
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:25,992
Like when we talk about supply chain, I think it is

172
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:29,891
almost exclusively a conversation about open source these days.

173
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,390
And there is a lot more in your supply chain

174
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,209
than just open source you need to think about.

175
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,570
In fact, I would argue

176
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,089
the not open source is often a bigger problem than the open source as crowd strike.

177
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,769
So kindly pointed out for us.

178
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,100
Well,

179
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:44,399
we have direct proof of that and I

180
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,369
have industry experience with that Microsoft Tuesday.

181
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,170
Like how much time and effort do companies spend checking these

182
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,850
updates to make sure they don't break anything for sure.

183
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:52,290
Right.

184
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:56,790
-- Thousands, if not tens of thousands of hours at large companies,
-- you know, I mean,

185
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,769
I remember working for a company

186
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,826
that ran a lot of Microsoft stuff and, yeah, we would have, like,

187
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:07,277
a test lab just for installing updates in and be like, does everything still work?

188
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,467
Oh, this thing quit working? 00, it quit working because the dis went bad.

189
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:13,027
Like, it's fine. It's not the update. Yeah. No, for sure.

190
00:08:13,036 --> 00:08:15,546
And I think a lot of places probably still do that.

191
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:15,907
Well,

192
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,986
and I think part of it is the traditional view of the supply chain

193
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,346
is from the manufacturing world where it's

194
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:23,346
stuff that goes into building something.

195
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:23,946
And

196
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:28,627
most manufacturing companies, well, see the difference is when you buy a hammer,

197
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:32,984
it generally doesn't randomly break or get a software update that breaks it.

198
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,604
And this is true of like a lot of manufacturing equipment from back in the day.

199
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:41,033
It's like, yes machines can fail, but it's not like modern machinery where,

200
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:41,143
you know,

201
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,263
they're getting software updates constantly and just

202
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,684
constantly glitching or having problems or,

203
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:47,843
you know, this other thing got updated,

204
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:49,604
sends a slightly different data packet now and this

205
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,414
other machine fails because of that or whatever,

206
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:51,744
right?

207
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,523
And I think that's part of the challenges we they're used

208
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,684
to like this was all part of your historical supply chain.

209
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:00,781
You know, we get titanium from X, we get steel from Y,

210
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,931
we get paper clips from whatever, but

211
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,671
they were easy to sort of change out. They were more fungible, right?

212
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:10,140
Like steel is steel. If you get the right grade, who cares who it comes from right

213
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:12,310
paper clips. Staples. Who cares?

214
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,781
Just go to, like, I don't care if you get it from Office Depot or Staples. The,

215
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,270
the office supply company called Staples.

216
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:23,460
But, like, with software being such a core part of all this,

217
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:27,080
anything complicated nowadays, like a refrigerator or up.

218
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,090
Yeah.

219
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,479
All of a sudden it's a lot more complicated and I think we,

220
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:34,159
the supply chain is a lot more fragile because it's a lot more complicated.

221
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:36,320
There's more potential for disruption.

222
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,200
I think your your explanation is wrong for a lot of reasons.

223
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,409
And I just want to read this description

224
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,359
from the middle of this article, the section of the article because I think it's,

225
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,400
it's the topic and it says I'm just going to read, I think it's a,

226
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,450
it is the last sentence.

227
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:51,919
It says

228
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,340
he emphasized the urgent need for organizations to adopt

229
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:59,859
more stringent security practices such as continuous monitoring,

230
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:04,250
supply chain audits to mitigate the risk posed by third party software components.

231
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,419
Here's what I'm gonna say.

232
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:07,799
If you look at the way society,

233
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:11,099
especially in the world of it has been functioning to date.

234
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,099
We have been, I would say

235
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,650
pretty successful by ignoring most of these problems.

236
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,059
And I think the reality is

237
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,104
and this is even true of your very long explanation. Just now

238
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:27,984
in the world of it, we only fix what is literally broken and on fire.

239
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:32,344
And most of the supply chain problems aren't broken and on fire.

240
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:35,965
Now, when Crowdstrike crashed, like all of Delta's computers

241
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:39,994
that was broken and on fire. So there was no plan B,

242
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:42,405
well, it was also all at once.

243
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,885
I actually have a very good analogy for this, which is my Kia,

244
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,145
the engine seized.

245
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:48,330
Yeah, you

246
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,880
saw that

247
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,650
and it turns out, uh,

248
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,789
let me just find the link,

249
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:56,909
uh, Kia Engine recall lawsuit site.

250
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:03,090
-- So, um, it's Kia Engine class settlement.com.
-- That's the website.

251
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:03,599
Yeah.

252
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:08,090
And so here's the thing. So my, my Kia engine seizes. So I, like I had it towed to

253
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,000
tire and they

254
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,539
seized it's dead. And I'm like, well, great. Now what,

255
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:15,760
like he's like, well, we phoned the Kia dealership and this is a known issue,

256
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,609
but these engines can seize and fail.

257
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:20,330
And I'm like, oh, ok, because I've never heard this before. Right.

258
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,219
And he's like,

259
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,159
and I'm like, like,

260
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,229
do you know what the timeline on getting this fixed or whatever it is?

261
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,650
He's like, well, they're kind of backed up right now.

262
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,385
He says they have seven cars and for the, with this problem in right now.

263
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:30,666
Oh, my goodness.

264
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:34,046
And at a different Canadian tire, I was at a, for a different reason.

265
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:36,645
I, I mentioned this and they're like, oh, yeah, the key engine recall thing.

266
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:40,075
Yeah, we, we're seeing a lot of those and I'm like, they're recalling an engine.

267
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:44,945
No, no. But that's the problem is it's not a recall. It's once it fully breaks,

268
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,656
if you can prove that you did oil changes and

269
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,526
took care of it for about four or 500 bucks,

270
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:53,205
they'll rebuild your engine or replace it, which is obviously, you know, to get it,

271
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:53,846
the full

272
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,752
price is about 5 to $7000.

273
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:57,401
So hopefully they'll cover it.

274
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,901
But obviously they're going to fight me on that because they don't want to pay for it.

275
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:03,041
But the fact is that like this covers like

276
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:06,831
eight years of engines put in Kia Optimus and sports

277
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:08,421
and a couple other models.

278
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:16,012
So literally like locally, like the Kia dealership, 1213 blocks from my house has

279
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:19,591
like half a dozen or more of these cars in for this type of repair.

280
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:20,961
My car blew up

281
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,072
like this is,

282
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,969
this is exactly it like, is this a huge problem? Yes.

283
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,489
Is it a problem enough that there was AAA lawsuit

284
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,799
with a settlement where Kia does not admit fault?

285
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:30,559
Yada, yada, yada.

286
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:34,130
Yes. Are they replacing the engines for 400 bucks a pop?

287
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,289
Well, yeah, and that's,

288
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,000
that's expensive for them.

289
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,609
And

290
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,369
this is,

291
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,330
this is

292
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:39,510
a,

293
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,690
but this is just how this works because like

294
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:45,710
you can't go back in time and fix the problem. Like we already shipped.

295
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:47,419
Lord knows how many of those engines.

296
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:49,619
Oh, and also these are engines that were built by Hyundai

297
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,000
used in Kias,

298
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,880
right? So Kia didn't build the engine Hyundai built the engine, the GD I engines.

299
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:59,780
They, they're now infamous for like, not, yeah, for being unreliable, long term.

300
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:03,940
And so, yeah, this is, and what, what blows my mind is like, I literally had

301
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,849
the car towed.

302
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:09,039
So, and because we were waiting so long for the tow, I literally put the key under the,

303
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,984
the floor mat because like, what somebody you gonna do steal my car.

304
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:12,784
That doesn't work.

305
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:15,284
That's true, actually. Yeah, because I had that thought.

306
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,844
I'm like, what if somebody steals my car? Wait, it doesn't work.

307
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:18,984
Like, ok,

308
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:22,575
so if you ever see a car bending on the road under the door under

309
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,494
the floor mat or in the gas cap is probably where the key is,

310
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,385
which will probably be of no value to you at all.

311
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,505
Everybody knows this.

312
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:30,294
Like now I've been,

313
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:33,085
I've been told this like five times in the last week with all the people I was

314
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:36,505
with. They're like, oh, did you leave it in the gas cap thing? And I'm like, no lock.

315
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,294
I had to leave it under the thing. They're like, oh, ok, cool.

316
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,780
So I had the car towed to can tire and like, basically

317
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,250
the tow truck driver fired the key into the drop

318
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,940
slot and then the next day I talked to him.

319
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:49,789
So I've basically done this thing mostly hands off.

320
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,500
So I have this asset my car which is broken. So it's worth a lot less money.

321
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,429
Now, it's kind of hard to steal because it doesn't move.

322
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,840
But I've literally had it like, towed cane tire.

323
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,559
They did some stuff to, it looked at it said it's broken.

324
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:03,760
Then I had it towed from the cane tire to the key dealership again.

325
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,000
Dropped off, you know, II I wasn't physically there.

326
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,236
I did go the next day to drop off the paperwork

327
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:12,005
and, you know, and then they gave it back to me. But

328
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,705
like this, with this huge asset, it's basically been,

329
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:16,476
I've been trusting third parties

330
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:18,645
and like the tow truck driver, I don't know who that that is.

331
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:21,995
Like, I, I, you know, scheduled him through the A MA app and hey,

332
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:24,515
your tow truck driver, Bob will show up and do it at some point.

333
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:26,835
Yes. And it, it's not ideal

334
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:28,846
but it's generally working and yeah,

335
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:32,255
my car will take Lord knows how long a month or two or three to get fixed,

336
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:34,536
you know, because they're gonna fight me on it and I want to fix it.

337
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:37,036
Well, rebuilding an engine is not an

338
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,382
thing

339
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:40,762
and I'm guessing if I pay for it myself, they'll be like, oh yeah,

340
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,242
we can have it done in a week, right?

341
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:43,512
Because then they'll make money doing it

342
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:45,192
-- for
-- sure. 100%.

343
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:48,671
They're going to let the intern rebuild all of these engines.

344
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,622
Like this is exactly what happened with crowd strike.

345
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:51,271
It's like we,

346
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:54,012
we shipped an engine that blew up a bunch of stuff and you had

347
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,192
to pull over the side of the road and get its tow and get fixed

348
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,351
and it was, you know, you could fix it but it was a lot of work and, yeah, I mean,

349
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,682
thousands of flights were canceled or late but, like,

350
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:03,952
the world didn't come to an end.

351
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:05,952
Like, I bet you a dollar if you ask 100 people

352
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:10,278
-- on the street about this, like, maybe 1% will know.
-- Oh, yeah, for sure.

353
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:13,747
And, and look, even in the IT world it's been what, like a month now,

354
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:16,007
-- the
-- fact that you can't remember how long it's been.

355
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:17,078
Exactly

356
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:17,638
the,

357
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:22,307
the Friday before I went on vacation. That's what I know.

358
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:23,288
And I'll never forget,

359
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,888
like I sat my wife and kids down on

360
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:26,817
Tuesday night because we left on Wednesday morning.

361
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:29,507
I'm like, look, we might not get to where we're going.

362
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:33,708
We might end up stranded somewhere like Atlanta halfway there. Like

363
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:39,364
we have to be for prepared for this trip to not go very well for a couple of days.

364
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:42,354
It was the 19th of July. So it was over a month ago.

365
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,984
-- Oh, it's over a month now.
-- See, like we can't even.

366
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,713
So, it doesn't matter because we kind of recovered everything and life goes on.

367
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:49,883
Well,

368
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:53,504
it's gonna matter if you're Delta because they're threatening to sue crowd strike.

369
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:54,984
But that's a whole another story.

370
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:58,004
Well, they kind of have to because their insurance is not going to pay out.

371
00:15:58,013 --> 00:16:00,583
-- That's probably true.
-- And they want to recover some money.

372
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:03,664
-- That's
-- fair. And I'm sure they'll get something from somebody,

373
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:08,950
some there, someone's going to settle somewhere like it's not going to court.

374
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,390
Well, and again, Crowdstrike will settle

375
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,729
and this specific settlement has no impact on any other settlement or lawsuit.

376
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:15,510
And this is very,

377
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:16,929
of course. Exactly.

378
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,130
You know,

379
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,690
it's like when Air Canada got dinged for their A I giving

380
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,020
bad refund advice and they specifically went to the BC tribunal which is

381
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,119
explicitly the act covering it says this is not for lawsuits for setting

382
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,729
precedent if it's important to go to court and do it there.

383
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:34,273
This is not like this is a lower, this is a step down from arbitration almost.

384
00:16:34,442 --> 00:16:34,703
Ok.

385
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:38,572
Anyway, we are like all over the place I want to bring us back to specifically,

386
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:39,882
but this crisis is new.

387
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:42,812
It's all of a sudden it's not existed for 20 years.

388
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:44,953
Yes. And, and I think,

389
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:46,632
I think the thing

390
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:50,153
that I find the most interesting and this is even true when I, when I talk to,

391
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:52,393
especially like Toma de Pierre

392
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:54,083
is the lovely human.

393
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:54,533
He is,

394
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:57,223
is sending me really interesting like blog posts and

395
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,192
books and things like that on a regular basis.

396
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:00,953
And as like

397
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,425
in it, security people as infosec people, as

398
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:06,345
aec people as whatever we are

399
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:07,326
MLA I

400
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:07,665
ops

401
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,195
whatever

402
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:09,625
I

403
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:15,536
love looking at these problems and being like, oh, we have to worry about, like,

404
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:16,765
updating these packages.

405
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,615
We have to worry about this backdoor package.

406
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,955
We have to worry about this and this and this and this, but everything exists in this,

407
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:23,645
like, much larger system

408
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,244
and the reality is

409
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,984
even as bad as we like to think things are.

410
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,975
And it's, it's funny because actually I was chatting with a coworker this morning

411
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:34,219
and he was like a lot of your podcast and with you saying we're

412
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:37,910
all doomed because I think the last one I did that and it's like,

413
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,910
yeah, they kind of do except we're not really doomed.

414
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,709
I mean, society functions for the most part,

415
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,170
it's more like we're just doomed to

416
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,300
the sort of mediocrity zombie shuffle when things

417
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,199
that could be better. But

418
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:52,939
putting the effort into things being better would be like,

419
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:55,619
like that daycare that served or not, sorry, a daycare,

420
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,930
there's several set of daycares in Calgary use a central

421
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:01,420
food prep kitchen that made hundreds of kids really sick.

422
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,420
Right. So they were, they wh it on food safety big time. And so, like,

423
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:07,319
we have all these food safety rules.

424
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:10,699
Like, I, I actually know a person who is a food safety inspector,

425
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,339
health code enforcer person

426
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:13,239
and like,

427
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,319
we not eat at certain restaurants and tells us not

428
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,640
to shop at certain places or eat at certain places.

429
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,479
I believe it.

430
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,550
And, you know, yeah, like legit, I look up the, the,

431
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,339
the records are public and I'm like, oh, yeah.

432
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:23,560
No, I don't want to go there.

433
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,650
There's so many things we could do to vast, like,

434
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,560
here in Edmonton we've had a lot of

435
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:30,130
recent people in crosswalks getting run over by cars

436
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:33,045
in March crosswalks because drivers aren't paying attention.

437
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:36,155
-- Yeah,
-- they're, they're probably totally not looking at their phones. Right.

438
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:39,175
Yeah. Well, or they're driving these trucks where you can barely see over the hood.

439
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:43,675
Those two, you have to be at least 4 ft six or so to even be seen

440
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:47,635
for sure. You know. So they're running over little kids like, yeah, I mean,

441
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:48,800
these,

442
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,079
these are impactful things we actually did lower the residential speed

443
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,890
limit from 50 kilometers an hour to 40 which increases pedestrian survivability

444
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:00,849
off the charts. Right. The difference in impact is massive.

445
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,890
But of course, you know, it's,

446
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,699
it's not like they're really enforcing that speed limit widely because like,

447
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:05,219
how would we?

448
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:05,530
Right.

449
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,829
So actually you bring this up and there is a youtube video I just watched,

450
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,969
I'll dig it up and throw it in the show

451
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,459
notes, but it talks about

452
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,339
the train safety

453
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:16,699
and, and there's some, some train exploded one day

454
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,140
and it was like the horrific pictures and it looks

455
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,500
like some love crafty and monster that it turned into

456
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,819
-- all the
-- steam tubes.

457
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,260
Right? And,

458
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,540
but the thing is like 38 people died, I think

459
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
from that crazy explosion. And I'm like,

460
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,439
there's a lot of things that happen where 38 people die and no one cares.

461
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,089
And

462
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:42,760
-- it's interesting
-- how many 7, 37 max has crashed? Well, two.

463
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:43,589
Yeah.

464
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,329
-- Yeah.
-- Like

465
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:48,209
who, you know, a door fell out of one because they forgot to put the bolts back in.

466
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,369
I mean, Boeing has had some

467
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,170
incidents as of late, we'll say.

468
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,650
But even then,

469
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,599
like Boeing airplanes are still in the air.

470
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,760
Right. And

471
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:02,079
they do get a lot of attention, but at the same time

472
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,239
-- how many people die every day in auto accidents
-- per passenger mile.

473
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,339
-- It's, it's insane. Like cars are utterly insane.
-- We don't care

474
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,400
or, or the other one.

475
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:11,910
Actually,

476
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,949
I also watched a video talking about like the extreme

477
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,550
heat in the American Southwest right now where it's,

478
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,719
it's really bad and like people are literally

479
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:21,229
dying because like if their air condition,

480
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,390
if you're old and your air conditioner breaks in your house,

481
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,469
you're probably going to die is what's happening.

482
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,319
We had that happen

483
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:29,228
last year with Vancouver and the heat dome. And there was talk

484
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,618
of like, for example,

485
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:34,157
for renters making it a right for them to have air conditioning because otherwise,

486
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:37,667
you know, these places are literally unlivable and that you can die in them.

487
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:39,628
-- And
-- I, I did that happen.

488
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:40,998
You

489
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:44,427
-- making landlords pay money for stuff.
-- Well,

490
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:48,958
ignoring that, we forget, right? We forget almost immediately crowd strike,

491
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:49,907
we forgot

492
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:51,588
almost it's a month

493
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,637
and I think this is like

494
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:54,806
part of the human condition.

495
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:56,586
And this is where we start talking about

496
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:59,495
like organizations need to fix their supply chain.

497
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:02,186
They need to monitor things, they need to patch things,

498
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:06,286
they need to do all this stuff, they need to audit whatever the reality is,

499
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:09,635
they're not going to because there might be a supply chain incident.

500
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,776
And we might say like, oh my goodness log for Jay,

501
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,885
like this is the worst thing that's ever happened.

502
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:16,036
We need to get on board and everyone needs to pay

503
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:18,276
attention and we have to upgrade all of our stuff.

504
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:20,965
And then a couple of months later, everyone kind of forgets and you,

505
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:24,163
you can look at sonatype published a graph

506
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:27,553
that shows like 30% of log for J downloads

507
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:31,463
from Maven Central are still vulnerable to log for

508
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:32,484
shell.

509
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:35,144
They have to be because you've got a package that depends

510
00:21:35,154 --> 00:21:37,543
on a package that depends on a package that downloads log for

511
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:38,973
shell. I mean, maybe

512
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:39,534
or log

513
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:40,453
for J Sorry.

514
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:41,213
Yeah, whatever.

515
00:21:41,473 --> 00:21:41,543
Like

516
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,333
that's like we have this at Red Hat where we started

517
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,413
going down the Java rabbit hole and it's like we,

518
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:48,293
if we touch this, will it break or not?

519
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:49,302
It might.

520
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:51,011
-- Yeah. Might
-- as

521
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:53,452
that's well and more to the point in some

522
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,582
cases there was nothing to upgrade to like the,

523
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:56,121
you know what I mean?

524
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:58,812
-- Like the original project that kind of faded out or whatever,
-- right.

525
00:21:58,822 --> 00:22:00,432
That, yeah, and that still happens now.

526
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,942
With like Python and N PM and everybody for sure.

527
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:06,572
-- But
-- especially with the complexity, like when you have 10 packages,

528
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:10,302
chances are they're still all alive. But when you have 1000 packages,

529
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:12,251
like, statistically one of them,

530
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:14,962
the developed before it died last Thursday for sure.

531
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,290
And I think that's part two is

532
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,989
the scale and complexity.

533
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:19,589
But

534
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:21,150
like I remember,

535
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:23,430
like I used to know all the configuration

536
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,949
options for Apache back in the late nineties.

537
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,390
I'm skeptical this is true.

538
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,670
Well,

539
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,430
all the important ones and now I wouldn't even pretend to know what they all are

540
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:34,089
-- and
-- you don't have to just go to stack overflow and copy and paste on.

541
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,969
-- It's fine.
-- Well, yeah, but that's the thing, right? Is like

542
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,260
you and I used to run Linux

543
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,829
and

544
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,859
I could do a psxau

545
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,939
and tell you what every single thing was.

546
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:46,397
Probably, haven't been able to do that for over a decade. Exactly.

547
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:47,118
Right.

548
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:51,958
Like you, you asked me how um system D works and my answer is, it's a binary blob.

549
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:52,458
-- It
-- is not

550
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:53,848
a binary blob. You know what I'm saying?

551
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:56,537
Like it's, it's no, it's like II, I know it's open source,

552
00:22:56,547 --> 00:23:00,238
but in the sense of it's this giant love, crafty and horror of code.

553
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:00,907
That

554
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:03,557
kind of does a bit of everything which we need.

555
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:06,228
-- They,
-- they have lots of little components built into it.

556
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:07,478
You could tell me that

557
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:10,277
system D will make toast and I'd be like, I believe you.

558
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,339
-- Right. Like, I have no idea what its capabilities are
-- a

559
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:13,900
plug

560
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,829
in to do that.

561
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,680
Exactly. And so that's the thing. Ok.

562
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,219
-- But
-- here's my point. Ok,

563
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,069
I'm not, we're not,

564
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,989
we're not ending this conversation like this

565
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,989
because we're off in the Doom territory.

566
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:27,150
No, what I'm saying is quite the opposite. Is, this is ok.

567
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,449
Everything's working fine. Is it perfect?

568
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,390
It's not fine.

569
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,109
There's a lot we need to do better.

570
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,640
But I, I think the important thing,

571
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,280
I wouldn't say it's fine. I would say it's not a crisis. So even though

572
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,670
the title of this section is the supply chain Security Crisis and the

573
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,449
title of this podcast is almost definitely the supply chain security crisis.

574
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:52,130
It's not a crisis.

575
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,640
It could be

576
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:57,839
maybe if, if certain things would happen. But I think generally speaking,

577
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,290
because we're dealing with complex systems,

578
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,270
we're not dealing with individual things.

579
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,420
So when you focus on one thing, it can look very bad.

580
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,050
But when you focus on like the larger systems,

581
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,790
it's definitely not as bad as we might be led to believe.

582
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,510
I think one of the fundamental problems is this is everything now.

583
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,750
This is the whole world, every aspect of the whole world. Basically,

584
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,790
it's the telecommunications networks, it's all the infrastructure, it's all the

585
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,599
like, for example, here in Canada, we might have a train strike slash walkout.

586
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:29,630
There's two main companies,

587
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,770
one is going to go on strike and one is going to be locked out.

588
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,489
So we might lose all of our trains in Canada and like to put it bluntly,

589
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,630
they, you know,

590
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,609
they're talking about how the truck industry can pick up a little bit of the slack,

591
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,689
but single digits at best.

592
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:45,329
-- And
-- I'm sure there's not a bunch of trucks just like sitting there doing nothing.

593
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:46,540
-- Oh, yeah,
-- exactly.

594
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:46,890
Well,

595
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,719
and there's certain things you cannot transport by

596
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:50,969
truck safely long distance like pot ash and sulfuric

597
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,319
acid and oil.

598
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:55,319
-- That could be I I honestly know very little
-- like no,

599
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,689
you cannot transport this safely.

600
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:57,939
There's a reason we do it in trains.

601
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:01,300
This feels like the last episode where you complaining

602
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,719
about the browser cas and me being like,

603
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:05,660
I don't want to care about this problem.

604
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,880
But the thing is like I would say this could we do better?

605
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,920
-- Yes, but do we need to do better
-- also? Yes.

606
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,550
I actually don't know. I think things are pretty.

607
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,800
No. No,

608
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,170
I'm not sure there is always room to do better.

609
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,869
What would be the actual benefit of it versus the cost of it though?

610
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,589
Is there other things we could invest in? Like for example,

611
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,880
instead of making the the the physical di uh

612
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,069
landline like making dial up better and faster?

613
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,150
No, the answer was high speed internet, right?

614
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,589
And now I would say in the open source world,

615
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:44,239
our supply chain problems I think are less about observing what we're doing

616
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,880
and auditing what we're using and all of this,

617
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,520
I think the more valuable and useful thing is to go down a level.

618
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,800
I don't know if a down or up how to define this. But

619
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:56,760
the people working on the open source

620
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:00,650
are really what we need to focus on versus we obsess

621
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:03,712
over this like consumption aspect of open source of like,

622
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:06,092
oh I'm downloading a package from github.

623
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:08,842
I need to audit the package. I need to do that.

624
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:14,082
Instead of saying, let's make sure the person working on the software

625
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:19,241
has the resources they need and is taking care of. And you know what I mean?

626
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:23,442
-- And it is not like working themselves to death.
-- So like the Sovereign Tech Fund Fund

627
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:23,994
open

628
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:25,004
source projects.

629
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,744
Exactly like them.

630
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:29,284
Yes, I think exactly what they're doing and,

631
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:32,563
and funding that is of course difficult and I do

632
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:35,124
-- think the government should be heavily involved
-- for sure.

633
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:37,913
Well, it is a, if there's any public good,

634
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,323
if there's anything that meets the definition of a public good,

635
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,784
it has to be open source.

636
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:42,453
Yes.

637
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,264
Like

638
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:46,203
curl, for example, like to quote Daniel, does this run curl? Like

639
00:26:46,306 --> 00:26:48,765
do, do things use coral. The answer is yes. Pretty much.

640
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,586
-- It's
-- everywhere on and off planet

641
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:52,026
I think.

642
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:55,446
Well, maybe that's part of it is we need to stop focusing on the product

643
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:57,696
and focus on the process

644
00:26:57,956 --> 00:27:02,446
-- that builds the product.
-- II, I think that's part of it. Yes.

645
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,836
Now the other side of this though is so while I was

646
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:08,965
in Las Vegas and I put a thing on Mastodon about this,

647
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,189
I had a conversation where

648
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,380
the end result of it was me realizing that

649
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,430
a shocking amount of our supply chain security

650
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:19,569
actually sits on the shoulders of like github

651
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:22,859
and pie, pie and cargo and N PM.

652
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:28,459
Because we expect that if N PM, if A, if a maintainer backdoors a package,

653
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:30,260
we expect N PM

654
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,420
to pull it.

655
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,532
If someone publishes a malicious repo on github,

656
00:27:34,692 --> 00:27:35,672
we expect

657
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:36,802
github to pull it

658
00:27:36,993 --> 00:27:41,292
-- and like, I don't want, it's not OK though.
-- This is how the internet's always worked.

659
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:44,522
It is. But that's scary as can be, man.

660
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:47,282
Remember Irc and all the forums, look, look at Reddit,

661
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,442
Reddit rests on the shoulders of a couple of mods to

662
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,572
keep the place from turning into a talk success pool.

663
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,762
Well, everything is like this because

664
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:56,916
fundamentally there's a lot of economic incentives for

665
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,656
things to centralize and be more efficient,

666
00:27:58,666 --> 00:27:58,916
right?

667
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,715
I don't want to run my own. Sure.

668
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:04,715
Get infrastructure and especially when my options are run my build and run my own,

669
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,056
get infrastructure or use github.

670
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:08,436
-- But
-- OK. No, no, no, you're not going down this hole.

671
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:10,666
I'm going to stop you right now and you're going to pull the Oh,

672
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:12,026
but what choice do you have?

673
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:16,066
-- Which is where you always end on this?
-- No, I'm saying, but the incentives align

674
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:17,906
to have this outcome.

675
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,140
A is that even a problem?

676
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,859
-- Because I would argue Microsoft has a strong vested interest in
-- not github.

677
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,609
Ignore github.

678
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:27,729
And let's talk about pi pie.

679
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:30,160
OK. Pi Pie is a foundation

680
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
-- and they have a strong incentive to run pipe pie.
-- That's

681
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,930
they are holding up

682
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,729
the world right now

683
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,442
and I guarantee they are underfunded.

684
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:43,772
We are counting on a volunteer run

685
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,383
underfunded foundation

686
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:49,133
to keep our supply chain secure.

687
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:53,942
And we know this and there are people who say that's fine. I don't think it's fine.

688
00:28:54,003 --> 00:28:58,672
Well, unless we start taxing companies, they're like, remember the episode,

689
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:01,666
you know, this, the the the the security of the market demands.

690
00:29:01,676 --> 00:29:05,885
Well, this is, this is literally what the market wants. Then the corporations,

691
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:09,765
some of them step up and commit to the foundation and donate, you know,

692
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:10,855
a nice chunk of money

693
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:12,975
and obviously the vast majority don't

694
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:15,566
-- because everybody uses Python, right? Like
-- that's,

695
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:19,536
I think this is like sovereign tech fund territory is my point.

696
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:20,130
I

697
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,949
think a lot of this stuff is sovereign

698
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:25,130
tech fund territory where we need the world's governments

699
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,349
to care and understand. And my, this here's the thing at the end of the day.

700
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:32,530
And I want to end the show on this point. I don't think

701
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,369
most people

702
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,410
understand like the importance of something like the Python Foundation,

703
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,489
the PSF the Python Sulfur Foundation

704
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,119
on just like

705
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,430
all of our software, right? Like we love talking about A I,

706
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,949
it's all Python

707
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:52,750
the PSF is driving the A I revolution.

708
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,890
And I don't think that lawmakers,

709
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,680
I don't think our governments and I don't think a

710
00:29:56,689 --> 00:30:01,030
lot of leadership understand the utter importance this thing has.

711
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,109
And I think

712
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,969
that

713
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:09,459
is probably more valuable to try to raise some of that up than it is to say, oh,

714
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:13,160
we have to audit all of our open source because I think the reality is

715
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:16,640
if we properly fund and staff, the PSF,

716
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:22,380
that's probably going to have drastically more benefit to supply chain security

717
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:25,430
than anything you're going to do as a company.

718
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,709
Well, that's the difference between solving a problem,

719
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:30,430
like putting a band aid on something and fixing one boo boo

720
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:34,260
and systemically looking at all the incentives and how the system works

721
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:37,099
and getting some people with actual resources and

722
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:39,709
-- power to help fix the system
-- for sure.

723
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:42,880
And that, but that's not where we've been directing our gaze.

724
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,589
I think we've seen things like

725
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:48,920
the open ssf get a bunch of attention and money when the reality is

726
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,500
the Python Software foundation should probably be

727
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,469
getting that attention and money instead.

728
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,449
Well, to put it simply, Red Hat has a lobby office in DC.

729
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:59,849
All the tech companies have lobby offices in DC.

730
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,270
I'm guessing very few open source projects do

731
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:06,140
I would be shocked if any of them do

732
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,930
Mozilla

733
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,579
-- might,
-- maybe,

734
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,319
maybe Mo

735
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,744
that's the thing like Google, you know,

736
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:16,594
all these companies have massive lobby efforts to help, to help air quotes,

737
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:19,474
write legislation and educate lawmakers.

738
00:31:19,655 --> 00:31:22,055
Yeah. And so how else would they like?

739
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:25,125
-- They're not going to go looking to learn about open source on their own?
-- That's true.

740
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:30,234
This is the, however we have an army of open source people.

741
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:34,275
And so maybe one of the things to think about is how can,

742
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:36,430
and, and we need someone behind this, like,

743
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,949
how could someone like the maybe not the sovereign tech fund?

744
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,500
Because I know they can't lobby but like,

745
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,609
there's got to be maybe the Python Software foundation can, can say, like,

746
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:49,310
please write letter, talk to your lawmakers, write them letters.

747
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,030
I bet it would take shockingly few

748
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,910
open source developers to actually change something.

749
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:54,790
I suspect that's right

750
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,745
because from what I've looked at and read about lobbying, it's,

751
00:31:57,885 --> 00:32:03,076
-- it's time consuming and expensive and complicated.
-- We're not lobbying,

752
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:06,745
-- we're constituents writing letters
-- that's lobbying.

753
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:09,056
-- Maybe, I don't know,
-- that's literally lobbying.

754
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:09,755
I don't know,

755
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:13,546
I, I don't know that what the term, I don't know what the definition of lobbying is.

756
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,541
I just assumed it was like rich people with money.

757
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,911
-- Well, they're the most effective at it. That could be
-- anyway,

758
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:19,921
because they can,

759
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:23,011
well, they can afford to hire the people to tell them how to do it.

760
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:25,192
Well, that's probably fair. We don't know what to do.

761
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:27,182
And that's a big part of what I'm seeing.

762
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:28,852
Historically, in open sources,

763
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:33,541
we've always ignored sort of the soft people skills, squishy side of everything

764
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:34,781
of

765
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:35,232
like,

766
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:38,621
well, that episode where he talked about how open source is getting gray.

767
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,800
What's the best we can tell? And like, how do we bring the new people in?

768
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,329
-- Not
-- the best we can tell. Like there's actual data. I think it's time to call this one.

769
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:49,459
But I, I think at the end of the day, you are correct.

770
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,819
We have ignored things like politics

771
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:56,670
and governments and all of that. And I think to our detriment to this point

772
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,660
and so I don't, I don't know what comes next.

773
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,530
I don't think it's doom and gloom, but I also think the,

774
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,619
the things we need to talk about and we need to educate people about is not,

775
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,670
you should vet all your dependencies.

776
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,150
Don't get me wrong.

777
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,390
I'm not saying you should go get I'm not giving

778
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,069
anyone like a get out of jail freak out here.

779
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,270
Like you still have to have proper hygiene internally.

780
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,560
But I think

781
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:23,089
if we want to see true change, we have to go to the sources more than anything else.

782
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:25,640
-- Yeah,
-- two comments. One, you should know what you're putting in your mouth.

783
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,489
And two

784
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,739
like, remember the hacker manifesto specifically says things like, you know,

785
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,329
we are free of borders, we are free of blah, blah, blah.

786
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,410
No, no, you're not.

787
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:35,880
I

788
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:36,650
know. Right.

789
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,829
And that's the thing like historically, a lot of these,

790
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,060
his hackers really do believe that they can be free of all these things.

791
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:43,530
It's like,

792
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,369
no,

793
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,704
no, like you, you live in a culture.

794
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:51,064
I used to think that, but yes, we have to function in society unfortunately.

795
00:33:51,074 --> 00:33:54,094
-- Well,
-- especially if you want society to give you some of that sweet, sweet tax money.

796
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:54,905
That's true too.

797
00:33:55,114 --> 00:33:58,305
-- To fix stuff.
-- All right, let's call it, man. Thank you, Kurt.

798
00:33:58,314 --> 00:33:59,625
Thank you everyone for listening.

799
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:04,224
I hope this was a happier ending. Go to open source security podcast.com.

Susie Pando says podcast hashtag on Mastodon. Kurt.

802
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:09,625
Have a marvelous rest of your day.

803
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:11,103
-- You too.
-- Thanks everybody.

804
