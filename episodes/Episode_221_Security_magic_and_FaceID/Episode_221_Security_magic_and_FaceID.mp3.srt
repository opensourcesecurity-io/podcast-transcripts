00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,990
This whole podcast is just one giant happy accident.

1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,090
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Curtsey Fried

2
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:17,180
and my partner in award less winning podcasting, Josh Pressers. Well,

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,500
-- we haven't won any awards, so we're award less.
-- Are we award less?

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,850
I don't know.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,790
Somebody gave us an award and didn't tell us which would be quite fitting.

6
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,530
Let's award ourselves.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,930
I'm going to award us the open source security best open source security podcast

8
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:35,380
-- in all of 2020.
-- I would

9
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:36,349
-- have
-- said longest running. But

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,770
sure.

11
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:39,630
Yeah, sure we can that two awards. Now, there we go.

12
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,330
That always reminds me of when I looked at, what was it?

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,860
I think it was Domino's Pizza and you know what it said on Google Maps,

14
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:46,630
a pizza chain known for late night delivery.

15
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:49,319
Uh

16
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,150
They're not wrong.

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,259
I agree with that 100%. Yes.

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,310
Anyway, that's like, actually,

19
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:58,509
you know what's funny you say that is so just a tangent.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,680
When I was in college,

21
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,950
I lived across the street from a 7-Eleven and

22
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,769
obviously 7-Eleven is open 24 hours a day.

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,510
-- It is
-- the best convenience store.

24
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,489
It is a marvelous store.

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,029
And I used to go there, we'll say late night and buy their nachos on a regular basis.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,110
-- And I went there one time during the day.
-- Did they, did they do the unlimited cheese?

27
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:18,716
They do.

28
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,015
You have like a little, little thing,

29
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:23,045
you can push the plunger and get as much cheese and chili as you want.

30
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:27,905
Anyway, I went during the day one time when it wasn't like 3 a.m. to get and I thought,

31
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:28,975
oh, I'll get some nachos.

32
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:32,606
Those are the worst nachos I've ever had in my life. But,

33
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:38,475
but at 3 a.m. when you're done at the pub, they are the best nachos you will ever eat.

34
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:38,755
Yeah,

35
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,356
there was a Chinese restaurant here that was open till 4 a.m. off the main bar strip.

36
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:44,695
And, yeah, I ate there once during the day and it was just like, wow.

37
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:45,402
Yeah,

38
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:46,491
it's

39
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:47,522
funny how that works

40
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:50,931
anyway. Anyway. All right. I have a serious topic.

41
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:52,772
I want to bring up because this is something I've been thinking

42
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,912
about and then we'll get to the real topic after that.

43
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:55,211
But

44
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:55,791
so

45
00:01:55,982 --> 00:02:00,222
I had someone contact me on Twitter the other day and they basically said, you know,

46
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:01,512
I'm a fan of the podcast.

47
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:06,071
I really want to get into security. Where do I start? And I spent a long time, run away.

48
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:11,311
No, no, no, no, not at all. I mean, that's our old man silly answer.

49
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,309
I thought about this a lot.

50
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,240
And the thing that I realized,

51
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,839
I think I've not realized in the past necessarily when we've,

52
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,600
we've discussed some of this is

53
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,259
there's no such thing as security anymore.

54
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,520
And I mean,

55
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,669
there kind of wasn't in the past but the reason I say that

56
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:34,279
is security isn't a thing what we call security is like 100 things.

57
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, it's like saying I want to get into business. How do I get into business

58
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,520
or art or literature? This is a,

59
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,350
even, even 20 years ago, security was quite a broad scope.

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,360
-- Like,
-- well, it was, it was, I think a little more common

61
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:51,011
where, for example, what I would say today is, I would,

62
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:53,561
I would split it quickly into two pieces

63
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:56,462
of operational security and application security now.

64
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:59,841
Whereas I think like back in the day there was way less,

65
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:02,921
it was much fuzzier between the two things because for example,

66
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,751
I worked at an ISP

67
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:06,641
and when we needed something fixed,

68
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:10,001
we would just start editing C code and stuff like that.

69
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:12,641
-- You know,
-- you and I are biased coming from the open source world.

70
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,772
Well, yeah, I understand that. And that's, that's a

71
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,604
-- good point.
-- And I think that's a big part.

72
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,563
I would look at the old security industry and a lot of

73
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,843
it was compensating for the fact that these vendors wouldn't do stuff.

74
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:22,083
Right?

75
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:22,244
Like,

76
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:26,074
how many timeliness did we see on bug track postings where it was like notified?

77
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,113
Well, I'm going to say it out loud,

78
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,563
notified oracle and then the timeline I'm looking at it and I'm like,

79
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:32,123
this is four years ago.

80
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:35,934
I know, like straight up or even Microsoft one or two years,

81
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:37,123
I don't want to rattle on this.

82
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:41,244
So, you're absolutely right. But I guess here's the thing that,

83
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:43,255
that I ended up instead of telling someone, oh,

84
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,455
you should go read this or read this or do that or something.

85
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:48,796
It was like, what are you interested in? What do you want to do? And

86
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:49,886
I've never,

87
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:52,395
that was never the first question I asked people where

88
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,085
they said I would like to get into security.

89
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:55,445
I kind of always asked that because, you know,

90
00:03:55,455 --> 00:03:57,425
the difference between running a corporate network and doing

91
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:00,276
pen testing and doing application security and blah,

92
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:03,126
blah, blah is, is night and day, the hours are different.

93
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:07,666
-- The fundamental focus and culture is different.
-- No, I agree.

94
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,727
And some people want to be auditors.

95
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:12,128
Some people want to be cool hackers and, you know,

96
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:13,697
some people want to do bug bounties.

97
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,598
-- It takes all kinds.
-- Exactly that.

98
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:16,726
And so anyway,

99
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,808
I've been really thinking about this a lot and I feel like I have

100
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:24,308
no doubt my views and opinions on this matter will evolve with time.

101
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,328
-- So
-- one thing that's interesting,

102
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:27,247
there was a thing on hacker news a day

103
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,558
or two ago about how to answer questions usefully.

104
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,108
And one common kind of thing in the, in the hacker news thread was this habit of

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,290
somebody asks question X and you go, well, did you really mean question Y or,

106
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:39,059
you know, and I,

107
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,779
but I do think it is important for questions that

108
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,029
are this broad or this sort of soft and squishy

109
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,910
that there is some clarification.

110
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,709
Like when somebody says I want to be a doctor, it's like

111
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,320
YP podiatrist, you know, you want to do like vaccine cures.

112
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:58,070
-- Like you got to narrow it down a little bit.
-- I think at the same time

113
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,989
it is,

114
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,429
it's like any kind of just journey through a topic

115
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,000
is you obviously start saying I want to be a doctor

116
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,510
and you might not even know how many kinds of doctors there are,

117
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,625
there's probably thousands of types of doctors if I had to guess.

118
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:16,684
And as you start learning, you can say, oh, well,

119
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:18,665
I really like this or I don't really like that,

120
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:22,825
you know, and I think security is exactly the same thing of what do you like to do?

121
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,225
What are your interests?

122
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:27,725
You know, what it reminds me of is the hero's journey story arc, right?

123
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,394
So you have the call to adventure, right?

124
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:32,625
Person wants to get into security and then they get supernatural aid like

125
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:35,625
the old wise woman or the old wise man or you know,

126
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,894
the talking bird or Josh Presser's.

127
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,649
No. And then no, no, no.

128
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,570
And then it starts to get ugly because it really does start to sound like our life.

129
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,380
-- Then there's the threshold guardians.
-- I

130
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:48,489
-- know. Yeah,
-- there's, there's absolutely no geek keeping in security.

131
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,410
-- We are a happy, warm, inclusive community.
-- No, I

132
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:54,959
-- like that 100 percent.
-- So then there's that threshold, they get past the threshold.

133
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,359
There's, you know, the helper, the mentor and then there's, you know,

134
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:58,809
they reach the abyss, right?

135
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,470
-- So there's that whole death and rebirth thing. And
-- I would argue

136
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,140
ever left the abyss.

137
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,049
Well,

138
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,529
that's where I was going with this because I worked for uh two companies.

139
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,730
I say partners in i defense,

140
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:13,420
it was like a technical analyst and the average burnout and I don't mean

141
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:17,929
it so much average is like everybody but me burnt out within about 2,

142
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,890
2.5 years.

143
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,619
And just they,

144
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,890
it was a combination of the type of work being it's like the postal system,

145
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,739
no matter how much mail you deliver today,

146
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,220
there's more mail tomorrow,

147
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:27,390
it never ends.

148
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,190
And I remember having a call with one of the higher level sea levels.

149
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,339
And he's like, yeah, he's like Kurt. So you've been here a while.

150
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,299
I'm like, yeah, and he's like, how come you haven't burned out, burnt out?

151
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,779
And I'm like,

152
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,859
I imagine my job is like washing rocks in a river, you know, and I,

153
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:40,200
I walk into the river and I wash a rock and then I put it down,

154
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:43,049
then I wash another rock and I put it down by the time I get to the bottom of the river,

155
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,450
I have to walk back to the top of the river

156
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,579
to start washing rocks again and it just never ends.

157
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,510
And there's really no point to it. And he went,

158
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,179
oh,

159
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,100
he's like,

160
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,959
that's not really helpful advice. Is it?

161
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,880
I'm like, no, no, it's probably not really helpful for most people,

162
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,679
but it works for me.

163
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:57,700
And,

164
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,100
you know, so I would, I would say for a lot of people,

165
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,649
there's, there's two big abysses in security world.

166
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,299
There's number one, there's the, oh my God,

167
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,399
this is so big and like we have to boil the

168
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,269
ocean to make the world a better place combined with.

169
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,200
And even if we do that today, it's gonna possibly burn down tomorrow, right?

170
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:17,579
Like we fixed every possible security shoot today,

171
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,070
somebody would find something new tomorrow.

172
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,100
-- Sure. I mean, except that we can't fix them all
-- today.

173
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,440
Exactly. Exactly.

174
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,179
So anyways, and that's that abyss and the death and the rebirth, the Phoenix, the,

175
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,769
you know, the transformation piece, which is next in the, in the story arc.

176
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,630
And then you have atonement, right? And

177
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,709
literally you and I are, you know, you and I both remember when we went from like

178
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,540
who we were to, oh my God, who the hell was I?

179
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:42,670
What a horrible human being I was, it is true. You know,

180
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:47,140
-- and, and sadly, some people never get there
-- I think most people never get there.

181
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,239
And then you go back into the known and you have the return, you know,

182
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,500
the gift of the goddess,

183
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:56,125
ideally in our industry means, you know, you start sort of mentoring like,

184
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:59,484
like a great example would be Mudge comes to mind because that tweet from yesterday.

185
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:04,065
But Mudge, you know, this, he's like one of the like foundational hackers

186
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:08,304
of computer security, like he testified before Congress or the Senate.

187
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,114
I forget which one

188
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,480
like with his hacker name, right?

189
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:12,630
And long

190
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,190
hair.

191
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,450
I love that.

192
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,250
And you know, and now he's like,

193
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,559
just found 6000 vulnerabilities that we're gonna tell the Linux community about.

194
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,559
We're gonna see, let's say I'm not going to comment on that now,

195
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,239
but disclosing 6000 vulnerability, I think it's 3000 whatever.

196
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,230
It's a lot. Uh

197
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:34,150
That's the edge of a knife and we're gonna see if he, if he walks in

198
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,280
and I don't, we'll,

199
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,515
we'll wait till he discloses it and then we will

200
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:40,445
discuss if he did it right or did it wrong.

201
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:41,433
That's like when you,

202
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:46,434
-- you're digging in your backyard and you find a 55 gallon barrel
-- in and I will say this,

203
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:49,655
I have never seen anyone do anything like this correctly before.

204
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:50,554
So

205
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:54,914
-- I, I am cautiously optimistic.
-- I would settle for not messy, let alone, correct.

206
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:57,775
But anyways, this is the foundational element of,

207
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:01,515
of stories and movies is this hero's journey story arc.

208
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:03,515
You know, where you go from the known to the unknown and back.

209
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,145
And I think like, honestly it works in life.

210
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,320
Well, it's just kind of how we as humans operate, right?

211
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,570
Very few people can do it themselves. You need some external influences, right?

212
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,150
-- Nobody exists in a vacuum.
-- Nobody can do anything themselves. Ok?

213
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,960
I want to focus on that point because what

214
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,590
you just said is very insightful and important.

215
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,969
You said most people can't do it themselves. Nobody can do it themselves.

216
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,719
And I think there is definitely a we'll say cultural aspect of it in general,

217
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,609
but especially security of

218
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:34,304
I can fix this.

219
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:38,184
-- No, you cannot even
-- worse. You couldn't fix this.

220
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:40,534
Like how many people are like, oh user ha ha.

221
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,815
It's so simple and then, you know,

222
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:43,484
yeah,

223
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:45,835
like literally yesterday. Oh This is fantastic.

224
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:46,934
I was playing Minecraft yesterday.

225
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:48,945
I was showing my son how to play Minecraft on the PC, right.

226
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,744
He's only ever played on the ipad and on the ipad wasd sure. I know that,

227
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:57,445
you know, space bar to jump. I had to look up the shift to like when you

228
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:00,844
in creative mode start flying, how do I was like, space bar goes up?

229
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,750
How do I get down? Right. So shift.

230
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,650
So I was helping him and I accidentally hit f

231
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:06,530
and all of a sudden there's like an extra block

232
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,909
next to my inventory with the block I want in it and it's like not placing and I'm like,

233
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,580
what did I do now?

234
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,099
Because I've played video games,

235
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:15,650
especially like keyboard based video games for long enough.

236
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,669
And I saw the screen, I'm like, oh, you know what it looks like?

237
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,039
I have one thing in each hand. OK. So I Google, you know, like,

238
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,049
literally, you know, holding two things in Minecraft, how to fix it, blah, blah,

239
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:24,299
blah.

240
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:26,849
OK. The term is dual wielding, blah, blah, blah. Look it up.

241
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,900
I have to put the item back in my inventory in an empty

242
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:30,075
and that will fix this.

243
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:32,135
Can you imagine a normal person is playing

244
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,965
Minecraft on the PC accidentally hits F and

245
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:36,534
all of a sudden the block is in the wrong hand and won't place properly.

246
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:39,184
I've done this and I had, I had to do the same thing you did.

247
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:43,244
-- It's super annoying and you and I
-- have 20 years of background and

248
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:46,135
experience and how to Google and what words to Google and like,

249
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:49,674
you know, we, we've both played D and D so we know what dual wielding is like,

250
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:50,775
I don't need to explain that

251
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:51,885
right?

252
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,534
Whereas to my mother, I was like, OK, so dual wielding is like,

253
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:56,224
and I literally took my phone and I'm like, D

254
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:59,130
and I passed back and forth to make it more physical, you know, because

255
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,849
like my mom has never played video games. She's just not a thing that she grew up with.

256
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,719
Yeah, there's there's this habit of like, oh,

257
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:07,890
you should have backed up every time something bad happens to these poor users.

258
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,450
No. Absolutely. Absolutely. And it is easy.

259
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,969
My favorite example ever, actually, I like to tell is

260
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:20,320
I was talking to someone one time about configuring and enabling TLS on a service

261
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,729
and this is a very difficult thing for people to do. And they said it,

262
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:28,265
it's so easy. You just make a certificate and copy it into a directory.

263
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:29,724
And I'm like, oh, my goodness.

264
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:32,164
Well, actually it's even simpler that you just need to, you know,

265
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:35,734
to generate a key and then generate a CRT with the correct fields and then, you know,

266
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,315
send it into the signing, get it back,

267
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:40,325
copied into the right location, make sure the file permissions are correct.

268
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:43,284
And then if it's hopefully something saying like Apache,

269
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:46,455
you can basically say like TLS security equals high and just

270
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:48,344
leave it at that or if you're not so lucky,

271
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:51,054
then you actually have to specify which ciphers and handshakes and

272
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,614
protocols are used.

273
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:55,099
-- But yeah, it's pretty easy.
-- Exactly this,

274
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,450
it's hard to mess up.

275
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,119
-- You know, you
-- know what I actually, so I'm a big fan of the painter Bob Ross.

276
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,500
He has a show called Joy of Painting. He's a Happy Trees guy.

277
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,409
And any time I see him on TV, when I'm like, looking at channels,

278
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,369
I stop and I watch whatever he's doing.

279
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,010
And he actually had a really cool comment the other day is someone asked him,

280
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,229
how long does it take you to paint one of these paintings?

281
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:20,289
Because he does them on a show? And his answer was 20 years plus 20 minutes.

282
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,640
-- It's so true.
-- How many paintings does he do on his show?

283
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,719
-- When you're watching him paint a painting? Well,
-- one, obviously every show.

284
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:30,880
Well, no, no, on the show he does one. I know he's painted it three times before that.

285
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,909
But that's another story.

286
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,119
But again, 20 years of talent is how he does it.

287
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,450
I mean,

288
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,349
I guess that's the advantage of being an air force guy

289
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,440
stuck out in the middle of Alaska some spare times.

290
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,190
Right?

291
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:47,669
-- You know, there's your 10,000 hours and then
-- exactly. Anyway, OK. So

292
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,419
point is the point is we'll wrap this one up if you are new to this

293
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,510
industry or even if you're not and you

294
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,450
want to investigate something new and different.

295
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,859
I would encourage you, make sure you educate yourself, go in with,

296
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:01,469
with maybe some questions.

297
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,840
But I think most importantly is find someone to talk to about all this and just talk.

298
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:07,669
And honestly,

299
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,429
even I've noticed a couple threads now

300
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,909
on Twitter where somebody asked that question,

301
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,590
like, how do I get into this or what about this?

302
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:16,219
And there's like hundreds of replies kind of spanning the whole old gamut, you know,

303
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,260
that's useful and helpful to some degree.

304
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,580
But

305
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,219
I do believe you're right.

306
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:23,940
-- That it needs to be more of a one on one conversation and relationship.
-- Yeah.

307
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,460
I would, I would find a person, find a person,

308
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:28,849
find someone to talk to and just ask them questions

309
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,619
and if someone comes to you and ask questions,

310
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,650
don't answer their questions, ask them questions as you know what I mean?

311
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,330
-- Socratic Method.
-- Yeah, exactly.

312
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,179
Like, don't answer questions, ask more questions because that's more valuable.

313
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,340
Well, yes and no,

314
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,080
I actually had somebody come to me on Twitter and I'm like, oh, what you want is,

315
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,010
you know, actually the CN A guidelines 2.0 page 11.

316
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,929
Bottom half.

317
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:49,840
He's like, oh,

318
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,440
holy crap. That's exactly what I need to say.

319
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,489
I'm talking about, like, life advice here now.

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,090
C

321
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:54,729
N

322
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,409
A question.

323
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,979
-- Yeah.
-- Well, yeah, for life advice.

324
00:13:57,989 --> 00:14:01,750
The Socratic Method is the way to go because partly that helps you

325
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,000
-- mask your biases.
-- Totally. Totally. All right. Let's move on.

326
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,820
-- What's our topic? I'll let you tell it
-- web kit being the foundational

327
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:09,989
or

328
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,119
do hickey for,

329
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,960
well, basically everything now except,

330
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,000
well, no, I was going to say, except for Microsoft. But even they,

331
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:19,320
-- yeah, everyone's, everyone's using it. Well, Firefox isn't. Oh,
-- yeah. Yeah.

332
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:19,950
Yeah, Firefox.

333
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,479
That's the one anyways and a couple of weird ones from God knows where.

334
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,479
But anyways they're, they're adding Face ID and Touch ID for the web,

335
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:27,880
which is pretty epic.

336
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,159
Number one just doing that is pretty epic.

337
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,640
But number two, doing it with heavy,

338
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,840
heavy privacy considerations because obviously, if I,

339
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:39,650
if you're using your faces ID, then tracking you becomes potentially a problem.

340
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,109
Yes, for touch ID,

341
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:44,599
your fingerprints and they've got a ton of privacy protections

342
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,630
in there to make sure that that doesn't happen.

343
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,070
And I just think this is the coolest thing ever because, you know,

344
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,169
now that I've got a newer ipad that does face ID, like I just love that.

345
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,169
I kind of like touch my ipad and it looks at me and says, OK,

346
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,099
you're curt and like lets me access it.

347
00:14:57,109 --> 00:15:00,419
And so you know, the lock time on that thing is real short because I can just,

348
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,979
it's so easy to unlock, right? I just pick it up, right?

349
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,640
Same thing with my laptop with touch ID.

350
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:08,809
And also I love it from an accessibility point of view

351
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,440
because almost everybody has a face that doesn't change much.

352
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,330
Well, like I've had the occasion with my kids' photos because I have twin boys,

353
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,929
they're fraternal, not identical, even as fraternal twins.

354
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,650
Like when apple the face photo recognition thing in a jigger goes back enough,

355
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,530
it starts to get confused between the two of them.

356
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,510
Interesting, right? Because they're just basically a pink potato.

357
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:29,969
Like you can basically the

358
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,814
shape is slightly different, but you know, they kind of look the same.

359
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:35,734
I think this is great because this is, this is so accessible.

360
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:40,133
-- This is so easy and it's secure
-- Well, so here's, here's my take on this.

361
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:44,213
I'm shocked Apple is letting this happen because Apple's obviously

362
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:47,554
the one pushing this because Face ID is Apple's thing.

363
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:48,174
And of course,

364
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:50,364
Google and everyone will have their equivalent

365
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:52,653
technologies and it'll come with time.

366
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:55,104
But Apple has been pushing

367
00:15:55,237 --> 00:16:00,797
hard into making things work the way they want them to work in their app ecosystem.

368
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:05,067
Like Fortnite is a good example of the fact that like there's all these like HBO go

369
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:07,138
in the NBC streaming service whose name I don't

370
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:08,978
remember and don't really care about isn't there,

371
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:10,208
there's all this stuff, right?

372
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:11,877
And Apple's taking this hard line.

373
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:17,547
And for example, Microsoft has a streaming service for games

374
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:18,458
that

375
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:20,297
Apple has told them, you can't come in

376
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:21,861
story. Do you know what their solution is?

377
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:26,171
Their solution is to just make it work in Safari, which is a marvelous workaround.

378
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:29,302
But here's the thing, Apple obviously, that's not in their best interest.

379
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:30,781
-- No,
-- they want that 30% cut.

380
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,702
I kind of view this in the same light of making web

381
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:40,161
apps more accessible is going to damage them from a business perspective.

382
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,771
And I'm shocked they let that happen.

383
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,461
Well, but if you look at Apple, they have taken a super

384
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,096
-- hard line on privacy and security,
-- they have done that.

385
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:51,815
What happens when somebody finds a security bypass

386
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:53,065
that lets you dump all the phone data?

387
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,375
Well, Apple comes up with T two silicon, which

388
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:57,505
also conversely means people like Luis Rossman

389
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,226
can't repair your laptop now because you,

390
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:01,666
you know, t two chip locks to your SSD and blah, blah, blah.

391
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,625
And they can't recover the data. It's gone. Sorry.

392
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:06,974
And then on the flip side, like I've noticed on my phone and my ipad, you know,

393
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:10,365
when I log into it, like I have lastpass and I've been a, you know, I like lastpass.

394
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,040
But the,

395
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,650
the Safari experience of password generation and password storage now

396
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,089
is I love that.

397
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:22,219
I'm, I'm getting to the point where I don't have a clue what any of my passwords are.

398
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:26,400
Don't know, don't care because the browser slash lastpass just take care of it.

399
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,189
And, but here's the thing

400
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,069
Safari because it's integrated with the I OS.

401
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,010
It will also do the passwords in the mobile apps which lastpass can't do natively.

402
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,390
So for example, if I open up the Reddit app on my phone,

403
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:43,510
it gets the password from the back end password store that you know,

404
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,709
got in there from Safari and it just works.

405
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:48,369
So even for apps, I don't have to go cut and paste passwords anymore.

406
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,670
It just works right from a user perspective is

407
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,290
so much more usable

408
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,199
and incidentally way more secure because, you know, I've looked at the passwords,

409
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,810
it's generating and it's like five or six random characters,

410
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,150
dash five or six random characters, you know, four puns, like they're just,

411
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,560
they're basically, you know, globally unique I DS at this point, you know,

412
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:10,040
100 and 28 bits of, you know, complete entropy randomness

413
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,229
or more probably.

414
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:11,939
And

415
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,359
what I'm looking at, you know, I've come to this conclusion of, like,

416
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:19,280
security is good but doing stuff for just the sake of security is almost never good.

417
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,069
Doing stuff that makes the world better, easier, faster, more efficient

418
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:30,209
-- and has the effect of better security. That's the way to go.
-- Oh, I mean, well, yes.

419
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:30,949
But,

420
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,770
-- yeah,
-- but you and I used to be like, security for the sake of security.

421
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:37,099
Well, there's some of that but I think there's also just the fact that, you know,

422
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:38,349
being, being a cynic,

423
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,349
there is an enormous amount of

424
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,079
just technology right now. That's basically the analogy. I love.

425
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:48,359
Someone told me once was a self looking ice cream cone.

426
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,180
I mean, these companies like Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter,

427
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:54,300
they're basically like tautologies at this point and they,

428
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,829
they do things to do things for themselves.

429
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,219
I bought this Google Home Nest. Number one.

430
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,959
-- It comes with a custom power plug, not a USB plug.
-- I mean, the Alexis

431
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,670
come with that though too.

432
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:09,069
Uh, no, all the, all the new Alexas come with a USB plug. The old spot, do they?

433
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:10,810
Yeah, I have a pile of them. They're all

434
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:14,229
USB and the fabric it's covered in is weirdly scratchy.

435
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,089
Like that episode of Better Off Ted where they make that insanely scratchy.

436
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,050
Fabric and then make chairs out of it and everybody works hard until they snap,

437
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:21,729
setting this thing up was like,

438
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,469
I had to skip or cancel or bypass more than 10,

439
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,660
but less than 20 prompts where it was trying to, you know,

440
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,459
hook up accounts or identify me or, oh,

441
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:35,780
it absolutely had to have access to location services

442
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,819
so it could identify Bluetooth and Wi Fi networks.

443
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:39,160
And I'm like, what? No, you don't.

444
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,270
You know, I'm like, you need to know what city you're in so you can give me the weather.

445
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,420
That's it. But it's Google. I know. And it was, it was a very googly experience

446
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,609
and I'm, I'm actually at the point now where

447
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,119
I've got it showing as like a desk clock with, you know, the old timey, like,

448
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,380
uh black squares with the white numbers on them. That kind of flip over.

449
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,250
That might be all this thing ever does.

450
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:04,280
-- And how much did you pay for a clock?
-- It was like 60 bucks at Costco Canadian.

451
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:08,209
So, honestly, for a nice desk clock, that's what I would have paid anyways, I guess.

452
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:09,089
I don't know.

453
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:09,489
Yeah.

454
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,130
Like it's just,

455
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,609
it's such a horrifyingly terrible device from a usability perspective,

456
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,810
but it's Google and I kind of expect

457
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,969
you're the product.

458
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,890
Yes, I know.

459
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,930
Get in line sheep.

460
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:23,415
I,

461
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:27,435
I mean, this is, this is just my, my eternal frustration and,

462
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:31,535
and I guess this is why I see enabling more

463
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:35,714
I guess just functionality in web apps fills me with hope

464
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:36,954
because

465
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:41,944
all of these devices and all of these app ecosystems are train wrecks.

466
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:42,675
And,

467
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:46,454
and now at the same time, like very few companies are saying, oh,

468
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:49,594
we should make this a web accessible service versus here,

469
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:52,555
install our garbage app so we can spy on you

470
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,479
and it's, it's horrifying.

471
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:58,079
-- Well,
-- and so you have stickiness and you can send them notifications.

472
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:58,479
right?

473
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:02,079
-- And I don't want any of that
-- crap again to poop on Domino's right.

474
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:03,790
I installed their app so I could order pizza

475
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,959
and it's like it has like a watch component and I'm like, cool,

476
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:09,079
like it'll tell me when my pizza's coming, which it did.

477
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,949
And then like two days later, I randomly get my watch beeping at me,

478
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:14,400
offering me a Domino's coup and I'm like, oh, ok.

479
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,319
I have to go disable notifications for this and uninstall it.

480
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:24,430
So, you know what I do is my kids love little Caesars, which is depressing to me.

481
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:25,000
Pizza.

482
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:26,709
It literally is,

483
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,560
but they love it. And so whatever they, but what's really cool they do.

484
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:33,813
This is, this is really neat. Is so they have this thing in the store now.

485
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:37,744
I think they call it the pizza portal where I just, yeah, that's its name.

486
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:41,813
I scan a barcode and like a little door opens up and my order is in it.

487
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:44,663
So I literally don't have to talk to or interact with a human.

488
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:50,573
So it's like, it's like the Amazon delivery boxes at 7-Eleven, but with fresh pizza,

489
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:50,973
right?

490
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:55,484
-- Ok.
-- I can get behind that. I'm ok with it in the times of COVID obviously.

491
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:58,063
And so anyway, you know. Yeah, the app's the same deal.

492
00:21:58,073 --> 00:22:00,624
I literally, I will install the app, order my pizza,

493
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:02,833
pick up my pizza and then I uninstall the app

494
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,527
as soon as get back home because it's like,

495
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:06,488
I don't want to deal with any of this garbage.

496
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:08,878
I'm guessing that Apple will probably do that in a future version

497
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:10,968
of IOS because right now they've already done the thing where,

498
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:12,828
you know, this thing wants access to your photo gallery.

499
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,118
Do you want to give it access to all of

500
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:17,527
your photo gallery just for now or just specific pictures?

501
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,647
Same thing with location? Yeah, I appreciate that.

502
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:23,177
And I assume at some point they're going to do that for notifications

503
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,758
where it's like this app can send you notifications while

504
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:28,488
the app is open otherwise like shut up or,

505
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:28,677
you know,

506
00:22:28,687 --> 00:22:33,232
for half an hour after the app is closed because like for food delivery would be,

507
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:34,251
that would be ok.

508
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:39,092
-- But
-- now obviously Apple might do this. I don't know if they will or not. We'll see.

509
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:39,671
But, but

510
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:45,432
someone like Google, for example, no way, like Google's Bread and Butter is,

511
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:50,112
is just scraping as much data off of you as they possibly can

512
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:53,222
and then getting up in your face as much as possible with advertising.

513
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:58,901
Right. Exactly. And so, I mean, this is where just that, that it's, it's such a mess

514
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:02,271
in terms of what the incentives are for a lot of these companies.

515
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:05,255
Well, I mean, that's what's interesting to me is Apple is,

516
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:08,235
I have seen Apple commercials where they talk

517
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:10,745
about just privacy for five or 10 seconds.

518
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:11,215
Yeah.

519
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:15,895
Yeah, I don't think Facebook or Google could run that without.

520
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:18,786
Well, first of all, it would make the news and it would just end poorly for them.

521
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,156
But I don't think even if they wanted to, they,

522
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,755
I think internally nobody would let them

523
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:25,446
because they don't fundamentally believe in privacy.

524
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:29,265
Well, they can't, they, I mean, if you look at Facebook or Google,

525
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:33,410
they've tried how many times to branch off into other business models.

526
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:33,920
-- Well,
-- or

527
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,060
Facebook just now talking about how, you know,

528
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:38,119
it's bad for consumers that Apple is, you know,

529
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,689
making it easier to block ads and that, yes, it's terrible.

530
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:44,839
I read the letter and I'm like, oh my, I'm like, whoever, like I get it,

531
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:45,750
this is your job.

532
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,199
You have to come up with these talking points and you have to write them down,

533
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,119
you know, logically.

534
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,869
-- But like, man, I just want to slap you with a fish.
-- I know. I know. I hear you, man.

535
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,439
I hear you.

536
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:56,979
It's so, anyway, anyway, now I will say, I know we, we,

537
00:23:56,989 --> 00:24:00,979
we actually talk about how much we like Apple more than I prefer on this podcast.

538
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:03,904
-- But I,
-- it's not that I like Apple more. It's that I

539
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:06,264
-- dislike them less. They
-- suck less.

540
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:10,524
-- Exactly
-- that their incentives appear to be more aligned with me than say

541
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:10,943
Google.

542
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:13,963
Maybe I'm still not convinced they're doing this for the right reasons.

543
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:15,374
Well, no, Apple's incentive is simple.

544
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:17,654
I pay them like a grand every two or three years for a phone.

545
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:19,723
I pay them a grand every two or three years for a laptop.

546
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:23,784
I pay them, you know, X dollars a month for extra icloud. I pay them for apps

547
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:26,864
and I'm ok with that because I feel like I get value for it.

548
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:30,413
You know, just like I'm happy every month when I pay my, you know,

549
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:33,687
I have a combined for my power, water, sewage, garbage pickup

550
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:37,297
and natural gas and all of these things. Like I love it.

551
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:40,368
I flush my toilet and don't know, don't care. It's just, it's gone.

552
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:45,917
Now, here's the problem though is if, if web apps become more and more popular,

553
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:50,088
then you're going to pay Apple less and less money because you're going to pay the

554
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:53,787
-- web app owner. Yeah.
-- And I've had that happen with Story Bots, right?

555
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:55,547
Story Bots app went off the store and now

556
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:57,777
they want a monthly subscription on the web and,

557
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,968
-- and
-- that's frustrating for obvious reasons.

558
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:00,368
Now,

559
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:06,511
what's really wild is I donated to a political campaign recently.

560
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:08,661
I won't tell you which one, but you can probably figure it out.

561
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,871
But I went to their website, I was on my phone. They sent an email.

562
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,661
They're like, will you give us some money? I'm like, whatever.

563
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:16,391
I'm feeling happy, I'll give you some money. Right. I click the button

564
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:21,552
and it says you can use apple pay to pay on the website. It was amazing.

565
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,271
And it worked and like, I scanned my fingerprint, it sent them money.

566
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:27,562
I'd obviously give them some information and they're like, oh,

567
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:29,722
now that you've paid us, you should sign up for an account.

568
00:25:29,732 --> 00:25:31,036
And I was like, no, but,

569
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:36,515
but anyway, like I was flabbergasted that Apple Pay just worked on a website.

570
00:25:36,526 --> 00:25:37,495
It was amazing.

571
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:41,505
I use it for when I order my Chinese food. My local Chinese place takes

572
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,936
-- Apple Pay square and on the
-- website.

573
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:45,416
Yeah,

574
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:46,446
that's awesome.

575
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,015
Yeah, they take Apple Square

576
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:52,176
and Google Pay and you can also, like, plug in your credit card manually.

577
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:54,255
I didn't know that was a thing on websites

578
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:55,916
because I think they go through Shopify,

579
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:57,215
I want to say

580
00:25:57,345 --> 00:25:59,615
or something like that. They go through one of those big providers where it's just,

581
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,300
just all works. That's awesome.

582
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,790
Right. Well, that's the future, right? Like I get it.

583
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,770
Why people again, like the whole cloud thing. I'm a little biased but,

584
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:09,520
you know, people who set up their own ecommerce website. Great. Cool.

585
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,449
Now you're going to get hacked and all your data is going to go.

586
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:13,160
Ah, yes, seriously.

587
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,660
Versus you just, I'm going to say Shopify because I'm a Canadian.

588
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,119
Shopify is a Canadian company and they're actually pretty decent.

589
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,719
You know, you just do it on Shopify, they take their cut

590
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,400
monthly, blah, blah, blah, and, but everything just works and,

591
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,359
but you get access to all these insane features and again,

592
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,750
no offense. Shop.

593
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,050
If I can do more security than like Bob running his web server with ecommerce on it.

594
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,099
I'm sorry, that's just how that works.

595
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,479
Like, I'll never forget locally.

596
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:43,410
I remember when the first secure web server to the best of my knowledge

597
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,109
was deployed in Monton and it was a company called the Running Room.

598
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,290
They sell like jogging

599
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,989
stuff and like sport equipment and they, I don't know what they paid,

600
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,050
but they had a son,

601
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,030
microsystems server running the Netscape Secure web

602
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,069
server thing with an online store.

603
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,770
And yeah, a few years later it went away.

604
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,290
But I was,

605
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,930
I'm just thinking back to those days like there's no

606
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,989
way they were competent to run that thing securely.

607
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,839
I remember building an online shop.

608
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:11,114
This was in nineties and let's just say corners were cut.

609
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:15,515
I don't think PC I existed, but we would have definitely failed our PC I audit.

610
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:16,714
If it, if it was a thing,

611
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:20,834
we were storing like credit cards unencrypted in a mysql database.

612
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:22,535
-- It was terrible.
-- My solution.

613
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:26,444
We, we couldn't afford a secure web server for a project. So I called it secure

614
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:27,834
server dot

615
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:29,594
dot com.

616
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,500
And then we gave people the option of faxing on their

617
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,560
order and we got like two or three faxes a month,

618
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,989
but most people ordered online.

619
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,479
At least we had a TLS enabled web server. But holy cow.

620
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,119
Well, but I mean, this is literally back in like the nineties. So

621
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,849
we've rat holed marvelously and we're basically out of time.

622
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,640
So I guess in summary,

623
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,489
I love to see that these web frameworks

624
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,920
are picking up all of these interesting features.

625
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,160
But I also, I'm terrified

626
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,729
that these companies are going to realize

627
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,510
as they enrich

628
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:05,869
the web browsers, they are going to be relinquishing control.

629
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,469
We've already seen this happen with media, right? Where

630
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:11,930
you used to just pay your cable bill, but now you've got Netflix, Hulu

631
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:15,089
youtube wants, what is it like nine bucks a month or whatever?

632
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,550
And what we're then seeing now is a bit of consolidation

633
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,709
because I don't want to pay for seven streaming services,

634
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:20,949
right?

635
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,550
And that's going to happen with these web apps is I

636
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,880
don't want to pay 17 different companies for my thing.

637
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,280
I just, you know, I want to pay for games

638
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:30,206
-- for my kids. I
-- mean, maybe I, I'm, we'll see, it's,

639
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:34,206
I don't know, I don't know how this ends but, but it regardless,

640
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:38,725
I'm glad Apple is doing it and I have a strong suspicion.

641
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:43,926
Someone in a certain place in the company hasn't connected the dots that,

642
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:45,885
that are going to connect at some point

643
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:48,505
-- or
-- they're just transitioning to their next Apple

644
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:51,056
-- self.
-- I would be shocked if that's the case.

645
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:53,005
They did it once with Steve jobs.

646
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:55,196
And honestly, when Tim Cook came in, I was like, oh,

647
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:59,062
-- well that, you know, Apple was nice while it lasted.
-- That is also true.

648
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,222
-- I said the same thing.
-- I am pleasantly surprised at how that's

649
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:02,621
worked out.

650
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:05,881
They are still a company and I think they're doing

651
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,131
acceptable.

652
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:09,791
I feel like they understand the innovation trap of

653
00:29:09,802 --> 00:29:11,702
-- where they do have to eat their
-- young.

654
00:29:12,062 --> 00:29:14,052
What have they eaten lately though

655
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:19,562
-- iphone se the fact that they came up with an iphone se two.
-- That is true. And I bought an

656
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:23,462
-- E because I am a cheapskate
-- and on the flip side too, the iphone se two,

657
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:24,041
as I understand,

658
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:25,858
it actually has a thicker profit margin for

659
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:28,238
them because it's like reusing components and stuff.

660
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:33,828
It's literally an iphone eight with a better chip in it. My son has an iphone eight.

661
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:38,478
The cases are the same. Every, the buttons are all the same. The screen is the same.

662
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:42,927
-- It's just mine has a slightly nicer chip and more ram like that's it.
-- I don't know.

663
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:44,218
I feel like, I mean,

664
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:47,718
I look at Google and Facebook and they are sadly like Google has gone

665
00:29:47,728 --> 00:29:50,228
so far as to create alphabet to try and re invent themselves and they've,

666
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:52,787
from what I've seen failed spectacularly there.

667
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:53,874
Like none of that has worked out.

668
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:57,354
-- I mean,
-- it's very, how many big companies have ever reinvented themselves though.

669
00:29:57,364 --> 00:30:00,173
I mean, Apple and Microsoft come to mind, but that's about

670
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:03,063
-- it.
-- Lots of companies have reinvented themselves and then cratered out.

671
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:04,534
Well. Right. Right. Exactly.

672
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:09,173
So, anyway, anyway, all right, we are fresh out of time, so I'm going to call it.

You too, I guess. Try to be more like Bob Ross. Everybody.

678
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,250
We don't,

679
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,459
we don't make mistakes, we make happy accidents.

680
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:30,209
We'll say that this whole podcast is just one giant happy accident.

681
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,650
-- I don't
-- think the PC I auditors are going to like that one.

682

Whatever. Nobody likes those guys. Anyway.
