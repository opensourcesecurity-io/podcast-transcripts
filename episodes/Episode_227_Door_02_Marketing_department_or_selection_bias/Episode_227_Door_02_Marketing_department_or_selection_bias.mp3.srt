Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with Josh Brushes and myself.

1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:04,920
Kurt Siefried.

2
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:09,000
Uh, you skipped a lot of whatever. It's December 2nd. Happy December 2nd. Kurt.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,630
-- Well, no, it's not December 2nd. It's door number two, door
-- number two, whatever.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,819
It's December 2nd.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,659
That's the point of the advent calendar. Door.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,860
Number two is opened on the second of December. It's the second of December.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,069
It has not been 17 seconds since the last episode

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,479
for you and us for everybody else. Time dilation occurred

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,170
anyway.

10
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,209
So this time we're talking about even though we have numbers, do they matter?

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,729
-- What
-- kind of numbers do we have?

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,069
Like, I have plenty of numbers,

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,560
70% of organizations say that they believe

14
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:40,889
their security risk increased significantly in 2017.

15
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:44,849
-- So
-- what we have are statistics about the security industry.

16
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,069
Well, we have statistics that were gathered

17
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,180
probably not very well.

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,169
And do they even matter?

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,009
Like

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,770
here's a good 1 90% of hackers cover their tracks by using

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,240
Du

22
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:00,369
du du encryption.

23
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,689
OK. So

24
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:06,150
I will put a link to this particular story in the show notes.

25
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,680
And oh, for, for those of you who haven't caught on yet.

26
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,699
Every one of these is going to be its own episode.

27
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:15,230
I'm not trying to do anything clever because I've listened to

28
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,069
weird special Christmasy type Advent Calendar podcast before

29
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,330
and when they don't put the episode number in it,

30
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:23,150
it's very difficult to put them in the correct

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,949
order if you accidentally get them out of order,

32
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,510
which I did.

33
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,550
So that is why I'm doing it this way anyway, I'll put it in the shorts.

34
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,599
But OK, continue. Sorry. Thank you.

35
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,239
Well, just, you know, it's just like these numbers are even with some context.

36
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:38,930
OK, there's a lot of numbers without context, they are useless.

37
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:42,150
And then there's like a whole bunch of numbers with context that are still

38
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,839
not

39
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,500
useful or actionable.

40
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:45,410
They aren't.

41
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,449
I agree like, well,

42
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:49,050
and some of them are amusing because it's like I would have guessed higher,

43
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:51,809
but like 75% of organizations infected with ransomware

44
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:54,169
were running up to date Endpoint protection,

45
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,339
which kind of says that most of that endpoint protection

46
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,290
doesn't sound all that useful.

47
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,790
I mean, but that, that, that statistic in itself has, I mean,

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,919
that's correlation is not causation.

49
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,769
-- Exactly.
-- Well, yeah. Well,

50
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:10,179
yeah, let's ignore correlation causation. Let's just ignore that.

51
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,399
Let's just ignore that because II I got nothing here

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,229
but like

53
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,210
91% of cyber attacks begin with a spear phishing email.

54
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,789
-- Well, yeah, because it works.
-- So I've been thinking about this story actually.

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,429
Because I read it and I had a,

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,880
we'll say less than positive reaction initially and then I've

57
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,720
done a lot of thinking about it and I think,

58
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,149
you know what the biggest problem is,

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,449
the vast majority of these numbers come from companies,

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,110
marketing departments like this is an independent research.

61
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:40,009
Well, you know, there's selection bias and then there's, yeah,

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,630
then there's marketing departments.

63
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,990
-- That's a good quote.
-- Yeah.

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,250
No, I think that pretty much sums up this episode.

65
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,539
Are we the marketing departments or are we the selection bias?

66
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,100
Uh, I

67
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,029
-- feel like I'm selection bias.
-- I'm gonna go with incompetent marketing department.

68
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:57,899
Yeah.

69
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:58,729
Anyway,

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,100
so I guess the, the, the,

71
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,029
-- I don't know what the takeaway here is.
-- Well, ok.

72
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,220
No,

73
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:08,270
I do think there's a takeaway and I think there's two really

74
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:11,289
important things we can take away from this data is number one,

75
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,410
we need to find good,

76
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,610
reasonable,

77
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:18,429
proper independent data and it might exist and I just don't know where it is.

78
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,899
It's obviously not in this story.

79
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,449
-- I'm
-- going to interrupt you and say the first problem is

80
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,990
we need to figure out what we need to measure.

81
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,389
I mean, that's the second part of what I was going to say it. So,

82
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:26,535
yeah,

83
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:30,815
it is difficult sometimes to understand what data means and sometimes it doesn't

84
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:33,255
mean what we think it means and sometimes it doesn't mean anything.

85
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:38,714
And this is where not focusing on marketing driven data is hugely important.

86
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:41,244
But as an industry, I think in security

87
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:44,514
we don't even know how to tell them apart because I don't

88
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:49,875
think we rarely see truly independent research data on what we do.

89
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,919
Uh, there's the eff and,

90
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,410
uh, that's about it.

91
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,139
I mean, there's some universities doing some work like this but,

92
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,509
and even what they're doing,

93
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,270
I'm not overly familiar with it and I don't even know where to go find it,

94
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:04,089
which I think is part of the problem.

95
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,990
Well, I mean, the classic answer would be you go to Gartner, buy some data.

96
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,479
They are

97
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,270
because, you know, the magic quadrant.

98
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:10,850
I'm not.

99
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,279
Anyway,

100
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,479
I

101
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,729
think that's the end of this episode right there is,

102
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:16,119
I

103
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:20,500
got a magic quadrant, I guess. I guess

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,750
we'll see, we'll see what the magic quadrant says on December 3rd. Right.

105
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:25,750
Unclear.
