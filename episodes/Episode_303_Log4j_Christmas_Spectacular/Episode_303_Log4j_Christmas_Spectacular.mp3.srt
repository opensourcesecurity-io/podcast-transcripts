Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,590
Christmas Spectacular with myself and Josh Bresser,

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,869
who is myself? Oh, sorry, Kurt

3
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,699
Siefried. No, I have not been replaced yet

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,129
by a robot. Well, in fairness you do the sound auditing so I can't replace you.

5
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,620
Uh That's true. And I, I'm, you don't have the logins to the

6
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:27,700
various websites we use for publishing either.

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,309
So we should probably fix that at some point, but not.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:30,559
No.

9
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:34,220
Well, this is a great example of Bus Factor where it doesn't matter because

10
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:37,060
the podcast is two people and the whole thing is kind of

11
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:39,979
the two of us bouncing off each other. And it's like,

12
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:40,360
I,

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,959
I'll be blunt, there's a bunch of Starcraft podcast,

14
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:44,330
uh

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,740
Starcraft game casters. Some of them are great on their own.

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,819
Yeah, like,

17
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,720
and some of them I'm not going to name names.

18
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,490
Some of them are absolutely terrible on their own, but with the right co

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,000
presenter, they're amazing.

20
00:00:56,569 --> 00:01:02,069
Right. No, I agree. I think if either one of us exited this show, it would cease to be.

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,180
Definitely.

22
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,949
Yep. Yep. Absolutely.

23
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:10,279
Alright. Alright. I wrote a Christmas poem. I printed it out this is the paper.

24
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:14,449
And so we're actually going to talk, why did you print it out?

25
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,459
But it's the poem I wrote,

26
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,120
I printed it because poetry should be read from paper versus a screen.

27
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,919
And I feel like it makes it easier to read and

28
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:27,809
it's going to be a dramatic reading. So I obviously need the ability to gesture.

29
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,919
We'll say wildly, turn your camera on then.

30
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,430
No, I'm not turning my camera on.

31
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:33,690
It makes a web browser crash.

32
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,949
Anyway. Anyway. Uh

33
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,250
So for anyone who's still listening,

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,129
we're, we're actually going to spend some time on log for Jay.

35
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:44,489
But I do have a marvelous poem. I spent more time than I want to admit

36
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:45,410
reading. So

37
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,449
here we go. Here we go

38
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:51,300
was the night before Christmas would all through the stack.

39
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:53,959
Not a scanner was scanning, not even a rack.

40
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,930
The S bombs were uploaded to the portal with care

41
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,569
in hopes that next year would be boring and bare.

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,319
The interns were nestled all snug in their beds

43
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,319
while visions of dashboards danced in their heads,

44
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,819
the ciso in their kerchief and I in my cap

45
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,630
had just slept our laptops for a long winter's nap.

46
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,819
When all of a sudden the pager went

47
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:17,628
ak AK I sprang to my laptop with worries of attack away to the browser.

48
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,729
I flew like a flash tore open the window and cleared out the cache.

49
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:25,518
The red of the dashboard, the glow of the screen gave a luster of disaster.

50
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:27,358
My eyes rarely seen

51
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,479
when what to my wondering eyes did appear

52
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,009
but a new advisory,

53
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:36,518
innate vulnerabilities to fear like a little old hacker all ready to play.

54
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:39,238
I knew in a moment it must be log for j

55
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,559
more rapid than Gigabit its courses.

56
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,770
They came and it whistled and shouted and called them by name. Now. Log for Shell.

57
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:48,520
Now, CV E now a SF and NVD

58
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:50,059
on Sisa on Luna

59
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,699
on

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,360
GSI, the dog to the top of hacker news to the top of the wall.

61
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:58,119
Now hack away, hack away, hack away all nice. I like it.

62
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:59,169
I'm not done yet.

63
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:05,119
Like the bits that before the wild CDN flew by when they meet with a firewall,

64
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,360
they mount to the sky.

65
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,759
So up to the cloud like bastards, they flew with tweets full of bones and log for J two.

66
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,100
And then in a twinkling, I read in the slack,

67
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,089
the wailing and screaming of each analyst called back as I drew in my head

68
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,029
and was turning around down the network log for J came with a bound.

69
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:24,639
It was dressed in a hoodie black and zip tight.

70
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:27,279
The clothes were all swagged from a conference one night.

71
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,880
A bundle of bones that had checked in its git

72
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,449
and it looked like a peddler just being a twit. The change log.

73
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,449
How it twinkled, it features how merry its versions were like roses,

74
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,050
its logo like a cherry,

75
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,809
its draw little mouth was drawn up like an at and

76
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,529
the beard on its chin made it look stupid and fat.

77
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,690
The stump of a diff

78
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:49,695
tight in its teeth and the bits they encircled the repo like a wreath.

79
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:50,875
It had a flashy,

80
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:53,445
read me an annoying little fad that shook when

81
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:55,934
it downloaded like a disk drive gone bad.

82
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:57,375
It was chubby and plump,

83
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:01,154
an annoying old package and I laughed when I saw it in spite of the hack, a

84
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:06,865
wink of its bits and a twist of its head soon gave me to know I had everything to dread.

85
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,065
It spoke not a word but went straight to its

86
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:12,085
work and pointed all the servers then turned with a jerk

87
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,649
and laying its patches the side of its nose.

88
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,309
It gave a nod and up the network, it rose,

89
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,988
it sprang to its packet to its team gave them more in a way.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,399
They all fled leaving behind a back door.

91
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:25,950
But I heard it exclaim or it drove out of sight.

92
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,070
Merry Christmas, you nerds log for J one tonight.

93
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:29,679
That was,

94
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,619
that was actually awesome in the traditional sense of the

95
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,660
word and the fact that most of it rhymed,

96
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,269
I'm impressed, you know how hard that is to do.

97
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,059
I know

98
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,450
that. So I don't write poetry.

99
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:40,890
It was,

100
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:46,119
it took me many hours to put this terrible poem together.

101
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,399
But I was very proud of myself and I'm like, I need to read this on the podcast, dude.

102
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,799
No, that was not a, that was a great poem.

103
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,429
I also love how just inherently like ageist your references are.

104
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,160
Yeah, probably like pagers and hard drives.

105
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,329
Well, I had to come up with something, I mean,

106
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,799
I tried putting other things in and it just wasn't easy.

107
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:04,510
I mean, part of the,

108
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,700
part of the thing with this actually was there the night before

109
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,250
Christmas poem has a very certain flow that rolls off the tongue.

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,779
And while I know I didn't replicate that as well,

111
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,600
it was definitely something I had in mind.

112
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,339
And so a lot of the words that are weird or don't make sense.

113
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,059
It was like I need to make this sound right.

114
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,220
But anyway, anyway,

115
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,579
now I want to say I want to put a little disclaimer in

116
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,459
like I pick on log for J and that log for J developers.

117
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,630
You guys are awesome.

118
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm not picking on you.

119
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,570
It's just a silly poem. Open source owes you nothing.

120
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,220
That's right. It's just a silly poem that I had fun doing.

121
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:39,679
All right.

122
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,519
All right.

123
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:41,279
That was,

124
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,160
that was really good. I like it. And you're posting it right?

125
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,859
Like you're not gonna make people transcribe it.

126
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,809
Yeah, I'll put it in the show notes. It'll be in the show notes.

127
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,459
Um

128
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:50,070
Yes.

129
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:54,279
Yes. Even though even though I read it from paper, I wrote it on a screen.

130
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:54,869
Yeah.

131
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,350
Can you even read your own handwriting anymore.

132
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:57,660
I

133
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,019
can

134
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,040
actually, my problem isn't reading it.

135
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:03,760
My hand gets really tired now when I write because I do it so rarely.

136
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:05,070
Yeah.

137
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,959
So when I try, I can write like, three or four sentences and then, like,

138
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,119
my hand starts getting sore and I have to just stop.

139
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,079
Well, it's funny because, like, I've literally with my one son, you know,

140
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:14,630
um,

141
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:16,000
he

142
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,309
basically, I just,

143
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,230
I'm not worried about him actually ever learning to

144
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,480
write with a pen or pencil because the question,

145
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,529
will he have a compute device?

146
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,309
He can type into

147
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,470
the answer is yes.

148
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:25,940
Yeah.

149
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,399
And if you

150
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,769
have one, somebody else will,

151
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,540
it amuses me when I hear old people like, oh, kids don't learn cursive today.

152
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:32,040
And it's like,

153
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:33,839
no, we don't

154
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:34,390
care.

155
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:34,799
And,

156
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:38,559
and the funny thing is I actually explained why cursive was a thing to my other son.

157
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,279
And it's because you used to have to be able to write fast to take dictation.

158
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,799
Right. Right. Exactly.

159
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,380
Yeah,

160
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,000
because black lettering is slow. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to explain to him that,

161
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:49,720
you know, like the whole dictated but not read,

162
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,600
right. That used to be at the bottom of letters.

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,380
And

164
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,380
so for those of you in the, uh,

165
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,929
listening to the show that are under the age of like 30 dictated but not read,

166
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,760
literally means that somebody dictated a letter to their secretary,

167
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,739
the secretary typed it out and sent it without the person reviewing it.

168
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,820
So like literally you speak out loud, somebody types in your,

169
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,220
well let's say email because make it a little more current

170
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,779
and and fires it off and there may be errors in it.

171
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,119
And so that that dictated but not read was sort of a disclaimer of like

172
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,119
here's what we think we heard the person say

173
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,390
but you know it might not be entirely correct,

174
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,399
of course. Now the answer is just send your own damn email

175
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,820
I mean. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Alright. Alright let's

176
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,540
let's talk about love for Jason Mo because why not?

177
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,440
That's the topic of the day.

178
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:32,709
Well,

179
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,320
and I love that again every like a bad vulnerability to log for Jay and

180
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,600
it's kind of like yeah and do you think this is the last one?

181
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:41,480
Like and by last one I don't mean ever I mean like this week.

182
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,000
Well ok there's there's two pieces I wanted to discuss

183
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,739
and and I'll start with this what I thought would

184
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,119
be the second one but so we're talking about log

185
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,079
for Jay a lot and it's getting all the attention

186
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,880
but something I I did is I've pulled down

187
00:07:55,059 --> 00:08:01,369
uh the Docker Hub api I can they they I get like 100 and 35 containers when I ask them

188
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,500
give me the top containers in Docker Hub, right?

189
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,920
And for whatever reason it stops at 100 and 35.

190
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,390
I don't know why I don't care, whatever, it doesn't matter,

191
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:10,670
it's good enough.

192
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:14,950
But anyway, I took them and I started looking and saying, what are the packages

193
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,700
in all? Like, what are the most used packages in this?

194
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,529
And I think

195
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:21,170
that's one of the things we need to think about is

196
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:26,119
log for J is obviously in the top 10 because every Java thing uses it.

197
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,359
So the other like one of my questions now is

198
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,329
like, what, what's the thing every node package has?

199
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:35,890
So let me guess, let me guess. I'm guessing engine X might be real popular.

200
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,799
A web server. Uh

201
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,130
No, no. Remember these are, these are the containers, these

202
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,058
I, I don't have it off the top of my head.

203
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,739
The basically the top probably 20 or 25 I think it was

204
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,169
are almost all N PM packages because almost everything is N PM.

205
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:51,289
How do you build a web thing?

206
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:51,989
Yeah. Right.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,669
Log for j's in there and like no seriously because I, I there's as far as I know,

208
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,919
there's literally no sane way to build a web thing.

209
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,820
No. Yeah.

210
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,849
Right. Right.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,609
And so I, I mean, I'm working on it,

212
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:04,190
I'll put some data together and talk about it at some point.

213
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,210
But you get the idea, right?

214
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:09,690
Like there's way more than just log for J that is everywhere. And so

215
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,460
I, well as defenders, we're starting to ask these questions.

216
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:17,320
I have no doubt the Attackers have already done this

217
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,869
work and they know what they should be looking for.

218
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,190
I actually will disagree with you because I've been thinking about this a lot.

219
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,330
Attackers have finite resources just like defenders and why they don't,

220
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,229
generally speaking,

221
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:31,929
most Attackers don't need to use zero days unless they're like some fancy nso group,

222
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,059
you know, selling to states,

223
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,549
the majority of Attackers are using well known zero days.

224
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,659
Not,

225
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:43,549
well, when I say well known zero days, like things that are either exploitable

226
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:46,130
and haven't been patched yet or, or straight up,

227
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,460
they were like a zero day or not even a zero day, but like they've been patched forever

228
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,979
and they might as well be a zero day for how many people are still vulnerable.

229
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,669
Yeah.

230
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,700
You know.

231
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,090
Yeah, that's fair. But anyway, anyway, it's just something to think about is

232
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,900
there are packages

233
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,049
in everything, there's going to be a certain subset.

234
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:09,929
And those are some of the things like we

235
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,799
always talk about all this critical path like,

236
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,900
oh open SSL and

237
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,260
the Linux kernel and Debian or whatever. And the reality is

238
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,179
log for Jay wasn't something on anyone's list and it turned out to be

239
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:27,659
the most important discovery potentially of the last decade.

240
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,619
Well, and that's something I uh so two of my questions that I'm,

241
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,570
I'm looking at in my third blog entry are it's

242
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,909
this inability to know how widely a library is used.

243
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,320
Now,

244
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:41,140
you can say like N PM will tell you like, oh, this thing's been downloaded, like

245
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:44,469
10-K jillion times. Cool. But that doesn't mean anything. Exactly.

246
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:44,909
Like, is that,

247
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,969
like Google is one download and then they use it internally everywhere.

248
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,429
Well, actually the real problem,

249
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,320
so I've got kind of two funny little anecdotes about that is

250
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,364
any time, like ac I job runs it often will just redownload all the node modules.

251
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,684
So, like, if you have AC I job running, you know, 1000 times a day,

252
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,864
that's 1000 downloads.

253
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:06,075
And so the the company you work for now,

254
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:10,744
Acor, we like ingest and scan containers and infrastructure, right?

255
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:12,434
So if you're using a certain container,

256
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:13,445
it will,

257
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,674
you basically say like I'm,

258
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:17,755
these are the containers I'm using like pay attention to them

259
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:18,635
and

260
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:19,799
the the

261
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,280
Encor Enterprise product will ask Docker Hub periodically like, hey,

262
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:25,299
are there any updates to this container image?

263
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,609
And apparently every time you do that, it bumps the container count up one.

264
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,080
And so there were a handful of containers that

265
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,119
we know we're hitting a lot

266
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,000
and their count keeps going up and people are getting excited and we're like,

267
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,080
we think that might be us like we don't,

268
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,719
I don't think people are using that many of these

269
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:45,969
but like, you know what I mean?

270
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:50,640
This is, that's why just like counting the number of hits or downloads or,

271
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,200
or whatever the the popularity contest statistics

272
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:56,270
aren't valid in this context.

273
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,789
You need to actually look at like, what are people using

274
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,760
and then what is in it?

275
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,909
Well, and then at least the second question is ok. So

276
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:07,000
how sort of widely used is this thing? Like,

277
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,140
just because it's downloaded doesn't mean it's actually kind of being used.

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,179
And, and the thing is like, we have no idea

279
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:16,200
until sort of,

280
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,340
we boil the ocean and everybody takes a look and

281
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,969
the only way to get that to happen is yeah,

282
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,330
to have something to log for J with a, a

283
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:23,539
massive, you know vulnerability.

284
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:24,179
Well, now,

285
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:30,080
now here I want to introduce the second thing and this is totally related is so

286
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:33,359
if you would have told me a year ago,

287
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,359
there is going to be a critical vulnerability in log for J,

288
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:40,840
I would have been like whatever nerd, it's log for J log stuff, right?

289
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,719
And so let's say we had

290
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,200
given log for J specifically log for J

291
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,559
infinite resources and we had

292
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,210
tens of people working on it full time. We had people doing security audits.

293
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,900
Would they have found this? I suspect not. Here's the thing, even if they found it.

294
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:00,109
The problem is

295
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,340
because of how the culture of building software is, it was originally

296
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,780
much worse of a problem than it needed to

297
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,840
be because it was enabled by default even though

298
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,640
almost nobody used it. And

299
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,640
I mean, their response after what two weeks was to say,

300
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:18,020
look after dealing with CV E you know, 2021 44 228 or whatever,

301
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,630
this J and D I stuff is just really dangerous. So, we're disabling it by default.

302
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,520
Right. Right. Like, if they'd done that from day one, this would have been fine.

303
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,619
And the question is, how many other features did they add that are just on by default?

304
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,770
And this is true of countless libraries. Yes, there are.

305
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,299
I, I think it's really easy to turn things on

306
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,979
and then there's always this attitude of we're going to break

307
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:42,739
backwards compatibility or we're going to break someone something or other.

308
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,609
And so there's always a reluctance to turn features off and

309
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,390
it's, it's a delicate dance.

310
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,609
Well,

311
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:52,150
and this is fascinating to me because we have sort of

312
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,409
the known quantity of if we disable this future by default,

313
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:58,150
X number of people are gonna have to turn it on and complain

314
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,289
versus the somewhat unknown quantity of by having this feature on by default.

315
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,030
If it has a vulnerability in future,

316
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,780
everybody's gonna have to deal with it and everybody's gonna have to turn it off.

317
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,039
And what is the cost and hassle of that?

318
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,729
And what's interesting to me is

319
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,409
again as it turns out like I, I

320
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:18,159
don't think very many people are actually

321
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,359
using the JND I lookups.

322
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:25,099
I would be shocked if it's used by more than 0.1%.

323
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,729
Well, it seems like a real enterprise feature of like, oh,

324
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:29,539
we want to have this request come in and then do like an out

325
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,059
lab look up so that in the logs, we can, you know, assign a cost center to the request

326
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,979
and that's a valid use case and actually quite a useful one,

327
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,619
but it's so insanely complex.

328
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,200
Like there's no way normal people are going to be doing that.

329
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:48,080
I, I think these days the way most logging systems work is you do the enrichment

330
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,590
when the logs are brought into the logging system,

331
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,599
not as the logs are written to disk.

332
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,270
So I think that's a feature from

333
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:56,210
a a

334
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,070
again, it goes kind of back to that cultural thing of I own the logging system.

335
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,390
I have to add this feature. Ok. I can add it here

336
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,039
and you know, shoehorn it in

337
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:04,789
and,

338
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,750
and that's the reality of like large software enterprise stuff

339
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,909
is trying to get another group to do something.

340
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,530
Good luck.

341
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:13,369
That's true. That's true. So it can be hard.

342
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,760
So anyway, anyway, I, I feel like this is, this is the question though,

343
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,429
like if we had tons of resources, would this have been found?

344
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,669
Well, would they have even, would they have documented it

345
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,679
because, well, they did eventually, after two years,

346
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,799
literally two years later, they actually added it to the documentation.

347
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:33,719
I mean, but anyway, so anyway, here's,

348
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:36,840
here's where I want this conversation to go into is so

349
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:43,830
there is all these features in all these libraries used across the entire industry.

350
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,599
And some subset of the features just by their very

351
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:49,520
nature are dangerous like this J and D I thing.

352
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,619
It was literally doing exactly what it was supposed to do.

353
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:55,340
Well, you know what, it's not just that they're dangerous,

354
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:56,289
but they're,

355
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:59,450
I'm going to use the word they're exposed by default,

356
00:15:59,609 --> 00:15:59,979
right?

357
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,890
So a good example of this Python has a silly

358
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,700
ridiculous dangerous feature called Pickle where you basically take a object

359
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,219
and turn it into text.

360
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,349
So you can shove it over the network or

361
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,099
shove it locally over something and then you unpick

362
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:11,489
it

363
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,880
and it, it can be code, it can be config it can be data, it can be whatever. And like

364
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,059
like as I keep saying,

365
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,979
the Python Pickle page has this giant

366
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:20,840
red warning saying Python pickle is dangerous.

367
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:22,299
Don't unpick all untrusted data.

368
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,309
But the thing is you have to go out of

369
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,739
your way to make something that does that nobody accident.

370
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,419
Like nobody has pickle enabled on their data by default.

371
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:35,289
It's you have to like you have to use Pickle. Now, here's how I would

372
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,119
discuss that is

373
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:41,780
why doesn't Python just yank it or add an option that says Pickle will only be

374
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:45,030
enabled if I run Python with dash dash

375
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,929
enable Pickle because I'm doing something stupid.

376
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:48,820
You know what I mean?

377
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,510
Because you effectively already have to do that by writing code that uses Pickle.

378
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,830
Whereas log for J you didn't have to write code that

379
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,210
uses the, the stuff.

380
00:16:57,219 --> 00:17:01,510
It's just if you pulled log for J and at all and used it at all, it just,

381
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,140
the data was coursing through log for J and vulnerable.

382
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:05,578
I mean,

383
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:06,259
yes,

384
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:10,068
you have to explicitly take a piece of data and unpick it.

385
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:12,308
But II, I think your argument is weak.

386
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,698
I think any time there's a dangerous feature, no matter what,

387
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:18,229
it should just not be there.

388
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:22,648
And I think if it's something that's critical to certain organizations,

389
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:25,928
then you can make some bizarre way to enable it,

390
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:26,928
that is

391
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:30,239
you have to live. I mean, saying pickle, you have to go to your way to use Pickle.

392
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,338
I don't buy that because you can just import Pickle, you can run Python,

393
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:34,775
you can type import pickles, import

394
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:38,645
that happens. You still have to write code that takes untrusted data. And

395
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:42,555
I understand that. I understand that, but I think you're splitting hairs.

396
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:46,275
I think the fact that a danger like why leave a dangerous feature in place,

397
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:47,584
why leave it there at all?

398
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,344
Well, that's a

399
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,265
part of it would be,

400
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:52,675
you can check how many people are using it and quite a few people use it.

401
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,035
The thing I think about log for J is that

402
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:59,834
you could have written the world's most secure, most safe java code.

403
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:01,255
But the moment you import log

404
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:01,935
for J

405
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:02,954
Poof,

406
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,839
you, you're affected by the vulnerability.

407
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:10,800
Well, I mean, this is true of lots of libraries where as soon as you use them,

408
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,729
you gain the superpower of the library but potentially any of the drawbacks.

409
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:17,290
But here it wasn't a potential.

410
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,959
It was if you import log for J and it touches any data,

411
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:23,030
you're affected whether you like it or not.

412
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,290
And this whole like people are like,

413
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,949
oh you sanitize your inputs and it's like you can't with this like,

414
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,119
like

415
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,680
what I love is people,

416
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,339
you know, tweeted out the first exploit and it's like, oh OK,

417
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:34,359
here's a filter for that.

418
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:37,910
And then they're like, OK, well, here's, you know, here's my anti anti filters,

419
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,060
you know, evasion

420
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,660
and it gets to the point where somebody posted a grip

421
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,930
statement for that supposedly catches all the log for J stuff.

422
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:46,420
And it's like, you know, it's like half a page long.

423
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,380
It's enormous and, and I'm sure there's ways to evade. Oh, absolutely.

424
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,780
So which OK, so that,

425
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,479
that's actually I was just discussing this with someone this

426
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:59,280
morning before I talk to you actually is the fact that

427
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,699
we have this like obsession with detecting and preventing sometimes

428
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:05,140
and in this case,

429
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:10,900
you have to patch it. You don't have a choice and, and like that's it. I, I appreciate

430
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,300
that people are doing this work, but at the end of the day, like

431
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,420
there's no escape

432
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,280
unless you're the size and technical ability of a place

433
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,050
like cloud flare where you are literally touching double digits,

434
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,619
percentage of all the internet traffic.

435
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,660
And you have some of the smartest craziest people

436
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:32,959
that have been working on filters for years.

437
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,020
You don't have a chance.

438
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,060
It's a waste of time.

439
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:37,660
It's like writing your own crypto or writing your own authentication system.

440
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,479
No, you just,

441
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,180
you, you use the one from this massive

442
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:42,880
and, and when I say massive,

443
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,160
I don't mean like numerically massive but just massive in terms

444
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,979
of like technical ability like cloud flare or Amazon or Microsoft.

445
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,520
And you don't do it yourself.

446
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,780
Like the hot patch, you don't write your own Java hot patch.

447
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,869
You download one of the popular ones, you know that Amazon Blessed.

448
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,800
That's right. That's right. And, and, and that's part of it is like, it's, it's,

449
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,109
you know,

450
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,969
it's the difference between a model T Ford where you can fix

451
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,790
it with a rock and a screwdriver and a modern car where,

452
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,369
you know, oh, for example, you know,

453
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,209
my check engine light goes on one day and I'm like, oh crap.

454
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:10,130
So I, you know,

455
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,609
drive around because it's not flashing, whatever, no funny noise, no funny smell.

456
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,640
And

457
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,060
uh I,

458
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:18,219
I go home park have dinner and then I go over

459
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:20,760
to a friend's house who has an O DB two whatever reader

460
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:24,739
and check the code and the light goes off by the way. So I'm like, oh great.

461
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,050
And the, the check code basically boils down to, it's like one of three things.

462
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,900
It's either

463
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:29,920
the, uh,

464
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,339
the

465
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:34,359
engine oil or in the camshaft is not like the right, uh,

466
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:35,619
fluidity.

467
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,619
Which makes sense because it was parked out overnight and it was really cold

468
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,430
or like, my camshaft is about to destroy itself or fall out.

469
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,060
And I'm like, well, it's probably option number one because the car was cold.

470
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:44,930
It's,

471
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:45,609
and

472
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,020
are you going to do if it's option number two, there's nothing you can do.

473
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,300
Well, I take it to the dealership and I pay some guy, you know,

474
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,780
thousands of dollars to fix it

475
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,920
because I can't, I like short of going and getting, uh, I

476
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,579
don't know, do car mechanics get degrees or? Well, they get certifications.

477
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:06,915
Spending four years educating myself. I can't fix the camshaft in my car. Yeah.

478
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:08,214
That's right. That's right. Like

479
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:08,675
that.

480
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,635
As I understand those things are like in the middle of my, I have,

481
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,415
I have an even better example for you.

482
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:15,425
So I own an electric car now. Right.

483
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,545
Have you seen the tools you have to use to work on an electric car

484
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:24,300
are 480 volts. If you touch that, you're dead.

485
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,150
So all the tools are like coated in thick rubber because I worked for, uh,

486
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,550
chemical electrical for six months.

487
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,400
I was their network admin and they do industrial electrical contracting.

488
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,239
So I'm actually very like I sat next to the safety officer

489
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,619
and the stuff that they bought like

490
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,310
$2000 for a pair of gloves.

491
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,579
Yeah. Yeah. But you need it, you know.

492
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,420
Right. Right. But, but again,

493
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,300
this is

494
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,400
like this whole dog for j thing in many

495
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,680
instances trying to do the runtime protection feels like

496
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,560
here's a pair of, of, of surgical gloves.

497
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:58,219
Now, go work on that high voltage line over there. It's like, wait a minute, what?

498
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,900
You're gonna want a chicken switch?

499
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,579
That's right.

500
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:04,589
Now, I'll just keep moving us along into strange tangents because I can,

501
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,380
uh there was also a worm

502
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:09,494
at the beginning of the week which thankfully at the time

503
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:13,145
of recording didn't go anywhere because the worm was broken.

504
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:15,104
But yeah, that, that's scary.

505
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:18,364
I'm mortified that like on Christmas Eve,

506
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,535
which this will actually come out the day after Christmas is when I will hit publish.

507
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:24,234
But I'm like, mortified Christmas Eve is going to be, oh, hey,

508
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,834
there's a log for J worm, everyone.

509
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,224
Merry Christmas. Well, and I think it might

510
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:31,734
be even more applicable than it was. I'm going to say two things. Number one,

511
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,160
if you have not updated your log for J yet, well, then

512
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,989
it's

513
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,300
good luck like whatever, whatever environment you work in is clearly so broken you,

514
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,089
you're up the creek no matter what.

515
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,199
And number two,

516
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,459
if you haven't

517
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,140
changed your systems or started changing your systems so

518
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,959
that you can update and patch them faster,

519
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:51,910
like you basically have,

520
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,560
it's not just enough to do an emergency patch.

521
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,319
You also have to learn how to fight fires better.

522
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:59,339
I mean, I think it's more nuanced than that.

523
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:03,189
Well, the thing is what I'm saying is if this event hasn't been the wake up call,

524
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,839
that your leadership needs to mature your security process,

525
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,239
you're, you're doomed.

526
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:07,750
I,

527
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,430
I agree and I think this is an example of

528
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:14,449
vendors need to have pressure to upgrade quickly if they,

529
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,670
I mean, if you have a vendor that hasn't upgraded their Java yet, like, come on,

530
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,709
if you're a, what is it? A federal civilian agency you have until the 24th,

531
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,880
they say that they always say stuff like that you can get waivers. And

532
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,949
I mean, there's, there's ways around that,

533
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,589
but

534
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:29,790
no, absolutely.

535
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,660
I think now there's, now here's a terrifying statistic at,

536
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,000
at this time of us recording.

537
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,229
This is Wednesday. The what the 22nd

538
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,339
there you can go to. Uh Sonatype has a, a website for Ma

539
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:45,880
they run Maven Central, which is where like everyone downloads all the Java stuff.

540
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,599
Only 40%

541
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:52,359
of the log for J Jars being downloaded at this time are the, are the new ones?

542
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,319
60% are the old ones still

543
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:55,390
the

544
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:55,709
Google,

545
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,880
the Google Security Blog from uh December 16th.

546
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,410
Um I'm just going to read it as of December 16th, 2021.

547
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,599
We found that 35,863 of the available Java artifacts from Maven Central.

548
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:08,400
Depend on the affected log for J code.

549
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,239
This means that more than 8% of all packages on Maven Central have at least one

550
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,140
and I love this have at least one version that is impacted by its vulnerability.

551
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,489
I

552
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:17,560
love Java.

553
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,479
These numbers do not encompass all Java

554
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:21,339
packages such as directly distributed binaries.

555
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:23,989
But Maven Central is a strong proxy for the state of the ecosystem.

556
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,410
And now here's the terrifying sentence

557
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,270
as far as ecosystem impact goes, 8% is enormous.

558
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,579
The average ecosystem impact of advisories affecting Maven Central

559
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:35,609
is 2% with a median less than 0.1%.

560
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,329
And that gets us in the birthday paradox territory of

561
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,209
essentially, if you download a random package from Maven,

562
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,890
like

563
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:47,449
over the whole thing, it's an 8% chance you're gonna get one with log for J

564
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:51,099
now more realistically because of the long tail and everything. It's, it's like

565
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,199
almost guaranteed.

566
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:53,420
You're going to get something with log for J,

567
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,719
especially if you're downloading more than a handful of packages.

568
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,550
And

569
00:24:56,849 --> 00:25:01,670
like you said, if only 40% are fixed and 60% are vulnerable, then there's a really,

570
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,520
really good chance that there's a

571
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,150
good amount of stuff slipping out the back door.

572
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,859
So, absolutely.

573
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,189
And, and that's a good point.

574
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:12,209
That's something I hadn't even thought of in the context of that statistic.

575
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,949
But if you have a Java application, you're depending on

576
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,280
some library and that library specifically asks for an

577
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,119
old version of log for J and I mean,

578
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,349
this comes back to that whole, oh,

579
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,920
everyone pin your dependencies or an old version of that handy thing that, you know,

580
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,569
takes a bunch of data and hands it over to the

581
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:30,089
server.

582
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,060
Right?

583
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:34,949
And, and I guess in this context, pinned dependencies are actually a bad thing.

584
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,209
So, yeah,

585
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:38,770
well, pin dependencies are

586
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:43,959
terrible for security because it's that much more effort to try and update them.

587
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,310
It,

588
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,209
man, I'm not going to get into this way.

589
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:50,189
I've heard arguments both ways and I think everyone's wrong

590
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:50,589
in

591
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,369
dependencies.

592
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,300
I think the problem is everybody assumes that these libraries are well maintained

593
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,849
and actively maintained.

594
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,420
See, that's the thing, you can have a well maintained library.

595
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,150
But the I like literally,

596
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:04,579
I'm not going to name names but when we did the XML hash off thing,

597
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:05,579
there was one library

598
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:08,030
where literally the developer like cool,

599
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,319
I have a free weekend in like a month and a half that I can work on fixing this.

600
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:15,750
And of course Red Hat was like we, we, how about we just do it for you like now

601
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:18,280
because we can't wait a month. But now

602
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,800
that's why you pay Red Hat

603
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:24,935
because they have people who will literally do whatever it takes

604
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,895
to solve these kind of problems.

605
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:27,074
Well,

606
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:30,324
and that's the thing is we don't have in the olden days if it took you

607
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:34,005
a week or a month or hell a year to fix the security vulnerability that was known

608
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,515
that was kind of ok. But nowadays,

609
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,265
no, it's that we can't do that anymore.

610
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:42,415
And I think we had an entire show on this, you know, where we talk about this and

611
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,979
you just don't have time anymore.

612
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:45,829
Like

613
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,150
this log for J thing

614
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,719
became public on Thursday

615
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:54,750
was publicly, you know, fixed and done on a Friday. And then like sort of

616
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:57,219
people basically, if you hadn't fixed this by Monday,

617
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:57,780
if

618
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,439
a, if an attacker wanted to target you, they would have.

619
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,579
And it looks like uh what was it?

620
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,380
The Belgian Defense Ministry I think got popped by this.

621
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:06,930
And

622
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,420
that's what it sounds like. I don't think I've seen like AAA verified

623
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,619
agreement to that, but that's the rumor

624
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,180
looks like our story on Copyright and Apple.

625
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,219
Maybe we should go verify some sources first. That's

626
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:20,819
right.

627
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:23,339
Who knew those journalists were onto something?

628
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,560
Yeah.

629
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:25,650
Yeah.

630
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:26,890
Anyway,

631
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,329
to be professionals, we're definitely not professionals. We have poetry now.

632
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:32,829
So that's great.

633
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,160
We're open

634
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,010
source security, poetry slam, dude. NFT that poem.

635
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,459
I know I will not be nft it. I'm too lazy. I just don't care.

636
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:42,839
I'll tell

637
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,569
you you can nft it. OK?

638
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,219
You have

639
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:46,900
my permission.

640
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,849
Speaking of verbal contracts from Christmas episodes,

641
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,650
you still owe me a box of wheat grits from three years ago.

642
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,760
I owe you a box of white wheat grits.

643
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,979
Just listen to the 2018 show.

644
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,290
There's one where you agreed to send me a box of wheat grits because I was,

645
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,189
I agree to that. Yeah, I was complaining about how hard they are to find in Canada.

646
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:06,040
You just need to ask. I'm happy to do it.

647
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,430
Well, although now it will take seven years

648
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,140
back to the

649
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:10,709
thing,

650
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,430
infinite security spent would have still resulted in them adding this

651
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:19,569
dangerous feature and it being enabled by default most likely probably.

652
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,489
And

653
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,170
what they have see the problem is there's,

654
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,729
there's things like buffer overflows where it's like, oh, you know,

655
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:26,880
you take a piece of data,

656
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,979
you should figure out how long it is because it's longer than that,

657
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:30,170
then everything falls apart.

658
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,099
But

659
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:35,229
the problem with JD I is, oh, we're gonna, you know, support this data thing

660
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,810
and it's like JND, I is, I don't even want to know how big the spec is.

661
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,239
I'm guessing it's between 500

662
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:42,349
1000 pages. It's probably huge. Yeah.

663
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,479
And, but here's the thing like, well, right.

664
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,339
It was working literally the way it was supposed to be. Well, and that's the thing.

665
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:51,579
It's you, it's like supporting J big two or, you know,

666
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:55,310
um A sn where these standards are over 1000 pages

667
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,310
and

668
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:57,349
yeah, like

669
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,550
it, it's not.

670
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:01,849
How do I put this nicely? I don't care how careful you are

671
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:03,500
when you're building a space shuttle.

672
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,400
Probably the first few are gonna blow up on the pad.

673
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,660
Now. The problem here is we

674
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:10,709
ship rocket man from spacex. I mean,

675
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,930
they had some spectacular whoopsies.

676
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,670
Now, I will say,

677
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:18,670
I think from a marketing perspective it was brilliant what they did

678
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,630
because

679
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,790
I watched almost every launch while they were

680
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,300
blowing up and I haven't watched any launches since

681
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,430
it's boring. Now, the rocket went up in the air. It's like watching a Costco truck.

682
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:31,380
I, I also need to give a plug since we hit on space.

683
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,010
The James Webb Space telescope is supposed to launch on Christmas Day. I,

684
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,189
I cannot wait.

685
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,359
It's gonna be I, I, no, no, it's gonna be great. It's gonna be, I can't wait.

686
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:44,229
It's gonna be an amazing telescope.

687
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:45,890
But

688
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:46,339
uh

689
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,630
I just,

690
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:52,180
the thing is when you, when you support something like L

691
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,930
dap, I mean, remember L LDA with their anonymous binds,

692
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,400
right?

693
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,430
Or,

694
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:58,560
and yeah, exactly.

695
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:00,380
Like go look that up people because if you're using

696
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,040
LDA and you don't know what an honest blinds are,

697
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,109
you probably have one.

698
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:06,040
I don't think there's any way it's reasonably safe

699
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,670
to pull in something like J and D or LDA

700
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:09,939
and not have security vulnerabilities

701
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,119
unless

702
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,390
you spend some crazy amount of time and

703
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,069
effort and engineering trying to make it safe,

704
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:16,390
which

705
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,500
you just can't realistically do.

706
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,099
It's like writing a secure PDF parcel. Adobe invented the format

707
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,699
and there's over 1000

708
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,050
like, I think there's over 1000 CV s for Adobe reader.

709
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,300
Probably PDF is very, very complicated.

710
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,339
Well, PDF is multiple standards and it's basically a container

711
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,869
that's the dirty secret PDF is just a container format that's fair

712
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,780
but embeds everything.

713
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,439
It's probably turning complete.

714
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,170
Oh, no, that

715
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:43,709
I wrote an article. It's, it's turning

716
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:47,390
the actual like config parsing part of it is turning complete,

717
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,479
let alone the content.

718
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:49,260
I believe that.

719
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:49,979
I mean,

720
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:53,569
because you can essentially reassemble content within a PDF using PDF commands.

721
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:57,760
I, I don't, does, does PDF encapsulate all of the postscript

722
00:30:58,469 --> 00:30:59,719
language, do you know

723
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,699
it encapsulates basically everything?

724
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,109
OK.

725
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,130
That wouldn't surprise me because I only bring it up

726
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,790
because I remember in my younger days at university,

727
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:10,150
all the printers were postscript printers

728
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,030
and

729
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,979
there was a postscript file, you could send it the printer.

730
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:15,699
I think I talked about this once before on the show,

731
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,229
but it would calculate pie and then,

732
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,790
and so it would, it would clog the printer up for, for a very long time.

733
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:21,640
That's why I had to buy

734
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,050
a new printer is I had an HP Laser Jet Four,

735
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,109
which I loved beautiful printer

736
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:28,540
and the CPU is just too slow on it.

737
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,449
Like I would send it print jobs and it just could not render them

738
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,760
in a reasonable amount of time because you know, it's an HP Laser Jet four,

739
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,160
it's older than most of our listeners.

740
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,329
So I upgraded to uh Lexmark, whatever, 250 something.

741
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:48,420
And again, it was fine until the CPU was too slow to render, um, the form PDF S.

742
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,589
I could not do

743
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:49,760
that.

744
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,989
And so then I had to upgrade again. I got an HP now,

745
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,099
you know, and it's like,

746
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,000
it's,

747
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:56,300
but the funny thing is the HP.

748
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,719
I think it has, like, it's a four or 500 megahertz quad core CPU in there.

749
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:03,839
Like, it's basically better than my computer from 10 years ago

750
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,040
and it's my printer

751
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:08,079
but it has to be, to, to handle these PDF S.

752
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:08,459
Yeah. Yeah.

753
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,630
Right. Right. All right. All right. Anyway, so

754
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:16,280
I think fundamentally there's, there's, the good news is a Attackers are lazy.

755
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,339
They, the majority of Attackers

756
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,439
are not going to go find some amazing zero day that's widespread. They're going to go

757
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,900
and find a vulnerability for which exploit code exists

758
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,439
and they're gonna go use it because people don't patch quickly.

759
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,089
And the thing is, especially in the rents and,

760
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,489
and attacks have changed from targeted to, I'm gonna ransomware spam 100 people,

761
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,560
10 will get infected.

762
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:40,250
One will pay and I've made my rent for the month. Sure. Sure.

763
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,770
Ok. I mean, yeah. All right. Whatever.

764
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:43,689
II, I,

765
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:46,510
you're not wrong but I still think we need to

766
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,709
pay attention to some of these most used packages.

767
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,050
Oh, absolutely. Oh, no, no,

768
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,560
I'm not saying we don't pay attention to them.

769
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:52,770
I,

770
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,199
I think those are the highest risk we have at the moment and I

771
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:59,729
bet the vast majority of them are a couple of volunteers which is,

772
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,040
if

773
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:00,660
we're lucky,

774
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,540
it, it,

775
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:01,810
I,

776
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,640
I truly appreciate the work people do on open source

777
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,489
and it annoys me to no end when someone's like,

778
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,449
oh, it's just volunteers.

779
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:10,209
It's like, yeah, they go volunteer jerk. Like, don't complain. Help.

780
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,160
That's the point.

781
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,270
But anyway, all right. It's Christmas.

782
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,290
It is the day after Christmas.

783
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:17,020
It is time to go.

784
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:21,780
I want to say Merry Christmas, KT Merry Christmas. Everyone listening.

785
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,069
Thank you so much. It's been a heck of a couple weeks for sure.

786
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,030
Yeah, I'm just sorry,

787
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,089
I was just looking at one of the most popular N PM packages

788
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,829
and it's the last commit was like a month ago on github which,

789
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,310
which package chalk?

790
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:35,050
It does like text formatting.

791
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't, I don't know if that was on my, I don't know where that falls on my list.

792
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:38,869
I'll have to go look at it.

793
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,479
Well, it's one of those classic things where my in my brain, I'm like,

794
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,849
even if it has a vulnerability, it shouldn't be that exploitable.

795
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,959
But then I'm like, no, Kurt, I would have said that right.

796
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:48,430
Log for Jay proves you can't say that. I mean,

797
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:48,689
here

798
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:49,670
it is. I used to buy

799
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,189
used by 76,000 package as of

800
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,459
26. That great.

801
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:54,280
So

802
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,319
I hope there's no flaws in chalk.

803
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,709
Go get it. Security researchers. All right. I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt.

Merry Christmas and a happy holidays to everyone and a happy new year to everyone.

812

Indeed. Let's hope 2022 is much less exciting than 2021.

813
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:27,529
Boring. Would be nice. I would love a boring year. All right. Thanks everyone.
