Hello, and welcome to the open source Security podcast.

1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,090
Today is December the second and it's myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:15,850
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:16,620
See how I,

4
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:18,909
I was a little quicker this week than last week

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,760
and you gave the date which you've never done before.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,819
So now people know when we're recording

7
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,879
as opposed to just guessing.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:25,760
So

9
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:25,920
I

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,270
think,

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,340
I think it might be a useful thing to have.

12
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:32,418
It's possible and I think we're gonna stay a bit more topical this, this week.

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,159
So, having a date would certainly be useful,

14
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,939
as I'm sure in several 100 years when we have

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,619
researchers looking into what went wrong with society in 2016,

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,639
they can probably identify us as one of the major problems

17
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:46,479
doing

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:46,790
that.

19
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:51,639
So, I guess, I guess, do we want to start off with the bad news or the good news?

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,630
There's no good news. Current,

21
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:54,549
I think it's good news.

22
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,150
Good news.

23
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:59,659
Well, the fact that, uh, according to Krebs online or sorry, Krebs on security,

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,830
uh, apparently the, uh, the avalanche global fraud ring got dismantled a bit,

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,019
uh, yesterday.

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,339
That's good news,

27
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:08,449
you know.

28
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:08,989
And, uh,

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,180
so for those of you who don't know him

30
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,410
because I certainly don't really track this stuff.

31
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,290
Uh, there are, well,

32
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,690
there's a whole bunch of groups doing online fraud and

33
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:19,040
some of them are quite well organized and some of them

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,970
are quite prolific.

35
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,650
Like, uh, I don't know if people remember back in the two thousands, but, I mean,

36
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,870
there was like that one spammer.

37
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,790
What was his name? The spam house got sued by and sued him and uh

38
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,809
Bins

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,309
Blanky

40
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,139
called him the spam king,

41
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:32,519
the spam king guy.

42
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:33,080
I

43
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:33,930
need to remember.

44
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,419
Yeah.

45
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,160
And it was like,

46
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:37,349
wasn't he something like 80% of the global spam

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,379
at some point or just some absurd number?

48
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:43,160
It was insane. And I remember looking at graphs of when they shut him down, the only

49
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:47,919
spam it plummeted, it looked like, oh man, it was, it was a phenomenal graph.

50
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,690
But of course,

51
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:53,559
as history always shows you can shut down one bad guy and there's

52
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:57,360
a whole bunch of new ones just like waiting for their turn.

53
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:01,760
Well, you know, if there's a market for a service, somebody's gonna go provide it,

54
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,559
you know, like look at the,

55
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:04,690
look at

56
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,209
all this.

57
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,580
Yeah. So anyways, this avalanche global fro

58
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:07,989
ring,

59
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,389
um What, what I, what I'm kind of really impressed with is it,

60
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,470
it was something like three

61
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:17,119
major law enforcement groups plus a bunch of regional ones.

62
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:21,720
Uh So we had Europol, which is basically a European Interpol, right. It's, it's a,

63
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:22,529
it's

64
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:22,740
a,

65
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,149
a European wide

66
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:28,389
uh coordinating body and then we had something called Euro justs,

67
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,789
which I've actually never heard of before today.

68
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,270
Uh And they're basically another, um,

69
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:37,240
they're a judicial co-operation unit, which makes sense. Right?

70
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,029
Because, I mean, it's not just enough to catch these guys,

71
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,029
you have to prosecute them.

72
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,460
Right? And I assume that's where Euro just comes in,

73
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,229
you know, as coordinating prosecutions,

74
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,479
like who gets to take a crack at them and stuff.

75
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,449
Uh Of course, the FBI was there and then authorities from the UK,

76
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,789
Germany and uh I'm guessing, you know, other countries were involved as well.

77
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,990
Um

78
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,029
And like what I mean, just the scale of this, right is, you know,

79
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,429
830,000 web domains used in the scheme and, and it's actually worse than,

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,610
or not as bad as it sounds because these guys

81
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,669
use a technique called fast flux. And uh do you want to explain it

82
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,460
or shall

83
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,309
I have no idea what that even is?

84
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,389
So, basically, when you host a nasty malicious website,

85
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,000
eventually, either one of two things happens, um

86
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,880
typically,

87
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,169
like you're serving malware or something and that gets

88
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,860
flagged and then your domain gets flagged and blocked,

89
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:25,339
right?

90
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,429
Or, you know, somebody hits the uh like in Google Chrome, they hit like the whoa,

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,970
this site is really terrible.

92
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,440
Like it's fake, it's nasty, it's spam, it's malicious.

93
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,779
And again, the domain gets flagged and blocked.

94
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:40,639
So how do you avoid that? Well, you, you go through domains very, very quickly.

95
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:44,179
Like some of these guys are using domains for like tens of seconds,

96
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,169
right?

97
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,690
So there's, there's,

98
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,449
you can ban all these domains and it doesn't matter because they've already,

99
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,089
by the time you ban the domain and push that updated, you know,

100
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,570
ban list out these guys have moved on to another domain,

101
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:55,600
right? That

102
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,729
makes sense. I get that.

103
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,850
Yeah. And you know, because domains are basically, you know, cheap to free.

104
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,050
Uh But anyway, so they generate these domains and they use them very,

105
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,410
for very short amounts of time.

106
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,389
So banning them doesn't do anything, right?

107
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:13,490
Um They host, they also host them off of many, many, many different IP addresses.

108
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:17,589
So you also can't really, you know, ban the IP S reliably, right?

109
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:18,730
Because,

110
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,690
you know, if you have say

111
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,029
1000 infected servers, well, you know, that's,

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,489
that's a lot of IP S to ban and deal with and confirm.

113
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,540
So anyways, they basically dismantled this botnet uh slash crime group.

114
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,869
Um And what's really sort of terrifying to me is, uh

115
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:39,260
it's, they've only arrested five individuals,

116
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,609
five people

117
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,809
did all of this.

118
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,640
Yeah. Well, five people got caught doing this.

119
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,660
See, and something to remember is now, I mean,

120
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,040
again, a market is need, you know, there's a market for this so it's fulfilled,

121
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,470
you know, crime has outsourced stuff, right?

122
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,529
Like if you for example, want malware, you don't write it yourself. You, you,

123
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,950
you go to a board like a website,

124
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:03,250
you know, that's somewhere in the internet that none of us really know about.

125
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,829
You go there and um and you say I wanna, you know, I want malware that does this

126
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,799
right? And let's say you want something to target a new browser.

127
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,820
You go and buy a zero day, you hand it over to the guys making the malware and they,

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,089
they spin up a malware with a new zero day to attack stuff and

129
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,859
give you the finished product.

130
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:22,350
You know,

131
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,130
it's capitalism and its finest.

132
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:29,730
Exactly. So, I mean, the good news is they, uh, they did dismantle this one and it's,

133
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,690
I suspect a lot of it is from what I've seen of online crime,

134
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,730
there's a lot of people doing online crime

135
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,540
but the good news is, there's not that many people

136
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:38,339
in that.

137
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:39,549
Right.

138
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,700
Well, no, no, I mean, globally, like there's, there's, you know, tens of thou,

139
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,809
like the whole Nigerian 419 scam stuff.

140
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,260
Right. There's thousands of people in Nigeria doing this.

141
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:48,829
I

142
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,059
don't

143
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:49,640
know. Yeah.

144
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:51,989
Oh, yeah. No, I was, I was watching a documentary on it.

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,059
There's just cyber cafes full of these guys,

146
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:57,329
right. Just pounding out emails, you know, manually.

147
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:58,160
So, like I said,

148
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,500
the good news is most of these scammers and hackers and whatnot are not that good

149
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,649
and, you know, part of it.

150
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,170
Is, they don't have to be that good to make a living, you know,

151
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,339
and especially in some of these countries, you know, a couple of $1000 a month,

152
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,359
you can live like a king.

153
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:11,779
So

154
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,660
anyways, the good news is, um, they, they, they took apart this, uh, this ring and,

155
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,100
I mean, there's a, we'll link to the show notes will link to the, uh,

156
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:20,410
the Krebs on security

157
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,359
article.

158
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:25,820
Um, but what's really interesting to me is, you know, these Attackers are, you know,

159
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,420
they're building like three

160
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,380
tier

161
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:30,940
application crime models, basically,

162
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,350
you know, like they have their front end,

163
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,350
they have like a middle layer to do proxy and to

164
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,649
hide themselves and then they have like an actual back end

165
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,510
where like they live, you know, and, and that's what these, uh,

166
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,049
the investigators had to get through, you know, these,

167
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,600
the front end through the proxy layer to actually find out where these guys are,

168
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:50,859
you know, who are they, you know, to hunt them down and arrest them.

169
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:51,640
That's

170
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:52,790
crazy.

171
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,250
So, I mean,

172
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,250
I guess the good news is this shows it can be done.

173
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,589
Um, you know, it kind of reminds me of so this week, uh,

174
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,760
somebody parked in front of my driveway and, you know, there's a simple process.

175
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,369
I phoned the non-emergency police line, uh,

176
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,730
navigate the menu, treat a parking enforcement

177
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,410
and, uh, give them the make and model of the car and the license plate and then,

178
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,190
you know, about 2030 minutes later,

179
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,630
a parking enforcement car shows up and then usually the person

180
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,690
comes and moves their car rather than get a ticket.

181
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,220
Now, if, if

182
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,940
so they'll write a ticket, will they tow the car?

183
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:26,369
If nobody moves it

184
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,010
in certain situations,

185
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,049
they will just take it and in some situations they will tow the car.

186
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,339
So for example, if the car is blocking a driveway,

187
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,589
which depends on how much it's blocking, they'll tow it.

188
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,579
-- Or for example, if it's in like a handicap spot
-- and was your,

189
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:42,010
was your particular perpetrator blocking enough of your driveway

190
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,260
to justify a tow or just a ticket?

191
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,899
Uh, I think they would have towed it, but like I said, nine times out of 10,

192
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,029
somebody pops out of their,

193
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,470
-- somebody pops out of their house and like, you know, moves the car,
-- did they,

194
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,279
-- did they move it before they got a ticket or do they still
-- got a ticket?

195
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,929
Yeah. As soon as the parking enforcement car pulled up, the guy came out

196
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,299
and to move the car,

197
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:00,769
-- would
-- you

198
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,510
a ticket?

199
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,260
He should still got a ticket.

200
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,399
No, but basically, I mean, a lot of parking enforcement boils down to, it's,

201
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,299
it's less about, you know,

202
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:12,709
handing out tickets and more about getting people not just to not park like maniacs.

203
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:13,019
No,

204
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:14,640
-- no,
-- no. The point is

205
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,019
the government sent out this person

206
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,529
to enforce the law

207
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:24,940
-- and the purpose of fines is to pay for the enforcement
-- right, to enforce the bylaw.

208
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,720
It's not a law, it's a bylaw.

209
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:31,179
This isn't a cop, right. This is just a person who can write tickets. Right.

210
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,460
So,

211
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,840
I don't know, it's how the system works and, and more to the point fundamentally,

212
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,169
from a quality of life perspective.

213
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,400
I, I got what I wanted, which is to use my driveway.

214
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,549
It's upsetting to me that you lacked retribution against this person

215
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:45,940
who's

216
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:46,830
part

217
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,030
of

218
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:47,489
you,

219
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:48,929
that they should get a fine,

220
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,130
they should get a fine because maybe they'll think about not doing it in future.

221
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:53,010
Right?

222
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,369
And,

223
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,289
and clearly this is a person who has no regard for the rules of

224
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:59,380
society that are necessary to keep it

225
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,090
functioning in a civilized and reasonable manner.

226
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,869
Yeah, I would agree.

227
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,809
But on the flip side, I mean, it, you know,

228
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,090
it's like people who constantly complain about speeding tickets, right?

229
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,820
There's like a large segment of society that sees speeding

230
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,830
tickets as like a cash grab by the police.

231
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,580
Well, to a degree,

232
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,320
you can argue that like there's a small city in Wisconsin where I live

233
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,940
called. Uh, is it Rosendale? I think it is. And

234
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,619
they are well known for having speed traps throughout the

235
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,179
city because there's basically the this relatively high speed highway

236
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,059
that runs literally through the city and you have to

237
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,739
slow down to about half the speed to go,

238
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,340
to go through town and then you should be back up

239
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,059
and they have way more police per capita

240
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,000
than it's necessary by, like, any stretch of reasonable policing.

241
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,280
And clearly they have that because they're handing out tickets, like they're candy

242
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,090
and I guess

243
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:56,500
in, in one, in one way good for them, you're, uh, essentially you found a loophole to

244
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,229
do something. Right. But, but at the same time it's, it's also, this is,

245
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,429
this is how society has to work. If you have a road that goes through your town,

246
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,020
you can't have people driving 70 miles an hour through the middle of your small town,

247
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,020
somebody is going to get hit and die.

248
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,580
Right.

249
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,460
The, the correct solution. Mind you is to just have the highway go around the city.

250
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,260
But of course, no one wants to pay for that.

251
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,369
It's, this is, this is not unlike running a corporation right where you can.

252
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,190
There's the right way.

253
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,020
There's a way we do it now and there's something we

254
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,859
have to decide that is good enough to get us by

255
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,340
without ruining anything for anyone

256
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,020
or spending any money.

257
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,340
Right. Or making money in some cases

258
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,900
handing out tickets.

259
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,400
Yeah,

260
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:39,890
I don't know.

261
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,219
I mean, yeah,

262
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:42,580
part of me definitely wouldn't mind these

263
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,090
people getting a ticket because quite frankly,

264
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,239
it's easy to not park in front of somebody's driveway.

265
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,200
Like, especially this is what drives me nuts.

266
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,599
It's not like my street is parked up, there's probably

267
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,760
30 to 50%

268
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,580
Ok. So

269
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,429
-- this was not the only parking space. No,
-- no, no.

270
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,669
That, that person

271
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,080
is a monster curt.

272
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,599
That person is a monster and they should be punished for their terrible behavior.

273
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,309
Yeah.

274
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,599
Well,

275
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:04,880
part of me is always thought about letting my

276
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,619
kids play in the driveway with a bowling ball.

277
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,799
That would be acceptable also. Yeah. Give that, give them BB guns or something.

278
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:11,109
Right.

279
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,760
Shoot that car.

280
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,609
Yeah. So, like I said, I guess the good news is that there is the occasional hope that,

281
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:23,309
you know, a botnet or a crime syndicate can be broken up online, but

282
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,650
it's not the occasional hope. Look. I mean, this is how it goes. Right.

283
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,090
There's always an ebb and flow to crime where the bad guys will get ahead for

284
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:37,390
a period of time and then the good guys will do something to disrupt their business.

285
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:38,270
And of course,

286
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,830
now there will be some slowdown of illicit activity of this nature and then in

287
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:47,270
probably a couple of weeks, I doubt it'll take longer than that.

288
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,119
Someone else will show up and replace it and the cycle begins again.

289
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:55,440
It's just, it's how it's been throughout history in all seriousness.

290
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,640
Well, I'm actually more concerned will this actually have any impact?

291
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,609
I'm sure it will

292
00:11:59,789 --> 00:11:59,809
be

293
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,280
a short period of time,

294
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:04,880
but long term. Absolutely not, this will just be replaced by something else.

295
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,869
And, you know, there is somebody who has been waiting for this to happen,

296
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,239
that's just ready and they're gonna go to town as soon as it is.

297
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:13,099
Yeah.

298
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:16,570
No, I, I, yeah, I don't know because, I mean, moving away from the good news,

299
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,309
there's more bad news this week.

300
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:20,450
There is

301
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,099
the,

302
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,500
and how are we pronouncing it?

303
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:24,349
I've heard Mira,

304
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,599
I

305
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:24,880
don't,

306
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:25,500
the

307
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:25,849
botnet

308
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,590
formerly known,

309
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,770
I

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,770
don't know

311
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,010
the Mira botnet which everyone I'm sure can reckon M Ira. I,

312
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:33,940
yeah.

313
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,729
Um, so, yeah,

314
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:38,489
apparently it was going and attacking about

315
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,710
a million German broadband routers on port.

316
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:45,010
What was it? 7547. So I'm guessing that thing has some default credentials.

317
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,260
It, I don't know if it's default credentials or, or what is,

318
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,099
it's some sort of management port

319
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:57,179
that is used by the I SPS to do stuff to the equipment.

320
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,059
And obviously they're doing it on a public interface because it's being attacked

321
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,520
from the internet

322
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,520
and then just kind of ruining

323
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,119
the routers for these people.

324
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,080
It sounds like they're just kind of knocked off line

325
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,030
and there's nothing they can do until they replace it.

326
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,900
What is not very well known server on port 7547

327
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:17,349
is also a tr 064 server uh landside CB configuration.

328
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,010
Uh And it's got a bunch of commands kind of like um so you can, you know, device info,

329
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,150
get info Wlan configuration,

330
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,830
uh proof of concept exploit basically consists of,

331
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,500
oh the, the proof of concept basically consists of go talk to it

332
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:35,820
and tell it to do stuff.

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,340
Yeah.

334
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,650
Uh, precautions they could have taken. Um,

335
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,880
yeah, like,

336
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,530
yeah, this thing is just,

337
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:50,289
uh, wide open, basically. Great. Awesome. See, that's what frustrates me. Right.

338
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,130
Is I have, you know, I have internet at home obviously

339
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,859
and, um, you know, I for sure do not trust the routers modems,

340
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:00,200
whatever I've been given by my ISP because, you know,

341
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,299
I have no idea what they're doing.

342
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,020
No, I, I agree with you completely. And in fact, I

343
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,539
am a customer of an ISP that lets me purchase my own equipment.

344
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,200
And so I gladly did that and, and granted

345
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,619
renting it from them is significantly more expensive than just buying.

346
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:19,900
But it pleases me that I, I know it's not.

347
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:20,859
Well, I shouldn't say that right,

348
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:22,669
because I'm sure they're pushing firmware and

349
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,289
doing goodness knows what to my router,

350
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:26,820
but at least the router is just a router and it doesn't

351
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,340
have any ports on it or anything like that for being,

352
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,010
being the, the access point and all that fun.

353
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:37,119
So then I obviously acquired my own access point slash gateway

354
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,000
that does all of the magic there

355
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,369
for, for the exact reason you mentioned is I I these service providers are,

356
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,739
if you're a security person,

357
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,340
they are historically will say uh less than ideal for our needs and wants.

358
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,159
Yeah,

359
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,549
I gotta admit my solution for my second backup

360
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,219
link is everything over it goes through a VPN provider

361
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,840
because I can't control the, uh,

362
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,979
you know, I can, I can purchase the modem from them but I can't purchase my own modem.

363
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:04,369
Right.

364
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,109
They have to, uh,

365
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:07,739
they don't allow that for whatever reason.

366
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,630
And so, yeah, I just have everything go through a VPN and I have a firewall that blocks

367
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,450
everything outgoing except to the VPN provider.

368
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:16,669
I love it.

369
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:20,919
Although, did you, uh, there was, there was a news story about how terrible

370
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,940
the VPN providers all were because they were using like horrible

371
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,179
static passwords for encrypting the data as it travels over there.

372
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:28,650
I,

373
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:30,960
I assume that for,

374
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,150
you know,

375
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:32,880
I mean,

376
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,119
actually the one I'm using, they support certificates as well,

377
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,270
they use open VPN obviously and they support

378
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:39,320
certificates.

379
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:42,940
Um, I mean, yeah, they do use static passwords but I mean, you know, I,

380
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,010
I generated some ridiculously long password for my account.

381
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,349
Well, no, no, no. The, the problem being that the way some of this VPN traffic works

382
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,460
is you have a pre shared key between the server and client

383
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,619
and the pre shared keys were comically bad

384
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,760
between.

385
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,640
So it was basically you could, you could break a,

386
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,210
a significant amount of the traffic that was kind of traveling over the wire

387
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:07,340
between

388
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,219
the, the clients and servers.

389
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,380
Yeah, I've always wondered because the majority,

390
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,789
when I looked into VPN providers is that really helpful?

391
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,070
Actually,

392
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,250
we should probably link to that in the show notes that VPN comparison spreadsheet.

393
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,099
Uh I don't know if you, if you Google like VPN comparison spreadsheet, uh

394
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,299
it'll be in the, uh,

395
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,659
you get this really nice huge list listing like, uh oh yeah,

396
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:33,900
the official name for it is that one privacy guy's VPN comparison charts?

397
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:40,059
Uh And so anyways, you know, and it's got lovely thing, um, like, uh you know,

398
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,570
how much they cost and like what, you know, do they, well,

399
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,440
what they claim to say about logging data, not logging data and all that.

400
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,590
Um,

401
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,619
but yeah, I mean, none of these things I've ever seen listed, sort of like, how,

402
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,849
how competent are they?

403
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
I, I would

404
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,429
always, I would

405
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,469
-- assume it's one
-- guy,

406
00:16:58,729 --> 00:16:59,919
they're not competent

407
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,669
because that'll just get you in trouble.

408
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,890
Yeah. So,

409
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,589
well, there's a good question.

410
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:10,410
How do you properly validate the security of a VPN provider?

411
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:11,989
You don't?

412
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,588
And even if

413
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:17,388
they tell you things, there's a significant amount of trust,

414
00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:19,178
you have to just put in their word

415
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,718
because

416
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,509
how do you prove

417
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:27,598
they're not logging data? How do you prove that they're storing passwords safely?

418
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:32,168
How do you prove that their certificate key wasn't generated, you know,

419
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:35,468
on some guy's laptop with SSH ports open to the end,

420
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:37,968
like you can't prove any of this stuff.

421
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,119
And so this, this is a huge challenge and in fact, this exists

422
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,810
in

423
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,459
a number of places where your,

424
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:50,020
your hosting provider you use on the internet your operating system provider,

425
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,589
your computer manufacturer,

426
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:54,239
you have to draw a line at some point and just say,

427
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,170
I'm putting my trust in the organization up to here

428
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,859
and anything past that you have no control over and

429
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:04,459
you just have to admit that it is what it is

430
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,150
-- and it, it's sort of terrifying in a lot of ways.
-- Right.

431
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,760
Well, it's getting better because, for example, um, I mean,

432
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,000
one of my favorite things I did you ever watch the DNS E key signing ceremony?

433
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,880
-- Because they broadcast it online for everybody?
-- Completely absurd.

434
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:20,050
-- Oh, yeah.
-- No, it's security theater. But, you know, they're

435
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:21,390
like,

436
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,479
they're at least giving a degree of transparency

437
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,430
and attempting to be open and honest.

438
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:25,719
Right.

439
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,739
You know, it's like the certificate, uh, logging reports. Right.

440
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,979
Like all these providers that are issuing certificates and in past

441
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,420
they would issue certificates and not tell anybody that they

442
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,750
issued a certificate other than obviously to the customer,

443
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,530
they issued it to,

444
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,829
you know, and then Google finds, like, because they do certificate pinning,

445
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,949
they find like, oh,

446
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,030
here's a bunch of Google certificates that we did not buy.

447
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,750
You know, and they write from, uh, I forget who it was.

448
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,410
Well, it's been a couple of providers

449
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,020
and so,

450
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:53,239
you know, I think a lot of

451
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:55,689
the future security. I mean, here's the reality. Right.

452
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,369
Writing secure code that, that has not worked out for us.

453
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,430
It is impossible to write security for humans,

454
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,089
let's clarify that for humans to write secure code

455
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,130
when the A is take over,

456
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,969
I will, I won't say they can do it,

457
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:13,219
but they might be able to do it whereas humans are in absolute cannot do that.

458
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,709
So I think a lot of what the future model of

459
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,890
security is gonna have to be around is around transparency.

460
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,439
You know, like

461
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,459
what, how did we do this?

462
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:25,209
You know, here's like, here's the steps we took to generate the key,

463
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,079
you know, and at least, you know, because I've, I, I,

464
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:30,469
I've also encountered situations where I've asked somebody,

465
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,750
how did you configure this or why did you configure this it this way?

466
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:37,150
And they don't have an answer and that immediately is a huge red flag.

467
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,270
You know what I mean?

468
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,599
Like if you can't tell me why or what you did or why you did something,

469
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,750
then chances are you did it wrong?

470
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,630
That's a reasonable argument. I think.

471
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,030
However, I'll still say that

472
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,819
let's pick on DNS sec.

473
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:57,810
In this case is apart from, we can argue the merits of DNS ec none of people will say,

474
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,400
but just focusing on the key signing like

475
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,750
they can,

476
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,270
they can do this theater

477
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,209
and it's recorded and whatever, and you can,

478
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:10,449
you can verify that the key signing the route is the same thing,

479
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,329
but then it still can kind of fall apart after that

480
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,010
because now you, you, you still have various layers of trust that have to exist.

481
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,489
And it's,

482
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:20,709
yeah,

483
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,670
I don't know. I mean, ii, I,

484
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:22,910
at

485
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,939
-- some
-- point we have to trust people. Right.

486
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:28,390
We can't very like, like food safety is a great example. Right?

487
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,500
This is one of the reasons I love living in

488
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:32,780
uh a boring country like Canada.

489
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,900
We have a very solid food safety system.

490
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:36,900
You know,

491
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:39,810
we have agricultural inspection agencies.

492
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:43,569
We have uh, you know, I, I know a person who is a food inspector,

493
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:44,910
it's a four year college.

494
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:49,089
Here's the deal. And actually you just brought up a great example because

495
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,599
food inspection

496
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,510
is not done by the organization

497
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
creating the,

498
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:56,010
typically

499
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,150
you have some sort of independent inspector and verify,

500
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,939
you have regulations that dictate it.

501
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,119
Exactly. And so I think that's really the important part.

502
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,260
Everyone always talks about this, you know, self regulating and what that's crap.

503
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,729
Right.

504
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:10,119
When you self regulate,

505
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,609
that means we like regulation until it gets in the way and then it's dumb.

506
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:14,859
And

507
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:15,949
I

508
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,689
think you always need external auditors otherwise you do encounter definitely

509
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,650
the, the conflict of interest is unavoidable.

510
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,949
Yes, absolutely.

511
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,630
Even with auditors, the conflict of interest is a problem because, um,

512
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:32,339
you know, their, their client is paying them to audit them and they wanna, you know,

513
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:33,589
obviously get repeat business.

514
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,020
So

515
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,109
I don't know if you remember that certificate Authority in Holland a few years ago

516
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,699
that was found to be completely virus ridden and like their key lived on,

517
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:43,589
like, basically a workstation attached directly to the internet.

518
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,380
Like, it was just comically terrible,

519
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,869
but they passed an audit, you know,

520
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,010
from one of the major accounting firms that does these things.

521
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,989
Right.

522
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:53,459
So,

523
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,180
anyway,

524
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:55,869
I think I,

525
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,260
so to me it kind of falls down to two things

526
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,500
and this is one thing where transparency helps is number one,

527
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,359
ideally we have, you know, some form of base level auditing best practices.

528
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:09,310
I mean, you know, as, as much as people hate PC I and PC I DS S,

529
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,969
it's better than nothing,

530
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,170
you know.

531
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,609
And then the second thing is is when the failures happen, catching them quickly

532
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,739
as quickly as possible. You know, like,

533
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,329
uh a great example being the, the, the, the Tylenol poisoning

534
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:24,819
way back in the eighties, right?

535
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:27,930
Um It took them a while to figure out what was going on because, well,

536
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,900
part of it is something like this had never happened before, right?

537
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,300
It was just, it was unthinkable.

538
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:33,099
It would literally,

539
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,819
they're investigating these crimes and they're like

540
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,599
treating it as like murders and,

541
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:40,060
you know, trying to put it into the existing framework of reality.

542
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,099
Whereas no, it's just some

543
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:41,380
crazy

544
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,780
person.

545
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:45,729
We should clarify for the people who aren't old

546
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:51,239
about the story you're telling about the Tylenol poisonings from the eighties.

547
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,430
So

548
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:56,310
let, let's start here. I'll, I'll start, I'll, I'll set the stage

549
00:22:56,449 --> 00:23:00,650
and then I'll let you, uh, take it home is. So a long time ago

550
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,390
they would sell

551
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,760
well, well, Ty Tylenol, I guess in this case, drugs,

552
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,880
drugs in general at the drug store

553
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,380
would be on the shelf and there was no like safety seal on it.

554
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,880
So you could literally just open up the, the case

555
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,859
and take out some drugs if you wanted.

556
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:21,020
Like, like for example, if you had Aspirin or, or Tylenol, in this case,

557
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,359
you could just open them and, and take them out or put them in for that matter. Right.

558
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,859
There was no such concept as a safety seal which now we're all very familiar with.

559
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,449
Well, it's, and just to clarify it's there, there were seals and things,

560
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,949
but they didn't show if they'd been opened or not.

561
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:39,229
Right. You could open a package and rec close it and it wouldn't

562
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:44,030
really show us, you know, it wouldn't be obvious that it had been opened and closed.

563
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:44,910
Right. Right.

564
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,390
And so now we bring ourselves to

565
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:50,069
the Tylenol poisoning incident.

566
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:53,189
-- Yeah.
-- So someone, uh, and they've never been caught.

567
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:56,849
Basically, somebody put cyanide in these, uh, Tylenol,

568
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,140
you know, bottles

569
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,770
and what's really, uh,

570
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:02,319
well, I mean,

571
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:04,540
unfortunately some people died but the good news is

572
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,630
the company that owns Tylenol Johnson and Johnson,

573
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,439
you know, they handled it properly,

574
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:11,650
right. They did a nationwide recall of all the Tylenol.

575
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,060
Uh, and the other cool thing is,

576
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,500
uh, well, not cool really,

577
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,829
but cyanide shows up on x rays for some reason it's dense or whatever.

578
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:20,449
So they took all the Tylenol,

579
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,319
they were pulling off the shelves and running it through airport X ray scanners.

580
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,640
That's crazy.

581
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,329
You know,

582
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,260
and then they invented

583
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,780
tamper proof and tamper evident packaging.

584
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,650
Right. Right. Ok. So I pulled up the Wikipedia page for those of you interested.

585
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,849
There were seven deaths and it was in, uh started September 29th, 1982.

586
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,719
So that's,

587
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,180
that's quite some time ago,

588
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,689
you know, but the beauty is now as a result of that, we have

589
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,219
packaging laws that, you know, make, have made things much, much safer,

590
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,979
you know, as a lot like that. But,

591
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:54,530
and, you know, unfortunately, though we needed, I mean,

592
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,939
things have to get bad typically before people, you know,

593
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:59,180
realize they're bad enough to need fixing.

594
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,050
Um, and I'm, I'm kind of wondering if we're getting to that point on the internet now.

595
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:03,109
I

596
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:03,510
-- don't
-- know,

597
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,780
we're even close,

598
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,920
we're not even close and, and I know you're aware that I've,

599
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,939
I started doing research actually into industrial safety

600
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,489
compared to

601
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,579
iot security

602
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:18,239
and looking for parallels.

603
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,719
And I have gone down a rat hole like I did not expect to happen, but

604
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,410
I'm now researching various industries and how bad it got before they got better.

605
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,390
And I'm gonna put together a nice talk to, to kind of give on this.

606
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,660
But, but fundamentally speaking, like

607
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,209
we aren't even close to bad enough when you look at things like environmental

608
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:43,530
protections or food safety or worker safety or auto safety or airline safety or

609
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:48,500
like literally things were exploding and people were dying before anyone cared.

610
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,810
And even then it took a while before people really cared.

611
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,439
I mean,

612
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:56,930
literally on the internet until things are physically exploding and people are

613
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:59,780
dying and a lot of them are going to have to,

614
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,479
nobody is going to care.

615
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:04,800
And the thing that scares the crap out of me though about this is

616
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,790
you look at cybercrime

617
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,250
and it is going to be in their best interest

618
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,050
to make sure nothing lights on fire and kills people.

619
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,729
They wanna make it bad enough, they're gonna make their money but not so bad.

620
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:16,810
Anyone fixes it.

621
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:19,530
And I think that's where we're stuck at today is,

622
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,349
it's bad enough that Cybercrime can make money,

623
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,150
but it's not so bad. Anyone's willing to fix it.

624
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,969
Yeah. Well, and, and part of my real concern is with self driving cars, right?

625
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:33,680
Because traditionally computers have been in things or controlled things,

626
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,199
uh, that are not very mobile.

627
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,089
You know, like with the exception of, uh, well, I say planes and trains and ships,

628
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,359
right.

629
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:45,520
Uh, and now cars, but, you know, we've never give them sort of that

630
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:49,069
autonomy and connected them to the internet directly.

631
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,560
Ok. There's, there's that, but let's also think about planes and ships

632
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,910
specifically because those are very computer controlled,

633
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:02,780
but they're also not the sort of thing that the general public owns.

634
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:03,329
Right.

635
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:06,280
These are things that are controlled by organizations that have

636
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,380
a specific interest in ensuring a certain amount of safety.

637
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:09,959
Right.

638
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:15,349
And that's gonna be the trick with cars is if we let anybody buy a self driving car,

639
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,359
anybody can do anything, they want to a self driving car.

640
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,250
But if you have an organization that has certain

641
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,339
requirements around safety and security,

642
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:31,500
then it changes the game and I know this is gonna open a crazy discussion.

643
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,290
It's something to think about.

644
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,770
Well, one thing I think about is you can already build a self driving car, right.

645
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,349
Google has, um, various inventors have done it.

646
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,670
You know, you could also definitely build a remote control car, right?

647
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,770
And use it to cause all sorts of mayhem and chaos.

648
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,790
The reality is to get it working, you know,

649
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,050
you need a certain level of sophistication that most,

650
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:52,130
you know, bad guys probably don't have or care about because

651
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:57,010
here's one thing to keep in mind, right? Is with a self driving car using it for crime.

652
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:01,719
It's still sort of tricky to monetize that. Right. I mean, yeah, I would certainly,

653
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:05,439
you know, uh, you could certainly do some things like, uh,

654
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:08,709
blackmail people or cause, you know, denial of service style attacks,

655
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:12,089
but to actually turn a self driving car into a money making thing

656
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,239
criminally,

657
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,040
you know,

658
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,859
-- it's, I, I, well, people will find a way
-- I'm sure ransomware, dude.

659
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,239
Right. Ransomware could certainly be one.

660
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,140
But, but here's, here's the thing I always am concerned with,

661
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,170
with self driving cars.

662
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
It's, let's say

663
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:28,760
we have self driving cars taking over the world.

664
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,140
There's no more people and all the self driving cars,

665
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,410
talk to each other and they all know what's going on.

666
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,099
And so for example,

667
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,520
we don't need traffic lights anymore because

668
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,579
the cars magically deal with intersections.

669
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,510
What happens when I decide I'm special,

670
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,810
my car isn't going to stop at the intersections anymore.

671
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,729
And now I have the only car that never has to stop

672
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:51,689
when it's traveling because all the other cars are willing to stop.

673
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,630
I would assume those cars would report that activity to the police, right?

674
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,030
Because see one thing and I hate like one thing I'm I'm wondering about, for example,

675
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,650
if you have a few percent of self driving cars on the roads,

676
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,729
uh let's say on the highway, what happens when they start

677
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:08,910
providing telemetry data on other cars to the police saying, you know,

678
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,670
here's this car that went zooming by me.

679
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,979
I was going this fast, this other car was going

680
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:14,469
100 miles an hour.

681
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:19,060
Here is video of it happening. Here is a high resolution video of the driver

682
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:21,260
as they went by good side profile.

683
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,069
Here's their license plate and all that

684
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:23,979
or

685
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,209
maybe not the police.

686
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:27,939
But what happens when they start providing that data to the insurance companies?

687
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,959
-- I think the eff is crying in the corner right now.
-- Kurt.

688
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:31,260
Oh,

689
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,680
yeah. No, I, I sort of am too but

690
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:38,020
I, one thing that gets me is our fundamental view of what is privacy,

691
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,859
you know, and what is

692
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,780
public is, is going to change so drastically because

693
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,599
there's going to be all these

694
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:51,319
machines with computers and, you know, liar, light sensors, cameras,

695
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:54,199
sonar like God only knows what kind of stuff,

696
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:54,959
you know.

697
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,630
Um I've heard talk of having biometric recognition so that you can

698
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,079
have automated billing when you get in and out of the car,

699
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:03,390
you know, so you don't even need to put your smartphone out

700
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,790
things like that. Right?

701
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:08,060
And so I'm I at some point, for example,

702
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:12,020
like I assume a self driving car service provider, you know,

703
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:14,869
is going to start monetizing that data

704
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,630
because they would be insane not to

705
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,079
right

706
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,369
from a business perspective.

707
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,290
I hate to say it, but if you have data that you can sell to an insurance company

708
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,310
for a million bucks a year or 10 million bucks a year, well,

709
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,609
they're probably going to do it.

710
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,609
Well, and I feel like this is one of those places where

711
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,689
laws aren't keeping up with reality.

712
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:34,890
I think in this case, it's worse than that.

713
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,689
Laws aren't even aware of these realities.

714
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:41,579
That's true. Right? Like like a great example being Bruce Schneier

715
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,130
talking in front of, what was that? The US Senate or the US Congress testifying.

716
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,439
Right.

717
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:47,880
And he's pointing out to these people that you have to stop

718
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,329
thinking about these things as a self driving car with a computer,

719
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:52,619
you need to start thinking about these things as a

720
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,880
computer living in a car with four wheels that controls.

721
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,290
Right. Right.

722
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,930
Like your fridge, your fridge is no longer a fridge with a computer. You,

723
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,579
it's a computer that happens to have a fridge wrapped around it that it can control.

724
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:07,380
Not my fridge, man,

725
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:08,239
I'm

726
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,349
the last person with a non

727
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,540
-- IOT
-- fridge. A great example is all these smart TV S that are apparently just garbage.

728
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:14,729
Right?

729
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,390
Every time I read about smart TV S online,

730
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,689
all I hear and all I've experienced is like they're so slow, right?

731
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:22,819
You turn them on and it takes a minute or two for these things to get, you know,

732
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:24,030
to youtube or Netflix.

733
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,310
Mine takes 12 seconds

734
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:29,390
because I had to configure my harmony remote

735
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,270
to work with uh turning on the TV. And then jumping to my myth TV machine,

736
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,630
uh switching inputs and it's 12 seconds from the time

737
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,680
I turn it on until I can switch inputs.

738
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:44,630
But now I recognize the risk to this and I have a special network,

739
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,689
wireless network set up that it connects to

740
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:49,680
that literally, this TV sees the internet and nothing else.

741
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:51,920
But granted most people don't do that.

742
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,790
But uh I mean,

743
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,839
that's the thing right is like we've already crossed that, you know, uh,

744
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,260
river with TV, S, all TV.

745
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,349
S now have a computer

746
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,589
to some degree. Right. And, but the good news is TV. S can't, like,

747
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,270
fall off the wall and kill you or, you know,

748
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,530
-- generally they can't set themselves on fire
-- or, you know, I would bet you,

749
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,670
you could get a TV to light on fire.

750
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,670
I bet it wouldn't be

751
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,750
for sure. Probably don't have hardware safeties and fuses and cut offs.

752
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,790
I bet you could. Yeah.

753
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:20,910
Yeah,

754
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,239
I bet you could do things with the display and like maximum brightness and just,

755
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,729
like, go to town on that sucker.

756
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:28,270
I bet. I bet you could light it on fire.

757
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:32,180
Well, see, and here's one example of a really something that would be not super fun,

758
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,729
you know, imagine a botnet gets into a whole bunch of smart TV.

759
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:36,589
S and they just start wi fi jamming.

760
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:37,380
Yeah,

761
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:38,099
-- I
-- suppose

762
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:40,770
that that would be really quite

763
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,469
so, here's the deal though is

764
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,849
there's no money to be made

765
00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:47,050
in that activity.

766
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,010
-- Ransomware, denial of service. Right. Except
-- you can't un

767
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,530
ransomware that because it's, it's denial,

768
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,439
the service in itself,

769
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:55,839
you

770
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:59,219
know, like for an hour and then you put a message on the TV saying,

771
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:00,680
would you like your Wi Fi back

772
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,319
or, I guess you could even say, do you want your TV back? Right?

773
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:07,469
I mean, you know, send, send $10 to this Bitcoin address and you get your TV.

774
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,869
Back and let's face it. It's like, yeah,

775
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,640
it's easier than buying a new TV.

776
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,479
So, no, it's, and that's, that's the thing.

777
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:18,160
Like, so I've actually decided I'm, I'm purposely avoiding

778
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,800
things with computers in them unless, like,

779
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,000
they really need to have a computer in them.

780
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,439
You know? I probably can't even buy a toaster without a computer in it now.

781
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:29,109
Well, let me rephrase a computer that connects to the internet.

782
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,050
That's fair.

783
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,170
-- That's fair.
-- You know, because

784
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,280
I'll make a few exceptions.

785
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:33,699
Like, I,

786
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:37,199
I really do love my bathroom scale that I have all the data charted automatically.

787
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,400
Um,

788
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:39,500
you know,

789
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,400
but fundamentally, yeah, I'm avoid,

790
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,949
I like every time I go to Home Depot now

791
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:45,030
I avoid the home automation aisle because I'm just,

792
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,270
I'm, I know it's tempting,

793
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:51,369
you know, that thing's a train wreck and most of it phones home besides.

794
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,239
So, you know, it's like doubly bad.

795
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,430
Yeah. Well, like those, uh, Android phones that had that, uh,

796
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:02,089
malware that was phoning home to China and giving apparently all the data like S

797
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:03,280
MS emails.

798
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:07,619
-- So
-- here's the deal with that. And this, I've been thinking about this a lot because

799
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:11,549
is phoning home to China

800
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:15,069
any worse than phoning home to Google or Apple,

801
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:17,549
which is what these phones currently do today.

802
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,688
I guess it sort of depends on.

803
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,750
Well, for example, myself, I live in North America so I would prefer that they

804
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,429
phone home to a jurisdiction that I'm in because if there is some legal problem,

805
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,290
I have a, a

806
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:32,590
faint hope or possibility of legal redress.

807
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,090
Whereas with China, I mean, it's just, there's no way it would be worth my time.

808
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:42,129
Whatever, man. If, if you wanted to go after say the, the producer of your phone,

809
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,449
we, we won't identify the company.

810
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,978
They, what would you honestly do? Even if you hired a lawyer, they probably

811
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,418
and do nothing. A class action lawsuit. Whatever, man.

812
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,199
I, I,

813
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,580
no, actually so funny enough you mentioned that is, there's, uh,

814
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,929
I, this is something that I,

815
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:02,590
I wonder about a lot and I've spoken with a handful of lawyers about is

816
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,100
it's not that easy to sue people because it turns out at least in,

817
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,939
in the United States, I can't speak for Canada,

818
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,020
which I think it's even harder to sue people in Canada than it is here. But

819
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,500
without the ability to show physical harm of some way,

820
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,939
like monetary harm alone is not acceptable for a lawsuit.

821
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:22,020
And so, and how many people, I mean, other than Samsung phone owners,

822
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,179
can anyone show physical harm from their phone?

823
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:31,229
Well, actually in Canada there is a class action lawsuit taking place, um,

824
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,199
around the Apple iphone six and six plus, uh, so-called Touch disease.

825
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:38,699
Uh, where apparently the screen starts to

826
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,739
-- not work.
-- Yes, but that's physical harm, right?

827
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,659
Because you have a physical good that you paid money for that no longer works.

828
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:51,699
It's different when something is just shipping data across the country or world.

829
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:52,860
Right. There's no

830
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,580
physical

831
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:56,770
-- would be,
-- the data privacy laws would be in violation that

832
00:35:57,169 --> 00:35:57,350
Europe

833
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:01,800
does have data privacy laws. And so they might have some advantage there.

834
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,760
But again,

835
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,389
do you think this company is probably selling in Europe?

836
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,770
And if they are, what would they do,

837
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,489
they probably just stop selling in Europe because they're already,

838
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,090
I'm sure making a fortune selling, you know,

839
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,479
crap phones to people in the United States.

840
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:17,320
No, I hate to say it, but I suspect,

841
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,889
II, I really can't see any option other than regulation to force the market

842
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,239
to be incentivized,

843
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,040
to make, you know, these things more secure

844
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:27,909
and, and

845
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,629
I don't disagree with you,

846
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,290
but the challenge with regulation is regulation

847
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,189
always is like years behind what's happening

848
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,750
and we're at a point now where you think about two years ago,

849
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,030
what technology looked like and

850
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:43,870
it is

851
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,840
unidentifiable by today's standards. And you think in two more years

852
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:51,870
there's gonna be stuff we can't even imagine

853
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,439
that's gonna be commonplace.

854
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:57,030
Well, you could see the thing to remember too is you can always regulate

855
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,090
uh how to explain it. You can sort of re

856
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:02,189
regulate the behaviors more than say the technology.

857
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,919
So for example, I think it was in Britain

858
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:08,520
rather than coming up with regulations for every single, you know, illegal drug.

859
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,739
Uh they either were talking about or have I I should check, but basically

860
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,739
any psychoactive substance,

861
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,620
which, I mean, uh, you know, that's like, also,

862
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:21,669
I guess technically includes toilet bowl cleaner,

863
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,479
um, which you should never drink, by the way, let's be clear on that.

864
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:27,620
Um,

865
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:29,260
but so, rather than, you know,

866
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,699
come up with these new laws for every single drug because these

867
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:34,659
drugs keep getting tweaked and produced in China and then mailed,

868
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,010
you know, to the UK,

869
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:38,750
they just all psychoactive substances.

870
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,010
And I suppose, for example,

871
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,669
you could look at blanket regulations like anything that

872
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,070
uh well, and to be fair, they already did this with the uh the computer abuse act.

873
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,330
Remember it was like any system that stores transmits or processes data,

874
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:53,949
right? Yeah, that's, that's true.

875
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:56,629
You know, so and I mean, let's face it, right?

876
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:02,389
By defining it as a system that stores processes or transmits data. I mean,

877
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:03,709
that's everything,

878
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,540
you know, there's, I can't imagine

879
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,229
it is now.

880
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,000
So this, I mean, so that's it. It's a good example actually is

881
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,540
I would bet you most of us commit

882
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,330
felonies every day by the C FAA standards, right?

883
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:19,530
And

884
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,290
it's terrifying

885
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,679
to think about some of that and, and now granted there's certain like sanity

886
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,590
that exists in the courts to a degree. But

887
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:30,530
I mean, this is one of the hard things is how do we solve some of this?

888
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,280
And some people talk about regulation. Some people talk about liability.

889
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,479
Some people talk about insurance some people talk about guarantees.

890
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,899
And I think here's what I always come back to is that

891
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:45,479
these problems are too new for us to understand how we're going to fix them.

892
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,649
And I'm not saying we shouldn't try and I'm not saying people

893
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,149
shouldn't be talking about regulation and

894
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,080
people shouldn't be talking about liability.

895
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:52,780
But

896
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:57,659
the problem I see is by the time we think we understand what's going on,

897
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,209
everything is changed and now we have to rethink our way through this

898
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:04,250
stuff and by the time you make it through that everything's changing again.

899
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,719
And so this is like the ultimate game of Kelvin Ball.

900
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,320
The world is playing with itself and we're currently losing

901
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,159
badly.

902
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,020
So for those of you who don't know,

903
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,070
Calvin Ball is from the uh comic strip Calvin and Hobbs.

904
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,169
And, uh, if I remember correctly,

905
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:22,899
the idea was that Calvin Ball had no rules except for all the rules it had,

906
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:24,219
which constantly changed.

907
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,780
And so you get scores of like 17 to purple losing.

908
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:28,870
Right. Right.

909
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:33,770
And, and so what, what it really is is, it's about whoever can think of the best rules,

910
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,590
the fastest wins.

911
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:37,770
Right. And Kelvin always lost

912
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:38,070
because

913
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,919
-- everyone else came up with
-- the

914
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:45,689
point too is even if you come up with good rules, you still have to enforce them.

915
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,750
-- Right?
-- And the bad guys just make up new rules. Right.

916
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,219
-- Yeah.
-- Or they move somewhere where they can't be enforced.

917
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,540
Yep. Yep. Yeah. Well, heck, we have that already. I mean,

918
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,860
look at, look at the countries, these,

919
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,810
these criminal organizations are typically running out of now.

920
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,129
Right. They're in countries that

921
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,370
are willing to

922
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,919
overlook or just don't care about, you know, kind of computer abuse law.

923
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,429
Yeah. Or they,

924
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,530
well, I remember, oh, there was a, I remember back in the day this, uh,

925
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,209
they finally caught this Taiwanese guy that wrote some really massive virus.

926
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,500
Uh but there were no laws against it in Taiwan.

927
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,290
And so he ended up going and doing his military service and getting a job in it,

928
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,850
I believe,

929
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,729
you know.

930
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,120
Um,

931
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,120
and, you know, and, and quite rightly, I mean, unless you can, I guess,

932
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:31,229
extradite him to a country where it is against the law.

933
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:35,270
But, you know, most countries won't extradite unless you've broken

934
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,870
something that is comparable to their laws. Right.

935
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:38,590
Most of them will say,

936
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,520
like it also has to be an offense in our country to a comparable degree because,

937
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,750
you know, um, there's a lot of countries with a lot of crazy laws.

938
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,270
Like you can't, you know,

939
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:50,449
in many countries, you can't say things about the leader of the country,

940
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:53,689
-- you know,
-- very democratic countries. Right.

941
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:54,070
Yeah.

942
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:55,989
Yeah. So,

943
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,510
yeah. No, it's, I, I hope that we get

944
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:05,199
regulation. I'm not sure that it would even work, even if we had good legislation.

945
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm not sure it would work because there's the enforcement angle.

946
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,560
Right. Well, and,

947
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,969
and not only that, let's think about open source.

948
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:12,449
Now,

949
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:15,100
how does open source fit into this story where

950
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,379
you don't necessarily have a company behind something?

951
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:22,620
You've got like a dude in his basement who wrote the image library that,

952
00:41:22,629 --> 00:41:24,540
that has a remote execution issue in it.

953
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,139
Now, like, what do you do?

954
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:29,979
Well, the thing that always gets me fundamentally open source

955
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,689
will need to be able to disclaim liability in some way, which it already does. Right.

956
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,860
-- You know, you agree to use the software and basically not sue us
-- if it be a

957
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,580
single piece of software

958
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:40,219
liability waiver.

959
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:42,090
And that's the second point, right?

960
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,219
Is if open source can do it,

961
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:45,649
why can't the close source guys and the commercial guys do it?

962
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,239
So, no, the point being though that the closed source guys,

963
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,610
I think we're doing this first.

964
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:52,889
Well, they ha, well, the thing is you can't

965
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:57,010
for open source and in general for the, the software,

966
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,159
the current software industry to survive,

967
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:00,959
it can't be liable

968
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,000
for every little thing because I, I've seen cases where, you know,

969
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,310
somebody does something stupid that, yeah,

970
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,090
maybe their computer shouldn't have let them do.

971
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,189
But fundamentally, you know,

972
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,350
they kind of brought it upon themselves and for example, didn't have backups

973
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,850
and then, you know, they want to sue for business losses,

974
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,780
which as we found out are very difficult to do,

975
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,419
-- however,
-- it has been done physical damage.

976
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:26,580
A lady sued Microsoft for forced windows update and got away with it, like,

977
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,479
managed to get it through.

978
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:27,979
But again,

979
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,500
it goes back to that sort of damage thing where they forced a windows 10 update,

980
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,459
that kind of bricked or laptop or whatever.

981
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,580
Um

982
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,659
So part of me, as much as I say, I would want regulate, like,

983
00:42:37,669 --> 00:42:39,820
and obviously I want like magical fairy unicorn

984
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,010
regulations that are actually correct and good,

985
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,649
which is probably not what we're going to get.

986
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:49,040
Um, but even assuming, you know, we get that. How, yeah, how do you have that, um,

987
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:52,540
that disclaimer or that opt out for open source?

988
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,139
So that open source doesn't get killed,

989
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,100
you know.

990
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,750
Well, it's not even about open source getting killed.

991
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,100
Everyone is using open source today.

992
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:00,820
There's

993
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,500
like my TV,

994
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,899
it comes with a special screen that shows all of the,

995
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,820
the, the licenses in libraries inside

996
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:12,340
my car. Does that. Now, I got a car with the touch screen a couple of weeks ago.

997
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:12,750
And how do you show

998
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,080
the

999
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,729
open source?

1000
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:16,620
Like, shouldn't you be able to write them a letter to get a CD or something?

1001
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:21,669
-- I would be very curious if anybody on the planet has done this.
-- I should do that.

1002
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:23,979
I should look actually if I, I got a Toyota

1003
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:24,699
and

1004
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:27,860
I should, I should see if they, if they make that available.

1005
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,580
They legally have to, don't they?

1006
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,000
Well, legally have to and just ignoring me is

1007
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:34,899
two very different things,

1008
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,350
right?

1009
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,399
And this is, I mean, this is part of the regulation challenge, right? Is

1010
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,229
you can make laws telling people to do things,

1011
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:44,080
but you need a way to enforce the things that

1012
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,219
need to be done because if nobody's enforcing them,

1013
00:43:46,229 --> 00:43:47,909
you effectively have no regulation.

1014
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:51,590
-- Yeah,
-- I don't know. I mean, what, what do our show listeners think?

1015
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:52,300
You know?

1016
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,540
So let's, let's assume for a moment,

1017
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,699
let's pause it and this is not entirely unlikely, I think,

1018
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:57,760
but let's assume for a moment

1019
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,969
that we will never have regulations at

1020
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,179
all to apply to this because they either just don't get done or they,

1021
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,479
by the time they get done it's like 20 years from now.

1022
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:08,469
Oh, sweet. I can finally buy that monkey.

1023
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:09,959
Yeah. Um,

1024
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,820
well, I mean, more specifically with, uh, with it, security type problems.

1025
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,939
But, um, you know, what does the world look like?

1026
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,889
How do we keep it from catching on fire?

1027
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,189
You know,

1028
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:23,600
and I'll be honest part of what I'm trying to do with the,

1029
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,379
the common vulnerabilities and exposures.

1030
00:44:25,389 --> 00:44:27,070
The, the CV stuff

1031
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,120
is honestly one of my goals in life is to flip it right now. Generally speaking CV.

1032
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:35,830
S are seen as bad. You messed up. You have a security flaw, bad, bad, bad.

1033
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,239
Right. Whereas, you know, it, it, in my opinion should be the opposite. Good.

1034
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,199
You found a security flaw and fixed it. I mean, and obviously

1035
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:44,850
it only works if people fix these things, right?

1036
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:48,120
But my, you know, because I look at these vendors like, um

1037
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,010
you know, Google Chrome Firefox, right?

1038
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,449
They're great examples uh Internet Explorer safari, right?

1039
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:55,489
These browsers all have tons of CV S

1040
00:44:55,689 --> 00:44:56,739
that they fix, right?

1041
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,929
Uh The most recent one being Firefox fix that zero day, that's, you know,

1042
00:44:59,939 --> 00:45:00,899
being exploited.

1043
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,340
Uh I think by law enforcement actually,

1044
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:05,340
um which suspected,

1045
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,100
suspected, sorry.

1046
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:08,419
Um

1047
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,050
And so, in my opinion, you know, you know,

1048
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,550
those are the web browsers I wanna use because

1049
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,929
they have security flaws that they fix quickly versus

1050
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:17,629
I figured it out.

1051
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,510
You just need to pre assign

1052
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:23,510
300 CV I DS to every software project on the planet.

1053
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:25,949
And, you know, the ones that fill them all out,

1054
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:28,409
look for all the issues and the ones that didn't,

1055
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:32,590
didn't care enough to look for all the security problems that occur in their code.

1056
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,129
You know,

1057
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:37,449
you, you say that, I think in Jest, but I

1058
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:40,570
-- told the worst idea I've heard all week.
-- It's half crazy.

1059
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,080
I'm writing this

1060
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:41,239
down

1061
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:41,830
as

1062
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:42,280
well.

1063
00:45:43,649 --> 00:45:43,800
And this

1064
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:44,129
is to

1065
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,350
me, we, we already do this to a degree with the CN A si mean, a great example being Mier

1066
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:49,780
actually sent out an email, me

1067
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:52,770
or the company that, you know, manages the CV database ultimately

1068
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,129
sent out an email saying, you know,

1069
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:57,719
reminding us all to get our 2017 CV S because come January 1st,

1070
00:45:57,729 --> 00:45:59,129
we're gonna start naming them

1071
00:45:59,649 --> 00:46:00,429
and

1072
00:46:00,629 --> 00:46:02,510
I, you know, requested the block

1073
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,030
and uh it was up in the 27 hundreds.

1074
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,860
That's awesome, man.

1075
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:07,689
It's

1076
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:08,399
amazing.

1077
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:12,179
So like, yeah, these vendors, these CNAs do care and

1078
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,860
you know, and if you look at who are CNAs, you know,

1079
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,070
it's major companies that do care about security, like

1080
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,389
Microsoft Red Hat, IBM Apple, you know, they, they have security process,

1081
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:22,580
they have security updates.

1082
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,449
And what sort of worries me is when I look at these vendors, especially big ones that

1083
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,889
I don't know if they have a security process,

1084
00:46:30,419 --> 00:46:33,199
they certainly don't have CV S that they've requested, you know,

1085
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:35,260
they might have had them assigned to them by somebody else.

1086
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,540
Um,

1087
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:42,090
and so to me, it becomes actually a very good metric is more CV S fixed obviously

1088
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:45,500
because the reality is the software is gonna have flaws. That's just a given,

1089
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,179
right.

1090
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,179
The question is,

1091
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:52,030
how quickly do they fix them? How, you know, robust, do they make the software? How

1092
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,750
do they do stuff to avoid CV S in future? Right.

1093
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,340
But the reality is we all have so much technical debt. Like,

1094
00:46:57,729 --> 00:47:01,909
um, you know, even the open BS D people still have CV S even SSH, you know,

1095
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:05,540
this year had a couple of CV S and, you know, two of them were pretty bad,

1096
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:11,159
you know, but they fix them really fast and they pushed out updates really

1097
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:11,929
work.

1098
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:12,229
And

1099
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,889
I think that's where the,

1100
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:15,260
the good

1101
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,790
industry, players have figured out that it's not about prevention.

1102
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,870
It's about speed more than anything.

1103
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:21,389
Right.

1104
00:47:21,399 --> 00:47:24,699
I mean, you, yes, prevention is certainly something you should focus on as well. But

1105
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:27,110
it's really about just being able to move fast.

1106
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:27,729
Well,

1107
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:30,169
I think the truth is you can do all the prevention in the

1108
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,830
world you want but you will still have house fires to deal with.

1109
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,030
You will still have somebody

1110
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,790
either doing a bug bounty or a bad guy,

1111
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,590
right? Because if your software is popular, the bad guys are gonna poke at it.

1112
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,229
That's, it's just how it is, right? Because there's value there.

1113
00:47:43,649 --> 00:47:44,790
And so whether or not

1114
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:47,639
you like it, I mean, open SSH is a great example.

1115
00:47:47,649 --> 00:47:51,550
Like they've done prevention for over a decade, maybe two decades now.

1116
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:55,590
You know, they, they pioneered concepts like privilege separation, right?

1117
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,370
They, they had a small core part of Open SSH that ran as a privileged user

1118
00:47:59,899 --> 00:48:01,149
and it's like

1119
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,889
only a couple 1000 lines of code and then it immediately

1120
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:07,330
gets out of that privileged thing as fast as it can,

1121
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:07,969
you know.

1122
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:09,090
Um

1123
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,290
And yet they still have, you know, CVS that they have to react to.

1124
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,040
So I think the thing is, yeah, no matter how much prevention you do,

1125
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,860
you're still gonna have those reactive security moments.

1126
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:19,419
And you know,

1127
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,500
the reality is if you can get those things out in 24 48 hours,

1128
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:24,790
then you can really minimize harm

1129
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,870
if it takes a year or two years or it never gets fixed. Right?

1130
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:31,050
Like, like, I mean, the reality is there are major vendors out there with, you know,

1131
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,149
popular software,

1132
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,389
internet facing software with flaws that have never been fixed.

1133
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,899
It's true,

1134
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,310
you know.

1135
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:43,399
Um, but yeah, the reactive side, you, you have to have some capability there. Just

1136
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:44,439
you have to.

1137
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:47,489
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I agree.

1138
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:48,540
Oh,

1139
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,080
make my head hurt. Curt.

1140
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:51,979
All right, man,

1141
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:53,520
let's call it.

1142
00:48:55,419 --> 00:48:59,360
So I guess the good news is law enforcement works sometimes and the bad news is

1143
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,280
the bad guys also go to work.

1144
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,459
Indeed. It's cat mouse, man. It never ends.

1145
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,739
So until next time

1146
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:13,280
you have a fantastic day, Kurt. And thanks for listening. Everybody again.

1147
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,949
If you want the show notes, you can go to open source security podcast.com

1148
00:49:17,379 --> 00:49:19,560
and see the links to all the

1149
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:21,179
interesting and

1150
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:25,939
we'll say mostly tangential and off topic things that we discussed today.

1151
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,479
-- Happy Friday, everybody. Happy
-- Friday. Take care.

1152
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:31,879
Bye

1153
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:32,639
bye bye.
