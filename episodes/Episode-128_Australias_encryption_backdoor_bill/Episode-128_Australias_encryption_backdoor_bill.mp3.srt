Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 128.

1
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:13,000
And no, we have not been compromised by the Australians at this time

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,460
that we can prove.

3
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,479
Well, I'm just wondering, for example, like, because if we were in Australia,

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,440
we could be compelled to put malware in the, uh, in the MP3, for example.

5
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:30,000
Uh I, I don't know, maybe it's this.

6
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,310
So if dear listener, if you haven't figured it out yet,

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,200
our topic is going to be,

8
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:40,340
we'll say the questionable law Australia passed very recently

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,669
around government. It, it, yeah, it's, it's super complicated. It's even worse.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,869
It's, it's madness

11
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,430
anyway,

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,509
the, the, we'll say questionable bill that made it through

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,069
the Australian. I don't know what they call their government,

14
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,509
whatever. Uh, the, the Australian government,

15
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:00,349
I'll call it the government. It is all right. Like what?

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,709
I don't need to know these things, right? Like whatever doesn't matter. No big deal.

17
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,468
Not, not, not America.

18
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:08,958
They have a parliamentary system just like our, well, not just like mine,

19
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,289
but very similar to mine.

20
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:10,689
So.

21
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:12,768
Ok. Right. It's some sort of

22
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:15,009
uh elected government

23
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:19,749
that is full of obviously old white men who don't understand technology and,

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,469
and that's

25
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:24,848
-- true of most of the world yay for us
-- or worse,

26
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:28,808
some of them do understand technology and, and are ok with this,

27
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:30,559
it could be

28
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:32,059
it.

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,120
So anyway, let's, let's just start at the beginning and,

30
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,720
and the best part of today is I made a,

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,910
a flow chart of how I think this might work out and,

32
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:41,239
and

33
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:45,910
it's on paper which amused me greatly as I drew the picture

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,730
and, and I, I scanned it. I'll put it in the show notes for those of you.

35
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,750
-- I do
-- appreciate the PDF. You sent me of it,

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,940
right? The madness and the scribbly lines and like the mistakes I made.

37
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,750
-- And it's, it's beautiful
-- dude. This is the, this is how Ethernet got built

38
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,690
it probably I'm gonna, I can

39
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:04,989
I have.

40
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,010
Uh so anyway,

41
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:09,490
this next to the pictures my Children drew after we're done talking

42
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,529
and

43
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,789
I was just trying to load a copy of access

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,130
the assistance and access bill 2018 Department of Home Affairs.

45
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,389
-- It
-- doesn't exist. It's

46
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,059
404,

47
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,210
the web page

48
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,570
actually, right? I know the link you clicked because I found that link also.

49
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,929
But I'm going to,

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,880
I tell you now you can't load it and I'll explain why

51
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:28,600
after I set down my piece of paper out of arm's reach.

52
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,580
So basically, here's what this comes down to is I,

53
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:34,270
I did a bunch of research because I thought if we're going to talk about this,

54
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,080
I want to read it.

55
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,679
Right. Because obviously

56
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:39,750
everything I've read up to this point is like reporters or someone

57
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,889
else kind of regurgitating what it is and what it is.

58
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:42,669
And I'm thinking

59
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,779
I want to see it.

60
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:46,289
You, you can't, it doesn't exist.

61
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:47,759
And, and so what happened,

62
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,979
what they passed is Australia has a multitude of what

63
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,229
are essentially like telecommunications interception laws that date back.

64
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,690
I think the earliest one was 1901. If my mind is, is remembering correctly

65
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,179
and there's, there's like three or four of these

66
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,699
and they didn't pass a new bill.

67
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,389
What they did is they passed a bunch of amendments to all the old ones.

68
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,970
So we now need to wait for someone to basically take the old ones

69
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:14,130
and, you know,

70
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:17,759
conduct surgery on them saying here what the amendments make it look like now.

71
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,850
So, basically

72
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,130
this thing was passed and I guarantee nobody actually read the text.

73
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,889
They almost certainly were like, yeah, whatever passed, don't care.

74
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,449
Yeah,

75
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,300
I actually managed by using the search on their thing to finally

76
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,679
find a working link, that sort of.

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,050
-- But
-- it
-- doesn't,

78
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,630
it's massive and it's just

79
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,149
right.

80
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,149
It just talks about all the amendments to all the previous laws and it's,

81
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,229
it's not something that is helpful to anyone who probably isn't a lawyer

82
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,570
-- and getting paid a lot of money to actually go through
-- it.

83
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,070
You would need a team of lawyers for this.

84
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,679
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. One human couldn't do it. It's, it's huge.

85
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,660
So, anyway, why don't we sum up what we,

86
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,000
we have been told this thing is by many other people.

87
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,029
I think the premise of this is, is this is the reaction of, oh,

88
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,990
we can't legislate against encryption or we can't

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,789
legislate encryption to have a back door because

90
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:15,139
that's like literally all the encryption technologies we're working on.

91
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,019
Essentially we're at the point now where we've

92
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,510
kind of solved all the easy problems like,

93
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,119
oh whoops, you know, key lengths of six.

94
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,260
Yeah, they probably need to be longer than six.

95
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,529
you know,

96
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:28,299
or, you know, just all the simple problems have been solved.

97
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,399
And now we're looking at the problems where it's like, OK, well,

98
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,820
let's say now I have a state level actor with a quantum computer

99
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,149
and this is a real threat, right?

100
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,200
There's D wave out of Vancouver with their quantum computers there, you know,

101
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:39,670
these things are becoming real.

102
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,399
How do I, you know, encrypt something so that for example,

103
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,769
it can't be read for at least 100 years or maybe 1000 years or maybe forever, right?

104
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:51,459
So now we're addressing problems in crypto that are quite hard

105
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,260
and people are making progress. So

106
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,130
nobody's going to deploy a crypto system like the Clipper chip where it's like,

107
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,299
oh yeah, no, there's a government back door, but you can trust the government,

108
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:04,369
right? Ok. That's not going to work. But what can we do? Huh.

109
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,200
Well,

110
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,829
what if we mandate

111
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:10,269
much like wiretapping laws that people

112
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:15,075
put some sort of backdoor or assistance access

113
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:18,015
into their software or service so that, you know,

114
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:21,994
we can read Bob's telegrams or in this case his uh signal messages

115
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:25,535
or his whatsapp or whatever it is the kids are using nowadays.

116
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:27,315
Um So the premise being that, you know,

117
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:32,089
this way, we, for example, we know a bunch of bad guys are using, I'm,

118
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,529
I'm just going to pick on signal because I,

119
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,290
I love signal and I use it and I think everybody at this point

120
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,839
in the infosec industry uses signal and

121
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,109
likes it except it keeps getting terrible you

122
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:41,329
whatever.

123
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,329
Um

124
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,089
So, you know, we know a bunch of bad guys are using signal.

125
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,109
Well, we can't monitor what they're doing. But

126
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,730
what if you could compel signal to

127
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,690
create an update

128
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,170
that allows you, for example,

129
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:58,940
to geolocation target everybody in for the sake of argument,

130
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,410
Afghanistan and Pakistan

131
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,540
and read all their traffic or,

132
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:08,769
you know, everybody whose nickname falls into this list of shall we say, you know,

133
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,010
Middle Eastern style names, right?

134
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,309
And you could totally do that in software, right? This would actually not

135
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,850
be that difficult to do with

136
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,920
if everybody involved in that piece of software was on board with this, which

137
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,839
I can pretty much guarantee you with a piece of software like signal,

138
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,480
at least one of them is going to throw a tantrum and speak up.

139
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:29,920
-- So,
-- Signal would never go along with this, you

140
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,149
know, software isn't a S a

141
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,130
single developer anymore, right?

142
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,239
-- You got teams, you got Q A but, but
-- let's pick on someone like, like Facebook or,

143
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,394
or even Google.

144
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:39,415
Oh,

145
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,295
Facebook is a great example because they've done stuff

146
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:44,035
like this and explicitly made sure that their CSO

147
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:47,434
I forget what his position was that the Chief security officer, I think it was,

148
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:50,505
didn't know about this, you know, so he ended up leaving Facebook.

149
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:54,255
But yeah, so for example, Australia could use this to compel Facebook to say, look,

150
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:56,554
you know, everybody that's part of this Facebook group.

151
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,605
You know, we hate America death to infidels.

152
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:00,954
Uh You know, we'd like to see all the traffic, please.

153
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,515
Can you put that into your app or on the back end?

154
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,265
Can you start sending us those messages

155
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:06,760
on the back end?

156
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,600
It's probably not difficult for them, but Facebook's Messenger,

157
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,049
they own whatsapp, right?

158
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,059
And whatsapp does do end to end encryption.

159
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,679
And my understanding is they do it pretty well.

160
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,329
There is the danger.

161
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:20,799
Yeah.

162
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:25,089
Well, see, and the challenge is a lot of these apps do very good end to end encryption.

163
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:29,779
But I mean, I'm talking about a binary signal on my phone. How do I validate that?

164
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,359
You can't?

165
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,359
Exactly. So I really have to trust the app

166
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:34,839
maker

167
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:35,779
and the software

168
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,559
and from what it sounds like the, from what I've read

169
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,839
the,

170
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,019
the way this law works is they, there's a couple of things they could do,

171
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:48,679
they could compel a company to put in some sort of monitoring feature.

172
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, or an individual that's where it gets really gross.

173
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,040
-- Yeah.
-- And that's really weird.

174
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:57,619
And let's kind of set that aside for a minute just because it adds a lot of,

175
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,910
-- I think
-- that's a really big part of the problem.

176
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:02,109
It, it is. And we'll get to it though.

177
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:02,970
So

178
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,010
there's

179
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:09,850
the compelling an organization to kind of put in essentially like a way to monitor,

180
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,609
but there's also compelling an organization to kind of magically update

181
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,660
an app, someone might have.

182
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,390
And there seems to be a lot of focus on phones and mobile devices in this context

183
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:23,510
being

184
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,510
we're gonna, we're gonna compel Facebook to only send Kurt

185
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:35,989
a special update that is going to essentially redirect all of his traffic through,

186
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,989
say these servers over here.

187
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,419
And that's kind of a, that's super doable technically speaking.

188
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,500
But it's, it's also really, really questionable

189
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,559
right? From just a, a sanity standpoint.

190
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,440
-- Well, I mean,
-- this, this technology already exists in the form of,

191
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,679
I forget the name of it.

192
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,900
But, you know, it, it,

193
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,919
it would intercept your downloads in real time and inject malware into them,

194
00:08:59,109 --> 00:08:59,580
right.

195
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:03,280
So this technology, yeah, it was a few years ago, remember,

196
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,859
I think we talked about it on the show once.

197
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:05,570
Maybe not

198
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:06,669
anyway.

199
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,890
Um, but, you know,

200
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,010
essentially it's not hard if you can intercept a binary

201
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,940
in flight and add a bunch of code to it

202
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,659
like that. This is a well known problem in solution space

203
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,510
and, yeah, so they can't do that anymore because, you know,

204
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,270
pretty much everybody gets their updates,

205
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,309
hopefully at a minimum over HTTP S that's

206
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,770
hard to intercept and mangle and more ideally,

207
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:26,880
you know,

208
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,179
through some sort of app store that has a

209
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,429
bunch of other controls and protections to prevent,

210
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,630
well, this exact kind of shenanigan,

211
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,349
you know.

212
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:38,169
Ok, so, so let's, let's say we're just, we're getting angry and we should, but

213
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,989
let's move the conversation because I think let's face it

214
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,929
anyone. Like if you don't understand why the the technical

215
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,210
kind of aspect of this is bad,

216
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:51,200
just Google around for it and there's people way smarter than

217
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,650
us who have commented on like the silliness of this.

218
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:53,979
So,

219
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,210
but what I, what I really want to talk to is kind of the second order.

220
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,989
What happens next and this is where my,

221
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,030
my little flow chart comes in.

222
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:03,830
So I, I have

223
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,479
at the top I have what I've, I've the box,

224
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,729
I've titled Assistant Assistance and Access,

225
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:11,549
which is essentially this bill that was passed and,

226
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,690
and I have two possible routes that come from.

227
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,580
This number one

228
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,289
-- is nobody cares. Right.
-- That's a real possibility.

229
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:22,260
Oh, I, I have. Yes and yes, I need to fix it anyway. So nobody cares.

230
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,619
I, I'll, I'll leave it for the sake of posterity because it's amusing.

231
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,739
So, let's say nobody cares. This gets passed. Nobody gives two craps.

232
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,609
-- And that's just the way it is. Well,
-- it's, it's worse than that.

233
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:37,390
Nobody with the power to alter this cares and, and based on the fact that

234
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,969
that

235
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,309
there has been no, like

236
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:41,609
generally speaking,

237
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:43,979
everybody who's been consulted and asked about this

238
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:47,020
bill in technology said that's a terrible idea.

239
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:48,380
And they went ahead with it anyway.

240
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:50,969
But here's the point, right?

241
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:53,039
Let's say nobody cares, let's say nobody who,

242
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:56,880
who is in a position to do anything about it cares, right?

243
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:01,640
Uh What happens next? I have everyone else does this by everyone else.

244
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,190
I mean, like most of the other governments on the planet

245
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:05,250
because here's the thing

246
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:08,070
Australia is only 24 million people.

247
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,049
They would be the, the 22 million. Ok.

248
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:14,049
But they're like, they're, they're big but they're not enormous, right?

249
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:16,809
We have us states bigger than Australia by population.

250
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,409
-- Canada is bigger than Australia
-- 24.6 million. You are correct.

251
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:22,049
Ok. That's what I thought.

252
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:22,650
So anyway,

253
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:27,169
like the point is a company could exit this market and it would hurt a little bit,

254
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,369
but it's not going to end them.

255
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,729
Right? And so

256
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,549
so anyway, here, here's a point though,

257
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:37,580
is this is everyone else does this if nobody cares and I have, uh, if nobody cares, no,

258
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:38,570
like somebody cares.

259
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,510
And then I, I wrote people revolt and I don't mean,

260
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,030
like armed revolts in the street but rather, hopefully,

261
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,890
maybe people would stop voting for these clowns.

262
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,880
But the reality is,

263
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,890
I don't think that's going to happen because I don't think

264
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,039
enough people know enough or care enough to make that happen.

265
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:55,729
So, I'm, I'm pretty happy to say that's almost certainly not an option here.

266
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,479
Yeah,

267
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,349
it's,

268
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,820
yeah, I mean, it's one of those things where

269
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,750
-- there's
-- way bigger problems people don't care about, right.

270
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,599
Climate change is a way bigger problem and nobody cares.

271
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:10,190
-- Well,
-- climate change is an actual existential threat to our species and

272
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,940
this is, you know, kind of a major inconvenience and it's one of those like, well,

273
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,219
privacy is good.

274
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:16,900
We should

275
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,729
allow privacy and this messes it up. So,

276
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,390
yeah, we're not, we're not, we're not fixing this anyway. Anyway.

277
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,760
Let's move to the other side of my, my flow

278
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:29,739
chat now and I have a fight back. I mean, the company's fight back, right?

279
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,619
Like you've got your Googles and your Facebooks and Apples and whoever says like,

280
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,549
-- no way, yo,
-- let's be clear.

281
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,739
Are we talking about fighting back against the bill itself

282
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,219
or fighting back against being ordered to do this?

283
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,429
Because those are two very different things.

284
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:45,380
-- Uh being
-- fighting back against being ordered to do this, right?

285
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,890
The bill is passed like too late it's there. Right. So what now? OK.

286
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,820
So let's say a company, let's say

287
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:56,109
the, the government shows up and tells Apple you got to do this. And Apple's like,

288
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,700
OK.

289
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,340
Right.

290
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,179
If that happens now, we're back to,

291
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,179
nobody cares and we're back to everyone else does this, right?

292
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,659
No questions asked.

293
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,109
Now, let's say Apple says,

294
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,289
no way we won't do this.

295
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:08,570
And,

296
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,450
and the first thing that's going to happen is the government's going to sue them,

297
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:11,890
right?

298
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,289
And there's going to be some sort of court

299
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:15,890
case and somebody's probably gonna get in trouble and,

300
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,700
and but here's the thing, Apple might say, no,

301
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,530
the government could do nothing in

302
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,090
which case or business as usual.

303
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:26,929
Well, the thing is if this is all in secret, the government says to Apple, Apple says,

304
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,650
no, the government quietly goes on the way tries it with Google or with Facebook,

305
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:29,760
right?

306
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,239
They can keep trying it because an inherent part of this is that this, this is secret,

307
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,520
right?

308
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,309
This isn't like

309
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,539
a warrant in a public court filing saying, you know,

310
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:41,630
we we want to go kick down this guy's door and like look for drugs,

311
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,659
you know, this is something that's done in secret because by definition it,

312
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:46,200
you know, you can't have like,

313
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,380
they don't want to have some sort of piece of paper that says, hey,

314
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,140
we want Apple to do this to target this specific group of people,

315
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,799
right? Obviously, that kind of tips.

316
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:57,580
Yes. And that's the thing. Right? Is because of the secrecy.

317
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:02,950
I think there is a, a less than 0% chance that if Apple tells the,

318
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,409
the Australian government we won't do this, they just go away

319
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:10,710
because the problem is if there is a court case, court cases are public

320
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,340
and so the Australian government is going to have to give away.

321
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,840
That's fair.

322
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:19,489
-- I don't know how this intelligence stuff works
-- Well, in the US,

323
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,799
you have the secret courts, you know, for fisa warrants and stuff

324
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:23,320
and there have, you know,

325
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,440
the EFS has been embroiled in a bunch of court

326
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,559
cases where they can't really talk about what they're doing,

327
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:31,900
you know. Um, so no, there is a framework for essentially

328
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,270
court cases, you know, under,

329
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,380
under the guise of national security, which like, obviously,

330
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,270
the government would push for this to be covered under national security

331
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:44,030
and, and that's true. Ok. So let's say the government does bring it to court right

332
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:48,080
now, let's say if the government loses in court, we're back to business as usual,

333
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,309
right?

334
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,250
Where, yes, there's a law but it's unenforceable and nobody cares.

335
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,330
And, and that does happen,

336
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,190
which means they would have to go back and do some rewriting.

337
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,630
Ok.

338
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,530
Now, let's say the government wins.

339
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,809
All right. So now Apple kind of has two choices.

340
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:07,940
They can pull out of Australia and say we're not going to work with you people.

341
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,580
And again, 24 million people.

342
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,679
Like it's not, it, it might make their earnings dip a little bit,

343
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,919
but it's not going to end the company by any means.

344
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:18,219
-- I think
-- you would probably notice more if somebody sneezed on the earnings report.

345
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,090
Uh, maybe, maybe so. Here's the thing. If they pull out of Australia

346
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:25,989
businesses,

347
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,919
they don't care anymore.

348
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,760
What if the company comes back with? It's not technically feasible for us to do this.

349
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,299
It is technically feasible and they can make it work and everyone

350
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,299
knows that it's just not technically feasible to do it securely,

351
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:39,559
right?

352
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,059
We have to be very clear on that.

353
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,409
Well,

354
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:44,340
technically feasible because one thing the bill does

355
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:47,280
cover is you can't introduce systemic weaknesses.

356
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,739
So they kind of tried to cover that whole. Oh no, no, no, we're not talking about back

357
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:52,104
doors for everybody.

358
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:54,255
We're not going to allow systemic weaknesses,

359
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:57,174
although that's not defined in the bill anywhere we ignore that.

360
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,505
So they've kind of tried to make it more palatable and that, oh no,

361
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:02,025
this will only be used to target, you know,

362
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:04,984
specific people or individuals or groups or certain groups of like,

363
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:08,224
say all the men or all the women or everybody who's right-handed.

364
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:09,044
Um

365
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,585
But for example, like what if,

366
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,289
because a lot of companies, you know,

367
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,669
they don't just let a bunch of developers randomly like write code,

368
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,690
shove it into a binary and ship it out to people via the app store, right?

369
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,909
Most companies, I know of that size, you know,

370
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,280
you have a bunch of developers, they do a bunch of code

371
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,460
and then Q A yells at them because it breaks their task,

372
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,219
you know, or

373
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,130
in some cases we talked about this on the show, you know, that company,

374
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,929
I forget which one it was,

375
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,219
but they basically had parts of their code that were labeled

376
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:39,030
as security sensitive and got extra review whenever you touched it,

377
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:40,469
you know, by other people.

378
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,119
So for example, you know,

379
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,630
it's not like they're just going to monkey with the authentication

380
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,780
routine or with the key exchange routine and be like,

381
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:48,619
yeah, no, this is fine.

382
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,479
Don't worry about it

383
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:50,900
and ignore all these.

384
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,270
If l statements around, you know, whether or not the user is left handed,

385
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,250
the company would have to have the entire stack from developers to shipping it

386
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,289
in Australia for them to then be sort of legally compelled to do this.

387
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:07,050
If you have an organization like Apple, I'm assuming a lot of this is in the US

388
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:08,969
and that American

389
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:12,608
manager is probably going to push back hard and

390
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:12,729
Ame,

391
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,040
you know, Apple's headquartered in America's

392
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,449
in America rather, you know. So

393
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,739
I I find it difficult for this law to work with a company that's international

394
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,660
and most companies are international now.

395
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,150
Well,

396
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,599
but it doesn't matter if it's international or not

397
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,150
if you want to do business in Australia.

398
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,880
And the Australian government tells you you have to do this, you have to do it.

399
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,199
It doesn't matter where you live

400
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,339
and if an American,

401
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,010
-- I
-- won't play

402
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:37,790
with them,

403
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,619
they're gonna, well, that's right.

404
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,160
That's kind of how the flow chart works is if you play chicken,

405
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,229
-- like
-- Uber.

406
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:48,020
Uber has done this legal chicken with tons of governments and generally won.

407
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,119
So,

408
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,699
let's face it.

409
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:54,910
There's most of the governments have as much will to care as the people do to care,

410
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,310
I think is what it kind of comes down to at the end of the day.

411
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,280
And so anyway, we,

412
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,619
we're kind of at the end of the flow chart. Then

413
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,939
let's say Apple pulls out of Australia,

414
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,500
they win. Let's say they don't pull out of Australia.

415
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,030
Now,

416
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,060
they essentially are going to have to comply to this

417
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,410
after losing a court case and we're back to the point

418
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,290
-- of everyone else's
-- and I don't think Australia or Apple

419
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,420
would have to pull out of Australia just for example,

420
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,420
pull your deaf people out, continue doing sales and marketing there.

421
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,729
You think they're gonna let them sell stuff in

422
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:23,290
Australia if they're not complying with court orders.

423
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,160
-- No
-- way,

424
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,930
I suspect if there's one of the few

425
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,130
things governments could do with respect to technology that

426
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,069
would actually get people in the streets writing it

427
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,849
would be banning the sales of Apple products.

428
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,390
And you know,

429
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,560
that's actually a really good point is

430
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:38,459
if suddenly the iphone wasn't available in Australia

431
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:41,680
people would be pissed. Now, people care. Right.

432
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:44,040
That's what we need to do is we need to tell Apple, like when the,

433
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,739
when the world misses its carbon emissions targets,

434
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,619
like they need to stop selling iphones and then people would be like, holy crap,

435
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,709
everyone stop driving now.

436
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:54,739
Pretty much. Yeah.

437
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,300
Yeah.

438
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:57,420
That, that makes me sad.

439
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,420
Yeah, I, yeah. Humanity, man. We're a heck of a species.

440
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:04,540
-- If we
-- look at this flow chart in big picture mode, right?

441
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,020
There's kind of,

442
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:09,390
I have a suspicion if companies fight this,

443
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,369
a more things have to go right for

444
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,050
the Australian government to come out victorious from this

445
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:16,584
than do for the companies, right?

446
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:20,744
Like this is sort of, if a company decides to fight this, I think the, the,

447
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:26,984
the weight of, of being, how do I say this? Like, like I, I think just the,

448
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:29,444
they have to do a lot less work than the government does

449
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:32,104
to make this happen and I have a suspicion they care more.

450
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:33,824
So I, my guess

451
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,655
I'm gonna, I'm gonna put 50% odds

452
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,369
on companies like Apple Google and Facebook telling the government.

453
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,969
Nope, go away and I think they're going to end up going away is my guess.

454
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:45,290
Well,

455
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,910
there's one thing fundamentally about this law that is

456
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,579
pretty much at odds with all Western law,

457
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,479
which is, this is a law that doesn't forbid something,

458
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:56,949
this is a law which compels you to do something

459
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,910
this isn't us saying you can't do XY or Z or if you do XY or Z, we will punish you.

460
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,579
This is I am going to compel you

461
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,859
to,

462
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:07,949
you know,

463
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:10,089
do something to your software or something

464
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,109
to your business or something to your servers

465
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,729
that not only is going to potentially cost you a

466
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:17,510
lot of money and time and effort but is potentially,

467
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,939
you know, very dangerous and very, very bad.

468
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,839
And so the companies,

469
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,989
the thing is the companies, they don't even have to stop doing something,

470
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,579
they just have to not do what the government is asking them to do.

471
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,880
And

472
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,540
I feel like, you know, this is the difference for me between, you know,

473
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,209
when people talk about free speech,

474
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:37,459
we have generally agreed that the laws

475
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,010
saying things that you cannot say are in general for certain cases, ok,

476
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,989
like you can't yell fire in a crowded theater

477
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,060
and, you know, you,

478
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,969
you can't threaten somebody to their face with physical violence.

479
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,770
You know, that's, um I want to say that's,

480
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,130
is that assault or battery? Which one is the actual,

481
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,880
the one is the speaking and the one is the hitting, I forget,

482
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,920
I always get the two mixed up.

483
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,500
But anyways, the point is we've generally agreed that you can,

484
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,030
you can stop people from doing things.

485
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:02,810
And I,

486
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,790
I can't think of any really good examples

487
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,969
where we have compelled speech or compelled action.

488
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,989
You know, you must do this,

489
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,859
-- um,
-- there's, there's some of it in,

490
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:16,729
in like court cases where they can ask you questions and you might be under oath.

491
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,219
But, like, even in the United States,

492
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:20,670
we have the fifth amendment so you can escape it.

493
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:24,400
-- Yeah.
-- Well, the thing is those are very restricted cases,

494
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,839
right? Like by the time you're in a court of law under oath, like,

495
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,750
yeah, the, the, there's a process in the system, this isn't just, you know,

496
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,619
I mean, this is, you know, having compelled things like you must,

497
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,930
uh II I can't think of a good example

498
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:40,010
of a compelled action that actually makes any sense.

499
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,180
And that's one of the reasons we don't do these things.

500
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:42,849
Uh,

501
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:47,380
-- you probably have to listen to police officers.
-- That's a lawful order.

502
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:52,349
That's a different form, that's not a form of speech, that's a form of, um, yeah,

503
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,280
that's true.

504
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:54,040
That's fair.

505
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,640
You know, like we have laws that compel you to do things like stop at a red light.

506
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,760
But the inverse of that is what we're, well,

507
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,089
what we ultimately want is we want people to not proceed at red lights,

508
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:04,430
you know,

509
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:05,050
uh,

510
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,130
you know, we're not compelling you to stop per se.

511
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,510
It's just we really need you to not go past that red light because

512
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,400
the people with the green cross traffic lights are

513
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:14,839
not expecting that,

514
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,890
right. So

515
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,989
even in the cases where we sort of have a compelled behavior,

516
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,949
it's typically balanced by like,

517
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:24,079
because we're compelling this behavior because it balances out this

518
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:26,189
other behavior that we really need to not happen.

519
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:27,949
And in this case

520
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,430
that, that I don't see that balance.

521
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,079
I, yeah, I mean, I,

522
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:34,589
-- I agree
-- and obviously the government disagrees

523
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,959
with me because they passed this law.

524
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,239
You know, they're like, well, we want to be able to monitor these people.

525
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,750
So we think we should be able to compel a software firm to,

526
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:42,189
you know,

527
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:44,979
ship an update to a specific person that compromises the security

528
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,010
of the app and their communication so we can monitor it.

529
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,589
Right. Well, and you know what else?

530
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,989
I mean, technically speaking, the thing I love the most is

531
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,189
people who are legitimate criminals.

532
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:58,400
Now, I, I'll also fill it in with like most criminals are idiots.

533
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,750
I mean, that's just the reality of it, but like people who are actually smart,

534
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,599
good criminals,

535
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:03,780
they're gonna know

536
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,140
which apps do and don't fall under this jurisdiction, right?

537
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,699
And they're like,

538
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:10,219
like signal probably doesn't have a presence in

539
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:12,130
Australia if they have any developers there,

540
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,439
like

541
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:15,900
that person's either gonna move or they're not going to work there much longer.

542
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,060
Right. And, and

543
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,859
like,

544
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,819
there's nothing you can do about that, right. You've already lost. There is

545
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:27,010
just the technical stupidity here is maddening.

546
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,209
Well, that's, and I think that,

547
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:30,989
that this comes back to something we were talking about before the show, which is,

548
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,520
I think most of these lawmakers

549
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,150
don't understand how international businesses nowadays,

550
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,189
you know, I work for a relatively quote unquote small organization,

551
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:41,199
you know, the cloud security lines and,

552
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,250
but we have,

553
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:44,790
we have permanent offices in three countries.

554
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,099
You know,

555
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:49,709
we have people across over a dozen countries and we're,

556
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,780
you know, we're less than 100 people and this is just, this is normal.

557
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,219
It, it totally is.

558
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,579
Right. Look at ala, like you work for Elastic.

559
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:59,300
How many countries do you guys have offices in?

560
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,089
Oh, man, we're like, almost completely remote as an organization.

561
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:06,790
We're very, very remote friendly and we have people, I mean, ignoring offices,

562
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,030
we just have people in,

563
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,449
pick a country. If it has internet, we probably have someone there.

564
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:14,369
I mean, that's just the reality of it.

565
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,989
Like, I think Red Hat was up to 100 and 60 countries or something.

566
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,709
I'd be shocked if that's all it was.

567
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,530
-- I mean, yeah, basically any country,
-- well, there's only like 100 and 84 countries.

568
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:27,709
I think the 20 don't have internet.

569
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,530
There's a handful that are on a list of, like, you can't do business here. Right.

570
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,280
So, between, like, lack of electricity and don't do business here. A man.

571
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,069
That's not even true. Like,

572
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:43,069
I know people who have been to what, what we would define as, like a remote country

573
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,219
and they still have freaking cell phones. Like, it's,

574
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,869
-- everyone has internet.
-- This is what part of it is.

575
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,180
They don't understand is I think they're looking at this from the perspective of,

576
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:56,810
oh, a company located in Australia doing business with Australians.

577
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,739
Those companies don't really

578
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,719
exist in the tech world because let's face it.

579
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:03,609
If you build something technology wise,

580
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,800
you absolutely want to sell it also outside of your country.

581
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,760
Well, sure where the market is like 90% of the rest of the world,

582
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,119
like you said, Australia, 24.6 million people, you know, Canada,

583
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,625
50% bigger

584
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:19,074
America is what? 300

585
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:20,545
I'm

586
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:23,494
-- spacing out three
-- 100 million in change, right?

587
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,285
330

588
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:27,594
-- something.
-- It's more than 10 times the size of Australia.

589
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:31,594
Yeah. And then the European Union, if memory serves as what, 370 or something

590
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,290
like give or take, so it's comparable to the US,

591
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,459
it's bigger than the U SI know that but not much bigger.

592
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,060
But anyways,

593
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,949
-- yeah, whatever.
-- So

594
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,689
I think

595
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,160
they, they've, they've also not realized that

596
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:47,829
the majority of tech companies in Australia are not just in Australia from

597
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,930
the perspective of like where they build their software and how it gets built

598
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,520
to think like the biggest tech company in Australia

599
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,750
today is probably Atlassian that's like based in Australia.

600
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,130
And I'll tell you what man,

601
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,670
if, if I was an Atlassian customer,

602
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,069
I would be saying,

603
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,589
-- what are we going to do about this?
-- Right?

604
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,630
I am an Atlassian customer and to be quite honest,

605
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,989
I I need to send in a support ticket today to ask them about this

606
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,420
because this is a

607
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,619
concern.

608
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,449
I mean, I don't see that, you know, I'm not concerned about us being monitored per se,

609
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:22,969
but I am concerned about their, their cloud hosting solution, you know,

610
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:27,609
having its security go wonky because they're compelled to do silly things

611
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:29,310
and that impacting me.

612
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,010
That's, I'm, you know, I'm worried about the fallout from this.

613
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,339
Um,

614
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,369
and it sucks to be them because I know they're not evil and I know they're, you know,

615
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,770
-- they don't obviously
-- want any part of this company.

616
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,739
I'm sorry,

617
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:44,930
on my short list of companies I'm willing to work for. Right.

618
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,449
Yeah. Well, they're like a supplier.

619
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,589
So, like, clearly I'm, you know, they're decent

620
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,439
and, um, but at the same time it's kind of like, you know, guys, like,

621
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,089
it's nothing personal but man, your government screwed up on Friday.

622
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,079
You know, I don't know how to put it

623
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:01,369
and, and at the same time it's like you said,

624
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:05,180
the, the, the people who actually passed this law are, are

625
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,410
probably, I mean, let's face it. They're old white men primarily

626
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,689
-- and they don't care and they don't have to care.
-- Oh, Atlassian revenue,

627
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:19,750
619.9 million as of July 2017. That's a solid number. That's respectable.

628
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,790
And, yeah, and it sucks because I really do like their software. But at the same time,

629
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,189
you know,

630
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:25,400
I have to answer to my CEO who's

631
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,989
gonna have probably some pointed questions about this

632
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:31,290
because I mean, like I said, this is a form of law that is just

633
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,380
egregious.

634
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,109
Yeah.

635
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:33,709
Yeah.

636
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,560
And, and I mean, ignoring the technical aspect of it,

637
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:39,219
just II I have a feeling that the social aspect

638
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:43,349
of this is going to be detrimental to the Australia.

639
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,329
Well, I shouldn't say that

640
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:44,459
I,

641
00:27:44,469 --> 00:27:47,479
-- I have a feeling
-- you said you were reading reddit and

642
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,739
Australian developers are already looking to pull out because I mean,

643
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,780
especially if I was a security developer,

644
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,219
I can't trust you.

645
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,459
And again, it's nothing personal.

646
00:27:56,469 --> 00:28:00,449
It's just for all I know your government has compelled you or will compel you.

647
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,400
You could be the best software developer in the world but

648
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,040
nothing personal. It's your government man.

649
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:09,209
That's a hugely, it's hugely problematic.

650
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:10,939
And I mean, you know,

651
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:13,119
Australia is very similar to Canada in that

652
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,040
they have a very resource extraction intensive economy

653
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,719
and they have like Canada

654
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,939
seriously failed to diversify

655
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:24,900
with respect to say manufacturing tech and other sectors. You know,

656
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,359
it's hard to do. I mean, I get it.

657
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,180
We, you know, like you look at a country like Germany, right?

658
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:32,660
And just their, their export is amazing.

659
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:34,140
So you know,

660
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,219
the

661
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:38,140
this is not helpful to your tech industry.

662
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,540
This is quite,

663
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:41,880
I I literally can't imagine pretty much anything

664
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,699
worse than this because here's the problem.

665
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:46,680
Not only is this law bad, but it is highly uncertain,

666
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:47,540
right?

667
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,599
If you pass a bad law that is clear and simple and like, OK, you know, we can't, you,

668
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:52,839
you can't export,

669
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:57,180
you can't export 64 bit binner from Australia anymore. Just 32 bit binders.

670
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:58,930
It'd be like, well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,

671
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,199
but at least I know what the law is and what it

672
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,550
means and I can start dealing with it.

673
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,319
This law has too many unknowns like looking at your flow chart, right?

674
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:07,819
It's like,

675
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,910
can we legally fight back because inherent in these things

676
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,400
is sort of a in an an inbuilt gig order?

677
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,290
So can you even talk to your lawyer about it?

678
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:19,079
-- Uh
-- Probably not. That's how this usually goes.

679
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:21,630
So then do we end up with somebody trying to

680
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,290
file a court case without a lawyer saying your honor?

681
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,310
I'd like to file a court case so that I could talk to my

682
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,949
lawyer about something in confidence and the judge is going to be like,

683
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,390
what in the heck is going on,

684
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:33,459
you know, and rightly, so I'd be very confused as well.

685
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:37,260
So step one would be legally, can I even talk to my lawyer about this? Step two? OK.

686
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,329
I've talked to my lawyer, what is,

687
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,449
what do they say?

688
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:41,060
And then, you know,

689
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:43,369
can you actually take the government to court about this

690
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:46,290
and that'll probably have to happen in secret and then,

691
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,089
you know, it's just,

692
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,170
it's just the level of uncertainty and doubt and,

693
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,650
and unknown

694
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,209
problems.

695
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,150
Yeah, I personally,

696
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,609
uh if I was a large multinational,

697
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:01,760
I would be very apologetic to my Australian developers, but I would put them in a,

698
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,489
in a fenced lot.

699
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,449
Like I would really fence them off from everything else

700
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:07,739
because again,

701
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,579
we can't trust you to touch stuff because you might be compelled to put holes in it.

702
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,300
-- Which
-- is crazy.

703
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,839
Right. But if the,

704
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:17,910
yeah, just anyway, I, I feel like

705
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,459
this is

706
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:24,380
ignoring the technical problems. This is going to be an economic travesty.

707
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,579
Well, ok, I shouldn't say that

708
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,660
I have a suspicion. There's going to be

709
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,780
-- in
-- a few years. It might

710
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,160
be

711
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:32,510
to it where it's going to take time and it's also going to be,

712
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,979
people are going to see what the government does here because like I said,

713
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:37,900
in that flow chart, if the government ends up not pushing on this hard,

714
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,910
-- no one will really care
-- as far as I know from what they passed.

715
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,810
There's no reporting requirement for them to say, oh,

716
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:44,380
we used this 10 times last year.

717
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,859
So we have no idea if they used it.

718
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:50,439
-- 01 or 1000
-- we'll never know what, what we're gonna have to watch is.

719
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:54,449
We're going to have to watch companies like Facebook and Google and Apple

720
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:59,310
and Microsoft and see how they're acting because they're never going to tell us

721
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,199
if this law is or isn't being used. And is, or isn't affecting what they do.

722
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:09,800
But I think their actions are going to tell us a lot about what's actually happening

723
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,020
because let's face it if,

724
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,339
like apple suddenly drastically changes the way they do business in Australia,

725
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,089
this is probably why.

726
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,260
Right.

727
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,599
And I have a very strong feeling

728
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:24,000
they aren't going to do anything unless they have to. Right.

729
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,069
They're not going to be proactive, they're going to wait till they end up, you know,

730
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,910
staring down the end of a court order.

731
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,520
Well, I think there will be some procedural changes

732
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,959
like literally having traffic routed from Australia

733
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:36,939
through an American server back to Australia.

734
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:37,709
So that, you know,

735
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,099
the whole DEV process doesn't occur in Australia, right?

736
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,670
So there's that balance and check.

737
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,569
Uh, maybe, well,

738
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:47,119
Github's probably hosted in America,

739
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:51,170
but not like we're, we're not much better. But anyway.

740
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,729
All right, we should, we should end this, I guess, let's say,

741
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:55,359
let's say you're a betting man, Kurt,

742
00:31:55,469 --> 00:31:55,810
if,

743
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,530
if you were going to put the money on the

744
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,650
table and say this is definitely happening or not happening.

745
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,540
What, what do you think?

746
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,770
I'm a pessimist and I think that we will essentially end up with

747
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,010
II, I don't think this law is going to go away.

748
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,300
Uh That's fair.

749
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,859
I'm gonna guess 30% odds of this actually being a thing,

750
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:16,020
70% it just fizzles and never really goes anywhere because it's,

751
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,660
it's Australia isn't big enough to affect the kind of change

752
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:22,420
that, that you'd really need to, to compel these companies.

753
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,619
Well, and the other thing is too, the,

754
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,790
the smart companies can architect around this

755
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,500
and then play legal chicken with the government

756
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,819
and they just have to drag it up slowly

757
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:32,449
and that's, that's

758
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:35,199
true, you know, and I suspect that's what will happen.

759
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:38,000
Awesome. Well, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
