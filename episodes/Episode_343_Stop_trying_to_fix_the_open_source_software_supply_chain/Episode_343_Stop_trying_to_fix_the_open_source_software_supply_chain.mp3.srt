Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

1
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,819
Kurt Siefried and my partner and being slightly sick but not entirely sick,

2
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:13,500
Josh Bresser,

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,209
I'm not sick anymore. I mean, maybe, I don't know. I feel pretty good.

4
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,700
I can't complain. It is amusing though because Kurt knows this, but no one else does.

5
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:22,870
After we hit stop last week,

6
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:26,379
I became violently ill for 24 hours to the point.

7
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:32,098
Like I, I just mumbled incoherently in, in bed. So I'm, I'm standing up again.

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,889
It's quite nice.

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,439
But anyway, anyway,

10
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,650
my kids brought home something from school.

11
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:38,020
That's how it works, man.

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,349
That's part of the fun,

13
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:43,680
I guess, ironically, in this particular instance, it seems I, I was patient. Zero.

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,299
So I got to get my kids sick finally for once.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,619
Anyway, I don't think I've ever done that.

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,319
-- I bet you have.
-- You just don't know it.

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,139
One of my,

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,450
one of my core memories of my Children when they were

19
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:56,330
small was Felix looking up at my face with love.

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,740
He's about 34 years old.

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm reading him a story and he just looks at my face with love coughs into my throat,

22
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,589
like, and I can feel it hit the back of my throat and I'm just, like,

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,919
oh,

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,040
and then, like, yeah, 24 hours later it's like, I don't feel so good.

25
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:14,849
Yeah. Yeah, we've all been there. It's the joy

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,879
of parenthood. Anyway. Anyway, we're going to talk about something better.

27
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:21,129
Well, this is basically the topic at hand is the so

28
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,440
called supply chains

29
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:23,349
where

30
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,870
I, you know, these companies are, like,

31
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,150
you make a software component that we use and we need you to fix it and update it

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,669
and keep it secure and enable two fa on your account and do a bunch of other stuff.

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,910
And like Google wrote a blog posting where they

34
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,870
were even proposing that for the critical software components

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,459
that,

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,449
that you could not be anonymous. Like

37
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:41,419
you have to

38
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:41,760
hold

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:41,989
on

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,230
-- just all sorts of insanity.
-- I know, I know, OK, let's back this up all the way.

41
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,980
There is a, a person who is, I'm, I apologize for butchering your name,

42
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:52,760
but I believe it's

43
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:53,669
Iana

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,610
at a on, I can't pronounce the last name,

45
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:00,430
but they wrote a blog post and there will be links in the show notes,

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,459
obviously that says there is no software supply chain

47
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,160
and they put software supply chain in quotes.

48
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:08,550
And then this person goes on to just kind of lay out

49
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,970
some of their grievances with what we're currently calling.

50
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:15,509
And like, obviously, Kurt and I talk about the software supply chain constantly.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,589
But, but basically talking about that

52
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,429
the, the software supply chain

53
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:23,160
as defined today is really these kind

54
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,889
of large corporations strip mining open source,

55
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:27,470
we'll say,

56
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,589
versus the developers who are doing this for fun and it's something they want to do.

57
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:35,869
And obviously these two groups have we say

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,789
-- opposing viewpoints and goals,
-- well, incentives.

59
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:42,070
And so to be clear, there is a commercial

60
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,580
software supply chain, like for example, Wolf Ssl.

61
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:46,110
Right.

62
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,279
Yeah.

63
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,190
Oh Right.

64
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,410
Oh What was it? It was like an HTML to PDF converter that was commercial.

65
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,490
And you know, anyways, the point is though

66
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:55,039
when you compare that

67
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:56,800
to the open source market,

68
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,990
it's like comparing an apple to one of those Maersk container ships.

69
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,949
You know what I mean? Like in that they both exist, but one is

70
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:10,960
just multiple, multiple, multiple scales larger and more widely used.

71
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,440
And I think that's part of the challenges people are

72
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:17,110
conflating the commercial supply chain with the open source supply chain

73
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:20,809
and the open source supply chain is vastly huger and

74
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,740
totally different set of rules

75
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:24,039
like literally

76
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,300
in the licenses.

77
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:27,210
And I think

78
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,539
a lot of the corporations using open source are

79
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:38,770
will say expecting the same things from open source you might expect from

80
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,850
working with

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,210
-- a company.
-- Well, and I think it's worse because they look at the open source world

82
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,660
and they see that the majority of people

83
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,440
have been treated quite well by their supply chain

84
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:53,539
but I think they forget that it was people being treated well by the supply chain,

85
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,389
not large companies that were strip mining it, right?

86
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,729
Like there's a vast difference,

87
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,860
you know, if me or Josh goes to some open source developer, like, hey, you know,

88
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:02,639
we like, oh man, like this would be a killer feature.

89
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:03,809
Could you maybe implement it

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,389
or, you know, hey, I found this bug and I think this patch might work,

91
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,059
but it's not great.

92
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,100
I don't really understand the code too well, you know,

93
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,940
when you're dealing with a human like that, it's, you know, it's like,

94
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,589
oh, I'm at a stoplight the other day and I like, look over and I'm like,

95
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,178
I start shouting at the guy. I'm like, hey buddy, buddy and he's like, what?

96
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,238
And I'm like your car is leaking like straight up.

97
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,339
There's like something leaking from the bottom of your car.

98
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,440
I can't see what color it is

99
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,220
but like, I know that that part of your car shouldn't be dripping like that.

100
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,640
And he's like, 00, thank you.

101
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,380
You know, like humans want to help each other,

102
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:35,059
right? That's how it works. Like, oh, Josh, you dropped your wallet. Here you go.

103
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,029
You know, I even left the money in it for you,

104
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,079
right?

105
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,239
But you know, when it comes to a large company, it's like

106
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,380
no man, like I'm not gonna go out of my way to, you know,

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,579
do what they want me to do for them for free.

108
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,059
Well, ok, I, and I can't be sure their expectations are insane

109
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:53,339
in

110
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:53,660
many,

111
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,649
a lot of times they are. But, ok,

112
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,000
let's reframe this a little bit before we just go on this big ranting binge

113
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,420
against giant corporations.

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,959
So if we look at this blog post,

115
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,500
there's a couple of things in it that I think really stand out that, that I like a lot.

116
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:10,579
And

117
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:14,579
one of them, I think the most interesting one is

118
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,619
there was a security advisory

119
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,140
github released

120
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,739
that was, it's titled ant C underscore term is unmaintained.

121
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,390
And this is a a rust package that apparently hasn't been updated in three years.

122
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,589
And the author basically said like this isn't maintained and then

123
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,320
it looks like someone submitted a security advisory to github,

124
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:35,760
github

125
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,880
published the security advisor. He did not get a CV ID, just a GHS A ID

126
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,089
and then

127
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,859
it was retracted

128
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,750
some period of time later

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,309
because people kind of freaked out a little bit because kind of, I mean,

130
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,179
one of the questions becomes like, is that a security issue if a,

131
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,579
an open source package is no longer maintained?

132
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,619
I mean, that's a harder question.

133
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,670
This speaks to what the GSD is doing, which is, is it a vulnerability?

134
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,570
No.

135
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,549
Is it a security concern?

136
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,350
Yes.

137
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,040
And there's a difference there, you know, like I would love like,

138
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:13,130
because I do this all the time I go and I look for a package I need to do something.

139
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,760
Um For example, I need like

140
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,239
uh 01 thing I need right now is a Yaml to

141
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,079
Json converter.

142
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,619
And so I go looking for them and you know,

143
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,950
I look in pi pie and I look in a bunch of

144
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,589
other places and it turns out that there aren't really aren't many.

145
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,119
So a better example would be oh

146
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,950
json

147
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,570
um merge, I need a thing to merge Json files. And so I look at pi pie

148
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:33,420
and there's like a bunch of them.

149
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:35,850
And so I start looking at kind of like, well, how much are they, you know,

150
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,070
how many releases have they had?

151
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,420
Oh, this one's like a 0.002.

152
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,290
This one's like 1.3 0.0

153
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,089
and then I also look at like, when's the last release date,

154
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,019
you know.

155
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:50,000
And so a perfect example of this is um oh, I was looking for ac pe library to, you know,

156
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,359
process C pe strings.

157
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,670
-- You
-- just talked about that last week,

158
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:52,829
you can

159
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:52,970
tell

160
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,420
the last ones from 2016. But that's OK because C pe is from 2011

161
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,529
and that's the thing. So,

162
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,100
you know, I'm, I'm trying to find healthy maintained software

163
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,989
mostly because I'll find a bug in it.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,420
I would like to have somebody that I can maybe ask nicely to

165
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,309
fix it

166
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,010
versus, you know, an unmaintained library where OK. Now it's my problem

167
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:13,750
OK.

168
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,440
So I think you accidentally hit on an important point with that statement is

169
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,899
you

170
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,589
Kurt, the developer

171
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:23,829
kind of have an idea of what to look for in

172
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,019
the open source world where you're looking at a library,

173
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,230
you're understanding what's in it, you're making informed decisions.

174
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:32,190
But you also, you have a great deal of knowledge about open source.

175
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,440
If you are someone, let's say who doesn't necessarily know a ton about open source,

176
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,739
you're just gonna start pulling in stuff that does what

177
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,079
you need and you're not gonna necessarily pay attention.

178
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:42,720
And I think

179
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:47,829
this is part of where the supply chain story starts to collapse a little bit.

180
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,920
I think in the open source world is these companies, I think

181
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,820
were just pulling stuff in for a long time with no regard for what it was.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,470
And all of a sudden they figure out, oh, holy cow, what am I doing?

183
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,950
And instead of looking inward

184
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:08,559
and saying, let's figure out what happened, let's figure out how to solve this.

185
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,869
They say open source, why did you make me hit myself?

186
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,220
Well,

187
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,679
and it's worse than that and that they pull the

188
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,989
first library that kind of does what they want and then

189
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,980
quite often they'll encounter like, oh,

190
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:21,070
it doesn't do everything we want like it does 90% of what we want.

191
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,700
I need this fixed,

192
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,670
right? Like or there's a security flaw.

193
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,510
And the other thing is I the supply chain

194
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:33,929
-- metaphor implies contracts.
-- I mean, well, business relationships do. Sure.

195
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,330
And the thing is you can't

196
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,280
really have that in the open source world with random open source does because

197
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,780
this is what drives me nuts is for a contract to exist.

198
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,270
There has to be an intention to contract, right?

199
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,049
There has to be an offer to contract, an acceptance of that offer

200
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,609
and a consideration

201
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:50,429
and there is no consideration ever in this

202
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,780
license. No, no

203
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,789
said this so

204
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,460
-- provided as is
-- but, but if you look at contract law,

205
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,169
there's no consideration. There is no,

206
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,080
there's nothing coming back from that company back to the open source developer.

207
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,229
So in in my mind, the open source developer is completely

208
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:07,690
blameless

209
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,030
because like, I mean, if I publish it,

210
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,429
like I literally have written crap Python scripts that I, I just chuck onto my github

211
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,599
publicly under, you know, the Apache 2.0 license

212
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:19,270
and like

213
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,539
in theory, some company could download this and start using it and relying on it

214
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,080
and then get angry at me when it doesn't do what they want. And I'm like, well, no,

215
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:28,900
too bad.

216
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,940
Well, OK, but, but no one cares. OK?

217
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,719
I I think that comes to the second part of this is your,

218
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,020
you're personifying some of these companies and some of

219
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,320
the companies are good about getting involved in being,

220
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,140
you know, stewards of open source and some of them are just like,

221
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,809
I'm gonna file a bunch of issues and complain constantly about the free stuff,

222
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,340
networking.

223
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,119
But

224
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,919
there is as part of this

225
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,669
blog post there, Google wrote a thing in February of 2021.

226
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,010
It's called known comma Prevent Comma Fix a framework

227
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,369
for shifting the discussion around vulnerabilities and open source.

228
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,659
And it lays out kind of a lot about the, we'll say the problems with open source which,

229
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,520
-- well, it takes a very corporate approach to
-- this. It takes a very Google approach.

230
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,830
Like

231
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,690
it,

232
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,710
it talks a lot about all of these expectations around open source and

233
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:23,900
things like you said at the beginning about you can't be anonymous and

234
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:27,070
you need to be using single sign on and you need to have

235
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,549
multiple sign offs on commits and you need to have vulnerability databases and

236
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:35,630
how does that work with those single developer projects?

237
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,659
Well, and, and that's just it, right? This, this casts all of open source

238
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:41,534
into

239
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,255
the

240
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,934
the play doh mold

241
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:48,335
that Google wants it to have. And I mean, this is Google has always done this right?

242
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:49,875
Where Google is a giant company.

243
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:55,934
They, they live in Google land where they can do things like zero trust correctly

244
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:59,255
because they have more security people than you have employees.

245
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:02,354
They have vending machines with like spare parts for your computer that

246
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:04,375
you can just walk down the hall and grab a new mouse

247
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,190
because it's cheaper to do it that way, right?

248
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,539
And that's just it though, like,

249
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,010
I think Google doesn't always see the world the way a lot of other people do.

250
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,630
And if you're, if you're a single open source person,

251
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,159
the world you live in is not the world Google lives in for the most part.

252
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,450
And, and I think

253
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:26,099
this is true of many large corporations is when you are part of a big company,

254
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,210
you exist in a very different space than when you're say

255
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:31,359
part of a start up or if you're one person.

256
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:31,650
And

257
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,750
I think

258
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:36,340
this is something that's often forgotten when we talk about like supply chain.

259
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:36,500
I mean,

260
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,580
I even see this like at the open SSF where we have all these people talking about, oh,

261
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:44,409
we need to have metrics on what healthy open sources

262
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:45,739
and it needs all these things and it's like,

263
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,580
hold on

264
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:50,940
who's gonna pay for any of this stuff. And it's like,

265
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,140
that's,

266
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:56,080
it's just not practical in many instances to expect

267
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,539
the open source universe to take this work on.

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,469
And kind of not now, I will say as well.

269
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,159
Like before I, I finish bashing Google,

270
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,690
Google has been a very good steward of open source

271
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,739
and they've dedicated enormous resources to the open source world.

272
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,460
So I think they're an instance of

273
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,900
they have these high expectations

274
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,979
and they will actually like send people

275
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:18,809
to help critical projects reach those expectations.

276
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,539
-- And that is the right way to do
-- this.

277
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:23,280
Part of the problem is Google has their view of the world

278
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:27,059
and they forget basics like you and I forget that most people don't

279
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,619
have taps that you just turn on and clean water comes out.

280
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:30,289
Well, that's,

281
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,820
that's maybe a bad example. This just came up this morning

282
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:37,750
when I was talking to someone where I made the comment off offhandedly.

283
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Oh, s bombs are everywhere and he's like, no,

284
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:41,299
no, they're not.

285
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:44,255
S bombs are ever where for people like us

286
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,505
because that's literally what we do for work.

287
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:47,895
Everyone else.

288
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:49,224
They don't even know what an S

289
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,294
bomb is.

290
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,414
And it's funny because sometimes we get trapped in these bubbles

291
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,934
and this is even true of like supply chain security,

292
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:56,734
which

293
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:57,054
I, I,

294
00:12:57,065 --> 00:13:00,455
I'm around all the time and you'd swear it's the most important

295
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,054
thing in the world and the company is working on it.

296
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:04,054
How could everyone not know who they are?

297
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:08,005
And the reality is the vast majority of developers don't know, don't care whatever,

298
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:08,434
you know,

299
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:10,794
and I'm done, you know, that's, and I don't blame them.

300
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,489
So, and the other thing is like, well, for example,

301
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,659
your metrics thing is hard because like I remember auditing some software from

302
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,469
a company that Red Hat acquired it was a Rails uh platform.

303
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,580
And for example,

304
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,340
they were using some libraries that were like horrifically out of date.

305
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:26,750
Like I remember there was this one library

306
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,429
that was like seven or eight years out of date

307
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,979
and it was called American Date and it literally converted

308
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,260
date strings

309
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:33,419
to month date, year

310
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,609
and it was like, 1020 lines long.

311
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,090
And I'm like, I looked at it and I'm like, nope, that's fine.

312
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:40,440
Like, it's, it's seven years out of date. But it's like,

313
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:44,349
it literally converts this to the stupid American Date format.

314
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,650
That's it. It's,

315
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,530
it's done,

316
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,630
like, there will never be an update for this library.

317
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,260
Yeah, exactly.

318
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,229
You know,

319
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,270
with the worst feature ever.

320
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,909
And so that's the thing, right.

321
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,229
In that case, well, that's an old library, unmaintained. Nobody cares about it,

322
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:04,390
-- but it's fine. I
-- mean, it probably is, but that's, that's a corner case.

323
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,400
That's my point.

324
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:09,770
That process is not sustainable. That process takes one or two hours

325
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:13,159
and if you're pulling in 1000 dependencies and you do the math.

326
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,419
Well, you better hire some more people. See.

327
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,320
And that's just, it's not sustainable and nobody cares,

328
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,159
nobody cares.

329
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:24,080
I think this is one of the important things we forget about insecurity sometimes is

330
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:27,849
we make these big deals about certain things that will say, oh,

331
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:31,250
you need to be logging this or you need to have single sign on there,

332
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,210
you need to be doing this secure thing and you need to

333
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:36,119
be watching vulnerabilities in your products and all of this stuff.

334
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,940
And the reality is if you look at

335
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,059
an enormous amount of the way the business world works.

336
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,250
That's a simple question.

337
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:46,950
If I do this how much does it cost if I don't do this? How much does it cost?

338
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,130
Well, how much does it make me?

339
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,039
Well, sure. I mean, that, that's fair.

340
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,950
-- That's, that could be a better way to look at it.
-- Like I want to make money.

341
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,119
If I do this, will it make me money or significantly save me money or something?

342
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,869
And this, this whole supply chain thing,

343
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,150
you know what it really reminds me of is like,

344
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,960
you have a company that takes pictures of houses and sells them

345
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,349
and they're going to people being like, can you please clean up your front yard?

346
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:09,500
-- I want to take a picture of your house. I mean,
-- that's probably a fair explanation

347
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,979
and, and some people might say, oh,

348
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,419
you're taking a picture of my house. I better clean up my yard

349
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,820
and other people are going to be like f you, I'm not cleaning up my yard.

350
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,609
Yeah, it's actually sad.

351
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,580
I just thought my lawn service sent me a picture of my front yard and it's like, oh,

352
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,369
it looks really bad right now.

353
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,409
They're like, you need to water it. And I'm like, nope,

354
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,289
I'm planning clover next year. I'm getting rid of the grass

355
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,330
I have.

356
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:32,419
So it's funny,

357
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,219
my, my yard

358
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:39,359
I've given up on and I mow it and it's, it's full of weeds and grass and whatever. I mow.

359
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:43,140
It, it looks fine and it's funny because, yeah, when, when it gets really dry,

360
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,140
everyone else's grass starts to die and mine looks fine and, and it's because I was,

361
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,619
I was watching a TV show

362
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:53,690
and they were talking about like new grass they're growing in Illinois, which is,

363
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,460
you know, south of me and it does get very dry in the summers.

364
00:15:56,469 --> 00:16:00,140
And they were basically saying, like, by planting clover in the yard,

365
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,640
it needs like, 60% less water. And I thought, well, that's neat.

366
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,049
My yard is full of clover and I keep

367
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:06,164
ordering it every year.

368
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,525
So I just quit putting chemicals on my lawn and yeah, it's like, it's perfect.

369
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:10,054
I love it.

370
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:10,974
Yeah. No, I'm done.

371
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:11,445
Well.

372
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:15,265
It's just, I, I live in a, in an area of the country which is basically the,

373
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,734
all of the country that like the grass we plant here is not at all native

374
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,515
or even remotely suitable for this climate,

375
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:23,815
you know, anyways. But

376
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:25,554
going back to this, like, it just,

377
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:26,934
the problem is

378
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,429
the ship sailed in that there is open source

379
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,570
in everything and it's like so much open source,

380
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,280
we can't walk it back

381
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,320
like we just can't, and we can't walk the process of this back.

382
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,280
Like there is no alternative for these companies anymore.

383
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,000
Like

384
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:43,359
I need to put

385
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:48,590
some device on the internet. So, like go grab Linux

386
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,219
because anything else costs money or is too heavyweights. That's it.

387
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,729
Ok. I have a,

388
00:16:54,969 --> 00:16:58,349
a different way to look at this. I think

389
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:01,239
you are correct that there's no walking this back.

390
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:04,108
And I think I'll even go further and say

391
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,719
we're not, we're not going to fix open source because it doesn't need to be fixed.

392
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:11,368
And I'm putting, I'll put fix in air quotes in that statement.

393
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,410
And I think if you look at a lot of this, all of this supply chain talk,

394
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,098
it often focuses on this concept of fixing

395
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:23,404
open source where we have to have project with

396
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:27,923
more developers and we have to have sign off. So we have to be signing everything and,

397
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:31,563
and we need M fa and right, there's all this stuff that's expected.

398
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:34,404
And in some cases, I'm not saying it's a bad thing,

399
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:36,593
but I think we have to be very mindful

400
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:40,124
that when you're essentially going to a natural resource

401
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:42,894
and asking it to do things for you,

402
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:46,354
you're going to be disappointed on a regular basis because I think what we

403
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:48,864
currently call open source is better viewed

404
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,843
as a natural resource we are extracting from

405
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,760
than

406
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,469
a thing we are cooperating with in many cases.

407
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:00,140
And so this is where I think the view I I've, I've developed on,

408
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,489
on all of this over the last probably year or two

409
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,089
is really one of it's not about controlling open source.

410
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:10,020
You have to just be able to understand and observe what's going on around you.

411
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,469
And sometimes you will need to step in

412
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,479
and take an action. But the vast majority of the time

413
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,010
you just need to watch and understand.

414
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:22,719
Well, and the other thing that drives me nuts is if any of these plans rely on

415
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:23,800
all

416
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:26,510
of your open source dependencies, doing these things,

417
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:29,189
you, you're going to be disappointed, like you said,

418
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,329
that's just not possible. Yeah.

419
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:36,199
No, no, I mean, I think expecting 10 or 20% of your open source to be doing,

420
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,780
this would be optimistic.

421
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,119
Like, and there's,

422
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,979
there's gonna be projects that work in a way that will say is

423
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:47,369
palatable to the likes of Google and many of them like Kubernetes,

424
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,339
obviously huge project Google is,

425
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:53,579
is a heavy investor and they made it what they needed it to be and that, that's great.

426
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:57,469
But there's also gonna be like N PM projects that everyone uses,

427
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,380
that's one or two people and

428
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:04,170
it probably won't change because even, even if you wanted to change it,

429
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,930
you could show up and say, oh,

430
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:07,050
we're gonna give all these resources to help

431
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,410
and the authors are probably gonna be like,

432
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,459
why? Like I don't, I don't want to do any of this stuff. I do this for fun. Go away.

433
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,729
It's

434
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,795
the other thing is there is no, again, like I just keep coming back,

435
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:20,484
there is no open source.

436
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,974
Like there's, this is like saying food,

437
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:25,994
like globally food is everything from a guy growing

438
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,964
potatoes in his backyard to like Archer Daniels Midland,

439
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:32,775
which if you don't know what ad M is, it's, it's a big company.

440
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,189
I

441
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,109
would think of it as saying,

442
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,359
we're going to go and we need to get stuff from the forest for work.

443
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:46,949
-- You're like, what, what do you need? Trees, rocks, dirt,
-- the oil underneath of it.

444
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,109
What are we doing in the forest? You're like, no, no, we just need the forest.

445
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,469
The forest has what we need. If people are going to be like, this isn't how it works.

446
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:57,109
The thing that I just keep coming back to is also it's

447
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,729
they're like shouting at the ocean.

448
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,739
I mean, you and I did this thought experiment of could we even do like

449
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:09,459
a survey of all, say the pi pie or N PM developers and get them to respond.

450
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,099
-- No, no,
-- I think we can't even contact them, we can't even talk to them or,

451
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:15,180
or get their opinion.

452
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,719
Here's a better example actually. So, so there is a

453
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,739
uh a dashboard from

454
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:21,089
pipe.

455
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,030
I give hi P A ton of credit for this because they're,

456
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,060
they're obviously are rolling out the multi factor off

457
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,229
and they made all their data public and I will

458
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,310
put a link to the dashboard in the show notes.

459
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,170
But basically

460
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,099
they're seeing they've asked the developers of

461
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,599
critical packages to enable two factor authentication,

462
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:35,890
right?

463
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,099
-- Not as
-- they forced,

464
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,760
they haven't forced them yet,

465
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:42,219
they're going to force them, but they're still, it's still voluntary.

466
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:45,619
They asked them nicely 20% compliant and I think this is basically

467
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,439
how it works is if you ask someone nicely to do something,

468
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:49,489
you're going to get 20%.

469
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,079
No problem.

470
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,979
And then you might trickle your way up to maybe 30 or 40 if you're lucky over a long,

471
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:55,060
long period of time.

472
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:55,910
But I think

473
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:58,385
that's kind of the trick to open source. Same thing here.

474
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:01,255
Like if Google says, oh, open source, I need everyone to do this.

475
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:03,045
I bet 20% would comply

476
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:04,925
and the rest would be like, nah, whatever.

477
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,915
Well, no, it's not even that 20% would complain.

478
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:07,935
And the rest are like, you know, whatever.

479
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:09,984
It's like a good chunk of them aren't even going to hear

480
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:12,375
about it because they're on vacation or they don't read that website.

481
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:14,015
Like that could be too, you know,

482
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:17,734
like I have this all the time at the cloud screen lines where I email the, the,

483
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:21,454
the internal everybody alias and we tell them about something

484
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,660
and then like three weeks later somebody's like, hey,

485
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,219
what about this? And we're like, yeah. Did you read the email? Oh, no, I'm busy. Like,

486
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,089
like, am I supposed to call them?

487
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:32,760
And I mean,

488
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,599
that's not even sustainable in an organization of 100 people, let alone

489
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,319
how many, tens of thousands of global debts for which I don't have phone numbers,

490
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,939
thousands, millions, millions and millions.

491
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,890
That's the thing, right?

492
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,199
Like, it's not that people don't want to comply or are unwilling to comply.

493
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:49,560
It's like you're assuming that they even know that this exists.

494
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,579
I mean, that's true actually.

495
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:52,420
And, and I keep,

496
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:57,000
-- I keep falling into this trap of like everybody
-- reads their email on a timely basis.

497
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,130
Have you met my son?

498
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,569
No, no,

499
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:01,979
-- not that
-- I've started sending him cat memes to try and teach him to read his email.

500
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:04,140
Cat memes never fail.

501
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,270
He still doesn't read his email reliably.

502
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:07,770
Oh, man, you gotta,

503
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,489
you're gonna have to up your meme game.

504
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:13,160
No, no, I'm I'm saying when you're in the middle of something,

505
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,140
it often feels very important and like right now like things like

506
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,180
bomb and supply chain and open source vulnerabilities

507
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,739
feel like the whole world

508
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:24,280
and, and most days to me because it's, it's literally what I do,

509
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:26,229
but the vast majority of people, yeah,

510
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:28,349
they don't care why should they care what it does?

511
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,319
It does it matter.

512
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:32,319
The thing that blows my mind is like this system works so well,

513
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:34,089
like look at all the software based on open

514
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,319
source that's out there chugging along getting stuff done.

515
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:39,380
It works like the amount

516
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,069
of millions of people

517
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:47,160
years of effort that have been saved by being able to like pull in open source, right?

518
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,640
I mean, I, I've always wanted to do an actual calculation of

519
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:53,010
like how much software is produced using open source,

520
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,010
how many hours does using open source, save them, right?

521
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,510
And, and the only number I can come up with is at least millions of years.

522
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,969
It's, it's a ridiculous amount for sure

523
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,030
without question.

524
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,109
Now, now, here's what I wonder sometimes and I don't know

525
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:09,469
if this is a, a reasonable question or I, maybe I'm off my rocker.

526
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,030
Open source has existed in the state.

527
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,979
It's in for a while and I'd say the last,

528
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:17,989
probably 5 to 10 years are when it really came into its place.

529
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,500
And you say everything is working and I agree.

530
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,979
Well, no, no, no, not everything is working,

531
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:24,109
-- everything is working well
-- enough every ok

532
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,729
and you say everything's working well enough,

533
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:26,469
which I agree.

534
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,310
But then

535
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,300
as this agent

536
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,000
in five or 10 more years,

537
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,180
will we be able to say the same thing or will there be

538
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:38,609
enough like crusty dangerous open source that it will be more of a liability

539
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,869
than an advantage?

540
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,339
So here's my follow up question to that or my response is,

541
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:45,140
do we actually have an alternative?

542
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,800
I mean, no, absolutely not.

543
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,310
This is like all those people that are like, oh, we should like redesign cities,

544
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,099
not around cars and it's like, ok,

545
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:54,979
so we're going to do what exactly with all these roads?

546
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:56,099
Like just ignore them.

547
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,300
Yeah, it's fine.

548
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,949
We'll put parks on them. It'll be, it'll be great.

549
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:00,609
You know,

550
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:01,170
I

551
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:01,680
know,

552
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,209
I look at this and I just do, we actually have an alternative.

553
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,979
You know, this is like saying we should end world hunger Yes.

554
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,410
Yes, we all agree that that's probably not the worst idea in the world. Right.

555
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,319
Ok. Well, but there's so many problems, like, there's

556
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:17,949
like, there's the lack of food issues in certain parts of the world.

557
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,819
There's access to the food, there's

558
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,630
safe distribution, you know. So it doesn't get stolen.

559
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,500
Like, there's a lot of, you know, there's security problems,

560
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,410
there's safety problems.

561
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,630
There's

562
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,459
like,

563
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,089
oh.

564
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,170
It's complicated, you know.

565
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:32,250
-- Yeah. I mean,
-- that's the answer to everything is, it's complicated.

566
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,079
I don't know that there is realistically, even if you,

567
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:41,010
like, had, even if you somehow got tens of billions of dollars to, like,

568
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,300
fix open source,

569
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,819
like, what would you actually do to make it?

570
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,160
I wouldn't look at it that way. I think, I think you've gone too far. Maybe

571
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,060
in, in a experiment

572
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,359
point of view

573
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:53,589
of it.

574
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,050
Think of it like this.

575
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,920
So, I've got all this open source. I can mostly use anything I want with

576
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,750
little to no repercussions.

577
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,300
So, if I just do, like, an N PM install of any random package,

578
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,140
I'm probably going to be fine. Right. Like,

579
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,709
it's, it's, there's really no issues

580
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:13,790
now in five or 10 years.

581
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,699
Are we going to be at a point where I can't just blindly N PM

582
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:20,280
install because there are going to be things that are dangerously out of date.

583
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:27,109
Will I have a system in place that maybe does look at, like, when was the last update.

584
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,579
How old is this thing? How many security vulnerabilities?

585
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,380
Well, then I just don't use the super old thing.

586
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,420
All the core functionality.

587
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,339
Well, no, no,

588
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,540
in some cases it might. But if I'm starting fresh,

589
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:42,939
I would just not use the really old stuff. You know what I mean?

590
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:45,579
But sometimes that really old stuff is your only choice for that thing.

591
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:49,099
Like I've looked for certain libraries and there's like one or two and,

592
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:49,900
and that's true.

593
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:52,810
There's not a plethora of like, like if you want a web server.

594
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,699
Sure man, there's like literally more web servers than I can name.

595
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,890
Same thing with email servers, same thing with a lot of things.

596
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,290
But you look for specific libraries to do specific things

597
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,170
and sometimes there's like

598
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,890
that American date and that's it.

599
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,310
I mean, and, and you're, you're not wrong and that, that could be true.

600
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:10,430
It, I don't know.

601
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:12,750
-- I guess it'll be interesting to see,
-- you know, it's,

602
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,849
it's a risk most people have decided is acceptable

603
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:17,760
because the problem is they don't have an alternative behavior

604
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,849
for that risk.

605
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:19,130
Well,

606
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,689
the alternative today is to write it yourself or

607
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:23,790
-- fork the project and take it over
-- that.

608
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,650
No, they can't.

609
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,839
That's, but that's like saying be less

610
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:27,880
can do that.

611
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:33,050
But I most places can barely glue code together,

612
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,119
let alone write a complicated piece of

613
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,510
software that actually does something tricky.

614
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,880
You know, like when I look at stuff like, uh in the Python world.

615
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,750
Like, I look at stuff like fuzzy wuzzy or numpy

616
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:44,469
or panda and I'm just like, wow,

617
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:48,719
like the phd S and whatnot people working on this thing are so smart

618
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:50,250
and like, performance wise,

619
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:54,770
like there's that, that hacker news post where they, they did something to uh numpy

620
00:26:55,189 --> 00:26:58,109
and it just magically makes it like 10 to 50 times faster. And I'm like,

621
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:02,589
-- ok, then like
-- magic, I mean, this is why I'm glad smart people do things like this.

622
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,390
And that's the thing, right? Is

623
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,109
I, I don't think most of these companies

624
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,609
realistically, you know, this is like saying to a company, oh,

625
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:10,400
you can't find the screws.

626
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,189
You want, just make your own screws. You,

627
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,209
you can't

628
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,599
Google can,

629
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:16,369
Apple can't Apple.

630
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,010
Remember Apple was like talking about on shoring their, their distribute or their,

631
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,170
um their, their laptops and they're like, well, we can't even get screws in America.

632
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,209
Like there's nobody that makes these the screws we need.

633
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:27,520
Well, remember when Apple started with the tiny,

634
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,979
tiny holes in their laptops for the speaker grills, right?

635
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:31,569
And how they were drilled with a laser?

636
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:33,780
Oh, yeah, they, they bought, they bought the company

637
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:34,910
that,

638
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,530
-- that made the laser
-- and apparently there's two or three spots in

639
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,560
the world now with these giant manufacturing plants where Apple just has,

640
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:42,540
I forget the name of this.

641
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,270
I think it's a Swiss CNC milling machine and they buy

642
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,140
like a major percentage of this company's milling machines to,

643
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,550
like, churn out the bodies of the laptops.

644
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,939
-- Yeah.
-- But Apple can do that.

645
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,750
You and I can't.

646
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,400
Exactly. And that's the thing. Right.

647
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,699
Even just to make a custom screw is we're

648
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,339
talking tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.

649
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:01,349
Sure.

650
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,819
You're just going to go buy some screws that

651
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:05,189
are close enough from wherever and use them.

652
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,670
And that's, and the same with software.

653
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,869
Like, how much is a good software dev with overhead about a quarter million a year,

654
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,199
minimum, 100 grand, more like a quarter million.

655
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,520
Ok. Now you need about five or 10 of them to build something complicated.

656
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,390
Oh, now we're talking like a million bucks a year.

657
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:23,709
Or you pull in an open source dependency.

658
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,530
Like, come on.

659
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,180
Well, no, I, I don't even look at it like that.

660
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:30,920
This is like if my core business is building laptops

661
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,119
and I'm spending a significant amount of my resources making screws.

662
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:39,800
I'm, I'm doing something wrong because I'm not gonna make any money on the screws.

663
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,359
I'm gonna make the money on the laptop,

664
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,900
I think. And this is why open source one.

665
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,739
Because if I'm a company and I'm creating a product that's made

666
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:53,020
of software and I'm paying developers to write like commodity functionality.

667
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,430
Well, I would say everything is software. Now that's a given.

668
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,930
Well, no, of course, obviously you don't even have to say that.

669
00:28:58,189 --> 00:29:01,660
But if I'm paying a developer to build commodity features.

670
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,390
I'm not making any money on that because no one's paying me for those

671
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,810
-- features
-- to the second part of the question I was going to ask you.

672
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:10,229
So I would posit that it's not actually realistically

673
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:12,680
possible for the companies to even build these components.

674
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:15,000
But let's assume they do build these components.

675
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,719
Are they actually better off than pulling in an open source component?

676
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:19,510
And the answer is no like they still have all the problems

677
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,255
that the source component would have in the sense of security vulnerabilities,

678
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:24,895
maintaining it, updates, adding functionality, blah, blah, blah.

679
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:28,944
-- It's not like building it yourself is somehow magically cheaper and better
-- than

680
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:30,645
it's almost always works.

681
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:33,864
And that's what I mean is realistically,

682
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:37,015
I don't think they have an alternative to pulling an open source because

683
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,010
they, they can't build it themselves.

684
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,569
But even if they could build it themselves,

685
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,439
it would cost more money and be more hassle, right.

686
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:45,719
So there is no actual alternative

687
00:29:45,979 --> 00:29:48,959
-- to pulling an open source realistically,
-- there isn't.

688
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:49,790
And, and again,

689
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,949
I'm curious what happens in 5 to 10 years

690
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,369
as there are things that are now several years old

691
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:58,880
and out of date when they become even more out of date in that time span.

692
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,209
-- I don't know.
-- Well, we've already seen that with web apps, right?

693
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:04,099
And we just Chuck Web app firewalls in front of them, right?

694
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:04,699
And

695
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,199
I mean, that's something important to remember is as long as it's like,

696
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,829
if you can't talk to the stuff over the network, how do you attack it?

697
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,140
Well, I mean, that's,

698
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,650
if only it was that simple, that's not, that's not how it works at all.

699
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,050
Well, but I'm saying, like, that reduces your attack service significantly.

700
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:19,670
I

701
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:20,349
know

702
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,119
I have out of date devices on my home

703
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,930
network here and if you're inside my home network,

704
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,680
I have bigger problems than

705
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,329
that software being out of date.

706
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,540
That's probably fair.

707
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,630
And, and I think this is, this is kind of where it all ends, right?

708
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,079
Is where we get back to that idea of

709
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,390
oftentimes, things like containment and observation

710
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,750
are vastly easier and, and more effective

711
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,119
-- than
-- prevention. I think again, it goes back to.

712
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,810
But do you actually have an alternative?

713
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:50,599
Well, the alternative, if, if your one choice is

714
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,589
eliminate all the security flaws in the software, that's

715
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,469
not an actual alternative,

716
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,079
right? Like that's,

717
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:58,410
that's just not,

718
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,689
that's like saying just let's get everybody to stop being poor or unhealthy,

719
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:05,000
like you just know.

720
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:09,160
And so like Apple's a great example, Apple could, can literally just

721
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,689
literally fill dump trucks full of money and burn it.

722
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:14,489
And instead they went with like blast door for iMessage,

723
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:15,709
you know,

724
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:15,969
and

725
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,369
because even they, you know, you look at their security advisor,

726
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,270
they're pulling in all sorts of open source to do various file parsing and mantling

727
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,310
and it's just, it'll never be secure because like any file parser.

728
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,079
Actually, I was going to say more complicated than,

729
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:31,780
but I'm just going to go with any file parser will have security flaws.

730
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:32,560
Full

731
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:32,709
stop.

732
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,739
Yes,

733
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:39,109
that's true. That's true. I mean, ok, so I guess I will end this with

734
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:42,349
there. There may not be a software supply chain,

735
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:44,430
but there sure is a lot of open source.

736
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,160
I will agree with that.

737
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,880
All right.

738
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,489
Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

739
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,880
Go to open source Security, podcast.com. Hit up the show now. It's Suzie Pound.

740
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,900
Oh, it says podcast. Hashtag hit us up on

741
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,140
social.

742
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,400
I just was going to say hit us up on social security, hit us up on social media.

743
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:00,979
It's been,

744
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,660
I'm just gonna say one last parting thought

745
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,839
too is imagine if these companies all built their

746
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:08,839
own stuff now we have how many things to fix versus one open source to fix.

747
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:13,060
That's true. That is true. And, and you're right. You're right. Alright.

748
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:14,469
-- Anyway,
-- thanks everybody.

749
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,930
Thanks everyone. Bye bye.
