Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,489
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,289
Josh Resor.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,430
Hey, Kurt, what's up, man?

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,989
Uh Not much. Just had a good solid weekend

5
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:17,120
weekend. That means it's Monday.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,079
I hate my,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,399
I, I can relate to Garfield on this one.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,379
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,829
Yeah, I'm a bit sour cause I bought the wrong kind of coffee for my coffee machine.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,819
So I'm drinking brown water right now.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,319
Yeah, I don't even know how to say about that. Um

12
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,299
Anyway,

13
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:35,659
brown water don't drink the brown water curt.

14
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,889
No, I, I can relate. I luckily have a fine cup of coffee here. So everything's good.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,110
So, yeah, let's uh,

16
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,520
let's talk about the news. You found some really cool stuff, man.

17
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,029
Yeah. So

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,680
my,

19
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:49,279
by far my favorite announcement in the last week is

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,729
this uh this physically secure open source computer called Orwell,

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,490
which, which is a great name, right? Yeah.

22
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,849
And um

23
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,869
one thing I do like also is the form factor.

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,729
It's a really, it's sort of like this little, um,

25
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,560
you know, the game Simon says

26
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:06,150
the little brown sort of puck thing with buttons on it

27
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:08,129
that I have one from like the,

28
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:11,779
the fifties or whenever they came out on my shelf behind me,

29
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:15,669
one of the lights burnt out and I'm too lazy to fix it. But no, it still works.

30
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,620
Yeah.

31
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,000
And so the idea being is that you have this, like,

32
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,430
small computer that is physically secured, uh, it's, um,

33
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:26,889
not just, I don't know if it's tamper resistant or tamper evident,

34
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,889
but the idea is if you do try to monkey with it,

35
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,919
uh the hard drive and all the data is encrypted

36
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,309
and it will basically uh crypto shred the encryption keys,

37
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,940
like it'll just delete the encryption keys so you can't get at the data,

38
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,029
-- right?
-- It, it, so in reading this, it says, and I'm quoting the article exactly here.

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,860
It says any attempt to get physical access to the internals of your

40
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,540
PC will delete the cryptographic key rendering

41
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,849
all of your data permanently inaccessible.

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,050
So I would say that's,

43
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,360
that's relatively tamper resistant, assuming it works correctly, which

44
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,360
I'm sure it doesn't.

45
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,519
Yeah.

46
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:01,019
And the other concept is it has like uh a little key fob

47
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:03,830
that you carry with it that and the key fob uh has to,

48
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,599
I guess be in physical proximity

49
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,970
to the computer for the computer to work. So I kind of like that in that,

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,809
you know,

51
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,300
one aspect I really hate about a lot of security systems is

52
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:15,220
they only have one sort of form of authentication or protection,

53
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:15,360
right?

54
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,809
Like a password or,

55
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,559
well, that's actually typically it as a password.

56
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:21,669
Um, let's face it, right.

57
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,490
And, you know,

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,460
versus something that requires like an external

59
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,089
token that actually does something securely,

60
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,529
you know, like actually does a little bit of crypto on it or in decryption, you know.

61
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:31,820
So

62
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:34,380
like, for example, using your smartphone as a token, you know,

63
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:37,500
with the software loaded to generate numbers on it, you know,

64
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:38,949
to authenticate to it or whatever.

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,619
Um So I like that in this case, you know, that you've got the,

66
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,029
you've got the key fob.

67
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,289
Uh And then you've also,

68
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,699
I'm assuming I'm hoping that you also have to

69
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,289
enter a password to get this thing decrypted.

70
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,630
So they can't just like mug you and take your key fob

71
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,039
and use your computer.

72
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:54,160
Uh

73
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,630
That's a good question.

74
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,279
And there's also the issue of so one

75
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:01,419
of the problems with physical proximity always is

76
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,300
if somebody has access to your computer, it's generally game over at that point.

77
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:07,789
And I know when we're doing

78
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,779
analysis of security flaws, the assumption has always been,

79
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,229
if someone is actually sitting at the computer,

80
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,289
it's not a security issue because

81
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,229
let's face it.

82
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,000
Like if you can plug in a USB drive and crash a machine,

83
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,929
like you can just hit it with a hammer too.

84
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,809
I mean, both of those are effectively the same outcome, for example,

85
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,729
-- or
-- you can hit the user with a hammer

86
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:26,139
to give

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,449
you the pass,

88
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:28,710
we won't get into that one.

89
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:31,250
But so in this instance though,

90
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,279
you've got your fob

91
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,940
and you need to log in in some way and it does some level of decryption, which is great.

92
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,850
But I'm wondering what happens when you walk away. Does it power down?

93
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,529
Do we make sure that the key in question is completely gone? Because I mean,

94
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,089
when you're talking about actual hardware,

95
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,199
there's those

96
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,190
various attacks you can do, for example, like, you know,

97
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,020
cooling the ram way down and then yanking it and then reading it for

98
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,889
to get the encryption keys off of it.

99
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:00,809
Or in many instances, most people probably don't even encrypt their disks.

100
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,160
So you can just literally, you know, yank the disks and you've got what you need.

101
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,529
And so, I mean, this is a tough problem and

102
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,199
I commend these guys for starting down this path because I think as security people,

103
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,539
we are notorious for saying this is impossible to do.

104
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,500
It's too hard to do. It's not perfect. You're a bunch of idiots quit trying.

105
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:20,809
When in reality,

106
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,109
every time they try to do this, they're gonna make mistakes and let's face it.

107
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,559
It isn't gonna be perfect. There's gonna be attacks on this,

108
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,420
but every time they make a mistake, assuming they learn from their mistake,

109
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:31,929
it will continue to get better.

110
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,730
And I would love to be in a position where I

111
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:38,619
have a secure device on my desk that I can trust

112
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,420
-- that would be awesome.
-- Well, you already do.

113
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:42,829
It's your phone, like, let's face it, the iphone and the, well,

114
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,750
the better Androids have already done this with the

115
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:46,429
carry it with

116
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,839
me everywhere I go. Right. That is, that is how I secure my phone.

117
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,040
I don't leave it there.

118
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,179
Right. So, like the, the iphone is a good example of that.

119
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,250
I don't know if you remember the San Bernardino attacker, right?

120
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,320
But the idea being that

121
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,279
in the older iphones, you have the the encryption key

122
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,410
and um

123
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,019
it's actually held in like a a chip that protects it, you know, from access, right?

124
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:10,369
I think you get the 10 attempts and then it wipes itself and stuff and,

125
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:14,250
but the thing is you can just clone that data and and just sort of keep trying,

126
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,149
it wipes itself.

127
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,700
So you reload the data, try 10 times, wipes itself, reload the data, right?

128
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,220
Um And so it's not until you get like a fully integrated chip that you know

129
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:28,190
requires you to like physically disassemble a chip in some way to get the data

130
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,230
that you

131
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,760
really begin to get to a secure point.

132
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:32,589
Because for example,

133
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,269
you know that there was a guy that published the technique for taking apart an iphone

134
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,369
and with $100 in parts cloning the ra M or um sorry, cloning the uh

135
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,549
the storage

136
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,679
so that you can then just brute force attack it, right?

137
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,269
Because that's the thing too, physically. Once you have a computer physically,

138
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,609
you know, rarely is it like the movies where you have, like,

139
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,989
five minutes to decode it before the guy notices

140
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:55,140
-- you typically have, like, all month or two months or whatever or, or
-- forever.

141
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,459
I mean, let's face it. Even if you have an encrypted disk,

142
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,619
it's probably some sort of password. You have some sort of key

143
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,799
and you can just clone the disk and now you have infinite tribes

144
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,179
to crack the, crack the password. Right.

145
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:07,820
Yeah.

146
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:08,690
Yeah.

147
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:11,820
And so, no, I would definitely like to see more of this because,

148
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,470
yeah, I mean, I,

149
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,649
I have all my computers and all my devices

150
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,619
with encrypted hard drives as much as possible,

151
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,579
but still, you know,

152
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:19,660
um,

153
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:25,429
it's so easy to make a mistake or, you know, or even a simple thing.

154
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,209
Like, I just don't want my kids using my computer.

155
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,130
Right. I don't want them mucking up my computer.

156
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:32,250
Right. They're constantly trying to touch it and stuff.

157
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,200
-- I can relate to that. Man. It's,
-- yeah,

158
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,890
we've had to train my one kid to actually, like,

159
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,670
physically turn his back and move a few feet away when

160
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:43,450
we enter passwords because he keeps trying to shoulder surf them.

161
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:44,660
Fantastic.

162
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,910
-- That's great,
-- you know.

163
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,140
Um, but yeah, so, no, I love because part of it too is there's, there's probably some

164
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,579
relatively simple ways that we can make, you know,

165
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:58,459
the situation better for 99% of users, which is really what matters, you know,

166
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,450
like I, I want, for example, if my phone gets stolen,

167
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,359
I just need a few minutes to go find a computer that I can log in from.

168
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,779
So I can remotely tell my phone to wipe itself

169
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,450
the next time it's, you know,

170
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,149
connected to the network or whatever.

171
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,399
You don't, you don't have that tied into an apple watch that if your heart stops or,

172
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,950
or the phone is separated from the watch by more than 100 ft.

173
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,549
It, it explodes.

174
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,869
I actually looked into that and there's no app for that.

175
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,390
They do have the Apple Watch doing authentication, which,

176
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:30,350
uh, that's actually, I mean, that's why I upgraded my phone was to get the,

177
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:35,220
the fingerprint log in so that I don't have to keep entering my password constantly.

178
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,679
-- You know,
-- I don't know if we've talked about this before,

179
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,950
but I actually found out that

180
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,290
in, in the US. At least

181
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:44,239
they cannot make you type your password in,

182
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,070
but they can force your finger onto the fingerprint scanner on your phone.

183
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,140
So,

184
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,839
yeah, it's,

185
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,320
I,

186
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:55,059
I'm wondering about biometrics long term.

187
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:59,410
Uh Yeah, it's, it's hard to change your fingerprint when it gets stolen.

188
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,779
It's, it's tricky, right?

189
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,320
Or the fact that you can, uh, there was a guy that did a,

190
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,269
he basically found with a decent telephoto

191
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:10,410
lens. You could take pictures of people's fingerprints off of glasses,

192
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:11,600
like in public?

193
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,190
Fantastic.

194
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,839
You know.

195
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,809
So, and, and as far as I'm aware,

196
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,250
there's nobody has the discipline to wear gloves all the time,

197
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,600
you know,

198
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,130
that, that CD finally pays off. Right.

199
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:26,290
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah. All that hand sanitizer

200
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,369
go to, uh, or no. What is it?

201
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,850
The, uh, all those movies where they would sandpaper their fingerprints off.

202
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,169
Right. I don't know if that works. I'm gonna guess not because I think if it did,

203
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,650
you would hear more of it

204
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,500
and not in the movies, right? Because we all know that everything in the movie

205
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,460
-- is
-- totally
-- true.

206
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,599
There was uh issues with surgeons using iphones and because

207
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,320
they scrub their fingers and hands so much that they,

208
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,760
they wore the prints down enough that the

209
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,119
sensors weren't able to register them properly.

210
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,030
-- So
-- it does happen

211
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:54,900
just

212
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,590
the same.

213
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,039
No fingerprint

214
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,780
pretty much. Yeah, I wasn't able to read them. So,

215
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,880
but yeah, no, I mean, one thing I would love to see is, you know,

216
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,190
why don't we have encrypted hard drives by default now?

217
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,809
Because, you know,

218
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,229
as far as I know every single CPU on the planet now has like an AES 256

219
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,340
you know, capability in it.

220
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,719
Right. So we can encrypt everything using

221
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:19,320
A S 256 for, for basically for free computationally speaking.

222
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:22,950
-- Yes.
-- I mean, so where do you keep the key though?

223
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,869
Well, well, like in a Linux system, for example,

224
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,599
you have your slash boot partition which is not encrypted, which drives me nuts.

225
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,039
And you

226
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,000
then,

227
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,640
you know, bootstrap into the encrypted system.

228
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,919
Uh Android has their secure boot system. So does Windows.

229
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,520
Um you know, you could, well, you could keep the key in the the T PM.

230
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,169
-- Uh the trusted platform, what is it trust platform, trusted
-- platform module

231
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,820
and Windows does a pretty nice job of supporting this.

232
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,880
Actually, the Linux support is abysmal on T PM.

233
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,469
And this is one of the things we're working on

234
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:58,719
solving with T PM 2.0 is making it actually useful

235
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,909
instead of a collection of barely working binaries.

236
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:03,929
Yeah.

237
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,340
And even when it, I mean,

238
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,359
to me, the iphone is a good example of you should just

239
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,869
encrypt by default

240
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,849
and that's an end of story,

241
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:17,130
right? And your login password or whatever should be able to decrypt your password.

242
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,130
And if you really want, you can set up recovery codes, you know, same thing on Linux,

243
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,130
you can set up recovery mechanisms. Uh It's kind of a chore, but

244
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,849
um fundamentally,

245
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,859
I think everything should be even if it's just encrypted with like a four digit pin,

246
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,960
that's still way better than no encryption.

247
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:34,739
I mean, I think you could argue things are heading in that direction because

248
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:35,979
let's face it.

249
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:39,549
The concept of the desktop is kind of falling

250
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,700
apart these days just because everyone's using their telephones,

251
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,869
they're using their tablets,

252
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,849
they've got all these devices and it's generally not a laptop or a desktop

253
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,669
and like, I encrypted my android devices

254
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,669
and it was really easy to do and it just works.

255
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,349
And I don't know a lot of people who don't have passwords on their phones these days.

256
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,710
I think generally speaking,

257
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:04,989
most people have a password and once you have a password, you can encrypt the phone.

258
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,750
So

259
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,000
I think we're closer than you think.

260
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,919
Well, and, and this is true of devices and computers that are used by people.

261
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,549
But what about computers that are not used directly by people?

262
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,150
So going to your cloud example,

263
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,710
you know, when, where we,

264
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,150
we used to typically say if somebody has physical access came over.

265
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,739
Well, you know, in the cloud, for example,

266
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,469
I have no idea where these data centers are or what security provisions they have.

267
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:25,780
I mean,

268
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:29,229
they, they claim, you know, sock, what is it,

269
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:33,590
whatever the sock two standard is or the B si standard or the iso standard, you know,

270
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,989
for physical security and stuff.

271
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,260
I have no idea what that actually means or if it's true.

272
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,630
-- But
-- today

273
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,419
in the cloud, you have to trust your cloud provider

274
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,469
pretty much completely because they have

275
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,809
virtually unlimited access to your machines and data.

276
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,440
I'm more worried about silly situations like, oh,

277
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,340
they accidentally throw out a bunch of hard drives instead of destroying them

278
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,859
or, you know, so I want to have my data encrypted at rest. Ideally,

279
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:01,719
right.

280
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,479
That makes

281
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:02,630
sense

282
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:07,429
and in fact, there are a handful of I know products that can do this now

283
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,630
and

284
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,090
there's something redhead's working out.

285
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,049
We're gonna call it network bound disc encryption.

286
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,239
Where the idea is basically, it's not meant to be secure in,

287
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,390
in the context of protecting a machine.

288
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,530
But rather the instance you say about throwing out hard drives where

289
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:23,320
you'll have some infrastructure set up.

290
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,409
So in a machine boots, it can automatically get the decryption key.

291
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:30,109
And the idea is if the, if the hard drive is removed from the machine,

292
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,750
you can no longer acquire that encryption key again,

293
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,869
or at least not without like an insane amount of work and,

294
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,309
and local access to the network.

295
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,630
But

296
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,719
it's, it's a tricky problem man. I mean,

297
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,510
I get it and I think on the cons for what it's worth on the consumer side,

298
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,650
I think things are much better than they've ever been.

299
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,940
And I think on the server side,

300
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:51,869
we're starting to move in the right direction.

301
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,000
I won't say we're there, but I think it's understood where we need to go.

302
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,530
I definitely on the server side.

303
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:02,250
Um And then, but there's that unfortunate gap in between of like, for example,

304
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,640
photocopiers and

305
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,159
you know,

306
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:06,090
all the people I've had to explain to now that a

307
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,429
modern photocopier has a hard drive in it and that it,

308
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,619
you know, it takes a copy of your thing and then prints out that copy.

309
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,919
That's what it's doing when it's, you know, quote unquote photocopying.

310
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:15,429
And they're like,

311
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:19,059
what do you mean? I'm like, well, when you photocopy something 500 times, right?

312
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,580
It scans it once

313
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,539
and prints it 500 times, it doesn't scan it, print it, scan it, print it right.

314
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,780
You know,

315
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,280
and of course, like any good computer, it simply deletes the file when it's done,

316
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,090
but that actually doesn't destroy the data.

317
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:34,719
Right. It's just there but, you know, sort of semi forgotten.

318
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,030
And, I mean, I'm sure you've seen this, you know,

319
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,020
the 60 minutes or the various people that

320
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,940
have bought like old photocopiers and stuff on ebay

321
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,559
and then, you know, run disc recovery programs to, you know, un delete the data

322
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,799
and turned up, you know, like medical, you know, offices,

323
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:52,669
like their last three years of faxes, you know, things like that.

324
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,059
Right.

325
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,190
Um,

326
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,179
and,

327
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,440
yeah, no, I think that that's the frustrating part to me is on the server side.

328
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:58,559
It's,

329
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,880
it's somewhat easier because everything gets replaced every

330
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,049
3 to 4 years because it just gets

331
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,640
so slow and eats so much energy that we want to get rid of it anyways.

332
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,109
But, you know, people buy printers and printers are forever, you know,

333
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,400
fax machines are forever.

334
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:12,799
There was that article about, you know,

335
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,039
fax machines running Linux

336
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,239
based firmware from 1999 still in use. And it's like,

337
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,049
and, and the funny thing is that's actually probably

338
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,239
in some ways almost,

339
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,330
uh,

340
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,750
I don't wanna say safer but it would

341
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,090
be more confusing for the attacker almost because,

342
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:31,130
you know, they would try some modern exploits against it and they would fail because

343
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,049
the software is sold that it doesn't even support that, you know.

344
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:34,780
But, uh,

345
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,340
no,

346
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,690
we're not discussing that.

347
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,880
-- But I think in general you're right, we need
-- to run software from 1999. That's the,

348
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,320
that's the takeaway. That's true.

349
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:44,099
Yeah.

350
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:48,349
But uh no, I think it encryption at all levels all the time.

351
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,349
If nothing else just to prevent silly mistakes.

352
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:53,559
-- Like, oops, I threw out a batch of hard drives but instead of destroying them.
-- Right.

353
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,260
Absolutely. And, and I think that's the important thing is

354
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,070
there are two scenarios that we often forget about the,

355
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,070
the other is there's always the malicious

356
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,869
attacker angle which we're obsessed with,

357
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,070
right.

358
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,489
We want to stop those Attackers. We have to do what we can.

359
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:11,059
But then people make dumb mistakes and they do

360
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,590
it all the time and that's the one that's actually

361
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,159
mostly solvable I would say.

362
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,169
And so I think if we're clever,

363
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,289
we're gonna put kind of more focus there for now because let's face it.

364
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,570
The problem with Attackers

365
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:26,489
is if the attacker is smarter than you, which they probably are,

366
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:28,349
you cannot stop them by definition.

367
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,719
That is the reality of it.

368
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,989
But stupid mistakes are by definition stupid.

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,880
So you don't even have to be very smart to prevent them.

370
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,429
Right.

371
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:35,830
You know,

372
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,770
I see so many simple things where just a checklist

373
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,909
would have prevented the disaster or the incident or whatever,

374
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,280
you know.

375
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:44,109
And, uh, I remember, like I remember looking into, you know,

376
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,760
hard drive sort of destruction and tracking and

377
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,210
one thing that, well, didn't really surprise me. But,

378
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,570
uh, was interesting was, you know, I, I didn't realize until I checked,

379
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,919
but I've never seen a,

380
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,200
the hard drives themselves have a serial number,

381
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:57,780
right. Usually on a sticker,

382
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:02,729
the platters themselves don't have numbers or serial numbers or any marking.

383
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,340
It's just a piece of metal,

384
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:05,890
right?

385
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,130
Um, so you have to, you know,

386
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,320
you have to maintain some really serious inventory control to like,

387
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,489
be able to really

388
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:13,580
no

389
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:13,809
ones

390
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,659
gonna take a hard drive apart and remove some

391
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:19,380
platters and then put them into another thing like

392
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,690
that isn't something that happens.

393
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:25,109
Having the serial number of the hard drive is probably ok.

394
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,239
This is

395
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,109
no, and that's the point is like, nobody, nobody would care about that.

396
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:29,590
Right.

397
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,960
Because if, if the attacker is able to do that, I'm going to do that then.

398
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:34,619
Well, yeah, they're gonna do something else.

399
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,390
I don't even know why anyone would do that. That,

400
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,609
that is a crazy attack.

401
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,250
Well, if you were able, for example,

402
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,169
if you were allowed to bring a laptop into a facility but

403
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:47,179
not allowed to bring a hard drive in or out or whatever.

404
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,109
Um,

405
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,190
-- but
-- you're gonna,

406
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,739
you're gonna take a hard drive apart, you're gonna remove the platters.

407
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,989
It would just buy a sticker. It'll cost you a nickel. You can cover up the.

408
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,099
Yeah.

409
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:58,940
Well, but this,

410
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,440
the point being is that there's places that

411
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,440
worry about those kind of things and that,

412
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,340
you know, it's really,

413
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,650
they should just be encrypting the discs.

414
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,150
Ok. I'll agree with that.

415
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
I

416
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:07,839
was

417
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:08,890
trying to get

418
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,270
-- your movie.
-- Plot attack.

419
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, that's the

420
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:12,229
point.

421
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,719
It's a movie

422
00:17:12,868 --> 00:17:14,868
plot thing that doesn't really make sense,

423
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,098
you know, and again,

424
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,790
like for example, with the network bound encryption,

425
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,540
that problem just largely goes away,

426
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:21,939
right?

427
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,500
It, it almost completely goes away, which is the idea, it,

428
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:28,500
it wouldn't stop an attacker from necessarily finding the key,

429
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,939
be it in memory on the machine or even

430
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,739
pretending you're the machine and talking to the,

431
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,099
the server, the secret server.

432
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,780
But that's OK

433
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,859
because that's not what we're protecting against.

434
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,979
We're protecting against a hard drive, leaving the data center.

435
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,869
And in which case that happens or

436
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,459
if you, for example, when you're transferring V MS between data centers, right?

437
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:52,969
If, if the VM is lost or stolen as funny as that sounds,

438
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,540
you don't have to worry about the data, right?

439
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:56,989
Yeah.

440
00:17:57,699 --> 00:17:58,810
Yeah. So,

441
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,750
no, I think I,

442
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,219
I think we are on the path to sort

443
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:05,140
of encryption of everything that stores interesting data.

444
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,500
But

445
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,469
the challenge being, of course, it costs money to do this and you know,

446
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,109
for something like a server easy.

447
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,239
You know, it has enough value

448
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,800
and cost that adding a dollar to encrypt everything is ok. But,

449
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,280
you know, the internet of things, for example,

450
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,280
a lot of the internet of things is going to have data on it.

451
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:21,839
Um,

452
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,880
they just recently here in Edmonton where I live, uh,

453
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,479
replaced or are in the process of replacing

454
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,630
all the electricity meters with the digital ones

455
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:33,369
and they sort of

456
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:35,209
didn't come out and say it. Exactly.

457
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:39,089
But they, they, you know, they made those noises around, oh, it's safe, it's secure.

458
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:39,930
Don't worry,

459
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,339
you know,

460
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,920
like, just don't think about it. It'll be fine.

461
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,689
But I, I really have no idea how much data it is storing and, but, and, you know,

462
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:52,000
based on those data patterns, you can, you can tell a lot about somebody's life.

463
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,839
It, it's incredible. Actually, I,

464
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:57,979
I know somebody who works for the power company in town where I live

465
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,859
and I was discussing this with them and I found out actually

466
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:04,560
I can make a written request to the power company and they will send me

467
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,790
my usage data,

468
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:09,300
which I've not done and I kind of don't want to just because I,

469
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,819
I don't want to get fired for, for spending a month,

470
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,339
you know, analyzing data.

471
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,010
But he said basically they take a reading

472
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,660
like every minute or something

473
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,859
and they, they store that data for several years.

474
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,160
So, yeah, there's a significant amount of data stored on your power use

475
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,500
by the power company.

476
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,829
I mean, it, it's wild but again, big data scary. What can we do with it? Who knows?

477
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:33,410
Magic?

478
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:34,150
Magic.

479
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:34,689
So,

480
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:36,530
and that's the thing I think is, is

481
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,229
we're entering this era where for one thing, storage has gotten so cheap, right?

482
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,339
Like I, you remember I was jokingly saying last week,

483
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,790
I'm not going to buy a new file server once I

484
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,650
can get a five terabyte drive for under 200 bucks.

485
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,369
And then I was like, wait, I wonder what they cost?

486
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,050
Well, apparently it's 100 and 80 bucks now.

487
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,479
That's under two 100 bucks, man.

488
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:56,609
No, I agree. Just back it up to Aws and keep a massive disk in, in the closet.

489
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,170
Yeah. You know, and so, you know, you can put a 32 gig.

490
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,709
Well, uh what was it? Those new one terabyte SD cards,

491
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,310
right? Like

492
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,439
32 gigabyte SD cards now are, well,

493
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:12,030
they're like the four meg USB sticks of old or whatever,

494
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,699
whatever minimum size we had back in the day. Yeah.

495
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:16,599
You know, and that's the thing too is, I mean,

496
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,829
there's gonna be so many of these IOT devices where

497
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,109
you can just add

498
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,589
literally infinite data storage

499
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:26,510
-- for like 10 cents.
-- You don't need infinite data storage on the device.

500
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,880
Even you with the cloud, you have infinite data storage.

501
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,150
You just need some bandwidth.

502
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:31,900
Well,

503
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,550
the problem is you also need to then pay recurring monthly cost to store the data,

504
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,359
right?

505
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,760
I would bet you

506
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,479
that

507
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,380
the cost of using

508
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,920
a, a cloud storage system

509
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,280
is

510
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,540
at or less than the cost of purchasing and keeping your, your storage on site.

511
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,390
It is so insanely cheap

512
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,939
for small amounts of data.

513
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,619
That is I would, yeah, that would definitely be true.

514
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,650
Um But what about, you know, things like, for example,

515
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,579
somebody's media center or these iot things that, you know, need to actually store,

516
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,619
you know, and process like

517
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,780
a relatively

518
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:06,329
like

519
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,369
let me give you an example.

520
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,099
I

521
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,739
have a backup.

522
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,290
I keep an Aws encrypted and do all that, you know, tinfoil hat stuff,

523
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,339
which it should be.

524
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,739
But let me, where's my bill? I just got it.

525
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:24,219
Guess how much it costs me to store between 7080 gigs of data in Aws per month.

526
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:27,900
This isn't glacier, this is like the proper S3 storage.

527
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,219
What do you think that costs

528
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,969
one or $2?

529
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:32,479
It's $3.86

530
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:33,089
right now,

531
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:34,660
which is like,

532
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,540
that's so cheap. I mean, you think 70 gigs of disk space would run me, what?

533
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,469
Probably 100 bucks figure because you can't

534
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,380
buy anything less than a terabyte anymore.

535
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:45,180
But

536
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,750
it, it man, I'd have to have it for what,

537
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,579
like 10 years to recruit my costs at this point.

538
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:50,650
I

539
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,369
mean, it's crazy, man. It's so cheap.

540
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,489
Yeah.

541
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,770
But um, well, the thing is, it's more to the point, you know,

542
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,359
you have to boot the IOT device so you have to have some storage in it anyways.

543
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,050
Right.

544
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,079
And

545
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:06,989
the minimum amount of storage you can buy. Now, I'm going to assume one or two gigs.

546
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,810
I mean, I, I think,

547
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:12,250
uh, like I remember back in the day when, you know, we were buying those, uh,

548
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,689
what was it? W RT

549
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,050
54 G wireless access points from D link that had like what

550
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:20,540
was it like? Four megs of ram or whatever, four megs of flash?

551
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,069
And that was amazing,

552
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:22,829
you know,

553
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,619
but yeah, no, I I

554
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:28,949
hopefully we get encryption everywhere that just works. Um

555
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:32,599
But the challenge become is how do you do that for devices

556
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:35,859
that don't have like a user interface or like your light bulbs

557
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,510
or whatever? You know,

558
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,430
I don't know, do, does a light bulb need encryption?

559
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:44,880
I don't think it needs encryption for data at rest probably.

560
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,310
But for example, it does for like signed up updates.

561
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,439
It does for, you know,

562
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,500
well, but in that case, you just need to store a key

563
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,829
somewhere inside of the device,

564
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,589
right?

565
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:56,819
To me,

566
00:22:56,829 --> 00:22:58,650
it's also getting to the point to where I

567
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,239
like the data encryption at rest because it prevents

568
00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:07,609
uh tampering. And it also is more, you know, evident if there is a problem, right?

569
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,890
Like if you get data corruption, the whole thing, you're gonna know right away.

570
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,130
Whereas you know, with a typical file system,

571
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:14,510
uh, granted,

572
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,589
I haven't had this happen in a long time because hardware is way more reliable.

573
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,430
But, you know, it's good to know.

574
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,530
Like, um, I mean, a great example of light bulbs is I bought a whole bunch of those, uh,

575
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,520
CF CS when they first came out and then, like, six months later,

576
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,660
a couple of them burned out

577
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,660
and they were like dark brown where the bulb connected to the transformer bit.

578
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,300
You know, and I wish I'd spotted that earlier.

579
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:34,680
-- All
-- right, we're, we're, we're in a

580
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,000
hoard.

581
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,359
Let's, I'm gonna pull this out

582
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,719
and let's talk about,

583
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,890
did you hear about the system? D one line crash?

584
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:42,599
Yeah, that one,

585
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,459
I don't know what to think about that. Like,

586
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,300
it's a, what was it? An assertion failure, I think,

587
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,089
uh something like that.

588
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,729
But, um, it, it,

589
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,589
uh again, I don't, well, I'm not too worried about it obviously because, you know,

590
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,579
somebody with, again,

591
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:03,839
local access can just typically reboot the system or pull the plug on it.

592
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:04,199
But

593
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:05,500
it is

594
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:06,890
a bit.

595
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,770
It seems to me like this is something that fuzzing can and should catch.

596
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,280
I would expect fuzzing to catch this. Yes.

597
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,079
You know.

598
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,969
So

599
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:21,760
what really gets me though is ok. So now we've seen this one. It's been patched

600
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,089
but has anybody looked for more of these?

601
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,290
Uh Probably not.

602
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,300
I think.

603
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:32,140
So, this interests me for a couple of reasons is first of all,

604
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:37,420
it is always intriguing when you can lock up a system by running just a shell command

605
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,180
as, as a logged in user. OK?

606
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,459
But then the thing I think about is so system d love it or hate it.

607
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:46,430
And I know that there's plenty of people on both sides and

608
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:49,709
I am indifferent in the middle where if you are a fan,

609
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,229
boy of it, I will pretend I like you.

610
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,339
And if you hate it, you know. Yeah, down to system D, you know, I'm

611
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm quite happy to,

612
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,819
to be the fair weather fan of system D.

613
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,500
But I think the thing here is no one can deny that

614
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,540
system D is potentially heavier than it needs to be where it's,

615
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,890
for example, if you have process one,

616
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:10,530
which is the init system for the,

617
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,380
I'm not even going to get into the details of what that means.

618
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,589
But let's say you process one

619
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:15,729
that also is reading

620
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,780
a bunch of crazy data off the network and off the local

621
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,189
system through a socket and all this stuff is going on.

622
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,699
I don't think that's necessarily

623
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,630
a well thought out system.

624
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,969
This is one of those cases,

625
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:32,739
you really need to be using sub processes to be parsing external data, right?

626
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,219
Versus just doing it yourself because let's face it

627
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,579
someday. And this is a guarantee

628
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,500
there, there is going to be something someone sends you that creates a problem.

629
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:46,569
And when you're doing it all in a singular process, you have issue.

630
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:46,719
I mean,

631
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:49,989
this is why web browsers all have now moved to the environment

632
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,900
where they have individual processes for parsing things like tabs and web content

633
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,369
because it used to be one giant ball

634
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,390
and they got killed, right?

635
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,859
And this is the same story repeating, you know,

636
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:04,609
history repeats itself as they say and this is it right here.

637
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,189
I think we definitely need to,

638
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,189
you know, somewhat decompose applications and, you know,

639
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:12,589
sandbox various components, especially something

640
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,869
by definition, something like system D or process one has to be super powerful,

641
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,780
like even more powerful than root, you know.

642
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:20,099
Um

643
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:20,979
but at the

644
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:21,119
same

645
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,579
time, you know,

646
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:21,780
the

647
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,270
route,

648
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:22,880
I

649
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,560
mean,

650
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,430
it's, well, you can live without root, you can't live without process one.

651
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:28,479
And um

652
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:32,109
you know, especially in things like the container space where it, you know,

653
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,250
you're gonna end up with

654
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,609
tons of this stuff, right?

655
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,319
Um You know, one for each microservice,

656
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:39,300
right?

657
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,989
Whereas you used to just have one per physical machine

658
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,459
and we've,

659
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,920
I think part of the challenge is, you know, is people want stuff to work.

660
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,390
Like I remember

661
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,660
a few years ago I bought a little GSM

662
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,630
antenna puck USB thing, right?

663
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,489
It's like a little pocket puck shaped thing with a G uh sorry GPS antenna in it,

664
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,670
plugged it into my Linux machine

665
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:00,930
and it worked

666
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,619
the Linux machine

667
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:08,550
like accepted the USB device, turned it on and went, oh, this thing requires GPS D,

668
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:08,930
it,

669
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:11,699
it started up GPS D and

670
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:12,979
boom data.

671
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:15,760
Right. I didn't have to do anything and it was magical to me and,

672
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:20,099
you know, and unfortunately people want that and getting that kind of thing to work.

673
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,140
Say with the old school in it

674
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,329
is difficult at best,

675
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,219
you know, and we've got all these requirements now for computers that, you know,

676
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,969
nobody would have ever had 1015 years ago.

677
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:32,729
You know, I want my computer to sleep. I want it to hibernate. I want it to,

678
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,689
uh, I want to be able to

679
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:37,770
go across different wireless networks and have it

680
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,489
sleep on one and wake up on another,

681
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:39,930
you know,

682
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:41,969
and these are hard problems to solve and,

683
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,040
yeah.

684
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,099
Well, like you said, it's, uh,

685
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:47,640
we ended up with this giant monolithic thing called system D, you know,

686
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,550
that what I really love is that it even has its own internal logging.

687
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,660
Right. It doesn't use cis log. It uses the journal.

688
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,900
Oh, that's not even the craziest thing it does, man. It has its own DNS resolver.

689
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:57,930
Oh,

690
00:27:58,709 --> 00:27:59,819
yeah, exactly.

691
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:02,599
I, I'm just,

692
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:04,369
I'm trying to imagine a situation where you have

693
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,040
a system without a DNS library because typically they,

694
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,239
that come, that

695
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,079
those batteries are included.

696
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,849
I'm not even gonna ask,

697
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:18,280
I, again, this comes back to the system D fan system D hater.

698
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,060
And

699
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,119
rather than have an opinion,

700
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,400
I'll say

701
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:25,599
it seems a bit odd to me, but I will not judge

702
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:29,010
because I have not written the internet system.

703
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,609
So I can't really say if this is functionality we should have or not.

704
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,300
Yeah.

705
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:36,069
So,

706
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,489
yeah, I think, well, and it's, I see,

707
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,140
I've seen this with a lot of software projects where rather than, you know,

708
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,880
trust somebody else's implementation or use it, they write their own.

709
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,609
Uh

710
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,310
sometimes because they do need something a

711
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,260
bit more specific and sometimes because,

712
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,630
you know, not invented here, syndrome is strong and,

713
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:55,000
-- well, it's fun Droid code,
-- I think not invented here is

714
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,439
more common than not

715
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,540
because

716
00:28:57,689 --> 00:29:01,469
if something doesn't do what you need it to do, it's open source

717
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,589
patch. It,

718
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,510
right. Everyone's always saying patch is welcome

719
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:06,459
but

720
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,180
it's, it, it's easier said than done, of course.

721
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,170
Yeah.

722
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,280
So, yeah, I suspect at some point we'll see system D

723
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,130
will probably have to be decomposed if nothing else for performance. Right?

724
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,930
Because if you have,

725
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:23,849
if every single container has system D in it, that's a lot of overhead.

726
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,329
It is. And I don't even think it'll be performance as much as space

727
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:31,510
because right now system D is pretty big

728
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,959
and when people are worried about having containers

729
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:36,880
that are a couple of megabytes in size

730
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:38,609
that becomes an issue.

731
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:39,989
Yeah.

732
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:43,699
And uh, yeah, I've, I've always wondered why, you know,

733
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:47,310
we have this sort of UNIX pendulum of going between, you know,

734
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,020
on the one extreme we have that do one task, do it well.

735
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,160
And you know, you get some pretty extreme tools like that.

736
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:57,160
But then on the other hand, you know, tho those tools slowly grow over time, like uh

737
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,069
Grep said,

738
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:58,239
a,

739
00:29:58,369 --> 00:29:59,650
you know, those things have become,

740
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,310
I, I'm pretty sure ac is turning complete and I think set is as well

741
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:06,060
-- because it's got pattern back referencing.
-- Matt.

742
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,319
I'd be surprised if they weren't.

743
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,270
Yeah.

744
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,349
And I don't know that Grep is turning complete, but I'm guessing somebody could,

745
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,050
but I'm guessing somebody somewhere has done something terrible with it

746
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,670
and accidentally spawned an A I that then committed suicide.

747
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,030
But yeah, so, I mean, it's, yeah, it's interesting to me like,

748
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,069
I don't know what the answer is but I'm pretty sure what we currently have

749
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,709
is going to be found to be wrong in five years.

750
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:35,910
-- Like everything else was
-- everything is wrong. Kurt, it's all wrong.

751
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,670
We know that.

752
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:41,530
Uh so anyway, I think if we want to sum this one up

753
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,479
is,

754
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,079
first of all, I guess, let's say this too. Uh People make mistakes

755
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:50,140
and so I think being too hard on the system to

756
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,219
developers is wrong because anyone can make a mistake like this.

757
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:54,949
Now, granted, fuzzing could have caught it.

758
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:55,180
Yeah,

759
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,569
we should fuzz it whatever and we can blame ourselves for this as

760
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:00,900
well because we work for a company that is funding most of this development

761
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:05,209
and the security groups are part of have not fuzzed. So there's that right.

762
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,859
But there's also the fact that it might be too

763
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:10,180
big and it might be time to start thinking about

764
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:14,130
is this set up in the right way, especially from the security point of view.

765
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,170
And so that's potentially something for us to talk about in the future,

766
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,109
but fundamentally,

767
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,699
uh, love it or hate it.

768
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:21,290
It is what it is. Right.

769
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,459
Yeah.

770
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:24,339
Well, and it's, it's, I don't know if you've seen,

771
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,310
but in the cloud space there's been a couple of major companies

772
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,589
that have gone back to monolithic designs saying that it's easier.

773
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:29,859
It's,

774
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,650
you know, it's actually it works better for them in some ways.

775
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,670
So, like everything, you know, I think part of the problem with software is

776
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,020
there's like 10 right ways to do it

777
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:41,849
and then there's like a billion potential ways to do it.

778
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:44,689
And the problem is I find oftentimes those 10

779
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:46,920
right ways to do it often look vastly different,

780
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:48,890
you know,

781
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,609
and with a slight variation then they're also terrible.

782
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,250
Um, but more the point having working code is amazing. Right.

783
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,849
That's something that always gets me is that any of the stuff I turn it on and it works

784
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:01,109
for some definition of work.

785
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:02,930
So,

786
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,540
all right.

787
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,020
Moving on.

788
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,780
All right. So let's, let's bring it home. We've been chatting about this for a while.

789
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,939
Now, there's a story you found here about the need for an open security journal.

790
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:18,640
Yeah. I, this kind of comes back to that whole thing of like, we don't even

791
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,599
know what we've forgotten because it's not documented anywhere.

792
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,339
Like

793
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:23,180
what we know,

794
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,959
like, the fact that when it comes to, for example, for cryptography, the still quote

795
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:31,479
unquote best reference is applied crypto version, what two second edition.

796
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:32,670
And that's like,

797
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,099
so

798
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:34,959
actually,

799
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,000
if you talk to most

800
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:39,790
crypto guys, they do not like that book.

801
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:40,910
Yeah. Well, exactly.

802
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,199
So

803
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:42,849
we have

804
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:44,010
-- nothing
-- old. It's wrong,

805
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,170
you know. And that's, and that's the point, right is

806
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:50,030
for example, where, where can I, oh, here's a really simple question.

807
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:54,329
How much, you know, how should I securely create certificates

808
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,699
for SSL and TLS web servers?

809
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,010
Right? And, well,

810
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,000
most people are going to go to stack overflow to find out,

811
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,170
right? And there's some, some

812
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,630
not entirely correct stuff in there. And

813
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:09,930
-- how do I tell? Which is, which
-- I'm gonna be lucky if I get to stack overflow.

814
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:12,390
I'm just gonna type into Google how to make a certificate.

815
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,770
I'm gonna click the first link and then that's what I'm gonna do.

816
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,910
This is actually where, where I think let's encrypt is doing some really cool stuff

817
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,339
because they've taken away all of the dumb questions and you just

818
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:24,569
run a command and you fill in a couple of things and,

819
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:27,489
and a certificate appears and it's magic and I love it.

820
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:31,989
Yeah. As ugly as some of their code is. And as ugly as some of their processes. It's

821
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,680
way better than

822
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,530
the majority of the current system. Like,

823
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,150
it's, yeah, so it's as ugly as it is. I mean, we don't

824
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,449
have far to go to get better.

825
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:43,400
Um, so back to this, I mean, I,

826
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,969
because I've been reading some fascinating papers recently where

827
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:48,750
instead of just talking about stuff, they actually had data,

828
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
like, they actually had crazy.

829
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,750
I know it's so wild to like,

830
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:58,160
uh what was the one like talking about, you know, users clicking on links and typing,

831
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:58,319
you know,

832
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,310
just doing random stuff and they actually had like

833
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,959
a really decent sample size of a couple 100 people

834
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,770
that they, you know, tried this out with.

835
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,849
And so they actually had statistically significant results.

836
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,080
And

837
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:11,079
unfortunately, you know, again,

838
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:13,259
how do I tell those good papers from those bad papers?

839
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:14,309
-- It's
-- hard man.

840
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:19,789
And this is one of the challenges any journal has is there's always bad content.

841
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:20,108
In fact,

842
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:23,888
a number of journalists have recently come under fire for producing

843
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:26,009
bad content and it's not that they even knew it.

844
00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:29,368
It's just that people were submitting poor quality stuff

845
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:30,790
and it's,

846
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,649
it's hard to tell what it is and security

847
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,820
is even harder because security is often very binary where

848
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:41,510
there some advice can be questionable and that's ok

849
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,750
and some advice can be dangerous,

850
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,688
right?

851
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,449
And that's, I mean,

852
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,610
like rolling your own crypto would be a

853
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,270
great example is if somebody published a paper about

854
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,110
their new crypto algorithm.

855
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,780
Would you want in a security journal? Would you want people implementing that?

856
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:59,659
Because let's face it in, in 99% of those situations that is,

857
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:03,219
it's just completely terrible. And you should never be done

858
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:03,919
right

859
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,919
now.

860
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:06,050
At the same time,

861
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,820
I also don't want to be the naysayer that just

862
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,820
def we keep saying everything is impossible and nothing is real

863
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,989
because that's not helpful either.

864
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,949
And so this is, this is a tricky one man is,

865
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:20,229
how do we do something like this that makes it useful.

866
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:23,320
But also doesn't just burn everyone out involved because face it,

867
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,419
anyone who's gonna be reviewing these papers,

868
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,629
you're gonna, after reading about five you're gonna be done is my guess.

869
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:31,229
Yeah, I can, I,

870
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:34,840
I wonder if the journal format is the best way to do this because for example,

871
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,629
I look at something like Wikipedia, which is amazing for general knowledge stuff.

872
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,929
But then it's, it's, oh, I forget what that, um,

873
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,310
something amnesia where you basically read like a newspaper

874
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,830
article on a topic you're familiar with and they're,

875
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,350
they're wrong about stuff

876
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,590
and then you read other articles in that same newspaper here and you just,

877
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,449
you think they're correct.

878
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:52,909
Right. And

879
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,669
I've read Wikipedia articles about topics I'm very familiar with and noticed,

880
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,340
you know, errors and inconsistencies,

881
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,110
-- you know, you can fix those. Right. I,
-- I have, I have and,

882
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,179
um,

883
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,479
but then it makes me, you know, I kind of,

884
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:08,820
I'm guessing the rest of Wikipedia is just as wrong.

885
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:12,370
But it's, you know, it's vastly better than, well,

886
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,000
what we have in the security industry, which is basically nothing at this point.

887
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:15,830
I,

888
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:16,540
yes,

889
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,010
I, I've written about this before, even the fact that

890
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:23,090
if we had tribal knowledge that would be better than what we have today.

891
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,870
So, and then the other thing too is there's so much,

892
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,510
I mean, there's potentially so much shenanigans going like,

893
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,189
because the security industry tends to attract trolls and, you know,

894
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,550
other annoying people

895
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,020
in a way that other industries don't sometimes.

896
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,909
-- And, you know,
-- I mean, do you think we're worse than anywhere else?

897
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:43,500
I, I honestly don't know, I feel like maybe we are but

898
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,989
I think for a lot of people it's, it's, you know,

899
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,239
how many people would love to prove Bruce Schneier

900
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,830
wrong.

901
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,989
And so, or, you know, those people that submit those like Markov

902
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,300
chaining generated papers to, you know, journals that were just gibberish,

903
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:56,899
you know,

904
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,239
they would love to do that to security people because again,

905
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,689
security people tend to be so binary and they tend to be so mean to everybody else.

906
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:03,060
I mean,

907
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,889
let's face it, right?

908
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:07,100
The security industry is not generally full of nice understanding, kind,

909
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,939
caring people,

910
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:08,939
you know,

911
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:12,280
they're typically burnt out because they're, you know,

912
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,020
equally frustrated by everybody else.

913
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:17,000
So I suspect this journal idea would be a lot

914
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:20,060
harder just on a process level. But

915
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,399
the other problem too is, I mean,

916
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:23,649
you might write a paper that's entirely correct today

917
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,540
and then tomorrow somebody finds out the math is wrong

918
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:29,110
but, you know, you based part of this on or something like that.

919
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,620
-- I mean,
-- but that's true of any industry.

920
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:35,500
I mean, there are medical papers that were published five years ago that we now know,

921
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,340
like, are, are dangerous to do these things, right?

922
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:38,820
This is,

923
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,000
that's totally true in any industry.

924
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,739
Do they have feedback mechanisms for that? Like, do they update the papers or

925
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,840
I have no idea. That's a really good question. Actually, I'm not sure what they do.

926
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:54,060
One thing I'd want to see is, you know, the ability to curate and,

927
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,600
and keep it sort of up to date to say like, yeah, this paper was correct

928
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,050
on this date.

929
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,610
But now it's like really, really bad idea because, you know,

930
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,330
Josh figured out how to quantum

931
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,280
entangled

932
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,000
photons

933
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,330
of prime numbers or God knows what.

934
00:38:07,629 --> 00:38:10,330
And that's part of the challenge I see in stack overflow whenever I look for,

935
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:10,689
you know,

936
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:11,659
uh

937
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,399
answers is, I mean, some things are so generic that OK, that's fine.

938
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,590
You know, they, they're always correct or whatever. But,

939
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,530
you know, some of these things have changed drastically.

940
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,350
This,

941
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,209
we just talked about this earlier is I was doing some work with go over the weekend

942
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,110
and I realized that the,

943
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,750
the math slash rand

944
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:33,909
random number generator in go is preceded by default.

945
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:36,949
So it is an insecure random number generator. And of course, the DOCS

946
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,189
say

947
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,590
exactly

948
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:40,729
you can, you can add your own seed.

949
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,000
But this one and, and the DOCS even say like do not use this for crypto operations,

950
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,189
right?

951
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,620
No question that that's fine.

952
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:47,310
But

953
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:51,389
if you're doing a search for, say how to generate random numbers and go,

954
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:54,189
you're gonna get this example to pop up.

955
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:56,770
And of course, the example doesn't say don't do this.

956
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,909
It just shows you how to get your job done. And so

957
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,429
I actually, I did some digging on github

958
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,790
and I found a handful of uses that, that sort of scared me a little bit.

959
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,050
But at the same time, the thing I keep coming to here is this is 2016.

960
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,239
We have no excuse for having an insecure

961
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,649
random number generator available in a popular language.

962
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:16,909
-- And they all do
-- though.

963
00:39:17,379 --> 00:39:20,969
One quick question, dude. Not only OK, so it's deterministic by default,

964
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:24,169
I'm assuming also if you see it twice with the same number,

965
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:25,760
you get the exact same output.

966
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,780
-- I mean, that's how seeds work with random number generators,
-- right?

967
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,939
Well, some are, you know,

968
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:33,100
they have mixing in to try and make it somewhat non deterministic.

969
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,020
But um so it's not even, it's, it's

970
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,330
basically what I'm trying to get it from a security point of view.

971
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,260
This is great because

972
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:39,290
it is

973
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:40,979
a random number generator.

974
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:43,540
Uh that is not really,

975
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,310
it's not pseudorandom even.

976
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,179
It's just deterministically give it a seed and it grinds out some determined

977
00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:51,350
output.

978
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:52,120
Right.

979
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:52,860
And,

980
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,409
-- and so, so let's tie this
-- to

981
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,159
explain that to a normal person. I fear and why that they're wrong to use. This is,

982
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,479
you know, I, I fear that that's not going to be an easy conversation.

983
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:03,719
No, I, I totally get it.

984
00:40:03,729 --> 00:40:07,360
And so, but let's tie this back now to this concept of a security journal

985
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,070
is

986
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:10,419
we've been making this mistake

987
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,340
since we've started using computers and it really

988
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,889
no one cared until maybe five years ago.

989
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,169
And so this is a great example of where you're, you know, five years ago,

990
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:23,530
this advice was bad and now now it's something or five years ago,

991
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,929
the advice was fine and now it's bad.

992
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:25,330
Right?

993
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,449
How do, who decides that? Because I guarantee you, I've not done this.

994
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:35,280
But if I go to the go upstream guys and say this is nonsense, this thing should be

995
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:38,159
random from the start and because people are going to use it,

996
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,120
you know, they're gonna come back with me and say,

997
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,679
but the doc say not to do it.

998
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,310
And that's

999
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:45,939
bonkers. Right.

1000
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,090
Well, to me it's, you know,

1001
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:52,889
I tell my kids not to run with scissors and I also put the knives away

1002
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,340
because they're kids, they, they make mistakes and

1003
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,129
I feel, you know, that that's one of the things that gets me about programming.

1004
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:01,399
Programming is always, you know, I want the choice,

1005
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:03,050
I want the tools I want to be able to do it my way.

1006
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,199
Because what if I have this weird requirement? Corner case. Well,

1007
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,300
too bad, you know, if you really do,

1008
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:12,000
then you can go spin some crazy monstrosity yourself.

1009
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,219
But

1010
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,620
yeah, like you said, for the majority of people, if you call like a random number,

1011
00:41:16,629 --> 00:41:17,399
it should be

1012
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,760
not just random but like cryptographically secure random

1013
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,929
because people are probably going to use it in that way.

1014
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,750
-- They're
-- totally gonna

1015
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:24,989
use it.

1016
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,020
People

1017
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:26,280
do.

1018
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:27,780
But here's the thing. All right.

1019
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,469
So running with scissors playing with knives, bad ideas.

1020
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:32,919
We have a journal of

1021
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:34,100
Children

1022
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,080
and you publish an article that says you shouldn't do this.

1023
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:41,729
And what happens when half of the board says Kurt's an idiot,

1024
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,929
kids should know better.

1025
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:45,659
And the other half says, yeah, that's good advice to publish this.

1026
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,169
And I, I fear

1027
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:48,290
that is we.

1028
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,379
Uh so I guess going to the fundamental core of security

1029
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:57,629
is I don't feel like we have enough kind of foundational elements

1030
00:41:58,189 --> 00:42:02,949
that we could even have a journal without it being just a massive flame war.

1031
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:03,879
Well,

1032
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,320
I would go even further to say we don't

1033
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,770
even have like a basic ontology of vocabulary for.

1034
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:13,449
And I actually just got, if you actually just

1035
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,610
one hour ago, a good old Harold booth from Nest posted to the CV editorial board

1036
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,610
basically saying that they are working on

1037
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:22,770
uh

1038
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:27,270
a draft announcement for, you know, a vulnerability description ontology

1039
00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:29,310
so that we can describe vulnerabilities

1040
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,330
-- and we all use the same language.
-- I love that

1041
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:38,189
-- it's 2016 and we're just getting around to this. And
-- how many pages is this draft

1042
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:40,209
like 27,000 or

1043
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,110
I mean,

1044
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:43,139
it is

1045
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,219
establishing a secure connection?

1046
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,479
-- That's good, of
-- course, and,

1047
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:49,860
and let's face it without you telling me if it's more than three pages,

1048
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,189
nobody's going to read it

1049
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:54,189
except maybe like you and Art Mann. Right.

1050
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:54,929
Here

1051
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:56,679
we

1052
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,020
go.

1053
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,010
Uh It's actually only 37

1054
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:00,580
pages,

1055
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,899
only 37 pages.

1056
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,100
And you know,

1057
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,090
that that's gonna be fascinating edge of the seat material. Right?

1058
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:09,969
Yeah. Yeah.

1059
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,409
Yeah. And I mean, but the reality is we, you know, like

1060
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:14,889
here's the

1061
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:16,879
two

1062
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,020
together

1063
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:20,570
like you get, yeah, you get an engineer from India,

1064
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,969
an engineer from Australia and an engineer from Canada together

1065
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,459
and they're gonna be able to have a conversation without

1066
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,739
you walk into a bar.

1067
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:27,969
Yeah. You know,

1068
00:43:28,629 --> 00:43:31,709
except maybe the American engineer who wants to use like foot pounds or whatever,

1069
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:32,510
foot

1070
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:33,050
pounds.

1071
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,389
Yes.

1072
00:43:34,209 --> 00:43:35,979
And I hate the English system so much. Actually,

1073
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,370
I'm,

1074
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:39,459
I'm brainwashing my Children to love the metric system

1075
00:43:39,469 --> 00:43:42,199
and despise English units because they're so stupid.

1076
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,840
But that's, we're not going to get into that today.

1077
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,340
But uh anyway, so, I mean, yeah, that's the thing is you know,

1078
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,169
all these other industries are mature enough that they just

1079
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:54,229
take this for granted that they have a common language

1080
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:57,909
-- or that they have a language
-- I want, I mean, I guess you're right,

1081
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:00,389
but they also, it took them time to get there.

1082
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:01,370
I mean,

1083
00:44:01,479 --> 00:44:04,629
the medical field certainly didn't show up one day and was like,

1084
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,360
all right here is the way it's gonna work guys.

1085
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,070
You know, they, they,

1086
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,550
they were murdering people for thousands of years essentially.

1087
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,870
And then they finally decided, like we're gonna figure out what's going on here.

1088
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,709
And I imagine the auto industry is probably very similar

1089
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,949
and I suspect every industry has gone through this.

1090
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:18,389
And,

1091
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:19,629
I mean,

1092
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:23,659
man, being in the middle of security some days, I feel like we're too slow

1093
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:24,699
in other days.

1094
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:28,389
I feel like this is impossible and other days I feel like, you know, maybe,

1095
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,300
maybe we're getting it, we're figuring it out.

1096
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:30,810
So,

1097
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:32,379
I don't know. Today is, uh,

1098
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:35,270
I, I think today I feel like we might be figuring it out.

1099
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:36,300
I

1100
00:44:36,419 --> 00:44:38,739
just, I wonder if we have enough time because, you know,

1101
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,020
as I pointed out before everybody that ships,

1102
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,239
stuff is shipping stuff with software on it now

1103
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,939
and all this stuff is being attached to the internet.

1104
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:49,500
-- Yeah,
-- that, that is a good question and I don't even think it's a good question of,

1105
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,620
do we have time?

1106
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:51,810
I mean,

1107
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,000
we don't need time. That's not our problem.

1108
00:44:55,899 --> 00:44:59,080
How how bad does it have to get before people start caring

1109
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:02,300
is maybe the right question to ask because let's face it.

1110
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,199
In general. People don't care about security because it gets in the way.

1111
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,030
I mean, I think, I think deep down they, they want to,

1112
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:12,669
but when it comes down to it at the end of the day, this is kind of like

1113
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,260
if I have tools with a safety guard on it, the safety guard gets in the way,

1114
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,659
I'm taking that thing off.

1115
00:45:17,669 --> 00:45:19,219
You know, I picked my table so I did that on it.

1116
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:21,280
It came with a nice little kick back guard and,

1117
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:21,989
and

1118
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,350
seriously, the first time I used it, it got in the way.

1119
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,649
I'm like, well, that's enough of that and off it went, it's never been back on since.

1120
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:28,790
Oh, dear.

1121
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:29,409
I just,

1122
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,149
I just haven't used my table

1123
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:32,350
so

1124
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,179
saw enough to actually want to remove it. I'll be honest,

1125
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:36,850
my

1126
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:38,510
fee,

1127
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,360
my chop

1128
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,879
saw has that little red line on it saying

1129
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:43,479
don't put your fingers over this red line and I

1130
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:46,709
-- do it constantly.
-- Totally do all the time. Yes.

1131
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:47,879
Right.

1132
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,070
I get it. I mean, I get it. I'm not saying it's right, but I get

1133
00:45:52,389 --> 00:45:52,409
it.

1134
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:56,679
So, I mean, we can't even get people to look both ways before they cross the street.

1135
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:57,580
I,

1136
00:45:57,739 --> 00:46:01,189
yeah, walk in Boston for a couple of days and you'll, you'll fix that.

1137
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,469
You learn quick,

1138
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,060
especially on one way. Streets.

1139
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:07,530
I

1140
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:07,939
think

1141
00:46:08,939 --> 00:46:13,310
how, I guess going back to your thing? Yeah. How do we decide, then who gets to decide?

1142
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,639
Right. Who's, do we just leave it to Bruce Schneier?

1143
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,399
-- No,
-- I think you should listen

1144
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:18,429
to me.

1145
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,469
I will be the decider.

1146
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:24,010
Uh, no. Well, ok, so, you know what, here's the deal is,

1147
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:25,270
I think

1148
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:30,750
if we have a more scientific rigor to our industry and this comes back to NIST,

1149
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,699
putting together

1150
00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:33,860
that kind of, you know,

1151
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,590
fundamental language we get to use and this needs to exist elsewhere.

1152
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,699
I think once we have a more scientific basis to kind of decide what we're doing,

1153
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,689
it will become easier

1154
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:48,860
to decide what is right and what is wrong in the context of security.

1155
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,260
Because today, it is almost entirely based off of opinion.

1156
00:46:52,919 --> 00:46:55,659
And of course, my opinion is the right one

1157
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,149
and that's basically what everybody thinks except, you know, obviously in my case,

1158
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,489
it, it actually is right,

1159
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:02,739
which is again

1160
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:05,820
and you end up with this where everyone's like, oh, I respect your opinion.

1161
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:06,820
Well, except I really don't.

1162
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:08,679
And it, it's kind of a mess.

1163
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:12,620
And we see this though because we see it when people argue about how to fix

1164
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:17,090
certain issues or they argue about is this particular bug a security issue or not?

1165
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,419
I mean,

1166
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,560
you see this all the time, man, you've got a researcher shows up and he's like,

1167
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,360
I've found the worst security bug ever.

1168
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:24,810
I mean, bad luck is a great example of that. Right? They got

1169
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:28,040
the Domain, they made a big deal. I mean, they, they should have had a theme song

1170
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:28,560
for the thing

1171
00:47:30,189 --> 00:47:30,219
to

1172
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:31,939
-- remember
-- and it came out and we're like,

1173
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,250
this is, it like, this sucks. What's up, man?

1174
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,169
And, and,

1175
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,120
yeah, that was the sam

1176
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,419
of one that, uh, Cerne did

1177
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:42,209
and the poor researcher who found it, like, yeah, that was good work.

1178
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:43,649
And he got killed

1179
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:47,729
in, out there in the wild because we decided it wasn't good enough.

1180
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,260
Well, although honestly, I think

1181
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,840
nothing short of some sort of root level

1182
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:54,879
worm

1183
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,840
would have lived up to the hype.

1184
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:57,709
So

1185
00:47:57,899 --> 00:47:59,500
don't hype your issues guys.

1186
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:00,030
We

1187
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:02,320
do tend to eat our young in the security industry.

1188
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,080
Yeah.

1189
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,419
Yeah, I think that's fair. But again, I think part of that comes back to

1190
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,000
it's so heavily based on experience and opinion.

1191
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,010
It's difficult to kind of bring us up to the next level.

1192
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,050
And there are very few people who can objectively look at things

1193
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,330
without bringing, you know, kind of their own personal feelings into, into the mix.

1194
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:21,929
Yeah.

1195
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:23,760
But no, I have hope like, I mean,

1196
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:26,979
nist is a great example. They've done some really good work, you know.

1197
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,139
Um, and more to the point they actually publish their stuff

1198
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,290
and it's,

1199
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:34,030
they keep it up to date. That's the biggest thing too I find is,

1200
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,060
you know, I've read a lot of these things where people talk about these things and it,

1201
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,620
it was written five years ago

1202
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:39,219
and

1203
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,929
is it still correct? Is it

1204
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:43,570
not? Is it?

1205
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:48,479
Well? And this comes back to the journal thing is if you're not paying people to care,

1206
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,239
they don't.

1207
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:50,929
And in fact, uh

1208
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,360
it, this is one of the great challenges is it's easy to say,

1209
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,120
I'll volunteer to work on this journal and I might for a month.

1210
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,889
But then when real life kicks in, it's like,

1211
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,850
well, this sucks.

1212
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,320
I mean, I don't want to work on this stupid journal anymore for free.

1213
00:49:03,969 --> 00:49:07,030
And so it's tough, man. It's, it's a hard problem.

1214
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,669
I don't, I don't know if we have a good answer for it today. But I guess

1215
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,899
let's, let's take it home.

1216
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:13,030
We think.

1217
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:15,669
And again, I, sadly, this is opinion,

1218
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,379
but

1219
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:18,989
we think one of the bigger problems here is the fact that

1220
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,389
we need the science of security and we don't have that today.

1221
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,270
And so

1222
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,229
to all you listeners out there,

1223
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:28,510
if you have ideas or there's something we're not aware of

1224
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,790
or you think there's something we should be paying attention to

1225
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,620
let us know. We would love to hear from you about the science of security.

1226
00:49:35,399 --> 00:49:35,939
All right.

1227
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,169
And with that,

1228
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,159
any final final thoughts, Kurt,

1229
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:41,459
if you have data, please share it.

1230
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:42,939
Yeah,

1231
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,189
in a friendly format.

1232
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:47,139
Not a PDF.

1233
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,159
Every time somebody sends me a PDF with a security thing,

1234
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:52,290
I'm just like uh run it through virus.

1235
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,340
Hope that for the virus,

1236
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:54,719
right?

1237
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:57,290
Oh, I love it.

1238
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:00,120
All right. Well, I guess until next time. Thanks for listening folks.

1239
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:02,659
Again, if you want all the show notes, all the fun links,

1240
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:05,770
all the stories we talked about it will be on open source security podcast.com.

1241
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,179
-- And I guess, yeah, until next time. Thanks for listening.
-- Thanks.

1242
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:10,290
Have a great week, everybody.
