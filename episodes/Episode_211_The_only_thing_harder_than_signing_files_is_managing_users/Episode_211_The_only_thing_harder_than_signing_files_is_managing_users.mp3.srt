Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

1
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:11,560
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,689
Oh, man. So, you know what something

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,260
I,

4
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:16,969
-- we laugh
-- because

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,129
300 in the bunker

6
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:20,420
is it?

7
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:21,600
I don't, it's been

8
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:22,329
years

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:22,899
I

10
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:23,409
think,

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:23,879
I don't

12
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:24,750
know.

13
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:28,530
I have no idea anymore. Time is an illusion.

14
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:29,489
That's,

15
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,209
that is my life now.

16
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,569
I think of it every day.

17
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:35,209
I can't even imagine how bad it is for our kids. Right.

18
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,169
Because they've been out of school for five months.

19
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,639
Yeah.

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,209
Yeah. Actually it's funny because

21
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,330
we were talking to our Children about going back to

22
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,639
school and they're going to do all virtual and stuff.

23
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,630
And my daughter's like, I just want to go to a real school and we're like,

24
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,729
yeah, we want you to go too. But

25
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:53,330
you can't. So there you go.

26
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,270
It's

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,259
anyway. Anyway, whatever it is,

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,389
it

29
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:00,419
is what it is. The dumpster fire of 2020.

30
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,869
Well,

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,989
the good news is there's other people that do silly things and take years to fix

32
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:09,900
what seemed to me to be pretty, I don't want to say a simple security flight.

33
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,940
It's simple on the surface and I know it's more complicated under the surface,

34
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:13,800
but fundamentally,

35
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:17,059
it seems like this is something Microsoft should have fixed a long time ago.

36
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:17,959
Yeah, why don't you

37
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:20,857
issue and then we can go into some details.

38
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:23,577
So as we all know if you're going to distribute files,

39
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:26,457
signing them is the most perfect way to secure the whole thing, right?

40
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:29,817
You sign the file, customer downloads the file checks the signature,

41
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:30,897
the signature is safe.

42
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,387
What could go wrong? Nothing, right?

43
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:33,857
It's not like people could go by code

44
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:35,637
signing certificates or steal them or anything,

45
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:35,777
right?

46
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:37,497
That's just not possible. So it's fine.

47
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:40,577
And so the deal is you download like an MSI installer, your system,

48
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:43,296
your windows machine checks the file signature, the

49
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:47,293
signature matches and you're you're totally safe to double click on it.

50
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,653
Nothing can go wrong. Sure.

51
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:50,973
And then, well,

52
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:54,353
there's this little annoying problem of apparently with an M SI file,

53
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:56,314
you can actually append data to the back of it.

54
00:01:56,323 --> 00:02:00,094
Like you can take the M SI file and like literally cat space file name, you know,

55
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:02,564
greater than greater than M SI and just jam a bunch

56
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:05,153
of data onto the back of the M SI sort of.

57
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:08,143
Yeah, I mean it's conceptually it's that simple like it's not,

58
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,490
-- you don't need a hex
-- editor.

59
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:12,610
Well, ok, so here is what's actually happening

60
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,610
and

61
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:17,811
this is hilarious for all of the right reasons.

62
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:23,600
So it's not just M si it, it, well, ok, you can take any M si, ok.

63
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,531
It just has to be a signed M SI

64
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,251
which is like the Microsoft installer format or whatever.

65
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:32,850
And you then append a jar file to the end

66
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,880
and then you rename

67
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,649
the new file

68
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:41,779
with a dot Jar extension. What happens is hilariously stupid.

69
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,380
So a jar file is just a zip file, the,

70
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:49,130
the lovable compression format we've all had for a million years.

71
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:49,600
And

72
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:54,570
this is important because floppy disks are part of this story, right?

73
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,889
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll,

74
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:59,850
I'll let you wait in suspense as to how floppy disks come into play here.

75
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,729
But so anyway, you append these two files, you rename it dot Jar.

76
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,330
And so basically what happens is if there's a signature check

77
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:11,634
on the file, it's going to pass because the way a signature works is

78
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:15,865
these M si files, basically, there's like the, the file content, right?

79
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,524
The actual meat of the file

80
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:19,725
and then it's wrapped around a little shell

81
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,384
and the little shell basically says like,

82
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:21,675
oh, there,

83
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:24,904
here's the signature and here's what's in the file and here's what's going on

84
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:29,735
and that's the thing that windows or antivirus or whatever is going to look at

85
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:30,535
and then check.

86
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,324
But the beauty of it is, it'll say, OK, I'm the wrapper around the content.

87
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:39,529
Here's the signature and the next 10,000 bytes is the file, right?

88
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:42,160
So obviously the thing is going to check the 10,000 bytes,

89
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:43,630
it's going to calculate the check sum.

90
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,660
It's going to check the signature and it says everything checks out. That's great.

91
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,389
Except there's uh megabytes of garbage on the end.

92
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,380
But we'll just ignore that because we don't care.

93
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,380
Technically speaking, if you treat it as an M si it doesn't matter.

94
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,979
It's right. It's metadata, whatever. Now,

95
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,610
zip files,

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,020
they have the unique property of storing the metadata for zip at the very end.

97
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,029
Well, it makes sense.

98
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,779
Well, it makes sense in the context of why they do it in history.

99
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:11,779
This is where the floppies come in.

100
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,339
So back in the day, you had the ability to tell the PK zip command,

101
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,500
which is,

102
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:24,329
that's a blast from the past on M sds that I want you to zip this data

103
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,329
onto floppy disks.

104
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,440
And I don't know how many it will take because obviously you can't,

105
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:33,200
you can't say, OK, I've got 12 megabytes of data.

106
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,760
You're going to need,

107
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,369
you know, 10 floppy disks or whatever.

108
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,059
There's no way to prec calculate that in a reasonable manner.

109
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,260
Well,

110
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:42,450
this also assumes that your floppy disks actually hold

111
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,369
1.44 megabytes because I don't know about you.

112
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,600
But I,

113
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:47,000
I had a tendency to recycle those free AOL floppy

114
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,359
disk that would hold anywhere from a couple 100 K to

115
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,910
-- whatever they were supposed to hold.
-- Exactly.

116
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,640
And I mean, there were different sizes of floppy disk, whatever.

117
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,079
There's a million things that could happen.

118
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:56,570
So basically,

119
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,970
what zip did is it just started zipping crap and writing to disk it fill up a floppy,

120
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,119
say give me a new floppy

121
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,322
and it didn't care how big it was, whatever, it didn't matter.

122
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,013
You just start feeding it floppies and then it gets to the end and it says I'm all done.

123
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:11,622
Now, I'm going to write the metadata onto the floppies.

124
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,053
And so if you ever then unzipped,

125
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,352
it would basically say unzip this file on this floppy and then say, oh,

126
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:17,852
insert the last disk.

127
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:21,132
OK. Now I know what's going on now, insert these disks anyway.

128
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:25,472
The long story is that basically the signatures

129
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:27,053
checked at the beginning of the file,

130
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:30,812
the zip content is at the end jar files are just zip files.

131
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,645
So you rename it dot Jar.

132
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:33,966
It passes signature checks,

133
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:37,626
you double click it and it's going to run your malicious jar content.

134
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:40,006
Well, and also I think there's a subtle thing where

135
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:44,376
the signed file is a signed portion of the file.

136
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:47,795
And that is a big distinction because when I heard this, I'm like, wait,

137
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,346
how can you have a signed file that has crap in it.

138
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:52,735
That's not signed, that is no longer a signed file.

139
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:55,645
You've signed part of the file, this other crap. What is that? Like?

140
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,205
-- It's not signed, it's not part of the signed file. It shouldn't be
-- there.

141
00:05:58,216 --> 00:05:59,536
It's metadata.

142
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:04,640
And I think that I, I think it's, well, so it's that perfect combination of

143
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,369
one thing reads from the front, one thing reads from the back

144
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:08,350
and

145
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:10,750
it treats a signed, it's,

146
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,489
I hate using the word signed file in this context because in my mind,

147
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,130
a signed file means the entire file is signed like an R PM

148
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,920
-- or like a AP GP.
-- Well, R PM does this too though.

149
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,170
Yeah. Well, exactly.

150
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:26,279
-- And that's broken
-- R PM literally does exactly this.

151
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,010
So, and here's so here's a challenge.

152
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,420
Here's something like a thought experiment for all of us. I want you

153
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,320
to have a file

154
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,269
that has the check sum of the file

155
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,239
as content in the file.

156
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,859
-- I've done that with shell scripts. No,
-- you didn't.

157
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:41,769
Yeah. Yeah,

158
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,790
I don't believe you.

159
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,799
What you do though is so you have a shell script like it's,

160
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,850
and it's like basically bang bin bash

161
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:52,119
and then you have like check some equals whatever number and then you basically

162
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,779
have a function that reads the entire file except for the top two lines,

163
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,630
check sums it.

164
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,369
I don't mean that that's cheating.

165
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,109
-- That's literally what you
-- want.

166
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,040
The signature embedded in the file with the whole file.

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,489
-- OK.
-- Well, then you basically you use MD five and a bunch of playstations.

168
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:09,010
Yeah,

169
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,820
that is,

170
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,489
don't use MD five, please.

171
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,549
Actually with MD five, you could probably do some magic to do it.

172
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,929
-- But here's the point,
-- right?

173
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,420
No, no, no, there's, there's, there's source code out there to build

174
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,929
these files. OK. Maybe.

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,390
But here's,

176
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,570
here's the point of this thought experiment is

177
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,220
signing the whole file is basically computationally impossible,

178
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,250
especially if you're using say like sha 512, which is very large and is slow.

179
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,395
And so that's why they kind of sheet in this way.

180
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:38,536
Now, this is also why there's things called detached signatures

181
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:41,876
where you can, for example, say here is a whole file.

182
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:45,096
I want you to sign it and then put the signature in this file over here.

183
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:49,036
And that gives you obviously an instance where now you can

184
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:52,555
sign the entire file. You don't just have to sign parts of it.

185
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:55,645
And I mean, this is, this is perpetually a challenge because

186
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:59,496
what do you sign? How do you sign it? Do you sign all of the content?

187
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:00,256
Do you sign the headers?

188
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:04,122
Like this is a challenge at R PM, for example, where you have an R PM header,

189
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:05,721
then you have R PM content.

190
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:11,742
-- What do we sign? How do we do this?
-- I would say honestly at this point in it's 2020. Yes.

191
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:12,582
Sign everything.

192
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:14,022
Well, I mean, yeah, I agree.

193
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:16,492
You sign the content and the headers like come on guys, it's

194
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:19,872
girls like it's, it's 2020 we sign everything because

195
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:20,981
if you don't sign it,

196
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,941
somebody's going to tamper with it and we're all going to

197
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:25,182
-- end up in tears
-- even if you do sign it.

198
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:25,842
Yeah.

199
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:26,691
OK.

200
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,019
Yeah. So, no, I get it.

201
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:30,339
But, I mean, the thing is too,

202
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,880
we've had a lot of systems that have signed things reasonably correctly.

203
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,140
So it's not like this is impossible. Oh, right.

204
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,820
It's, it's definitely, and look, here's the thing.

205
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,359
So I'm going to this Microsoft bug, I would break down in two pieces.

206
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:47,500
-- There's the angle of this was a stupid mistake and they obviously fixed it
-- after two,

207
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,525
after being notified, two years after they were notified,

208
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:51,815
it took longer than it should have.

209
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:54,184
And I don't think there's necessarily a great excuse for that.

210
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:56,405
But my suspicion is the reason it took so long

211
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,965
is they were like,

212
00:08:58,244 --> 00:08:59,844
how, you know,

213
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:02,244
you've got to get a file on the system and then

214
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:04,784
a user has to double click the file and like,

215
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,525
how often is that really going to happen?

216
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:10,034
So this Windows 10 computer I just bought and

217
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:12,465
the drivers I was downloading from the motherboard website.

218
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,830
Uh, there's some pretty sketchy,

219
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,630
like I was downloading some stuff that wasn't signed and it's just like, you know,

220
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,340
click the ignore button and continue with.

221
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,710
Yes and like enter your password to force Windows to install it.

222
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:26,070
And I'm kind of like, well, I guess I want my network to work so I better do this.

223
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,349
And, um,

224
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,919
there was, you know, I was downloading science stuff and in one instance,

225
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:32,869
my favorite is I bought a new computer mouse

226
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,169
-- and the driver for it. Was actually hosted off of mega.
-- Yeah, you told me about that.

227
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,179
That's hilarious.

228
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,309
I guess that's a cheap way to host a file.

229
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,090
But, like, it's an unsigned file coming off of mega.

230
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:44,440
I'm like,

231
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,739
I'm throwing this thing through virus total and it's one of the

232
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,590
few instances where the file had been put through virus total.

233
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,909
Well, a lot, like a long time ago.

234
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,719
So somebody else had that thought too where they're like, you want me to do what? Now?

235
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,460
With where?

236
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,869
Um, so no, this is, there's tons

237
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,520
of, and the thing is also, I was getting signed M SI files

238
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,950
and signed DXC files to, you know,

239
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,400
install various drivers and stuff off of insecure

240
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:10,049
websites or off of insecure content delivery networks.

241
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:14,630
So there's a ton of signed files floating around out there.

242
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,669
And then my favorite thing is, of course, is what happens if you Google like

243
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:22,909
your, your, your most part, your most part number. Slap space drivers.

244
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:23,349
Do you?

245
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,840
Does it,

246
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:26,590
does Google Point you at the like Corsair or

247
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,979
Steel Series website first or some like dodgy,

248
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:30,309
like most drivers.com?

249
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:33,599
I mean, you never know. That's one of the challenges always.

250
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,200
It, it could go anywhere.

251
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,429
Some of these drivers were like most drivers.com or whatever and I'm like, nope,

252
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,200
not going there.

253
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:42,580
-- Yeah. No, I, I
-- agree. You and your printer drivers for your relatives.

254
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:47,859
Yeah, this is, this is why I just buy crappy mice off Amazon that don't need drivers.

255
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,739
I'm not a cool kid. Anyway.

256
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,580
Anyway, anyway,

257
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,619
so I think sort of the root cause of this whole thing

258
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,270
is that there's no established way to handle and treat a file,

259
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,510
right?

260
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,099
Like is a file, a zip file because it says dot zip or is it a file, a zip file?

261
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:06,270
Because the file is actually physically like a zip file as far as I know there's,

262
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,630
there's no iso or

263
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:10,309
standard on this, right. You just kind of do your best.

264
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,669
And,

265
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,030
yeah, I, it's, it's complicated. Right.

266
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,130
I agree. The good news is they fixed it.

267
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:21,299
The bad news is that, you know, how many systems got infected by this?

268
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:22,309
We will never know.

269
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,750
I know.

270
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,809
Let's just say, hey,

271
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,270
users don't download crap off the internet because it's your fault.

272
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,450
There we go. Problem solve.

273
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,140
Well, and this is what drives me nuts.

274
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,320
I, I should be able to reasonably download files and

275
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,890
run them now, whether or not, you know,

276
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,229
if I give a file permission to install to my system then, yeah,

277
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,359
kind of all bets are off.

278
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:46,039
But even that shouldn't be so unsafe that it like bricks my system or, you know,

279
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,140
totally destroys my system.

280
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,299
Which, uh, you know,

281
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,729
I think that's a pretty simple reason why tablets have taken off.

282
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:53,799
Right. Because you, you can't screw up your tablet like this.

283
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:54,750
Yeah.

284
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,919
Like there's literally nothing my kids can do their tablet that would mess it up.

285
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,489
Versus if I gave Felix admin privileges on the Windows 10 machine, what, maybe a day,

286
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,489
two days

287
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,340
before

288
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:05,489
a

289
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,140
-- couple of hours,
-- man.

290
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:13,909
I mean, I, I, so I actually gave my kids admin access to the Windows machines.

291
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,260
I have an admin account and I gave them the PIN code and I was like,

292
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,969
just try not to screw it up too bad.

293
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:21,320
But yeah, that machine as far as I'm concerned

294
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:22,979
is an adversary.

295
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,650
I never use it in a,

296
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,299
we'll say, man, like I, I've never logged into Google on it. I've never logged in.

297
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,260
The only thing I log into is Steam so I can play games.

298
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,090
And I'm like, you know what, it would suck if my Steam account got stolen,

299
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:38,080
but I would not cry too hard if it did.

300
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:42,460
So I can live with that. I would lose my 500 games. I've never played that would

301
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,520
anyway. Anyway.

302
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:49,270
All right, let's move on to the git lab news story that we found.

303
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,760
So I will, I will explain this one basically Git lab which is like an open source.

304
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:54,989
Github

305
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,059
competitor.

306
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,880
Fundamentally said we're not going to allow

307
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,109
support to reset multi

308
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,500
authentication on free accounts.

309
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:08,380
And I'm curious, just give me your hot take on this. What do you think?

310
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:08,679
Funny,

311
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,479
you mentioned that I was just logging into youtube on

312
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,059
my ipad and I was having trouble and it said,

313
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,900
basically log in with your key or a PIN code

314
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,140
and if none of this works and you need to recover your code,

315
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,460
it's going to be 3 to 5 business days to contact Google

316
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:21,989
and

317
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,289
I have a paid Google account with which allows

318
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:26,729
me to have the advanced protection turned on,

319
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,770
which I do have turned on.

320
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,849
So the reality is doing account recovery beyond.

321
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:33,890
Oh, you control that email address. That's you. Cool.

322
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,260
Is

323
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,190
expensive.

324
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,669
I had a friend who had their, I think it was Pinterest or Instagram account hacked

325
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:42,070
and they had to go through account recovery and what they did.

326
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,489
And I thought this was very clever.

327
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:44,549
They had to,

328
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,630
they basically got a one time code via email that they then had to like

329
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,049
write on a piece of paper and hold up and take a selfie with.

330
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,830
And that actually works with like Pinterest and Instagram because they have

331
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:57,090
past pictures of you on your account, right? So they can,

332
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,359
they can do like a proof of life picture with you,

333
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,580
but that requires a human being by and large.

334
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,510
The thing is if you want to do account recovery securely,

335
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,159
then you basically have to have either

336
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,270
a hugely complicated technical system that is

337
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,309
basically a human being or you actually have to have a human being.

338
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,409
And that costs money like a five or 10 minute phone call,

339
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,510
even with a poorly paid support person

340
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,989
-- that's costing the company 1020 bucks.
-- Well, not only that,

341
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,909
there's So from what I read

342
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,229
about Git lab,

343
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,859
I don't think that was even necessarily the inception of this.

344
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,580
I feel like this is more of a,

345
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,340
lots of people are using this now

346
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:36,950
and we're seeing Attackers

347
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,460
abusing our basically friendly support staff to gain access to account.

348
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:44,419
So our solution is just to not do it. Which

349
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,219
-- I mean,
-- well, that's the Google way.

350
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:49,219
-- Yeah, and I'm not opposed to
-- it.

351
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,169
Well, I mean, the perfect example is like, you know,

352
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,299
somebody's homeless and they're saying, look, I have no ID,

353
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,909
like I got rolled, like I got mugged my ID, all my, you know, all my identification,

354
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,500
all my papers, all my worldly possessions are missing, but I'm Bob and I want to,

355
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,619
you know, get registered for this program or for some support thing.

356
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:06,859
Well, what do you do? Right.

357
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:10,400
If we, we generally don't have biometrics of people in North America, you know,

358
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,479
there's countries out there like, um I think India is one where they're collecting,

359
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,159
you know, fingerprints as part of the ID scheme.

360
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:18,210
But fundamentally if somebody claims, hey, I'm Bob but, you know,

361
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:20,049
I got mugged and all my ID and everything's missing.

362
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:20,510
Well,

363
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,619
yeah, what do you do then? Right? You can't prove a negative.

364
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,719
Like you can't make Bob prove that he lost his

365
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,359
ID because he could just throw it in the garbage.

366
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,539
It shouldn't be git

367
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:30,250
lab's job to do that.

368
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,849
Well, but it is, if they own the account, right? If they're hosting the account

369
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,719
and somebody shows up and says that's my account, but I don't know my password.

370
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,969
I've, what the extreme is like, install Google Chrome.

371
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:43,349
And it's like you want to, I want like, do you want to log in?

372
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:44,690
Did you forget your email address?

373
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,802
And I'm like, how the heck do people forget their email address?

374
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,312
But apparently it happens enough

375
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:51,893
that that's in the first screen of logging into Chrome.

376
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:54,552
It's like if you forgot your email address, you can enter your phone number.

377
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,293
And I actually did this once to see what happens,

378
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:57,562
plugged in my phone number and it like,

379
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:59,922
spat out all my email addresses that are register

380
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,713
with that phone number. And I'm like, oh, ok.

381
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:04,273
And I've talked to some people about this who work in, you know,

382
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:05,343
in public service and they're like, yeah,

383
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:07,293
we deal with people all the time where we

384
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:08,593
ask them their email address and they're like,

385
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:12,153
-- I don't know,
-- that's a meet space government problem

386
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,166
though. And I view that as different.

387
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,736
The point being is that,

388
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:17,255
you know,

389
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:19,616
we live in a somewhat privileged world where we expect

390
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,776
people to have their user names and accounts and passwords.

391
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:26,255
And the reality is what percentage of people use a password manager personally.

392
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,056
I'm going to guess about maybe 1%.

393
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,755
I'd be shocked if it's that high.

394
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:31,755
And it might be 1% though because there's people

395
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:33,315
like me who force my Children to use it.

396
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:37,815
That's true. My whole family is using it and it's, it's actually really funny is so,

397
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,489
uh my son who is

398
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,739
dreaming of becoming a youtuber,

399
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,820
he,

400
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,940
he's setting up all of his youtube stuff

401
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:50,150
and one of his options was he decided to

402
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,489
create like a special account just for youtube stuff,

403
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,859
which I'm like, that's not the worst idea in the world.

404
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:57,349
It's like

405
00:16:57,469 --> 00:16:58,880
they're asking me about two factor O.

406
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,780
I said you better install two factor

407
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:01,900
off. Like

408
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,739
there's no excuse not to.

409
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,540
Well, and the good news is like, I know natively in the apple world, you know,

410
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,685
with Safari, it's doing password management, your web browser and stuff.

411
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:14,385
Same in chrome. Firefox does the same, I assume internet

412
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:17,243
or what is it edge now? Whatever it is edge.

413
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:19,314
So that's, and, and let's face it.

414
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:21,594
Web based passwords and credentials are like,

415
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:23,483
pretty much that's all that matters to people.

416
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,135
Like I'm trying to think if I have any credentials for

417
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,973
anything else that matters and the answer is nothing important.

418
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:33,354
No account recovery is one of the easiest ways to hack someone because

419
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,939
you don't have to guess their password.

420
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:37,729
Hell, you don't even have to guess their user name in half the cases.

421
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,540
You just phone up the support and you're like, I'm Bob and I want my account, please.

422
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,540
Right. And this is

423
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,770
so my, what I always like to tell people about this is,

424
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:51,579
this is something that sounds really easy in theory.

425
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,099
And if you're say

426
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,540
hosting data for six people, it is,

427
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,239
well, it is easy because they know those six people,

428
00:17:59,410 --> 00:17:59,800
right?

429
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,640
And it's different when you try to scale this problem and it becomes very difficult.

430
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,260
And especially when you're dealing with adversaries,

431
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,069
there's almost nothing you can do.

432
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,689
And adversaries if they are motivated,

433
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,219
they will acquire the information, they need

434
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:16,140
to accomplish their task.

435
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:21,219
There actually is one thing you can do that's rather clever as you just don't do it.

436
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:22,410
And that, and I,

437
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,530
I don't mean like git lab where you just don't provide support for that.

438
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,670
But for example, the CS A has some systems where

439
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:31,630
we really, really don't want you to make an account,

440
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,660
we want you to log in through a different account

441
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,329
provider like Google or Twitter or Facebook or linkedin.

442
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,349
I agree with that 100%.

443
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:42,829
There's no way unless you give me like about $100 million that I can provide

444
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,895
anything approaching the security and reliability of like

445
00:18:45,906 --> 00:18:48,265
-- a Google
-- login a long time ago.

446
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:49,745
I was, I think it was at

447
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,865
OCON, maybe I had lunch

448
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:56,505
with someone who was working on the Microsoft Identity platform and I don't even,

449
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:59,576
this might have been before office 365 even existed.

450
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:01,375
I mean, this was, this was a long time ago.

451
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:01,936
And anyway,

452
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:04,505
I was talking to this guy and something I'd never considered

453
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:07,306
before because he told me that on a daily basis,

454
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,465
Microsoft was seeing billions

455
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,421
of failed

456
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:12,862
login attempts that were malicious.

457
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,141
And I know I was like, that's

458
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:18,842
-- nuts. I couldn't fathom that.
-- Well, credential stuffing.

459
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:19,531
I mean,

460
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:23,982
there's public databases of all the passwords that people have used.

461
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:27,791
Yes, exactly. That. And so this is, I mean, this guy

462
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:30,962
over the course of lunch basically completely revolutionized

463
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:33,501
my thinking on authentication on the internet.

464
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,770
And so they obviously they see this, but he said the most important part of it

465
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,849
is they collect this data

466
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:42,890
and then they use it to protect other users. So for example,

467
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,369
they might see 2 million login requests coming from some IP address in the Ukraine.

468
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,900
And they're like, well, this IP address is just never going to log in, right?

469
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,689
Like we're going to block it for a month.

470
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:59,060
You think about that on a on a scale of me running a computer on the internet,

471
00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,729
I can't

472
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:01,055
fathom

473
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:02,875
doing something like that, right?

474
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:05,275
But to them, no big deal now,

475
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:07,795
now they know when that when that person running that attack,

476
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,305
when they do hit a valid login,

477
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:12,234
they're still going to fail. That's huge.

478
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:12,574
Well,

479
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:15,305
a great example of this is log into your Gmail through a Tor

480
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,675
enabled browser and you're going to have to re log in constantly.

481
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,464
I would hope so. And I'm OK with that,

482
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:22,765
-- right?
-- Because those Tor

483
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,785
exit nodes are, let's just say dodgy

484
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,800
like that. I don't mean the Tor

485
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,250
exit node itself is dodgy but like the,

486
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:33,569
the kind of people that use them to log into Gmail.

487
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,290
I mean, well, you know,

488
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,520
I've worked for a company where we provided a service and we

489
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,569
found that 100% of the signups through Tor IP S were malicious.

490
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,050
I don't doubt that.

491
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,719
And so we ended up blocking signups through Tor

492
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:47,430
IP S.

493
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,829
Now you could access your account through Tor.

494
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,479
We didn't care that that was fine

495
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,040
but the actual sign up part,

496
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,140
not, there was not a single legitimate sign up through

497
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,469
Tor.

498
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,520
-- It was always malicious people hiding their tracks and stuff.
-- I believe that.

499
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,060
And in fact, it was just a report that came out the other day.

500
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,930
I'll see if I can dig it up and throw it in the show notes.

501
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:09,420
But they basically point out the fact that like a nontrivial number of Tor exit

502
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,000
nodes are believed to literally be malicious where

503
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,160
they're spying on what users are doing.

504
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,060
Somebody ran a research paper looking at what ports

505
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,449
were blocked and there were Tor exit nodes blocking.

506
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:19,839
Like

507
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,800
um this is years ago when Tor was actually still reasonably fresh,

508
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,189
but it was blocking like all the encrypted email options.

509
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:30,369
Like it would allow port 110 and 19 for IMAP and pop, but it was blocking um like,

510
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,290
uh what is it like 553 or whatever the encrypted IMAP and encrypted pop options.

511
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:35,979
One.

512
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,500
Yeah.

513
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,540
So, same thing for Web. It was blocking 443 and allowing port 80.

514
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,099
Now, obviously, nowadays that wouldn't work,

515
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:46,459
but back in the day it did and I guess maybe somebody's stupid enough to use Tor

516
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,170
and be like, oh,

517
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:49,859
you know, I can't get my mail encrypted. So I'm going to

518
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,199
go to unencrypted.

519
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,020
I bet a lot of male clients a long time ago would just fail over and not say anything.

520
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,219
-- I mean, that was the way things used to work.
-- Well, that's it. The

521
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,180
even US supported encryption. I remember

522
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,900
when they started supporting encryption and setting it up was often quite a chore.

523
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,719
The other aspect of this is that whole law of large numbers, right? Like,

524
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,699
there's a fundamental difference between making dinner for one person,

525
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:16,770
making dinner for 10 people, making dinner for 100 people

526
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,739
and making dinner for 10,000 people. Were to be blunt,

527
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,989
-- you're now managing a logistics chain. You're not making dinner. Yeah,
-- exactly.

528
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,800
This is what git lab is doing is where Git lab basically went

529
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,900
from being the cool alternative kid on the block to now they're,

530
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:34,045
they're having to deal with logistics and infrastructure

531
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,734
and it's different.

532
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,744
-- The,
-- the reality is even if they were somehow able to provide the service,

533
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:41,185
they just don't have enough bathrooms and parking for all the people.

534
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:43,645
No, like, really, I mean, you know,

535
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:44,785
it always astounds me.

536
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:48,204
I remember the official alternate seat of government here in Alberta was, uh,

537
00:22:48,214 --> 00:22:49,805
it's a building called Government House.

538
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:53,645
It's by the old Provincial Museum. It's a lovely stone building.

539
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:56,214
It's the Lieutenant Governor's mansion and I believe it had

540
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:58,425
something like 20 phone lines and about a dozen toilets.

541
00:22:58,849 --> 00:22:59,349
And I'm like,

542
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,800
that is not going to work so well as the alternative to

543
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,109
government when you try and cram like 300 people in there.

544
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,469
Yeah. Right. Right. I, oh man, no.

545
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:12,030
You know, so you know what's funny is this is one of those things that

546
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,109
I think as humans were really bad at understanding.

547
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:15,979
We, we look at our,

548
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,920
our one computer with three users and we think it

549
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,760
wouldn't be that hard to scale it up and,

550
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,619
and it's kind of, I forget,

551
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:26,020
I forget where there's some culture

552
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:29,540
that basically their counting system is 123 more than three.

553
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,349
And I,

554
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,859
I get that

555
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,550
like

556
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:35,859
it is, it is so hard for us to envision

557
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:37,540
things at scale

558
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,420
and

559
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,589
it, it feels like we should be able to just say, oh,

560
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,780
that's easy or II I understand or I can do that and

561
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:48,780
it's not, I mean, so one of my, a great example I have actually is. So

562
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,670
I know we've talked about this in the past,

563
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,250
but I basically took all of the Bitcoin data and I shoved it into elastic search,

564
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,410
right.

565
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,689
And I did do all this fun stuff with it.

566
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:57,589
Of a fun talk I give and whatever.

567
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,400
But the point is like when I started,

568
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,380
I was basically doing things in a nice linear manner, right?

569
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,150
And you don't think about it.

570
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,640
But I could say, oh, I'm doing like a couple of 100 entries per second.

571
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,920
I, I'm like, I'm on fire here. But then you realize a couple 100

572
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:16,750
entries per second when you have literally now, like, you know,

573
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,579
500 million transactions.

574
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:19,020
Like

575
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,270
that's,

576
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:23,760
I'll be dead before this is done.

577
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,040
And so,

578
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,479
and it's funny,

579
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:29,770
it's totally changed my perspective on a lot of things because I realized like,

580
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,619
I need to be able to process

581
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,390
millions of things per second to even hope to make this practical

582
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,630
and to get a meaningful answer in a short time frame.

583
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,755
Right. Right. And so it's, it's,

584
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,204
it changes your perspective when you have to scale things up.

585
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,025
Well, not just scale them up but make them still happen fast.

586
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:49,604
Like again, if you're going to make dinner for 10,000 people,

587
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:50,724
you can't take three months.

588
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,724
That is a good point. You would have a revolt.

589
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:56,805
You actually have, you have like a two hour window to feed everybody

590
00:24:58,135 --> 00:24:59,675
otherwise it's not dinner anymore.

591
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:01,430
Right.

592
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:06,310
Just blends into drinks in the evening. No, I mean, I, I agree. I totally get this,

593
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,589
here's how I will end this, this conversation.

594
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:13,209
It is a curse and a blessing when you reach this point because it means git

595
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:17,550
lab has been successful enough that they have to worry about this level of scale.

596
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,829
And the curse is obviously you have reduced some of the

597
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,219
user experience value that you could obviously bring in the past.

598
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,430
My comment on this would be I think

599
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,619
places and this will a lot of people are going to hate me for saying this.

600
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,760
But I think places should as much as possible avoid human support,

601
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,979
not because they can save money and create crappy user experience.

602
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:42,479
But because they should actually invest in creating a really good

603
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,079
automated support system, but even better prevent the support from being needed.

604
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:51,349
Do things, you know, like Google is doing things on the front end so that you can, oh,

605
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,760
I forgot my email address, plug in my phone number.

606
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,089
Oh, there's my email address right now.

607
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:57,400
I remember, you know, things like that because that's

608
00:25:57,512 --> 00:26:00,642
the only thing that is sustainable in the long term.

609
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:02,812
I think that's a really powerful statement.

610
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:06,453
Otherwise, otherwise you're doing artisanal it services which,

611
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:07,672
and there's a market for that.

612
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:09,713
Right. There's a market for that. Absolutely.

613
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:09,812
You know,

614
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:11,932
there's old people that will happily pay 50 bucks

615
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:13,373
an hour for somebody to hold their hand.

616
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:15,253
It's a small market though. Good luck with that.

617
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,503
-- Yeah,
-- it doesn't scale.

618
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:20,782
I mean, I think that's a powerful statement you just made and I think it's, it

619
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:26,012
is the right way to do things. I think, I think designing to not

620
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,586
support is the,

621
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:30,745
it's the only way you should be designing

622
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,786
a great example of this is road construction,

623
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:32,926
right?

624
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:34,906
You look at interstate freeways in the US and

625
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:37,615
they are amazingly well designed from a safety perspective,

626
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:37,706
right?

627
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:41,895
You have this like 10 to 20 yard run out on either side, that's basically flat.

628
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,566
So even if you come off the road,

629
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:46,066
you're basically going to lose speed before you hit anything.

630
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:48,345
In theory, you have guard rails.

631
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:49,385
I mean, when you look at them,

632
00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:51,826
you look at those youtube videos of people crashing and walking

633
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:54,666
away from it now in like just normal cheap cars.

634
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:58,239
And a lot of that is the car, but a lot of that is also the road design, you know,

635
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,469
Jersey barriers that redirect the energy upwards the guard rails the here locally,

636
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,930
I've noticed we have a big ring road,

637
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:08,109
the Anthony Hendy Drive and pretty much the entire thing now in the middle, you know,

638
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,819
the, the metal stakes with the three or four wires

639
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,790
and like there's a couple of spots where it got clobbered.

640
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,479
Well, yeah, those are designed to sell you down

641
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,942
on, well, and to prevent you from going into oncoming traffic when you wipe out.

642
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:20,493
-- Right. Right.
-- That's going to end poorly.

643
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:22,062
The challenge there as well.

644
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:25,412
And the thing to always remember and the thing we don't have in it is

645
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:29,772
those kind of safety measures and those kind of regulations are written in blood.

646
00:27:29,863 --> 00:27:32,373
We don't kill a lot of people. Thank goodness.

647
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:36,123
-- The
-- thing is, at least people are thinking about it and the systems are starting to do

648
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:37,145
to get better.

649
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,995
You know, Google has put in your recovery, uh email address,

650
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:43,536
put in your recovery phone number, nominate a recovery person.

651
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:46,345
So again, I don't know if you notice this in your Google account, right?

652
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:47,026
Because you pay,

653
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:49,566
but you're a super admin for your organization and you

654
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:51,946
can nominate someone else to be your recovery person.

655
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:55,926
I have not looked at that. II, I don't, I don't know if I can do that or not.

656
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:56,826
-- If it's
-- paid, you can,

657
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,959
you're paying, right?

658
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,640
Oh,

659
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:01,079
-- that's
-- right. Your grandfather in, under the free one

660
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:02,609
way back in the day,

661
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,959
it's always Google's accounts are all separate that way. It's really messy.

662
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:09,469
-- Like
-- I don't have enough people that really matter. But it's like,

663
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,199
I,

664
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,270
it'll cost me a couple of 100 bucks a year

665
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:16,074
isn't the end of the world, but it's like I'm pretty happy not to pay anything.

666
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:18,675
-- I
-- honestly pay so that I didn't have to worry about them.

667
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:21,094
Like going away or I had some recourse basically.

668
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:21,295
-- Yeah,
-- I

669
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:23,685
-- should,
-- I should probably look into that because it's,

670
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:27,074
if I lost my personal email address,

671
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:27,925
it would,

672
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:30,814
-- it would make me sad.
-- It would be a problem

673
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,589
actually. So I'll end on this one silly story is I was talking to a friend.

674
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:39,880
So I I've set up, I've got some honey pots running in digital ocean

675
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:40,890
for

676
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,609
and,

677
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,459
and obviously just to kind of pay attention to

678
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:45,349
some attacks going on right now in the world.

679
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:49,619
And this guy was saying, oh, I'm going to set this all up in, in GCP.

680
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,219
And I said I never run anything even remotely questionable in Amazon

681
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:57,339
or Google just because I don't want them one day being like,

682
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,849
we think you're a bad guy.

683
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:01,130
Like all your, all your accounts are gone. Now,

684
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,510
that is my nightmare.

685
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,969
Well, my favorite is those people who are like,

686
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:07,170
Google suspended my account and they're like, but you're not a Google customer.

687
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,130
So you can't talk to us,

688
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:11,439
even if you are a Google customer, you can't talk to them.

689
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,680
I mean,

690
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:16,229
like that's one of the things I think is,

691
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:18,579
is if something bad happened to my Google account,

692
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,900
I would be like, who do I know who works for Google?

693
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,109
I wouldn't even dream of trying to go through support.

694
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,270
I would totally backdoor myself in because I know that's

695
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,310
the only way I might maybe have some traction.

696
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,189
Yeah, pretty much

697
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,709
anyway, I'm calling it. It is.

698
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,560
