Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 154 with myself,

1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,000
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,050
-- And
-- I'm so excited today, Kurt,

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,129
we have the two authors of a new book called The Fifth Domain.

4
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:20,469
Here. We have Dick Clark and Rob

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,409
Kaki with us.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,239
So, since there's two of us, we're gonna need a little bit of,

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,729
I guess traffic direction here.

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,229
So,

9
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,229
Dick, why don't you introduce yourself first?

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,409
Tell us who you are and, and a little bit about what you're doing.

11
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,700
-- So,
-- I'm Dick Clark mainly. I'm Rob

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,880
Ky's co-author.

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:41,840
Nice. 10 years ago, Rob and I wrote a book called Cyber War. And we've been working

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,450
since then together. Both Rob and I have worked

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,619
in government in the White House on the National

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,849
Security Council doing policy in the Cyber area.

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,169
And

18
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,549
uh both Rob and I have been consultants independent of each other,

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,459
working with major corporations around the country trying to

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,630
help them figure out how to do cybersecurity.

21
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:05,000
-- Fabulous and Rob tell us about yourself.
-- Sure.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,089
I spent about five years in the Obama administration for

23
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,910
those uh in the White House writing cybersecurity policy.

24
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:16,940
I am now out in the academic world and at

25
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:19,709
the Council on Foreign Relations where I'm a senior fellow

26
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:20,989
that is awesome.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,470
And the reason they're here, I kind of mentioned this at the beginning is

28
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:26,110
there's a book that's coming out.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,410
Actually, the, the same day this podcast is being released called

30
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,739
The Fifth Domain.

31
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,949
And so

32
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,660
I'm I I, Kurt and I read the book, we were, we were given copies and I must say it's a

33
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,120
fantastic book.

34
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,019
But for, for the listeners who might not understand, why don't we first?

35
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:46,080
Like what, what is the title? What is the Fifth Domain? What does that mean?

36
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:50,879
Well, the military, the US military thinks of everything as a domain

37
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:53,959
that they have to dominate in the past, they've talked about

38
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,199
land,

39
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,519
sea air

40
00:01:57,629 --> 00:01:58,919
and outer space

41
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:02,410
as individual domains. And now

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,330
now that they have us Cyber command, they're talking about

43
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:08,110
cyberspace as being

44
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,970
the fifth Domain

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,949
where war will occur

46
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,490
and a domain that they have to dominate. Very cool.

47
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,110
And,

48
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:19,589
and there's something really special about this domain you talk about in the book,

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,360
which is the first four

50
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:24,029
that they exist, right? But the fifth one

51
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,169
-- we
-- built. Yeah.

52
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:28,350
And we think that's really important because

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,669
there's this view in the cybersecurity community

54
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:32,699
that

55
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,589
offense has this tremendous advantage

56
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:41,000
in cyber warfare and that it will never go away and that defense is hopeless. Well,

57
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,869
our point is that within the fifth domain because it's manmade,

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,580
we can therefore change it.

59
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,570
And that gives us a tremendous advantage over

60
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,830
the other domains which largely exist as they were

61
00:02:53,014 --> 00:02:54,714
created by Mother nature.

62
00:02:54,964 --> 00:03:00,744
So, and just so the viewers are aware, this book covers quite a lot of uh material.

63
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:01,375
And so,

64
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,414
uh me and Josh actually had a discussion yesterday about

65
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,494
what we wanted to talk about because quite frankly,

66
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:08,414
this could probably about 10 half hour episodes in total

67
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:13,994
if we cover the whole book at least. And so, well, I guess where do you even begin?

68
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:17,369
Well, I guess the, why, why do we need to secure this? Right.

69
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,419
And one of the things, one of the aspects you talk about is election security,

70
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:21,369
which I think is topical, right?

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,610
We have a federal election coming up here in Canada in the fall and the US,

72
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:27,740
-- you have elections coming up next year that are kind of important,
-- right?

73
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,710
We do,

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,410
we have a presidential election coming up

75
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,369
and the way we run presidential elections and

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,820
other federal elections is that we let the States and even the counties run them

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,899
and there are over 4000 counties and the notion

78
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:47,660
that 50 states, some of whom are largely populated by cows and, and, and,

79
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,100
and 4000 counties

80
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:52,860
that they're going to be able to know when the Russians,

81
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,559
the Russian military have been able to hack

82
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,350
into them and defend against the Russian military.

83
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,649
That's pretty, that's pretty ludicrous, but that's where we are.

84
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,960
Well, and so one of the things I wrote down actually is,

85
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:09,919
I know there's a lot of focus in this book about the Russians attacking the pri

86
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,669
the previous US presidential election.

87
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,149
And

88
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,675
I think there's irrefutable evidence that happened.

89
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:16,635
But the question I,

90
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:20,435
I keep thinking of is they were successful to a degree what's

91
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:25,615
going to stop other hostile nations from essentially doing the same things.

92
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:27,955
They're going to be like, well, heck I want to get in on this.

93
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:28,105
Well,

94
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:31,915
-- I
-- think
-- you have to understand the American political system to manipulate it.

95
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:37,026
And the Russians have made a practice of that over generations,

96
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:41,041
understand our political system as well as we do perhaps even better

97
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:44,131
because they were able to manipulate it at the precinct level,

98
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,791
at the lowest level of voter activity.

99
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:50,402
And they were able to use social media in a way

100
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,562
that none of us really recognized that you could do.

101
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:54,552
But you're right

102
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:58,992
now that it's become clear this is possible. Uh Others will try it.

103
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:00,962
I don't think they will be as adept

104
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,519
as the Russians were at manipulating our politics.

105
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,940
And one thing I was curious about so is

106
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,070
obviously there's more than one way to interfere

107
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,619
or to sort of manipulate an election.

108
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,670
And from what I've been reading, it sounds like, ok,

109
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,100
so one obvious possibility would be, you know, the Russians hack,

110
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,429
a bunch of voting machines and like, oh, hey, we elected Elmo.

111
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,429
Fantastic. Tickle me president and, and that doesn't seem

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,869
to be

113
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,420
what they're pursuing largely. Right.

114
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,690
It seems to be more, they're pursuing sort of the, the soft side

115
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:32,890
of,

116
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,510
well, like social media, the news, the, I,

117
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,130
I guess you could call it the propaganda sort of based attacks

118
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,350
which strikes me as something that's, you know,

119
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,929
we can't just use more firewalls and,

120
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,589
and necessarily apply technology to fix the problem.

121
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,109
I think the important thing to understand about the Russians is this

122
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:53,309
is not something that they're going to do every four years.

123
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,589
This is a continuous campaign really with the goal of sowing disruption and discord

124
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,820
than the United States.

125
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:05,359
And so it leaves many people wondering why would the Russians do things like

126
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:05,920
coax

127
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,230
anti vaccine sentiment

128
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,790
in the United States?

129
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,019
But they're doing that and the reason they're doing

130
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,070
that is because they want to show divisiveness,

131
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,660
their goal is to try and divide the country and they're doing that very successfully

132
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,359
in many people's view,

133
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:26,250
using social media and using targeted ad campaigns. So,

134
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,929
moving away from that a bit. So are there sort of technological solutions?

135
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,200
Because I I,

136
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,049
one thing I find fascinating is I've been reading more

137
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,760
and more about school systems all over the western world

138
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,540
having classes now where they're starting to learn about

139
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,350
how to research online and, and a component of that essentially,

140
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,470
is this a good source?

141
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:48,299
Is this a bad source. You know, they're, they're basically being taught to,

142
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:51,350
uh, discern the truth as it were.

143
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,589
And unfortunately though there don't seem to be any classes for adults in this,

144
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:54,790
uh,

145
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,910
do you think there will be any good technological

146
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,950
solutions here that can sort of be applied?

147
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,890
Well, there's a lot of talk here in Washington that there should be a federal law

148
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,390
and there should be federal regulations that regulate social media.

149
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,059
We certainly regulate commercial broadcasting.

150
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:16,269
I know it gets into the realm of, of restricting liberties and no one wants to do that.

151
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,600
Uh No one wants to restrict content or freedom of speech. But there may be times when

152
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,579
you need to really prove who you are.

153
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,649
There's certainly places for anonymity on the web.

154
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,779
Human rights people struggling inside China need

155
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,850
to be able to do things anonymously.

156
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,279
Uh But if you're an American voter and you're putting

157
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,839
your name out there saying this is my opinion,

158
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,160
perhaps you need to prove who you are and that's not

159
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,640
difficult if the social media companies want to do it.

160
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:46,630
Well, and that's something I've definitely noticed.

161
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,200
You know, I've, I've been on the internet for a long time now and back in the day,

162
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,880
you know, the quality of forums was, was relatively good and then we sort of hit,

163
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,839
you know, that inflection point where there was all these new people and

164
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:57,863
trolls and stuff.

165
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:58,352
And so I'm,

166
00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:03,363
I'm on some forums where there actually are very strong identity requirements

167
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:04,493
and they're quite nice.

168
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:07,643
What I'm finding is, it's not so much that it's about the identity of the person.

169
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,722
It's about you get one account and if you, if you get booted,

170
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,333
you don't get another account. Right. So people

171
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:16,812
behave or they get kicked out and, and I don't think Facebook is going to do that,

172
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:18,683
but I, I've definitely noticed that the,

173
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,562
the forums where people have an incentive to behave

174
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:23,096
otherwise they don't get to come back.

175
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:26,895
They're much nicer than say, you know, something like Reddit or Facebook.

176
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:27,286
I mean, well,

177
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:29,605
let's pick on Facebook for a second because

178
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:33,285
Facebook hired everybody around me in my office.

179
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,184
Literally

180
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:39,635
from the Obama NSC Facebook now has the ability to validate

181
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:46,245
identities using a driver's license in order to buy political advertising.

182
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,820
They're doing a real world through the US mail verification system.

183
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,229
In order to be able to buy an ad online,

184
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,869
there's no reason that they could not extend that

185
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,320
out either on a voluntary basis or on a

186
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,989
mandatory basis so that you would have some trust

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,630
when somebody says I'm a member of your community,

188
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm thinking of voting this way.

189
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,150
I'm telling

190
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,719
you, it's not a throwaway vote, vote for Jill Sanders.

191
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:12,599
You might not,

192
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:15,679
in fact trust them if that was an anonymous person

193
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,719
who didn't have a check mark next to their name.

194
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,640
And so I think for that reason, we really should be pushing Facebook,

195
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,440
Twitter and others towards real names.

196
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,669
Now that said there are plenty of real name trolls on Twitter.

197
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,840
I won't mention any right now,

198
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,450
but

199
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,309
I'm, I'm thinking of a couple.

200
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,190
I think that's a good point because, well,

201
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,390
in a similar situation I've noticed with reviews on restaurants, I,

202
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,849
I tend to look at the, the best and the worst reviews right,

203
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,650
to make sure it's sort of consistent, whatever.

204
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,840
And quite often

205
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:46,200
the best reviews will be, you know, you click the best review and it's glowing,

206
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,530
but it's written a little strangely.

207
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:49,359
And so it became pretty obvious that, you know,

208
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,609
this person is probably not a person and it's

209
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,210
reviews for hire.

210
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,679
And I, you know,

211
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,640
the the problem I had was that I could have gone through and reported them all.

212
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,039
But,

213
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,219
you know, is it, is it worthwhile? And that's my,

214
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:05,270
my other concern is even if we kind of have this real ID, that will definitely,

215
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,650
I think help with, you know, this person telling me to, yeah,

216
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,960
vote for whoever locally

217
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:12,109
is this person local and informed or is it some, you know,

218
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:15,719
someone from the other side of Canada who's being paid to do this.

219
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:18,020
But secondly, is, is the mechanisms to then

220
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,070
if you suspect somebody is a troll, how you know, how do we handle that at scale?

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,750
Well, I think artificial intelligence can do some of that at scale.

222
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,450
But what we propose in the book is a system separate.

223
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,950
And apart from the election issue.

224
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,429
And apart from social media,

225
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,130
we propose a system called Really You with the letter

226
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,669
U because we need to be able to replace passwords.

227
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,190
Online,

228
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:45,409
passwords are a mess. They're 1/20 century solution. We need to move on.

229
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,849
There are ways of doing it.

230
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,719
But in, in the United States,

231
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:53,419
at least we don't have a national ID and people don't like the idea of national ID.

232
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:54,369
They think that's big,

233
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,849
big government and Big Brother and the first slippery slope

234
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:00,159
to ending democracy is to have a national ID.

235
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:02,280
It's crazy, but that's the way people feel.

236
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,159
So what we propose is

237
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:05,719
let's have

238
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,049
two or three companies,

239
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:11,580
they could be banks, they can be things like mastercard or Visa

240
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,590
issue,

241
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:13,510
a

242
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:14,179
multi

243
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:18,390
factor authentication token card that you can use

244
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,760
anywhere online to verify who you are

245
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,369
and to get this going,

246
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:25,289
we call upon the government

247
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,359
to be the first adopter to say,

248
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:32,150
yeah, we'll accept that online as a way of getting into

249
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,869
your social security or your Medicare or your taxes.

250
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:38,390
I'm glad you brought this up. It's so

251
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,280
I think telling Facebook

252
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:44,690
you should verify identities is never gonna happen. Let's face it.

253
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,669
They, we, we can barely get them to do anything decent.

254
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,789
This is, I think that's so far out of the question.

255
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,570
But I feel like, and,

256
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,280
and this is something I've said in the past more times than I can count is I,

257
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,469
if we don't regulate a lot of the security,

258
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,869
it's just never gonna happen because people don't care.

259
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,409
And I, I feel like

260
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,770
the government

261
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,830
having something like this. Well, you're right.

262
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,460
It's going to be difficult to convince people to, to use it perhaps, but it would,

263
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:12,140
it would have enormous

264
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,760
consequences, I think for like, like literally everything we do. Right.

265
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,979
I mean, one of the it it's I I guess

266
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,739
tell us about

267
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,859
how,

268
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,020
how, how do we get this to happen? Right? It's easy to say. So the government should,

269
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:30,260
you know, have a national ID? But, but what does that really mean? Right.

270
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,869
How do we see something like that become a reality?

271
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,750
I think where, where we really began with this is to say, ok, Congress has got to act.

272
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,440
Congress has got to put a mandate on the federal agencies

273
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,010
to sponsor the creation of the system

274
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:50,590
and then to pay for it on a transactional basis, right? Every time you go to validate

275
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,750
your ID,

276
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:55,190
in order to make a tax transaction or

277
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,109
social security transaction or apply for a passport,

278
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,599
they need to be willing to pay an identity provider of your choosing.

279
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:03,890
And if you do that,

280
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,429
you're going to be doing one of the most powerful things that Congress can do,

281
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,469
which is to create a market.

282
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,710
Once you have that market started,

283
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:18,710
I guarantee you that the big banks and even maybe Facebook will latch on to that

284
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:25,289
uh and use it but it is not something that seems to be happening on its own without that

285
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,869
shove from the US Congress.

286
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,270
I like this because

287
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:34,400
I feel like when the, when the government shows up and mandate something, people,

288
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:35,630
it doesn't matter what it is, right?

289
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,109
They could, they could mandate like, free money and someone would complain.

290
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:38,840
But

291
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:40,070
I, if you

292
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,780
leverage the spending power of federal agencies now

293
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:48,309
the market is driving the change, right? Which is, that's really cool.

294
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,950
Well, a stupid question here but like I actually have us government ID, right?

295
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,969
I have a nexus card because quite frankly, no lineups.

296
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,190
I mean, well, couldn't you simply have the IRS mandate that if you want to talk to us,

297
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,070
you have to have this strong identity,

298
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,130
right?

299
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,020
I mean, we, we have this in Canada where, you know,

300
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,330
if I want to have my Alberta government ID account

301
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,210
so I can access my health care records online.

302
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:11,760
I have to sign up for an Alberta, you know,

303
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,450
government online identity which involves validating it through the

304
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,130
mail with my driver's license and all that.

305
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,109
I mean, it, it seems to me that you,

306
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,489
you can just simply have somebody like the IRS do this.

307
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,130
And so I guess my question would be why,

308
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,049
why hasn't this happened or is it just the political will, isn't there

309
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,250
a couple of reasons?

310
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,989
One is a group of Americans that will never

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,830
do whatever the government tells them to do,

312
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,929
get a measles vaccine. No, no, that's big government.

313
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,940
Uh, ok. Die, I mean, you know,

314
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:41,159
the, the other reason is that there's a,

315
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,260
a group of largely Republicans in the Congress and

316
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,190
now in the White House who think that regulation,

317
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,289
federal government regulation is some sort of sin.

318
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:54,390
And they've even had a rule in this Trump administration

319
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:56,559
that you can't have a new regulation

320
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,039
unless you get rid of two existing ones.

321
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,570
Uh And how lo how logical is that it's difficult to get regulation

322
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,989
in some cases. However, we need it. We don't want micro

323
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,609
regulation where the government tells you how big the screw is and

324
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,640
how many times you have to turn it to the right.

325
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,789
We want regulation

326
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,539
that identifies goals and says this is what we want you to do

327
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:23,109
and we want a third party independent of the government independent of you

328
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:28,770
to come in and audit that you've gotten to the goal. And that's kind of the, the notion

329
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,049
that we have with the National Institute of Standards, the so called N

330
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,729
cyber framework, it's voluntary, but increasingly a lot of companies are doing it.

331
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,049
Yeah, because it, it works right.

332
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:42,210
I mean, it's,

333
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,140
I, I know, I, I have a lot of personal experience with it.

334
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,119
People deploy it because it, it does what it says, which is, which is fantastic.

335
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,979
So I guess speaking of the cybersecurity framework.

336
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,380
Let's use that as kind of a pivot point because I know we could,

337
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,260
we could all whinge about I DS all day long, no doubt.

338
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,820
But I'm, I'm really curious. One of the things that's covered in this book in depth is

339
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,619
many of the cyber attacks we've seen to date

340
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:13,890
and there are more than I can count or go over in the short period of time we have.

341
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,440
But I guess

342
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,960
the one thing that keeps sticking out to me is

343
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,440
there are

344
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:24,599
numerous cyber attacks from a nation state against another nation state.

345
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,880
And we've seen really no sort of response ever. Right.

346
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,849
I mean, I'd compare this to in the, in the kinetic world, right.

347
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:34,109
Kinetic being, you know, traditional warfare essentially.

348
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:38,030
If somebody shoots a missile at you, like you're gonna come get them,

349
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,750
you're not just gonna sit there and say, oh, well, that was neat.

350
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,229
So this is one of the challenges, I mean,

351
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:47,070
one of the things that's happened in the United States is at the end of the Cold War.

352
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,710
Everybody who understood

353
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:54,330
Cold war tactics. Cold war strategy. Cold War ideology was kind of out of a job.

354
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,539
And then 10 years later, we got terrorism and kind of 10 years after that,

355
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,409
we got cybersecurity.

356
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,789
And so we've been kind of reinventing

357
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,930
all of the strategies from the Cold War,

358
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,689
principally deterrence and trying to apply them to cyberspace and trying to

359
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,569
find equivalency between a cyber attack

360
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,540
and an intercontinental ballistic missile.

361
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,130
And even though we have probably written 10,000 pages on the subject, I mean,

362
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,719
the Rand Corporation alone has probably written 10,000 pages.

363
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,459
We really,

364
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:28,630
I think have concluded that deterrence does

365
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,030
not work in cyberspace for cyber attacks.

366
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:36,280
-- What,
-- what does deterrence mean in cyber even?

367
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,949
-- Well, I
-- think deterrence means if there's a cyber attack on me,

368
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,900
I will be able to identify who did it called attribution.

369
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,199
I'll be able to identify who did it with a

370
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:49,859
99.9% certainty.

371
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,489
And I will be able to strike back at that person

372
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,540
and do more damage to them than they did to me.

373
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,739
Now, for that to work,

374
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,060
you have to believe that the guy you're going to attack

375
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:06,239
has that offensive capability and that you're afraid of it.

376
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,839
Well, how do you know, how do you know what cyber weapons somebody has,

377
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,119
how do you know how well they will work?

378
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,520
And frankly how do you know that you'll get caught because, you know,

379
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,040
not everybody is the North Koreans who leave a Kimchi trail to, to, you know,

380
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:21,880
Pyongyang,

381
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,410
there are lots of people like the Israelis and frankly the United

382
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,390
States and occasionally the Russians that do things in a way.

383
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,319
It's really not clear who did the attack and sometimes some of the people use

384
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:39,219
the other people's weapons so that it will look like it was somebody else.

385
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:43,469
This is the interesting thing that the Russians have stolen American weapons,

386
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,560
cyber weapons.

387
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:49,900
-- It was the NSA one, the eternal blue. Right.
-- Right. Right. That's one of them.

388
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,739
And some CIA weapons have shown up online

389
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,869
and now Chinese weapons are being exposed online.

390
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,219
Gee, I wonder who did that.

391
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,520
So,

392
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,140
you know, if you're attacked by a Chinese weapon,

393
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:02,400
does that mean

394
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:06,079
that was a Chinese attack or what was it? The American attack?

395
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:08,099
I want to build on Dick's point here.

396
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,540
The, the final piece of it is even if you can sort out all those puzzles.

397
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,239
There's a major question particularly with the Russians

398
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,060
about whether or not Vladimir Putin actually cares if

399
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:23,560
he turns out the lights in the United States and we turn out the lights in Moscow.

400
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,905
Does he, he care about that?

401
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:31,155
Russia is a country where 25% of the population doesn't have indoor plumbing.

402
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:34,334
So taking off the lights may not really matter.

403
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:38,175
And if you look over the last five years,

404
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:41,734
the consequences that he has accepted on behalf of his

405
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:44,994
countrymen for the things he has done in Ukraine,

406
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,295
for the things he has done in Syria.

407
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:51,630
I suggest that he doesn't actually care about the care and

408
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,209
feeding of his people on a day to day basis.

409
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,859
We have a line in the book where we talk about,

410
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:59,630
let's say the Russians turned out the power grid in the

411
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,979
US on a cold dark night and kept it off,

412
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:05,939
you know, they didn't just turn it off, they destroyed the equipment.

413
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:06,500
And so

414
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,530
two or three weeks into a blackout where the ATM S aren't working and you

415
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,089
can't get cash and you can't buy food and just in time deliveries aren't happening.

416
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,089
And the United States says, oh, well, fear not.

417
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,250
We turned off the lights in Moscow,

418
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,989
we have a line in the book that says, uh

419
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,530
how will that make you feel? You know,

420
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:26,020
is,

421
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,209
is it really equivalent because you're going to be

422
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:30,589
freezing in somewhere in the United States and?

423
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:34,010
All right. So are the people in Moscow, but at least they have vodka.

424
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,180
Well, so it sounds like the whole, you know, this goes back to the Cold War,

425
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:41,910
the counter value target won't work, right?

426
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,699
So, attacking sort of the civilian side of say your adversary.

427
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:49,300
So what about the counter force targeting? Why don't we just go

428
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,680
if we know who did it? And we know

429
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:55,119
like it was, it's actually attributable to a government, you know, it's not about

430
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:59,589
rogue people or whatever, why not go counter force and attack their, you know,

431
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,489
their attack infrastructure and take it out.

432
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,959
So I think it's a really interesting idea and

433
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,089
the United States has toyed around with that,

434
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:06,270
right.

435
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,910
We saw Cyber command very loudly announced that they'd carried

436
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,170
out disruptive attacks against the internet research agency in Russia.

437
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,969
Uh You know, my, my view on that was great.

438
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:19,150
You knocked out the power to their building. Ok.

439
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,800
Where's the nearest Starbucks turns out it's, you know, almost two miles away.

440
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,390
So they might have had to drive instead of

441
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,790
just walking across the street with their laptops.

442
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,790
Right. Counter cyber force is, is really not something that is likely

443
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,640
to be that effective.

444
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,239
I think there is some gains that can

445
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,439
be made from targeting the external infrastructure.

446
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:43,010
But right now the the mechanisms that you

447
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,520
have to legally take down third party infrastructure

448
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,099
are really not there.

449
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:51,915
They really can't move at the speed that Attackers can reconstitute them.

450
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:55,074
Yeah, because the attacks frequently come from within your own country.

451
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:55,265
You know,

452
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:58,145
we saw that when the Iranians attacked us banks a few

453
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:01,675
years back and when we traced back the attack routes,

454
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:03,515
they were coming from servers

455
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:04,994
that they had compromised

456
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:06,755
inside the United States.

457
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,390
They, they were all in Texas.

458
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,430
And I, I really think I was,

459
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,839
I was in the White House at the time and I really think

460
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:16,689
the office of legal Counsel is still actually wrestling with the question of,

461
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:21,479
could the president have ordered cyber command to attack a server in Texas?

462
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:25,589
I, I would hope the answer is no,

463
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,859
but I know it's more complicated than that

464
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,619
Canada weapons free. But you know us.

465
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:33,839
Right.

466
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,229
Well, I mean, it occurs to me, you know, for example,

467
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:40,079
we do have established legal doctrines that if you know,

468
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:42,380
something is of significant hazard

469
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:46,109
you know, uh, for example, like the fire marshal shows up and tells you to unplug it,

470
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:50,099
right? Or, you know, the police show up and tell you to stop.

471
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,900
For example, you know, when it's dry out,

472
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,359
you're not allowed to shoot off fireworks because you might start a forest fire.

473
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:56,829
Right? And they'll go confiscate your fireworks and arrest you.

474
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,930
-- If you're being a real jerk,
-- the FBI can do that.

475
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:02,500
The FBI can get a warrant and go and disconnect a server.

476
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:05,829
But you can, you know how easy it is to get a server these days.

477
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:09,849
You want a server on Amazon's Cloud and you've got a credit card

478
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,979
that still works.

479
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,689
Even if you, even if you stole it from somebody, if,

480
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:16,810
if you got a credit card that works and you've got a laptop,

481
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:21,890
you can have a server spin up in Amazon's Cloud in a matter of two minutes.

482
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,810
You do your attack and then you spin it down

483
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:28,109
and then when the FBI shows up with a warrant, who are they serving?

484
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,089
There's no, it's a virtual server and it lasted for two minutes.

485
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,680
Well, I'm always reminded of when I get the, uh,

486
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:36,920
the spam text with a link to a website that's obviously been hacked.

487
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,439
You know, it's usually some ill maintained little small business website. And,

488
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:41,675
yeah, I've kind of wondered about that.

489
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:44,255
Like, should I report it to somebody who should, like, turn it off?

490
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:48,614
So they may notice and fix it or it's just sort of like litter on the streets.

491
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,275
It's just something we kind of have to live with.

492
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:50,824
Yeah.

493
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:53,194
I mean, I, I think one of the interesting things and,

494
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:55,285
and I think we're gonna get some push back for this.

495
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:56,145
A lot of

496
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,079
the book. We're, we're essentially saying, look,

497
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:05,030
we need to make the victims or the intermediate victims

498
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:06,959
of cybercrime

499
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,569
responsible for some of the consequences. right?

500
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:11,359
The first reaction that most people have

501
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,650
is when something bad habits in cyberspace,

502
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,865
go find the people who did it, go find the Russians, go find the Chinese. Well,

503
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:19,355
good luck with that.

504
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:23,375
We've had indictments out now for five years against the Chinese

505
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:28,105
actors that were responsible for a series of very serious intellectual property

506
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:31,296
uh incidents, uh intellectual property theft,

507
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:33,586
they're never going to see the inside of a courtroom.

508
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:35,936
So just focusing on the actors

509
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:37,086
isn't enough.

510
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:42,822
One of the things that we've been pushing for in, in the book is to say, look, you know,

511
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:49,141
if Godaddy or Amazon or Microsoft is the staging grounds for an attack,

512
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,212
they have to have some responsibility,

513
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:57,371
they have to have some liability for that bad outcome. And if they do,

514
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:01,302
they will do a much better job of policing their own infrastructure

515
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,380
and that's how we can get to it. Not by FBI door knocking,

516
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,790
but by creating liability in which Amazon will say, oh,

517
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:13,459
-- we can't have that kind of activity on our systems, on our
-- network.

518
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,849
That seems fair to me. I'm curious, is,

519
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,410
does that exist elsewhere

520
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:22,119
in, I guess the Real World? I'm, I'm,

521
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,930
-- yeah,
-- Josh, we have, uh,

522
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,290
there's definitely liability for something that's a known hazard.

523
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,920
Well, I mean, the, the simplest example is, you know, here in Canada, like if you

524
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:34,069
don't shovel your walk, uh, you can get a fine

525
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,199
but more to the point if you know, your walk is icy and somebody slips and falls,

526
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:41,959
you know, they, yeah, they can definitely pursue you legally because

527
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,260
uh it's Canada, we know that our sidewalks get icy.

528
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,739
-- You should go salt and sand that right.
-- And you,

529
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:51,060
and you know that your servers are going to get hacked.

530
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:54,310
You shouldn't be surprised when they do. Right? And so

531
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:57,380
from that perspective, I, I think there is a strong

532
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,589
uh view, at least in some legal communities in the United States,

533
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:05,510
then you just want to place liability where it's going to do the most good.

534
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,390
We're holding somebody liable is going to make uh the situation improve.

535
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,150
And that's what we've been advocating.

536
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,130
And, and one of the examples of that is the, is the idea that

537
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,380
actually it was Rob's idea first,

538
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,160
which is

539
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:26,160
when your data is stolen, the company from which it is stolen should have to pay.

540
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:31,000
And if you pay a penalty based on the number of identities stolen,

541
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,890
let's say how about $10 in identity every time your identity is stolen,

542
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:39,859
that company has to pay $10. You'd bankrupt some companies.

543
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:42,719
-- I,
-- I'd be a millionaire right now. I think so.

544
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,199
No, I, I like that though. I feel like there's, you need incentives. Right.

545
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,680
And we let's face it on the internet today.

546
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:56,040
-- Right. Yes.
-- Well, that's true. I guess in that case it's, it's a disincentive

547
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,599
but, I mean, today there's, there's no consequences for, you know, you,

548
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:04,319
you hack someone, no consequences, you steal the data, no consequences, you, it's,

549
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:05,839
it's, it's crazy, right?

550
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:06,209
Yeah.

551
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:09,930
And the I mean, the place that we can introduce the consequences,

552
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:12,130
right is on the holders of that data, right?

553
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,964
We can't introduce consequences very easily. I'm not saying we shouldn't try.

554
00:27:15,974 --> 00:27:19,444
I'm not saying we can't do more to pursue cyber criminals. We can

555
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:24,625
and we absolutely should. But where we have levers are over the holders of the data.

556
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:26,944
And so that's where we need to apply pressure.

557
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:32,145
We're, we're kind of approaching the end and I would love to give you each

558
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:36,964
and a chance to kind of say closing thoughts as kind of what can we do?

559
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:37,594
What does it mean?

560
00:27:37,604 --> 00:27:38,785
And of course, why everyone should,

561
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:40,844
should purchase a book because I will say if

562
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:42,785
you're listening to this uh buy this book,

563
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:43,685
you will not regret it.

564
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:44,094
So

565
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:49,099
as as was decided previously in the order of the authors on the book, Dick, I,

566
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,439
this book is

567
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:54,130
optimistic. 10 years ago, we said

568
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:59,280
no company can defend itself against cyber attacks. In this book. We say

569
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,949
there are companies who are successfully doing it.

570
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,040
There is a way to do it.

571
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,119
The technology has evolved.

572
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,160
You just have to figure out how to do it involves spending money.

573
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,270
Yeah, it involves changing procedures. Yeah,

574
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,119
but

575
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:20,520
it is now possible, maybe this will be a moment in time that only lasts a few years.

576
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:24,910
But it is now possible to defend yourself in cyberspace.

577
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,630
And we should not accept it when people don't.

578
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,790
And just to add to that, you know, what,

579
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,050
what I would say is that what we kept coming back to as we were writing

580
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,569
this book was the idea that we get so much value out of the internet.

581
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:44,459
And what we're not doing is pushing any of that value back in to protect it.

582
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:47,670
If we realized how truly valuable the system is,

583
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,339
how truly valuable our information was, we would absolutely

584
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:57,369
be spending a lot more and taking cybersecurity a lot more seriously.

585
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:59,920
And that's the big argument we're making in this book.

586
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,719
Cybersecurity is possible. It's getting easier all the time.

587
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,670
The Attackers advantage is eroding.

588
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,599
We know that because the Attackers are getting caught left and right now in a way,

589
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:16,530
they weren't 10 years ago and that actually is good news.

590
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,390
Yes,

591
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,709
I, I love that. It is. I, I think you, you two summed it up beautifully. And so

592
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:24,270
I I also

593
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,500
want to call out that

594
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,790
Dick has a podcast called Future State, which

595
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:31,660
is a fabulous show.

596
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,489
I'll put a link to it in the show notes and anyone who's listening

597
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,689
to this show and has any interest in us policy would adore it.

598
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:41,630
I, I love it. It's been fantastic since I've discovered it.

599
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,040
Yeah, I guess Kurt. Do you have any closing thoughts?

600
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:44,989
Well, just

601
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:47,510
the one thing I really took away from reading the book

602
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,989
is that as they said, you know,

603
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,750
it is becoming increasingly possible to defend yourself,

604
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,579
but that it's going to take some effort.

605
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:54,849
But I,

606
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,770
I just keep coming back to the simple fact that

607
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,430
I don't know a single person who has a job

608
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:01,849
that they can really effectively do without the internet,

609
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,349
like full stop.

610
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:04,119
Right.

611
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,920
And, and I mean, even trades people, you know, they,

612
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,989
they need to access their manuals and stuff.

613
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,109
So, yeah, it just, it kind of blows me away that, you know,

614
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,880
like electricity and running water that's safe to drink.

615
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,270
We,

616
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:16,979
we take this for way too much granted.

617
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,369
Well, you gotta remember though.

618
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,989
I mean, it took, took a long time to get clean drinking water.

619
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,239
So we're, we're on the way.

620
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,010
But in, in books like this, I think are a much needed step in the right direction.

621
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,560
And so

622
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,439
thank you gentlemen for everyone listening. The book is out today.

623
