Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Curtsy Fried

1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,729
-- and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser. Oh, man.
-- Thought Crime.

2
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:16,569
I feel like this week is a thought crime. It's,

3
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:18,840
I had Monday off because it was Memorial Day in the

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,079
United States and I have no idea what's going on.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,180
I yesterday was Tuesday and I missed a bunch of stuff because people like, hey,

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:25,989
are you coming to this?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,530
And I said it's Monday that's on Tuesday and they're like, it is Tuesday.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,819
I'm like, oh, it is Tuesday, isn't it? Well, I'm still not coming, but

9
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,599
actually it's Wednesday. Now,

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,319
now,

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,000
now I know it doesn't matter anymore. I'm like, whatever. I don't even care.

12
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,090
And by the time you edit this, it'll be Thursday.

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,119
Well, it'll be later than that.

14
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,709
I've got other stuff to edit too, but I don't, I don't know what the hell edit this,

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,119
Kurt.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,590
It's

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,430
-- anyway, time
-- and his illusion

18
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,389
time. Lunchtime, doubly so. Right.

19
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,770
Yeah, I think that was Tuesday afternoons.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,520
It was a Thursday, right when the world ended Thursday.

21
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:01,810
Sorry,

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,279
Thursday.

23
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:05,110
This is Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy for Eddie View.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,349
If you don't know, go read the book. You won't regret it. Yeah.

25
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:09,050
-- So
-- you had a topic for today?

26
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:11,410
I have a doozy of a topic. Ok. So

27
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,449
I'm going to put this in the context of

28
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:16,889
two services that have recently come to my attention.

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,379
The first is a site called

30
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:18,733
Code

31
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:19,443
Beg. Code

32
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:21,563
beg.org. I'll put links to all this in the show. Not Code

33
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:26,453
Beg is meant to be something similar to github, but run by a foundation, right?

34
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:26,972
So it's

35
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:27,962
basically, and they're,

36
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:30,722
they're specifically only hosting free and open source software.

37
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,172
They're not letting you host

38
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:33,432
non open source, right?

39
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,292
-- It was defined by like O SI. Yeah,
-- it's

40
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,492
-- got
-- to have an O SI license.

41
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:36,633
OK.

42
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:37,453
Cool.

43
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:40,133
There's also this thing that came to my,

44
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:45,005
it's called, is it veiled Valid? I don't know how to pronounce this word veil

45
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:45,625
ID

46
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:48,975
doesn't matter.

47
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:53,416
So anyway, this is, there's uh the guy who runs hackers dot town on Mastodon,

48
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,176
the Gibson

49
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:55,986
is his name, which is a marvelous name. Go

50
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,036
oh, pronounced

51
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:57,755
Vid

52
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:58,776
Valid

53
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:02,096
-- according to their Twitter. All right,
-- I'll try my best. But

54
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:03,416
Vid

55
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,430
go also go watch a movie hackers if you haven't. Why the Gibson is such a good name.

56
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,050
But anyway,

57
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,850
Vid is they, they, I'll just read what the Gibson wrote.

58
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,000
It says this and this is of course, very grandiose. But take it for what it's worth

59
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,559
this summer, we restore the future together.

60
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,440
Hackers that town has teamed up with CDC cult of the dead cow to take

61
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,990
back our birthright from the billionaires who squander

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,440
our best hope for a better future.

63
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:27,380
No more

64
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:31,169
veil it is here and it is our chance to restore, recover and rebuild.

65
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:34,669
And then I will also tie this in with Mastodon,

66
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:37,020
which you and I have become prolific users

67
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,600
-- of
-- because the alternative is Twitter and that's

68
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,300
just a pile of fire

69
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,360
even ignoring, OK, even if for a moment,

70
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:48,139
you ignore all the people that left and don't post there anymore.

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,850
Like my feed is like, even before I deleted it, it was pretty damn dry.

72
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:54,889
The outgoing links were broken one day and like the site is

73
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:59,130
slow or just apparently they decided not to pay their reddest bill,

74
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,529
-- which is why a whole bunch of stuff broke for the live casting
-- doesn't matter,

75
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,020
doesn't matter.

76
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:03,509
Let's move on.

77
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,020
-- I don't wanna, I don't wanna rant on Twitter
-- for we're unmasked on because it's,

78
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:09,380
it's the least worst option at this point.

79
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,470
Here's the thing though is I'm, and, and this is for us to discuss and

80
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,100
I feel like we are seeing this.

81
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,059
I don't know if I call it a resurgence necessarily, but a,

82
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,800
in an above average level of interest

83
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,610
in

84
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,419
cutting the shackles to what I would say is the,

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,380
the current like Gigantor it companies that are kind of running the world.

86
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:32,029
Well,

87
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,080
I like it personally, but I, I don't know if it's gonna make it. That's the thing.

88
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,429
But it's also how we ended up here in the

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,059
first place was a bunch of weirdos and start ups

90
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,419
that became Gigantor and then market forces and

91
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,539
incentives took over and they turned into jerks.

92
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,199
And I don't understand how you escape that because a great example would be open.

93
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,759
A, I started out as a nonprofit ostensibly to do a I open.

94
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,490
Well,

95
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:56,399
yeah,

96
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,070
that sort of changed

97
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,710
or? Oh, a great example. Wikipedia, what's wrong with Wikipedia?

98
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,279
Have you looked at how much money they're sitting on and

99
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:07,429
there's constantly begging for donations and what they're paying their people.

100
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,070
I'm

101
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:12,750
on the fence about that one because I recognize the value in a foundation

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,709
creating a heap of money to sit on because you don't know what's coming.

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,100
II I recognize the criticism.

104
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,815
I'm not gonna give them a free pass.

105
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:26,054
-- They've got 100 and $65 million in the bank.
-- Is that a bad thing though?

106
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:31,174
I mean, if we, if Wikipedia fails, like it would damage society

107
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,595
irreparably.

108
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:35,535
But I mean, at some point, well, it's like the, but here's a great example,

109
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,774
all these universities like Harvard that are essentially now an

110
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:40,394
endowment fund with the university stapled onto the side.

111
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:45,054
They are. Right. And, and that is my concern is how do you fundamentally

112
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,200
you can't fix social and business problems with technology?

113
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:51,059
Like no amount of clever.

114
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,839
Well, like all the Blockchain people Oh, we'll have a dow that'll blink,

115
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,619
blank blink and they end up just being evil.

116
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,230
I don't want to get into that this discussion

117
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,480
because I think this discussion is one of society.

118
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:06,816
I want to talk about the potential for these kind of grassroots,

119
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:09,006
purposely free and open

120
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,216
things

121
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:14,305
-- that feel like they're getting a groundswell
-- and here's a dirty secret.

122
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:17,446
One of the things that's really helping them get a groundswell is

123
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:21,776
running this stuff from a technical perspective is so cheap now,

124
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:25,406
like 20 some years ago, secure to portal.com.

125
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:28,391
Like I would write an article and it would get 100,000 views in a day.

126
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:31,161
And that was a massive amount of traffic and

127
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:34,802
we made so much money off the advertising. It was kind of frightening in hindsight.

128
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:39,432
But the like we needed, I think it was two or three racks of servers

129
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,071
and like,

130
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:43,002
and we started running into problems like the log processing

131
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:46,221
server was taking 23.5 hours to process the day's logs.

132
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,920
You got half an hour extra, it's fine.

133
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,950
And the admin was like uh so like, and I think we ended up getting a second one.

134
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,399
I don't know, like it used to be horrifically complicated to survey static website.

135
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,549
I mean, I'm not even talking

136
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,239
like reactive or people talking to each other or sending messages to each other.

137
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,010
I'm simply literally talking about static content and images going out

138
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,160
and serving that more than 100,000 times a day used to be an incredible nightmare.

139
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:16,119
And now you could have a Raspberry pi do it without breaking a sweat or

140
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,589
a raspberry pi could just run your instance of Mastodon with like 10 users.

141
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,059
No problem. You can do that.

142
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,089
Yes, I think that is one of the big changes is it's,

143
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,630
it's like the whole 3D printing thing.

144
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,890
It's like, oh, I want to prototype this plan

145
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:30,894
thing, but oh, getting a, a prototype mold and everything set up is like, you know,

146
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,755
$100,000 or more.

147
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:33,234
Well,

148
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:37,144
now you can have a 3D printer do it for like all in like

149
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:40,554
1000 bucks us if you buy a new one and filament and everything,

150
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,475
if you buy a really nice printer

151
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,075
way cheaper than that.

152
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,829
OK.

153
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:50,790
You, you may be correct. And I think part of this story as well is the

154
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:55,269
open source tooling to run all this stuff is better than ever.

155
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,269
Well, and that's the thing.

156
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,390
So you can focus on the value that you wanna

157
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,850
add and not running a bunch of stupid servers,

158
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:05,570
-- which
-- I guess ironically is why open source one because

159
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:09,390
the the universe adopted it because now instead of like

160
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:10,304
building

161
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:14,144
all of the crap, I need to serve a website, I can just serve the freaking website.

162
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:19,225
I, you know, I had to set up a static website for uh schema dot GSD dot id and I was like,

163
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:22,635
I want to do this with as little effort and management and maintenance as possible.

164
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:25,635
So yeah, like Cloudflare pages via github

165
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:29,195
-- done in like took about 15 minutes to set up in total.
-- Now.

166
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:32,024
Now I want to clarify though a lot of these

167
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,614
open source

168
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,000
services are not leveraging cloud flare, they're not leveraging Amazon.

169
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,720
Well, they're explicitly avoiding it.

170
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,089
Exactly because those organizations are part of the problem.

171
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,480
They're trying to circumvent. But

172
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:48,459
I mean, a good example is so like we had Jerry Bell on the show a while ago and he,

173
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,489
I don't know if he still does it,

174
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,429
but he was updating his blog on a regular

175
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,570
basis about like what was running Infosec dot social.

176
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,809
And it was a shockingly small amount of

177
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,850
hardware and he found that running it on actual

178
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,570
hardware was cheaper for him than running it on like cloud and we'll put

179
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:07,899
-- cloud in quotes
-- assuming you have the expertise to install and manage like that.

180
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:10,959
That's like you and me saying like getting a really high speed

181
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,660
mesh Wi Fi network at home set up is super easy.

182
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,980
Well, you know what you're doing.

183
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:15,630
And like,

184
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,929
and I had that problem where I had to rebalance my wifi channels and

185
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,579
I have to do it once a month now because like stuff stopped working,

186
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:23,820
like half my IOT devices dropped off the network and wouldn't rejoin.

187
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:26,440
I just had to rebalance the channels like magic

188
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,179
but that's the thing, right? People take a lot of this stuff for granted.

189
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,070
It's like a car mechanic saying, like, why do you,

190
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,469
why do you pay somebody to change your oil?

191
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,179
It's so easy.

192
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,960
Well, yes,

193
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,369
if you know what you're doing and own the right wrench and own

194
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,619
the little slide dolly thing in a pan to put the oil in.

195
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,140
I used to change the oil in my pickup truck all the time because it was like,

196
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,969
it was very expensive because it took like a ton of freaking oil.

197
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:50,539
And eventually I gave up because I'm just like, oh,

198
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,979
this is not worth my time because it took, you know,

199
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:56,739
it was an hour of my life vanished versus just dump it

200
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,440
off down the street and come back tomorrow and get it.

201
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,130
And that's, I mean, and, but again,

202
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,380
part of this is

203
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,940
there are more people with these expertise

204
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,169
and these expertise are easier like you and I

205
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:11,609
know how to tune file systems in ways that nobody in their right mind

206
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,609
ever needs to know again because you just buy an M two drive.

207
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:16,969
I have a fun fact for you.

208
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,729
So

209
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,030
at the time of recording last night

210
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:24,450
I installed an update to my, my Macbook that work makes me use

211
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,599
and the disc cooked itself,

212
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,659
it happens to me at least twice a year. I hate Macbooks.

213
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,280
They hate me like it's just, it's a mutual dislike. And so I spent

214
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,700
is significant basically all night long,

215
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,859
reinstalling Mac Os and getting all my files back. So,

216
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:42,460
-- it's very exciting. No, it's not nice. Their file system sucks
-- to be clear.

217
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:43,159
I'm not trying to

218
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,419
say it's, you know,

219
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,500
essentially things have gotten so much easier that it's actually,

220
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,090
you don't need a six figure salary

221
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:54,619
for assisted men. Plus another one to build the website. Plus another one.

222
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,940
I agree with that. But I don't want to talk about this either.

223
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,409
I'm just gonna keep kicking this can down the road till we get to the.

224
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,619
So here's the deal, let's say there's all of these free services like

225
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:03,880
KBG

226
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,239
is my favorite example right now.

227
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,479
Like I created an account, I poked around a little bit.

228
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:09,869
It's not as feature rich as github. Big surprise.

229
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,030
That's actually not necessarily a bad thing because in some ways,

230
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,739
things like github have too much like, like every time I log into linkedin,

231
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm just like,

232
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:19,609
I just wanna go manage the groups that I have to manage and get the hell out of here.

233
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:25,330
Oh, man, I know. But anyway, so here's the thing. It takes a concerted effort

234
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:26,289
from

235
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,919
all of the people using say github

236
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,760
to want to migrate to something kind of more free.

237
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,479
You would it cost time to move your stuff

238
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:37,380
-- and all the links break. Right. Right.
-- All kinds of stuff, right.

239
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,770
And the question kind of, I, I keep thinking of,

240
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sure there's going to be people who move their stuff.

241
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,179
There's gonna be probably a nontrivial number of people because, like,

242
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,890
there's a lot of open source nerds who love this kind of stuff.

243
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,320
Do we think this sort of thing

244
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:52,719
can make it?

245
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:56,070
And I want to say yes. But I don't know.

246
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,219
-- I really don't, I'm
-- actually gonna steer you back to Mastodon in the sense of,

247
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:04,070
I don't care if Mastodon is popular with the masses or not, it scratches my itch.

248
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,549
-- You
-- know, that's a good point.

249
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,780
-- That's a very good point.
-- I don't care

250
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,280
because all the people I kind of wanna keep an eye on and chat with are on Mastodon.

251
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,289
-- So like
-- for sure,

252
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,309
you know, that's a good point.

253
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,630
You know, like there's a bunch of local restaurants.

254
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,840
I don't want to be super popular because I want to go there and eat and not wait in line.

255
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,460
I know how that,

256
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,059
you know, like I want them to be successful.

257
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,440
Like here's the thing that I noticed during COVID,

258
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,219
all the places that I truly love did find

259
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:33,280
some of them actually expanded, like,

260
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:36,020
like there was one that basically they were like,

261
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,469
yeah,

262
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,239
we took half our dining room and expanded

263
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,520
our kitchen because our take out business is

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,460
-- too busy.
-- Yeah, a bunch of restaurants.

265
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,169
I know, like they don't even have seating anymore.

266
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,390
They're like f in your take out now and I'm like, I can respect that.

267
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,340
-- Like, that's cool.
-- So the thing is you have to define success here and,

268
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,229
and it's like these, you know, these maximalist who are like

269
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,650
this solution has to take over the world for it to win.

270
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:57,059
Well, no,

271
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,849
like if this solution is even used by 0.01

272
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:02,400
of a percent of the existing Infosys uh Infra

273
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,609
uh ecosystem,

274
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,520
-- then that's a gazillion users and that's fine. And you
-- know what else?

275
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,950
I think that's, oh my goodness. You just flooded my brain with thoughts.

276
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,719
When you aren't trying to make money.

277
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,169
You don't care if your growth is 10% per quarter.

278
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,570
Like Mastodon doesn't care if it grows right?

279
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,710
-- Because Mastodon's just,
-- can we even really measure that because it's Federated.

280
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:27,090
-- So all the different servers and
-- like there was a,

281
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:31,960
a site that was basically checking, looking at Mastodon.

282
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:33,210
Oh, that's right. Yeah, I was checking.

283
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,169
But I mean, also like how much of those are spammers

284
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:39,132
-- and how much of that is blah, blah, blah. Right.
-- Oh, for sure. Absolutely. Like you.

285
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:42,103
But, but I mean, Twitter is no different. Twitter's always break.

286
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:45,703
Oh, we have like a billion more users. Yeah. And like half of them are spam.

287
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,882
Well, but again, it, it boils down to what is success like having more users? Cool.

288
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:50,963
But here's the problem.

289
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:55,283
Twitter defines success as, as that horrific user engagement.

290
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:56,372
The doom scroll keeping

291
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:56,736
you

292
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:59,986
hooked in and shoving ads down your throat and blah, blah, blah,

293
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:00,596
which

294
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:01,736
like to, well,

295
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:04,796
we were just discussing actually the attention economy before the podcast

296
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,835
and I was pointing out that like, as a, you know,

297
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:09,596
sophisticated technical person of means, we,

298
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:12,135
you and I do a lot of things to protect our attention, right?

299
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:14,495
-- Ad blockers,
-- I'm not sophisticated just

300
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:15,036
for the record.

301
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:17,745
But I mean, we, well, but do you run an ad blocker?

302
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,955
Yeah. So you're sophisticated?

303
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,570
Ok. And so that's the thing, right?

304
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,940
Like Twitter's version of success is literally my version of hell,

305
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,929
like if Twitter gets what they want out of me,

306
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,760
that would be my life would be a living hell.

307
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,750
OK. So no one can see this, but I just want to clarify what's going on.

308
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,919
So Kurt just moved his cameras so I can see his cat on his desk,

309
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,219
my,

310
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,489
my son's cat, whatever.

311
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,700
And this is twice. Now you've done this for me and he likes hanging out with me.

312
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,869
It amuses me that for some reason you feel the need to

313
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,820
move your camera so I can see you petting a cat,

314
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,580
you like chatting.

315
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,219
-- He likes
-- to be part of the, you know,

316
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,719
it's a three mammal podcast now,

317
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,969
a mammal.

318
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,549
Anyway. Anyway, OK. So,

319
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,419
-- oh man,
-- I always wanted to get him to purr to see if you can remove the noise.

320
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,289
I, I of course, I can, I, I have magic powers.

321
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,559
Kurt, like I should say, I don't like there's so many good plugins now.

322
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,260
The soft, well, and that's an,

323
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:17,135
an example of this is like, I've actually set up a CV S server

324
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,215
and it was a horrible nightmare back in the day,

325
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,054
-- the CV
-- S the version management system thing, you mean?

326
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:22,434
Yeah, that was

327
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:22,565
that

328
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:23,854
system.

329
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:25,465
If you don't know what that is,

330
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,434
-- like
-- the alternative was a shared folder.

331
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:28,775
Uh

332
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:29,965
Yes

333
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:30,835
and

334
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:31,724
no,

335
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:36,705
there were the most of the source code management systems of that time.

336
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:40,434
What they did is you had to lock a file,

337
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:42,854
check out a file. And when I say check out a copy,

338
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,039
you lock the file,

339
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,969
you check it out and now Kurt's moving his camera back that the cat left.

340
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,000
But you check,

341
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,390
you lock the file, you check it out, you make your changes,

342
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,039
you check it back in and then you unlock it.

343
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:58,039
And so it wasn't you, that's what made C DS so popular is CV S could apply a diff.

344
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,349
So you didn't have to lock a file because I remember what always happened.

345
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,619
Invariably at any of these places I worked,

346
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:06,349
someone would lock a file, go on vacation

347
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,429
and then we'd have to like unlock the freaking file.

348
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,609
It was, well, the, the metaphor was a library book

349
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,859
and it made sense because that's all the technology support at the time.

350
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:18,229
But, but again, that's the thing like setting this stuff up,

351
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:22,799
got so much easier and running it got easier and using it also got easier

352
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,869
-- and C DS was terrible.
-- Yeah. Like it was, there were books on it

353
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:27,719
and I mean,

354
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,429
using G

355
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,669
well and using Get

356
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,609
beyond simple pulls and checkouts. Like you start re basing and branching.

357
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:36,030
Yes, it gets complicated fast.

358
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:41,330
-- But like 99% of us never need to do that.
-- Uh C DS supported branches. It was terrible.

359
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,390
Yeah. So

360
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:45,489
I think the thing is to define success and here's the thing,

361
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,719
like a good example is the Global Security Database.

362
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:51,570
I I define success as people use it and find it useful.

363
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:55,969
And we're not there yet admittedly, but I don't define success, for example,

364
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,489
as like we beat CV E like I don't care.

365
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:01,570
See and part of this actually goes to

366
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,669
um

367
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,929
what is it, the uh what is it the four or five stages of management where

368
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,130
uh like the bottom level,

369
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,320
you essentially have prison games where people are shaking each other,

370
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,260
including people in their own group to get

371
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:14,210
tribal leadership is the name of that book.

372
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,909
Tribal leadership. Thank you. That's the one

373
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,960
I just recommended that to some people I know. Excellent.

374
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,130
And I'm kind of like where I am with the GST is like, II, I just don't care

375
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,289
about CV E like and I say this as somebody who used to

376
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,460
be very much into CV E for 20 years, well, 15 years

377
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,640
and I just don't care anymore. Like I want to go do my GSD thing.

378
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,380
And make something of value for the community.

379
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,609
And you know, and by that measure,

380
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,150
then KBG

381
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,780
will absolutely succeed.

382
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,679
Probably by the measure of, will Colberg get 1% of github

383
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,179
-- to transfer over to them. God, no, probably never.
-- No, probably not. Probably not.

384
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:50,719
But like,

385
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,840
who cares?

386
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,760
-- Yeah, I
-- mean, that's fair. And now here's going back to your Wikipedia complaints.

387
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,070
KBG

388
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,359
claims they have 12 years of revenue.

389
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,739
Well, 12 years of runway,

390
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:06,770
-- right?
-- 12 years of runway. So like I'm glad, right? I want a foundation, I want

391
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,160
12 X then they only have one. Well,

392
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,729
I don't know the math but you

393
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:10,979
know,

394
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,589
-- I
-- I understand what you're saying.

395
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,630
And obviously Mastodon is a similar situation where, well,

396
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,848
Mastodon's decentralized though.

397
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:17,348
So like if in

398
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:18,750
like for example, Masto

399
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,410
dot Social, that's where I started out. And so did you

400
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,750
and then both of us,

401
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,829
I went first

402
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,569
and then you went to Infosec dot Social because it was kind of like this is

403
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,150
infosec dot exchange, not Infosec dot Social. I think we called it that earlier.

404
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,510
We're like nubs.

405
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:33,079
Yeah,

406
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:36,510
the the Infosec site run by Jerry. Um

407
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,209
and like,

408
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,880
see that's the thing and and

409
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,760
Mastodon is a great example where it actually explicitly

410
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,439
in the protocol has a transfer mechanism of like,

411
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:50,390
you know, Kurt left here, went over there and like it told all the people

412
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,500
-- my
-- Mastodon account multiple times because I think

413
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,880
I started out on Mastodon dot online.

414
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,770
And then I think I went somewhere else and then

415
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,329
I went to Mastodon dot social and then I went to

416
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,920
Infosec dot Exchange. But, but here's so here's the thing though, right?

417
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,300
So Infosec dot Exchange

418
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,750
man, I wish, I wish stuff like it did that.

419
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,119
Oh man, seriously.

420
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,050
But, but so here's the thing, right?

421
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,430
There's still like the the core Mastodon people and like,

422
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:18,219
I still give them money even though I'm not using Mastodon dot social

423
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:22,790
anymore because I recognize like they need to fund development of Mastodon.

424
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,910
And then I also give Jerry Bunny for running

425
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,510
Infosec dot Exchange because I recognize like

426
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:34,449
he's a guy who's working way harder than me to give me a marvelous service, you know,

427
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:37,109
and, and I think that's part of it too. Like if Twitter said

428
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,680
we're gonna charge you $5 a month, I probably would have been like f this amount,

429
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,170
but I, I'm giving infosec

430
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,520
dot Exchange $5 a month and I'm happy to do it.

431
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,359
I don't feel like an abusive partner at infosec dot Exchange.

432
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:53,609
We're like Facebook and Twitter and all these social networks. Like

433
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:56,239
it's just about we're going to cram garbage down your

434
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,510
throat and you're gonna eat it and you're gonna like it

435
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:01,579
and monetize your privacy and monetize your

436
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:03,670
attention in ways that are detrimental to you

437
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,140
for sure. Oh, you know what? That's another thing.

438
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:08,709
My mental health when I quit using Twitter,

439
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:08,920
I

440
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:12,449
recognize the definite change in myself.

441
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:17,010
And I'm like, this makes me sad because if I see what happened to my, my, like,

442
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,459
happiness, I'm sure other people

443
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:21,270
really noticed it.

444
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,920
-- Yeah.
-- I think the other thing too is

445
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:27,020
we've only now had the time to see

446
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,040
the problems, especially at scale that come from these things.

447
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,719
Oh, perfect example in Canada is like the whole trucker convoy protest

448
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,849
debacle,

449
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,165
social media component of that.

450
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:40,484
Like if you told me that 10 years ago, I'd have been like,

451
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:42,214
like we need to get you to a hospital.

452
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,944
You've clearly taken all the drugs,

453
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:45,885
we need to get your stomach pumped,

454
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:46,525
right?

455
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,724
But, and now it's like, oh wow, no,

456
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:54,104
this is like some horrific toxic like stuff that leads to people getting dead.

457
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:56,550
I mean, like, oh for sure, for sure.

458
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:56,859
You know,

459
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:01,750
people are being radicalized online but the point is until like part of it is

460
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:04,459
people are like, oh, Facebook's not great. It's kind of gross, whatever.

461
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,849
But now we've actually seen how horrifically terrible it

462
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,119
is to the point where people are like,

463
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,359
oh, we need to build something better.

464
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,069
I mean,

465
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:10,520
that

466
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:11,790
has ideally

467
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:15,219
sort of technological and maybe social components to

468
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:19,140
prevent the failure scenarios of well Facebook and

469
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,959
you know, Twitter.

470
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,500
So I, I wonder and I don't want to come off sounding like a, a little too weird on this.

471
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,380
But I wonder if part of the failure problem, these social media sites have,

472
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,099
is their revenue

473
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,579
is ads

474
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,569
and

475
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,589
when your revenue is ads, you probably need like obscene user growth. Not, not 10%.

476
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,910
Probably way more than that.

477
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,229
No, it's worse than that because you're competing for attention.

478
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,709
There are so many things you can do now. Right? Like, whenever

479
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,319
mono is my, like whenever Felix says he's bored, I'm like, well,

480
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:51,270
you're a boring person

481
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:54,209
because you have books, you have a cat, you have homework,

482
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,229
you have like a ka jillion things to do.

483
00:20:56,439 --> 00:21:00,630
You have all of the internet on your phone pocket thing.

484
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,150
The knowledge of humanity is within reach.

485
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,979
And so the problem too is,

486
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:07,229
is that Twitter is competing with linkedin

487
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,300
is competing with Facebook for your attention,

488
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,699
for your money, for your

489
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,469
hitting

490
00:21:12,795 --> 00:21:14,005
share link or whatever.

491
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,994
Like we perfect example. We run a podcast.

492
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:20,494
We are competing for people's attention and, uh, to the tune of half an hour a week.

493
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:26,604
That's true. And we're a great example because we lose money on this podcast.

494
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:27,074
No,

495
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,535
none of this wee stuff. It's, you,

496
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:33,775
-- you pay all the bills.
-- I pay the bill. Wait, look, it's $40 a month. I can live with it.

497
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,989
-- I should probably cut you a check or something. I don't care.
-- Here's the thing.

498
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:39,020
-- This gives me joy.
-- I'll

499
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,819
send you more cheese.

500
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,260
There

501
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,530
you go.

502
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,880
Yeah, I'm almost out of cheesy

503
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,689
from when I smuggled them out of Canada.

504
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,000
-- Oh, ok.
-- I'll go, I'll go I'll go to Costco.

505
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:50,930
Which if, if anyone listening, there's a snack food in Canada called Chey's.

506
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:55,130
-- The bag looks like it's from 1965. They're still shipped in.
-- It is

507
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,239
-- because it is, it probably
-- is.

508
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,719
Like they are the best thing ever.

509
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,709
Well, the best though is their website. Have you been?

510
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,170
I've told you to go to their website.

511
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,250
It, no, it's like three pages from 1990.

512
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,160
-- And I
-- love their construction spinning.

513
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,910
And the thing is they're the kind of company that we make.

514
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,050
We're Hawkins, cheesy, we make cheesy.

515
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,560
I mean,

516
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,060
that,

517
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,069
that's the,

518
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,239
this,

519
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,500
I think this fits in nicely.

520
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,689
The conversation like this is a company that does their thing.

521
00:22:24,699 --> 00:22:26,589
They, I assume they're not a public company.

522
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:28,689
-- Uh,
-- I think they're family owned, but

523
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:29,430
you know what I mean?

524
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:36,380
Like, there are times you can be content with what you have and that's ok sometimes.

525
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,469
Right. Like, there's plenty of small businesses like that.

526
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,910
Like our podcast is like that. I don't care what

527
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,140
our listener numbers are. It's not, I have no interest in, in growing the show.

528
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,430
It's just something we do.

529
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,959
And I think that's the power and that's probably what should scare

530
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,329
the crap out of anyone paying attention to all this open source.

531
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,560
Like they don't care if they grow or not.

532
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:01,140
Wt Hawkins Limited is currently under the directorship of President Ken Hawkins,

533
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,699
grandson of founder WT after WT Hawkins passed away in 1961.

534
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:05,910
His son WW

535
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,959
Hawkins,

536
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,119
uh assumed control and guided the company for nearly 30 years.

537
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,010
Continuing with the basics, family values fresh year.

538
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:15,359
But yeah, they basically, they make, they make cheesy and cheesy are delicious.

539
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,359
They are like, they're,

540
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:20,390
they're the best thing I was in Canada for the Open Source Summit in Vancouver.

541
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,560
And when I, when I got to the airport I had some time to kill.

542
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,089
And I look,

543
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:26,810
and I see they're selling cheesy at an airport store

544
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,160
and I literally filled my suitcase with as many cheeses.

545
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,400
I bought all of the cheesy.

546
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,760
They were selling at this little shop and the

547
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,270
lady looked at me like I was on something,

548
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,719
but I'm like these are the best.

549
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:36,520
I love these.

550
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,420
Yeah, that I filled my suitcase as full as I could fit in.

551
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,189
Well, it's like nutter butter up until a few years ago.

552
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:44,469
You could not get nutter butter in Canada reliably

553
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:45,969
or tim

554
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,390
tams. They're available in Australia and Western Canada.

555
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,550
But ok, so back to this. But that's the thing people.

556
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:54,030
The problem is a lot of people look at this from

557
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,979
the business point of view slash start up point of view

558
00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:58,939
where we have to have hypergrowth because I'm gonna put two

559
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:01,734
or five years of my life and money into this thing.

560
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:04,535
And if I don't get a payoff at the end of a million dollars,

561
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:06,974
like I'm basically stupid and broke.

562
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,734
Whereas a lot of these open source people are either, like, this is kind of a hobby,

563
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:14,775
this is on the side or they're like, kind of, I'm just gonna say hippie,

564
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:17,055
I don't know what other word to use, but they're kind of like hippie and they're,

565
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:20,135
they're happy to live a very minimal lifestyle

566
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:21,775
and, like, turn out some code.

567
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:22,974
Ok. Ok.

568
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,920
I'm going to do the thing

569
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:29,140
I promised myself I wouldn't do. And I'm going to tie this into the last episode.

570
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,160
We just did about new spaces. Like

571
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,869
when Toma and Carol say we don't want to do name spaces, right?

572
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:39,250
What like our incentive is I like name spaces because

573
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,219
it makes certain things I want to do easier.

574
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,859
But

575
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:44,030
they don't and it doesn't make their lives easier.

576
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,369
They can say no, it's open source, there's nothing I can do.

577
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,709
They,

578
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,790
they have all the power and I think that's

579
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,099
the beauty of this and that's also what makes it

580
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,869
amazing and what makes open source so powerful.

581
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,630
And it's also to some degree the market has spoken like, if enough.

582
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,459
Oh, perfect example. Master Dawn and Search,

583
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,540
right? Masson

584
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,099
does not have search, which I personally believe is a good thing. A very good thing.

585
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,449
I didn't like it at first, but I,

586
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,069
-- I'm ok with it now. You
-- know what?

587
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:12,410
It prevents so much toxic and malicious behavior, right?

588
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,430
Because people can't get dog

589
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,520
pled. Like if you, if you want to be outraged about something.

590
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,609
You have to really work at it. You can't just search for people tooting about

591
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:21,530
cats and then go hate on them.

592
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:21,979
Right.

593
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:23,089
So,

594
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,290
yeah, so I, I personally love that Mastodon does not have search again.

595
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,699
At first I was like, oh, this is so stupid.

596
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:32,020
I need search and then I was like a few weeks later, I'm like, no,

597
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,079
apparently we don't need search.

598
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:34,000
This is just fine.

599
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:34,959
And

600
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,839
if enough people really, really, really wanted search, well,

601
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:42,130
they would demand it and somebody would fill that need either

602
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,849
for money or because they also think search is needed

603
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:46,660
and they would run a server with search now.

604
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,810
Is that gonna happen? Yeah, absolutely.

605
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,020
Because we've already seen that there's those

606
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,969
instances that are just crawling the,

607
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:53,849
the, the uh Fetty versus spear or whatever it's called

608
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,750
and like indexing everything and like

609
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:56,239
A I

610
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:58,979
companies are like, they, they're picking that food.

611
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,469
Well, and they,

612
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:03,989
they absolutely have to because like Reddit and all those companies are closing,

613
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,709
like, they're gonna be like shutterstock now, like, well, Twitter, right?

614
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:09,229
Like you want access to the tweets, it's starting at, what,

615
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,790
10 or 20 grand a month or something stupid.

616
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,469
Now, 42 $1000 is the expected cost for Twitter's API and this, this actually ties in,

617
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,400
there's a link I sent you earlier today.

618
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,900
There's

619
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,040
a

620
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,920
Reddit third party client, uh uh Apollo

621
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,349
is what it's called

622
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:25,660
and apparently

623
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,140
they're gonna start charging these third party apps to use

624
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,829
the API and Apollo will need $20 million a year

625
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:33,510
to

626
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,680
-- consider
-- that open A I was trained on every reddit comment with plus

627
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:39,900
like over three vote up

628
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,349
votes

629
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,420
like that is such gold in those hills.

630
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,260
So obviously,

631
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,520
conde Nast probably had a bunch of screaming meetings with their lawyers,

632
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:50,420
you know, saying how can we change the terms of service and how can we blah, blah,

633
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,050
blah anyways,

634
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,079
you know, for sure.

635
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:52,550
So

636
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,109
that's,

637
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:53,780
I think

638
00:26:54,949 --> 00:27:00,400
again, it really boils down to is what does success mean to these entities.

639
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,430
And if the barrier to entry is so like perfect example, I was like, hey,

640
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,420
Mas sounds really cool.

641
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,180
Wouldn't it be cool if you could like find

642
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:09,810
people more easily by using their email address?

643
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:13,489
Well, yeah, there's a thing for that called web finger. It's literally a protocol,

644
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,579
right? Designed for that.

645
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:17,709
And so you can like

646
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,300
in your Mastodon search bar, you can type

647
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:21,140
K

648
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:21,910
at KT at

649
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,640
seafood.org and it will magically through the magical web finger,

650
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,280
bounce you to my actual account on infosec dot exchange.

651
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:30,939
And so I

652
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,280
built and run a web finger service that is free because

653
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,760
while the the cost of setting it up and building it was,

654
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,459
it was tens of hours to learn and to program, it's fun to do.

655
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,989
And I also wanted to learn how to do web finger.

656
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,880
So I'm like, well, what better way to learn than to build one.

657
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,449
And I ran into a bunch of weird problems.

658
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,119
And I also learned a lot about the protocol in actually

659
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,410
building it and deploying it and running into stuff.

660
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,400
And for example, I was pretty sure Twitter was going to go full

661
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:57,589
silly.

662
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,150
And so I basically have like AAA headless chrome thing that will actually, you know,

663
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,250
look at your Twitter profile to look for, you know,

664
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,979
to make sure you're linked to your, uh Mastodon profile.

665
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,439
And of course, now I'm like, ha ha

666
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:11,300
because I thought they were gonna maybe pull the plug on that in a year or two.

667
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,260
And then it's like, no, like a month later they pulled the plug

668
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:14,114
that and I'm like, whoa,

669
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,204
good thing. I'm smart and paranoid.

670
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:19,834
It's, it's like, literally just, it's not a hobby.

671
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:22,954
It's part of my job, but at the same time, it's such a small amount of time.

672
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:27,084
It's doable for one person and it's open source. So now anybody that wants to do it

673
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:29,125
doesn't even have to build it. They just

674
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:29,755
like

675
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:32,270
fork the code and turn it on. I

676
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,239
mean, to a degree that makes sense.

677
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,119
And that's the beauty of this is like, we're getting there with stuff, like get,

678
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,920
get used to be very complicated.

679
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,359
Now,

680
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm sure you and I could probably build a passable, get service in a few weeks.

681
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,000
It wouldn't be great. It wouldn't be pretty,

682
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,380
-- I
-- don't think it would work,

683
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,180
they'll just use code

684
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:47,640
beg

685
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,810
and code

686
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,699
is built on. There's, uh,

687
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:56,319
what's the name of the thing that, that report that, that undercuts it.

688
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:58,579
There, there's some open source

689
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,369
software that's basically driving all of this and I, I don't remember the name of it.

690
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,479
Um, it's in their docks, I think somewhere you get the idea. There's,

691
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,520
there's a lot of open source that kind of

692
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,770
does a lot of this stuff that's really exciting.

693
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,810
And here's something I really love about a place like KBG

694
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,290
and how much they essentially don't care about the

695
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,130
quote unquote competition on the about page alternatives.

696
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,819
KG. And then they give a list of alternatives

697
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:24,094
like self hosting, git lab community edition source Hut Forge

698
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:25,305
go uh for,

699
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:26,015
for

700
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:27,574
Joe, I can't pronounce it.

701
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:30,594
That's the name of the thing that it runs on top of

702
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:31,125
the.

703
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:31,604
Yeah,

704
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:34,084
but that's the thing like they're like we're doing our thing and we're

705
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:36,964
so happy about doing our thing and we still fundamentally don't care about

706
00:29:37,114 --> 00:29:38,165
winning or losing.

707
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:40,645
Here's some alternatives to use if you don't like us.

708
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:41,484
I mean,

709
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:44,035
I bet you there's not a similar page of github.

710
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:50,079
Yeah, I agree with that. And, and I think let's, let's land this plane.

711
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:50,750
But

712
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,869
I think from the open source angle and obviously not a lot of security in this one, but

713
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:03,160
I feel like we are at this inflection point in the world of software and services

714
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,349
and you could argue we were there with software

715
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:09,500
probably 10 or 15 years ago where I think

716
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,469
you had like the dominance of Windows and you had the open source people saying like,

717
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,969
we have to do something about this.

718
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:16,750
And I think

719
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,170
ironically

720
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:21,824
that war ended because open source one and Microsoft

721
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:24,974
-- just join the club
-- even more web browsers one.

722
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:27,574
-- And,
-- and sure that's part of it. And I think

723
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:27,974
though,

724
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:32,655
how many, how many things do you use on a daily basis that you can't live without,

725
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,454
that don't actually run on your computer and are just a web browser

726
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:36,395
mediated.

727
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:40,614
-- And so
-- as we record a podcast in a web browser,

728
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,994
basically open source one in the sense of,

729
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:48,295
oh, we don't really care if Windows owns the desktop, 90 whatever percent.

730
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,290
It just, you need a web browser,

731
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:52,410
-- right?
-- I guess that's fair. It doesn't matter.

732
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,979
-- They
-- basically went to the ne it's like

733
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:56,650
it, they skip to the next iteration of technology.

734
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:01,000
And I think now we have all these as a service things

735
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:01,719
that

736
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,989
at first they were novel and amusing. And I think now

737
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,949
many people are starting to ask questions and say, you know, like, what is going on?

738
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:13,109
Why are we doing these things? And so I'm hopeful

739
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,650
that we can see some of these like nonprofit foundation fueled entities

740
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,390
kind of catch on and maybe not take over.

741
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:26,239
But I think they're going to drive change

742
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,280
within these larger organizations and that's fundamentally what we want

743
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,319
or even, no, I would say even better than that,

744
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:36,839
they're gonna give people options that didn't exist before. And that's ok

745
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,949
and much more palatable options. Like, like, like

746
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:41,979
comparing

747
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:42,560
KBG to

748
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:43,130
github,

749
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,469
if I had to label one, like, cruelty free to programmers building,

750
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,000
it probably would be Coburg.

751
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,599
Right? Like,

752
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:53,219
maybe, maybe I, I don't know if I go that far but,

753
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:54,520
but

754
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:55,449
it, it's,

755
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,550
I think

756
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,760
I finally have some hope and II,

757
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,619
I would blame Mastodon for the inception of

758
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,239
-- this hope because I remember
-- that showed the Fet

759
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:06,810
Averse can work because the, the fetter

760
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,310
has been around for a long time. But

761
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,479
-- who cares?
-- No one, no one cared. No one

762
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:10,949
used it.

763
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,479
And it was until Twitter went full silly.

764
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,244
Like we actually do need somewhere else now.

765
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:18,765
-- And
-- that's the thing. I don't think

766
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:20,724
github's ever gonna go full silly.

767
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:24,964
-- I don't think a lot of these other services, Microsoft
-- is way

768
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:28,425
-- saner than people give them credit for
-- II, I think they are.

769
00:32:28,435 --> 00:32:30,405
But I also think it's healthy

770
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,685
to have

771
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:35,665
something there poking them with a stick. And I feel like that was

772
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:38,714
ironically, it was open source to Microsoft 15 years ago.

773
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:41,935
It's now open source to Microsoft again, just in a different way.

774
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:42,479
I

775
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,599
think it only ever can be open source because it's in the

776
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:48,280
sense of it can only ever be the crazy small start ups.

777
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,079
-- It,
-- it has to be free and it has to be unencumbered by

778
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,510
the, the limits of capitalism as, as, like, like lefty as that sounds.

779
00:32:57,699 --> 00:32:59,530
I think it's true though. I think

780
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:03,290
it is what has to happen. And I think in many instances,

781
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:07,199
open source had they, they hold all the cards

782
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,079
in these conversations.

783
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:12,479
And so, I don't know, I'm, I'm excited to see what's gonna happen. I, I'm, I

784
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,619
love the cult of the dead cow so I can't wait to

785
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,359
see what sort of ridiculous thing they probably do this summer.

786
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:22,800
Remember the birth of the web and just all the insanity from 95 to 99.

787
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:26,359
And now it's just a, we don't even think about websites anymore.

788
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,920
It's just, it's like roads or

789
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,489
-- like sidewalks.
-- It's,

790
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,109
it's unregulated infrastructure and that's a different problem.

791
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:32,739
But,

792
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,040
yeah,

793
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,579
but I mean, and then we saw that with, you know,

794
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:37,949
taking payments online in commerce and all of a

795
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:40,800
sudden now we're doing all this purchasing and whatever online

796
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:44,030
and now with these now we can do that with relatively

797
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,569
complicated and difficult services are now not so complicated and difficult

798
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:49,949
to

799
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,900
like, well, yeah, exactly.

800
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,400
And so I think we're going to continue

801
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,469
to see this and I think right now we're right for this explosion of community

802
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,900
because people realize

803
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:03,069
community matters like this is like we're humans like

804
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,250
that's true. Like community matters. I'm sorry, full stop.

805
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,310
But community

806
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:09,310
driven by

807
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:15,000
had based companies as we've seen with Facebook. Maybe it's not the way to go.

808
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,550
Yeah, I'll agree with that. All right, I'm, I'm landing this plane. Thank you, Kurt.

809
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,389
Thank you ever for listening. Go to open source security, podcast.com.

810
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:22,590
Hit up the show notes, UZ Pound

811
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,239
do says podcast hashtag hit us up on social media.

812
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,030
Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day.

813
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,239
-- You too. Thanks everybody. Thanks
-- everyone. Bye bye.
