Hello, and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,850
I'm Kurt Siefried and with me is Joshua Bresser.

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,119
Hello. He said, please, Kurt call me Josh. Don't ever, Joshua is what I hear.

3
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:16,510
I'm in trouble

4
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:20,909
as far as I know, I'm not in trouble at this moment. So let's just,

5
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,600
let's keep it informal.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,190
Well, it really doesn't count until I use your middle name.

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:26,389
Yes.

8
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:29,459
Anyway, how are you doing?

9
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:30,879
I'm good. I'm good.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,259
So, I'm pleased to say the podcast went public last week.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,700
This will be our second week of actual

12
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,939
real time news. And, and that's exciting for us. And so

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,380
what are we gonna talk about this week? Kurt, what you got on the list?

14
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:49,540
Well, I was thinking maybe we could do, uh, some things around container security,

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,400
uh, container security. Everybody's favorite topic.

16
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,299
But, but in all seriousness, that is something interesting.

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,680
But how about before we get to containers? Let's, uh, let's look at the news.

18
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,040
You've got a handful of things here that,

19
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,680
that you wrote down that are actually super interesting

20
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,800
and, and maybe not the most open source topics, but still very,

21
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,519
very interesting from the security point of view.

22
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:10,169
Well, yeah, one of my favorites this week was, um,

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,239
somebody basically hacked into a shipping database, uh, for a shipping company

24
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:20,029
and figured out who's sending gold bars around

25
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:21,849
and intercepted the shipments.

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,419
And it was actually caught because the post or, uh,

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,230
I don't know what the correct term is nowadays.

28
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,589
The

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,870
postal carrier.

30
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,989
Uh, actually,

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,629
well, in this case, yeah,

32
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:35,550
he actually knew the customer and so the guy at the door trying to convince him to,

33
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,940
you know, hand over a package,

34
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,080
you know, he knew that wasn't the right guy. Yeah.

35
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:40,510
And it got me thinking there's, you know,

36
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,019
there's all sorts of fungible goods that don't have serial numbers and that you can

37
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:47,129
sell it a pawnshop or online easily like

38
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:50,690
stolen beanie babies or magically gathering trading cards

39
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,569
or

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
probably,

41
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:55,470
um, but, you know, that's the thing, right.

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,209
There's, there's when you think about how

43
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:00,175
reliable the majority,

44
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:02,985
like when you think about how many packages go missing from Amazon,

45
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:07,294
I bet the number is horrifying if we actually know what it is.

46
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:10,663
Well, true, much like, you know, luggage at airports.

47
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:12,485
But when you consider overall the rate

48
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,404
of loss, you know, it's pretty low.

49
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:19,255
I, I suspect this now, but here's what I took out this, that, that is interesting is

50
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:23,464
I understand the security angle of protecting your

51
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:26,414
data and sometimes when you're sending something sensitive,

52
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:27,574
you have to be careful that in fact,

53
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,710
I, we'll have to look this up. I believe that when they shipped

54
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,679
one of those super huge, one of a kind diamonds that were found,

55
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,300
they actually put it in a brown box and,

56
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:41,229
and mailed it via like regular post because they didn't want anyone to know

57
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,860
it was, there was no other way to do it securely.

58
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:45,300
So that kind of security through obscurity.

59
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:50,429
However, in this case, I find it fascinating that it was really kind of the,

60
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,429
the human angle that fixed this because the postman knew who it was supposed to go to

61
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:59,940
and just due to having that interaction that actually foiled the bad guy in this,

62
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:00,100
you know,

63
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,070
I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you kids and your dogs sort of thing

64
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:07,740
versus relying on any sort of technology to help us out here, which quite frankly,

65
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,350
I don't know if technology could necessarily solve this problem.

66
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:14,649
Well, I mean, at a very simple level asking to see some ID, right?

67
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,419
That, that introduces another step of having to create fake ID, at least, you know,

68
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,399
for the bad guys,

69
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:22,520
you know, and I mean, it's, it's not hard but it, it does,

70
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,360
it does make it a little bit harder.

71
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:25,520
Um,

72
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,559
has a delivery person

73
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,759
ever asked for ID from you?

74
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:33,759
Yes. But mostly because of duties that were charged

75
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,800
things that ship from the States quite often I have to pay duty on them.

76
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:41,470
And so they want to see ID, not for the package so much, but because of the credit card.

77
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,990
Sure. Ok. Ok.

78
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,990
The first thing I can think of here is,

79
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:48,809
can you imagine how much more expensive shipping would

80
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,850
become if every time a package was delivered,

81
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,050
the delivery man had to say, can I please see your ID? And I'll say, oh, crap.

82
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,009
It's in the house.

83
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,970
Wait here while I go dig through my belongings

84
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,089
trying to remember where I put my wallet.

85
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:05,449
And I bet in many instances you'd probably be talking about adding near an

86
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,889
hour a day to a delivery person schedule just to find I DS.

87
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:10,770
Yeah.

88
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:13,910
Well, I mean, quite the opposite I've done is with, for example,

89
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,510
with uh one of the sh M Comeys, I deal with I, I went through a rather lengthy process

90
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:23,149
to qualify for their signature not required even when a signature is required.

91
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:24,720
Right?

92
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,269
So, and,

93
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,369
and the end result of this is I have a little sticker on my mailbox with a barcode

94
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:30,589
and their logo on it

95
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,019
so that the guy can blip it

96
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,440
instead of waiting for me to take a signature.

97
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,019
And then you can just leave the package uh uh

98
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:40,140
behind the snow shovel or whatever, you know, under the mat by the door.

99
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,170
That's, that's crazy, man. You, you opted for the less

100
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,720
-- secure option. Well
-- done.

101
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,480
I don't, I rarely buy anything worth more than 20 or $30 online.

102
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,640
That's true too. I, I, you know, it's just not worth it. Right.

103
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:54,730
Like I bought some D cell batteries for a flashlight

104
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,600
and the weirdest thing

105
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:56,709
because Amazon use some, like,

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,850
off brand shipping company that I've never heard of locally.

107
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,720
Uh, probably because,

108
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,390
uh, probably because, well, yeah,

109
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,809
I just see this random dude standing on my porch with, well,

110
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,119
an Amazon box and I'm like,

111
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,730
thinking one of my neighbors received it accidentally or something,

112
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:13,899
you know, and then he gets in his station wagon and leaves.

113
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,359
Uh, and I looked it up and it's, it's,

114
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,859
I think what happened is because we were gonna have,

115
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:20,250
we were potentially going to have a postal strike here a few weeks ago that

116
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,929
Amazon

117
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:25,040
started outsourcing a lot of their deliveries to be on the safe side.

118
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,170
-- Sure.
-- Sure. Sure.

119
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:26,649
Um

120
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:26,989
You know,

121
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:27,859
reminds me

122
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,850
of is I remember one time.

123
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,239
Uh In fact, no, th th this was

124
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:35,549
the first laptop I was ever sent by Red Hat.

125
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:39,679
They sent it in. I think it was three packages. There was the,

126
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,649
the laptop and a docking station and I believe there was

127
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,839
power connections or something like that that came with it.

128
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
And I'll never forget this because

129
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:50,049
the first box comes and it requires a signature.

130
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,329
And I'm like, oh, my laptop finally came. That's fantastic.

131
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:53,309
And

132
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,559
it shows up and I look at it

133
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:59,230
and it's the docking station and I'm like, man, come on this, this sucks.

134
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,929
You know, I've got a docking station, no laptop.

135
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,489
And then the next day the laptop came, the guy said it on the port,

136
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,170
rang the bell and left there was no signature required on the box of the laptop in it.

137
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:11,010
And I'm thinking this is hilarious that this happened in this order.

138
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,850
But that, that, that happens. I'm sure more often than not. But, all right.

139
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,890
Anyway, what, what else, what else we got on our list?

140
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,959
So then another interesting thing is

141
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,079
talking about the French Dark Web

142
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,000
and how, apparently there's,

143
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,519
there's actually some really big differences in sort of

144
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,570
the various countries in their dark webs and their,

145
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,049
you know,

146
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,519
illegal online marketplaces and what they sell and how they sell it, which, uh,

147
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,010
I wouldn't have guessed, you know,

148
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,029
-- I would have thought the Global Underground is sort of more consistent
-- and

149
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,709
it makes France special in this case.

150
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:47,920
So apparently they have some really strong reputation sort of

151
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,549
controls that basically if you go on these dark webs

152
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,630
and either don't ship the stuff you're supposed to

153
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,239
or don't pay for the stuff you're supposed to,

154
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,000
you will be named and shamed,

155
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:58,660
uh, and driven out.

156
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:04,660
Uh II, I believe that actually. Have you read Krebs's book Spam Nation by chance?

157
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,489
So you should

158
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,980
read it again

159
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,279
and he talks about this, in fact, on this kind of, you know,

160
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,140
underbelly of the internet, we could call it perhaps

161
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,839
the way some of these organizations run

162
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,959
is that there's a very specific reputation system

163
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:21,820
and

164
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:24,850
essentially, you know, if you can, the thief

165
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:26,230
you're done,

166
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:30,250
they will everything from just ruining your ability to conduct business to,

167
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,250
in some cases even, you know, physically coming after you.

168
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,910
It, it's a fascinating read. I would, I would suggest it for anybody out there

169
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:38,410
about what's going on

170
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,989
it. Yeah. It's, it's wild how

171
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,290
I do. We want to call it advanced.

172
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:47,149
I don't know what to even call it when we're dealing with kind of this, this

173
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:51,579
other side of, of the net and, and ransomware is the same thing. Right.

174
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,779
There are ransomware companies

175
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,049
that have reputations and even support for that matter.

176
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,700
I mean, they're running like legitimate businesses. It's crazy.

177
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,059
Well, it's, it's, if you look at some of the, you know,

178
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,559
less developed nations with the kidnapping issues,

179
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:05,929
right.

180
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,079
Kidnapping doesn't work unless, you know, you're gonna get your person back.

181
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,019
You know, you, you can't, and you can't damage them too much.

182
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,519
Yes. That, that, I mean, that's a good point wild man.

183
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,100
Although I think

184
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,190
so. Does this make France special? I haven't read this article.

185
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,190
I admit, I apologize.

186
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,339
I suspect it's not special and I mean, let's face it,

187
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,549
there's so much of this going on that by definition we don't really know about,

188
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:33,058
you know, and there's, there are companies that track it

189
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,690
and write reports. Um,

190
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,739
and I suspect in many ways it's not as bad as we fear.

191
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,099
But at the same time, I mean, I know I've read articles talking about,

192
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,809
um, what was that guy? He set up a computer program to buy things off of the dark web.

193
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:51,179
Uh, just like things that cost, like, what was it, like, €10 or less? Right.

194
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,669
And he was in Switzerland, I believe.

195
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:57,539
And I've heard this of Amazon $1 a day things but

196
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:01,518
-- man, buying things off the dark web every day, that sounds like a recipe for going
-- to

197
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:01,979
end

198
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,948
up buying some drugs and

199
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,969
you know, just it was,

200
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:05,989
but it was,

201
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,849
well,

202
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:09,979
and here's the part of the answer was he wanted to

203
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:13,830
figure out is this illegal having a computer program do something

204
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,669
-- and, and how did that? Is he still in jail or did they let him out?
-- No, no.

205
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,859
Iii I don't think so. I, I, but

206
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,169
it, it does raise some interesting questions. You know, if you have an agent

207
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:27,979
running on your behalf that does something that's illegal somewhere,

208
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,890
-- you know,
-- you know what this reminds me of is the time

209
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,669
the monkey took a selfie

210
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,510
and then

211
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,890
it spent years in court to decide who owns the copyright on that image,

212
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,940
which it ended up the monkey.

213
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,429
I guess

214
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,159
it is.

215
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,830
Monkeys can't own copyright. So it's a public domain image. But

216
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,270
so

217
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:47,599
man, I, I don't, I don't see it. I'm sorry

218
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,510
because

219
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,469
so if my computer accidentally buys something illegal and then it's delivered to me

220
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,590
and they come get me and be like, oh, it wasn't me. It was my computer.

221
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,340
I, I just, I don't see that defense holding up in court

222
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:00,450
and if it does

223
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,859
everything anyone ever does again that's illegal is going to

224
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,619
be their automated computer doing the work for them.

225
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,969
Right.

226
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,719
Well, yeah. Uh, yeah, here we go. The random Dark Net chopper

227
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:16,650
and it was an, it was an actual art exhibition and he gave it $100 in Bitcoins per week

228
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:19,820
to go buy things on the dark web.

229
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:21,400
Uh,

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,559
I'm sorry,

231
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,409
I don't see how you can't imagine going to

232
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:28,590
jail is the only reasonable outcome to this experiment.

233
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,789
Well, what think about, for example, uh,

234
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,570
companies that have written software that they

235
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:37,500
run that end up doing things that are,

236
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,789
you know, of questionable legality.

237
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,590
Uh, last I checked, I don't, I haven't heard of anybody,

238
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,890
these companies going to jail for this, you know,

239
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,849
um,

240
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,210
all sorts of failures in software that have resulted in major losses or,

241
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:54,219
uh, you know, some of those trading companies on Wall Street that lost, uh,

242
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:57,890
what was that one company that accidentally pushed from test to production

243
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,010
and lost several $100 million in, like the space of a few minutes

244
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,250
and, and, ok, last year. But, but here's the thing

245
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,609
that was

246
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:09,890
an honest mistake as far as I can tell. Ok.

247
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:10,989
And there's, I,

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,049
it's one thing when you have honest mistakes

249
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:16,640
or even people maybe doing something that,

250
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,070
that is unexpected

251
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,409
with your product or process or whatever it is. You do.

252
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,599
But let's face it.

253
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,000
The dark web

254
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:28,280
is known for selling illicit thing.

255
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:33,390
And so when you set something up to purchase items from a place, you know, is just

256
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,479
literally filled with illegal items.

257
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:40,919
II, I struggle to think you could, you could stand behind the argument of,

258
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:42,960
I had no idea what my computer was doing.

259
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,000
Like, you know, I mean, it's one thing if you're ordering Amazon

260
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,190
parts for a bomb,

261
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,630
that's different. Right?

262
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,179
A perfect example of this would be,

263
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,760
is there's a lot of things in Canada that are either

264
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,299
flat out illegal or heavily prohibited items such as tasers,

265
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:02,000
body armor, brass knuckles, uh, certain types of knives

266
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,570
that are

267
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,020
completely, completely

268
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:05,070
-- legal in the US.
-- But you,

269
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:05,809
and you can buy

270
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,049
kinder

271
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:06,710
eggs

272
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,549
and I don't.

273
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:08,409
Yes, exactly,

274
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:09,284
because

275
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:11,104
we, we don't choke on them.

276
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:13,395
And so as an example, there's,

277
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:17,455
there's a ton of things I can buy on that on Ebay or Amazon that are, like,

278
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:19,195
really illegal up here.

279
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,715
Like, not just kind of like a little bit illegal, like, but like, you know,

280
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:26,784
almost as illegal as kinder eggs in the US, you know, $2500 fine.

281
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:28,594
What is it, like, five years in jail or something?

282
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:30,875
It's less dangerous than, than

283
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:32,674
toys inside of chocolate.

284
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,909
And, I mean, there have been cases of people have bought, for example,

285
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,549
knives that they didn't realize were like flip knives or whatever, those,

286
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,039
those knives with the springs in them, you know,

287
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,030
that are like, really illegal up here in Canada.

288
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:48,479
-- But
-- here's the thing, I would still expect that to be.

289
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:51,010
It's kind of like you can't be ignorant of the law. Right.

290
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,090
If you break a law, even if you didn't know it was a law

291
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,789
that's not a defense. And I see this as being very similar to that

292
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,580
-- in principle.
-- Yes.

293
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,130
But the problem is the law has gotten so big now that we don't know how big it is.

294
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,409
Like, for example, uh,

295
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,080
like here I just pulled it up but

296
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,960
they don't actually know how big the US federal code is. At this point.

297
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,200
There's been so

298
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,210
many additions to it,

299
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:12,510
you

300
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:13,440
know.

301
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,419
So, so here's the thing too. All right. So,

302
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,669
have you ever been pulled over for speeding?

303
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,070
And the officer just gives you a warning and let you go on your way. Right.

304
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,669
I think that's part of it.

305
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,900
I would expect if you accidentally purchase something from the US

306
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:31,549
and have it delivered to Canada that depending upon the situation,

307
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,059
you could easily just get a, don't do it again. Ok.

308
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,969
And this is, this is similar to, I mean, I mean, if you're ordering,

309
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:43,070
say 200 knives that are illegal, that's very different from ordering one

310
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,630
because obviously if you're getting a box of them.

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,609
You, you have plans and you probably,

312
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,390
in that case should have known what you're doing.

313
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,789
Right.

314
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,530
And this is similar to,

315
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,599
I know, I, I've heard instances I, I've not, I've not experienced this but where

316
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:01,289
us customs will catch people with kinder eggs and they generally just say,

317
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,010
just throw it away, you know, get rid of it.

318
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,559
We're not.

319
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,130
And I'm sure technically speaking, they could probably arrest you and,

320
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,210
and who knows what else.

321
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:09,489
But

322
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,630
more often than not, this is people who just don't understand that.

323
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,890
Why can't I bring candy to my kids?

324
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:15,770
It's,

325
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,809
it's kind of one of those things. Right.

326
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:20,369
-- Well,
-- it's like, you know, when I was looking up and I, I discovered it.

327
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,489
Apparently it's completely legal to mail you squirrels

328
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,580
as long as they're an,

329
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,719
a

330
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,580
-- freaking gray squirrel, which is
-- awesome.

331
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,599
And I still part of me wants to try that just to see what would happen.

332
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,739
And the other part of me doesn't because I think there's a

333
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,059
greater than 50% chance of getting a dead squirrel in a box.

334
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,869
Yeah, that's, that's a very real possibility.

335
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,659
-- I want
-- to see what the customs form looks like after.

336
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:45,429
It's no doubt gone through 12 layers of bureaucracy.

337
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,219
Will people try to figure out if it's actually

338
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:49,219
legal to let these squirrels enter the country?

339
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,640
Well, it's like this one guy,

340
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,219
he did an experiment where he mailed various strange objects because

341
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,109
apparently

342
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,724
you can attack, you can just attach postage to stuff.

343
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,765
Right. And, and drop it in the mail. And so he mailed like, what was it?

344
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,885
Like a banana and a hammer and a

345
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,114
ski? I think one time

346
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,825
it was all this crazy stuff. I do remember that guy. Now,

347
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,525
I do remember though too, that

348
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,604
the post office stopped accepting items from him at

349
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:15,684
some point

350
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,924
because they were tired of it.

351
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,380
And so again, though, that kind of falls back to that human angle of human beings. Can

352
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:23,900
I guess,

353
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:28,260
bring some sanity to things where if all you're fo focused on is the letter of the law,

354
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,919
things can certainly get out of control.

355
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,260
But once you have a human involved, they can make reasonable judgment calls.

356
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,080
And, and I guess that's probably the next trick with, with A I, right?

357
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,659
Is today A I is very black and white

358
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,530
and it will need that

359
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,460
reasonableness that

360
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,599
some people have we say.

361
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,179
Right.

362
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:46,969
Yeah.

363
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,989
Well, and I think part of it too is, is, you know,

364
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,119
having people do strange things once in a while is fine.

365
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,299
But,

366
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:57,130
and here's a great example of a company that mailed all the bricks

367
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,770
needed for a bank to Alaska because it was cheaper than shipping them.

368
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:05,250
Yes. And although I also remember, I remember I read a lengthy article about that

369
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,030
the postal service tried to stop them

370
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,030
because it would, it would cost the postal service more

371
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,729
basically.

372
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:15,320
Whatever they were charging to mail one brick was more expensive than

373
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,909
what it cost the postal service to actually deliver the brick.

374
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,520
And so they said, no, this is ridiculous.

375
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,280
We aren't mailing, you know, tons of bricks one at a time for you.

376
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,030
And I guess it went to court and basically the, the court said, look, you,

377
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,599
you can't not mail things that are given to you

378
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,690
like that is your job as the post office.

379
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,650
And so

380
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:32,940
under

381
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,530
-- federal mandate. Right.
-- Right.

382
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,280
And I mean that now that is an instance where I think common sense probably failed

383
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,349
because while technically speaking,

384
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,630
you're under federal mandate, it that's

385
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:44,840
bananas,

386
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:45,460
right.

387
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,239
Trying to make

388
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,359
and this is

389
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,330
sort of a segue,

390
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:53,679
this is what really worries me about the whole self driving car market,

391
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,090
ride sharing market because

392
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,830
traditionally we have taxis which have legal mandate

393
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,309
that they have to pick up disabled people,

394
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,309
they have to take their service animals, you know, not in the trunk,

395
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,829
they have to pick up people in wheelchairs.

396
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,608
Whereas, you know, these companies like Ride and Lyft and Uber, you know,

397
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:11,098
there's been incidents where they put the service animal

398
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,199
in the trunk or they just flat out,

399
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,989
don't allow the person in the car as these things change.

400
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,390
You know, I'm, I'm kind of wondering as a society,

401
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:20,167
do we need regulation around this or like you said,

402
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:20,769
common

403
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:24,229
-- sense.
-- In many cases, there is regulation, I seem to recall.

404
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,608
I don't, I don't remember what state it was in the US,

405
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:29,869
but they ended up passing a bunch of regulation around Uber because they,

406
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,499
they told Uber thing, you know, you have to pick up disabled people.

407
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,989
You have to, you know, you can't discriminate based upon,

408
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:37,548
you know, race religion or, or whatever else.

409
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:38,428
And,

410
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,040
and, yeah, I, I think that's important because you're right.

411
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,189
If you don't regulate some of that stuff,

412
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,579
it can get out of hand and people can start to say, you know,

413
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,069
I don't like what this person looks like.

414
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:50,380
I'm not going to pick them up and, and then, although at the same time,

415
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,729
once we have our robot overlords driving our cars,

416
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,229
they will, I hope

417
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,709
not be quite as uh obtuse as humans are in that regard.

418
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,829
Well, you know,

419
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,459
it's funny because like there's always ways to sort of legally discriminate.

420
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:06,949
Right. So for example, with a lot of these companies, they flat out

421
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,739
already discriminate because you need a credit card and a smartphone.

422
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,349
So that right there, I suspect takes care of a lot of problems.

423
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,550
Could you make the argument in order to take a taxi? You need money?

424
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,359
I mean, it's

425
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,849
-- kind of
-- the

426
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:20,030
same. Well, no, but for example, you can pay for a cab with cash,

427
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,829
right? And you can hail them on the street.

428
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,390
So I have just as much access to a cab as you do.

429
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,189
But if, for example, if I don't have a smartphone or I don't have a credit card,

430
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,150
I have absolutely no access to Lyft Uber or ride or anything like that.

431
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,880
-- You're not wrong but you still have access to taxis. So why for
-- now?

432
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,780
For now?

433
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,199
And that, that's fair. I mean,

434
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,040
I'm torn over this cause cause you're right in one sense

435
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,000
but I mean

436
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:48,599
there are, when you're on an airplane and you want to buy a snack,

437
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,390
they only accept credit cards.

438
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,609
So are you suggesting that they're

439
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,020
discriminating against people without credit cards?

440
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,500
Well, there's a bit of a difference between something like for example,

441
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,099
the ability to travel and move

442
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,099
and the ability to get a package of peanuts on an airplane,

443
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,829
right? One is one has way more impact, right?

444
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,150
Like there's a, there's a current,

445
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,819
a bit of a stink going on in our city because uh the jail and the

446
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:14,069
remand center have this bad habit of uh

447
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,589
releasing people from the prison or from the jail

448
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,699
like at two in the morning in the middle of the city

449
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:21,689
with like no money

450
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,359
in some cases with no shoelaces in their shoes.

451
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,930
And you know, and these people have very little resources and help to call on,

452
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,290
you know,

453
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,770
and they're just dropped off in the middle of the city

454
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,569
at like two in the morning or six in the morning,

455
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,089
you know, and the one guy was saying he had no shoelaces, which right now is kind of ok.

456
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:40,410
But like when it's, you know, there's six inches of snow on the ground.

457
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,040
That's, that's really gonna suck.

458
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,020
Yeah.

459
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,869
So,

460
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:47,729
and these people certainly don't know.

461
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,449
You know, there's, there's no transit running at that time of day.

462
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,900
So, yeah, I mean, it's just, it's, you know,

463
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,969
it, it becomes a real problem, you know.

464
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:59,459
Uh, like I know I've looked at using public transit locally and just, wow,

465
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:03,229
the amount of time I'd spend versus, you know, a self driving car or a ride,

466
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:05,040
share service, you know, it's fantastic.

467
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,329
But,

468
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,699
well, except

469
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:06,880
like,

470
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:08,849
right.

471
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:09,520
Well,

472
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:10,079
I

473
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,300
know

474
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,050
for you, uh, they're doing them in Philadelphia though. I know.

475
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,069
I'm, I'm, in fact,

476
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,189
I just read an article the other day that said Uber expects

477
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,890
in five years the majority of their fleet to be self driving,

478
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,469
which I'm not, I'm not gonna lie.

479
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:26,069
I cannot wait to have a car pull up, the door will open

480
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,790
and there will be no one else in the car except me.

481
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:31,199
And then I don't have to worry about small talk

482
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,569
or I don't have to worry about tipping them.

483
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:33,319
When I get there.

484
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:36,550
I can just get in the vehicle and it goes exactly where I want to,

485
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,880
I don't have to worry about crazy shortcuts

486
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,520
where they're like, oh, I know a shortcut.

487
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,650
I'm like, yeah, you're driving, you do whatever you think is best then, you know,

488
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,089
you end up going through like the scariest neighborhood you've ever seen.

489
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:47,010
I, I will be

490
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,930
ECAN when, when that day comes.

491
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:49,920
Yeah,

492
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,219
I'm also really curious as to what this is gonna do for crime because for example,

493
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,500
how do you, you can't get away in a self driving car? Can you,

494
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:58,510
I,

495
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:03,400
I don't know, man, you could have like the, the getaway.com uh driving service,

496
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:03,770
right?

497
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,719
Niche markets here, right? Kurt.

498
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,290
Yeah. So

499
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,520
no, I'm really curious, you know,

500
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,479
with all these self driving cars and taking video and you know,

501
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:15,780
potentially audio recordings of the surroundings all the time,

502
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,939
you know, can we use them to track people and bad guys

503
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,319
fleeing the scene of a crime, you know, you know,

504
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:26,180
it's going to happen and then the privacy people are going to lose it as they should

505
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,949
and we will start some very bizarre conversations about privacy

506
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,530
in what will be the new automated world.

507
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:36,800
Yeah, I mean, I'm,

508
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,810
I have to assume that they're going to use biometrics to identify people

509
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:42,660
getting in the car so that they can do billing and you know,

510
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,089
you can do, you can just split a ride share without even having to pull out your phone,

511
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:46,260
right.

512
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,560
Who doesn't want that? Right.

513
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,760
Well, all the privacy advocates.

514
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,920
Right. Right. Right.

515
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,489
Well, you know, actually this, this brings up a good point and,

516
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,359
and we'll kind of segue ourselves out of, out of this story, but

517
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,280
I remember when,

518
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:01,920
when it was easy pass came out in, in

519
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,150
New York

520
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,119
and

521
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,839
I love 2600 magazine.

522
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:09,209
And those guys, they actually, they have a radio show called off the hook.

523
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:10,010
It's fantastic.

524
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,400
But when, when easy pass came out

525
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,400
they complained nonstop about how it was gonna track people and you

526
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,880
lose a bunch of privacy and this and that and another.

527
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:23,500
And in fact, I just listened to a show a couple of months ago where they,

528
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,640
they admitted like, look, yeah,

529
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,650
it's a privacy violation but it's just so convenient.

530
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:31,640
It, you're crazy not to use it. And I, I kind of get that,

531
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,380
that there's always a trade off to everything and,

532
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,939
and in fact, for, for tolls,

533
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:38,640
I have an automated tolling dealio in my car

534
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,560
and I understand that it has certain privacy implications,

535
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,380
but it's so nice not having to stop and pay people

536
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,310
real money that I'm totally willing to put up with it.

537
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,829
-- So
-- to me, to me,

538
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,459
this whole thing is kind of funny because like

539
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:55,050
all the tires nowadays have RF ID tags and,

540
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,310
or the uh the little wireless pressure sensors that have a unique serial number.

541
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:04,560
If you have modern tires on your car, you have four built in tracking devices.

542
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,829
-- Yeah,
-- that's probably fair.

543
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:06,439
Uh

544
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:07,280
So

545
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,079
listen, I don't want to think about it. We're not, we're not getting into privacy.

546
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,560
Privacy is too complicated and, and there's too many people on both sides of it.

547
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,099
What's interesting to me is that we've lost a lot of privacy in many ways.

548
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:21,229
And my kids are growing up in a very different world, privacy wise.

549
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,890
And what I haven't seen is nobody having a serious discussion of what

550
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,859
does privacy in 2030 look like for our kids when they hit 18.

551
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:29,219
You know,

552
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:29,949
how is

553
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,900
anybody taken over by then?

554
00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:32,760
I mean,

555
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,760
yeah, I mean, a perfect example of this is, you know,

556
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,599
there will not be a single politician who hasn't posted to Reddit or Foran,

557
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:42,790
right?

558
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:46,989
And I mean, a great example being this, this, uh, reported story of the, um,

559
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,800
the Mr what is it,

560
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,709
Ketti, the, uh, the email guy

561
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,550
who,

562
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,250
you know,

563
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,640
apparently is accused of wiping the Clinton's email servers and was apparently

564
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,829
posting to Reddit asking how to do this a few years ago.

565
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:06,199
I actually haven't seen this story, but that's hilarious in all the wrong way.

566
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,319
Yeah. So, I mean, it's, it's really curious to me because, like,

567
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,119
everybody makes stupid mistakes online and now they're, you know,

568
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,859
they're recorded and immortalized forever.

569
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:17,619
Oh, my goodness. I didn't want to think about it.

570
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:18,959
Yeah.

571
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:20,089
So,

572
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,040
oh, I,

573
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,670
I love the future. It's, it's fantastic.

574
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,189
It's definitely a lot different than I expected, you know, II,

575
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:33,030
I don't know if you read a lot of cipher or cyberpunk when you were younger, but,

576
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,780
you know, the, the vision of the future and the VR and the,

577
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,199
the, the dystopian view of the world. You mean?

578
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:44,890
I, I don't think I can't think of any cyberpunk novel that isn't dystopian.

579
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:48,709
They're all basically terrible universes. And I remember it was,

580
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:51,430
I was, I was in high school when I realized I'm like,

581
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,530
there's no future for the human race anymore.

582
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,930
We're, we're going to ruin everything at this point.

583
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:58,290
And, and I told the teacher that and they,

584
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,890
they didn't seem very pleased with my lack of optimism, but

585
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,689
it's,

586
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:04,170
I, I still, I, I will say

587
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,949
that I don't think it's going to be near as dystopian as was once predicted

588
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:12,989
because you look at the world today and you can complain about it a lot.

589
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,979
But fundamentally,

590
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:18,430
life is better on a whole for humanity than it was

591
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,930
even 20 years ago.

592
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:20,709
Oh, yeah.

593
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:24,410
What really blows me away is, you know, we went from smartphones,

594
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,829
are only 10 years old at this point.

595
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,329
Go anywhere where people are waiting and what are they doing?

596
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,890
Sitting on their phones, you know, staring down at them.

597
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:37,930
Yes. And, and the old people are judging them for not conversing about

598
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,329
whatever it is people used to talk about.

599
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:43,900
Yeah. No, it's

600
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,390
so.

601
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,319
And then finally in the news we have again, back to governments and the public good.

602
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:52,520
Uh, we apparently have a proposal in the UK

603
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:56,449
uh for the government to run a block list

604
00:25:56,969 --> 00:26:00,969
of sort of naughty domains and naughty emails that you could then

605
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:05,880
use to firewall and you know, block attacks coming in from these naughty people.

606
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,689
All right, man,

607
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:06,989
I

608
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,680
there is no way

609
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:09,790
that

610
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,310
this can be done

611
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,550
in a fair and reasonable manner.

612
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,219
There's just, it's not possible. It is any time you try to do any sort of censorship,

613
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:22,800
it gets out of hand, it can start with good intentions.

614
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:27,959
And I'm sure every instance of censorship in the history of humans

615
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,099
has started with noble intentions

616
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:33,979
and it always goes wrong every time it's

617
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:36,680
on paper. This sounds like a nice idea.

618
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:39,880
But after even probably six months of doing this,

619
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:42,430
people are going to be outraged by all of the

620
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:45,599
things that have been deemed naughty by whoever it is,

621
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,910
is getting to decide the difference between naughty and nice

622
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,880
and, and maybe they'll check their list twice.

623
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:52,680
Yeah.

624
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:57,089
No, I remember, um, what is it, uh, the infamous porn filters that, you know,

625
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,250
prevent people from researching breast cancer

626
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,449
or looking up, you know, birth control or anything like that, you know,

627
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:08,030
that are pretty legitimate things to be looking up, you know, even if you're a child.

628
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,500
Um, yeah. No, I, I would have to agree.

629
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,060
Even something as simple as, like, uh, uh, a geographical IP database, you know, is,

630
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,160
how do you see part of what comes back is how

631
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,760
do you verify that these people aren't indeed naughty or nice,

632
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:21,900
you know,

633
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,790
especially when you're not paying for it and you're not really having any recourse.

634
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:30,959
I see, that's exactly it. Right. There isn't a good answer to any of this.

635
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:32,790
And I think eventually

636
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:34,290
it gets out of hand

637
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,680
and, and you, you know, this actually reminds me of just now is,

638
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,579
did you see the XK CD comic from,

639
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:42,530
was it yesterday I believe,

640
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,209
comparing the fashion police to the grammar police?

641
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,439
And, and that's what you end up at. Right. Is

642
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:51,979
you have a group

643
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,650
that is just

644
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,920
out of control essentially. And, and while I,

645
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,280
I'll, I'll pick on the grammar police a little bit, but II, I

646
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,319
easily fall into that category.

647
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:06,109
Occasionally we'll say it depends what I'm trying to do. But, I mean, fundamentally

648
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,099
when two people disagree,

649
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,349
one of them is always going to, well, they both do for them,

650
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,280
they have a reason why they're right.

651
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:18,010
And so once we give that sort of responsibility to the government,

652
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,209
your reason doesn't matter anymore because they have

653
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:24,810
the fundamental authority and that is scary and dangerous

654
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:28,420
when this isn't something that can be easily explained in a,

655
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,089
we'll say factual manner, you know, like most laws are relatively black and white.

656
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:33,770
Right?

657
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:35,150
And for when they're not,

658
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:38,369
that's where we get lawyers and judges to help clarify that.

659
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,270
And if you have a naughty list of websites,

660
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,760
are you going to sue the government every time they block a domain you want to look at?

661
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,910
Of course not.

662
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:47,819
So,

663
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:48,709
let's,

664
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,790
oh, my goodness. What a terrible idea. That's all I'm gonna say,

665
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,609
well, it's, it's one of those things that, you know,

666
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:56,670
in principle sounds simple and effective.

667
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,089
But

668
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,880
in practice, we all know is a,

669
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,119
-- a bit more of a disaster.
-- It's

670
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,390
a,

671
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,660
it's a train wreck. That's what it is.

672
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,939
So like, uh, you know, the fact that now when you get an IP address for a server,

673
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:10,349
you have to, uh, ideally before you get the IP address,

674
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,069
-- check if it's on a blacklist and when
-- you have that problem with, with email now,

675
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,540
right is if you're going to run a mail server,

676
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,660
you need to make sure your IP address isn't on one of the blacklists.

677
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,000
And in fact, that's happened to a handful of people.

678
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,750
I know where, you know,

679
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,599
they're trying to figure out why isn't my mail going anywhere.

680
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:27,369
It's like, oh, you're on a blacklist, you know, they're not,

681
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,920
they're not even kind enough to send you a rejection because you're on this list.

682
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,729
They just like,

683
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,099
you know, they, they dump your connection as soon as it, it connects.

684
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,949
So,

685
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,310
oh, man, it's, it's, it's rough. So, all right, let's do this.

686
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,680
Since we're on the topic of, of disasters,

687
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:47,750
let's start talking about container security for a few minutes and we can,

688
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,709
we'll continue this conversation over the course of the

689
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,989
next couple of weeks and I think it's,

690
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,270
it's a nice way

691
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,339
to end the podcast and to just start getting some of

692
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:59,130
that information out because I think container security is super important

693
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:01,890
and there's a lot of people who don't always understand what's going on.

694
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,310
So let's start here. Why don't you tell me, Kurt?

695
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,229
Pretend I am a person who will say, knows what a computer is,

696
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,359
but I don't know what containers are.

697
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,770
What would you tell me?

698
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,780
So, fundamentally, containers are not really anything new.

699
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,910
We've been doing this or attempting to do this with things like ch root in jail.

700
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,719
And essentially what we're trying to do is we're trying to

701
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:27,380
box off a small part of the computer logically speaking,

702
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:30,199
so that you can run some software in there without

703
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,579
having to interact with the rest of the system.

704
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,599
So you have a nice little clean environment

705
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,079
that you can

706
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:39,359
clearly define. You know, I want this clean environment to have

707
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,020
Red Hat Enterprise Linux version seven or maybe I wanted to have Red Hat Enterprise

708
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:44,530
Linux

709
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,630
version six

710
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:49,449
or maybe you want it to run Debian or ubuntu or whatever

711
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:55,229
with some very specific libraries and versions of libraries, for example.

712
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,280
So containers are just an attempt to logically

713
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,520
break your computer up so that you can

714
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,880
run software in these controlled little boxes basically

715
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,339
which then gives you

716
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,560
the power to do things like, oh,

717
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:11,619
I really need this weird old specific version of a library.

718
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,849
Now, I don't want to install it on the system as a whole because it's, you know,

719
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:16,560
it's full of horrendous problems

720
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,630
but for whatever reason I need it for this, you know, Payroll software I'm running,

721
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,099
right.

722
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,540
Uh It also allows you to do things like breaking software up and making it easier

723
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:30,619
to interact with in some ways because you can, you know,

724
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:34,290
you can clearly define how the software talks to each other rather than

725
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,430
just jamming it all into one giant box in one big pile.

726
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:37,719
And,

727
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:40,170
you know, hoping that none of them, you know,

728
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,540
that hoping that they all play nice with each other.

729
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:43,920
Um

730
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:49,599
And so containers also make things a bit easier for developers because

731
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,729
the you can actually

732
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,270
replicate the environment exactly that you would

733
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,459
have between production testing and development,

734
00:31:58,469 --> 00:31:59,790
you know, whereas traditionally

735
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,930
people would write stuff and the infamous, well, it works on my laptop.

736
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,030
Yes,

737
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,170
the the call of the developer.

738
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,020
So, all right.

739
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,300
So let me ask this, then you sound like you've just described a virtual machine to me.

740
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:19,939
Yeah, basically that's exactly what I have described.

741
00:32:19,949 --> 00:32:22,849
And the main difference being is in a virtual machine,

742
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:25,760
you replicate the entire computer from

743
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,239
essentially you give a pretend hardware,

744
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,680
running a kernel and running a user space and basically running the entire shebang

745
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,520
with containers,

746
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:37,420
you kind of move up a level.

747
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,579
So you're sharing the hardware with the base system,

748
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:41,680
you're sharing the kernel with the base system and

749
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:44,000
you're sharing some other aspects of the base system.

750
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,979
And the advantage here is that you're

751
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,150
because you're sharing resources.

752
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,979
For example, if you want to run 100 copies of something,

753
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:55,319
you don't have 100 copies of the kernel also running, right?

754
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:57,060
It's just you're sharing one copy.

755
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,739
So

756
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:04,680
from a resource usage point of view, you can save on a lot of the resources.

757
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:05,780
Um

758
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,630
The other thing is

759
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:12,880
it in, well, I would say once we're done getting containers, right?

760
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,650
It will be reduced complexity. Currently, it's actually

761
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,229
more complex in some ways than virtual machines.

762
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,040
Um But also because we're able to do things with

763
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,439
containers that we can't easily do with virtual machines.

764
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:24,459
Like if you want to chain

765
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:28,050
10 or 20 containers together using Docker and Kubernetes,

766
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:31,770
it's actually you can do it with a, you know, a single definition file.

767
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,890
Whereas if you try to, you know,

768
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,810
fire up 10 V MS and have them all come

769
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:36,910
up with the right IP addresses and chain them together.

770
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,469
Uh That's still not super easy in most cases.

771
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,180
Yeah, I mean, that's a fair point.

772
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:42,739
It's

773
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,739
so let's

774
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,510
think about security now. OK.

775
00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:48,750
When we,

776
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,959
so would we say

777
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,839
that containers are more or less secure than a virtual machine?

778
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:59,040
Currently, I would say that they are less secure than a virtual machine

779
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:03,390
due to the fact uh Well, due to two main facts, one, they share more things

780
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:06,060
which sometimes is what you want, you know,

781
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:09,708
you want to be able to share data quickly and efficiently say over

782
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:14,020
uh shared file system or, you know, through memory rather than, you know,

783
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,739
with a virtual machine having to shove it over a fake network.

784
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,770
The second thing is that we containers are still young, right?

785
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,188
Virtual machines have been around for what, 20 years now?

786
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,360
-- 25
-- it depends how you want to define how long they've been around.

787
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:32,060
I would say if we're going to talk in the context of Linux, it's been 12, maybe 15 years

788
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,790
that you've had

789
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,429
virtualization.

790
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:35,520
Yeah.

791
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,370
So they, you know,

792
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:40,449
we've had 12 or 15 years to beat a lot of security problems out of these things.

793
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:43,080
And we're still finding, you know, security flaws

794
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,879
-- with
-- V MS

795
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:48,719
is there's been certain things added to

796
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:51,590
the hardware to help make virtualization faster,

797
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,708
but also more secure in the way you can segment off some of these, these devices.

798
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,350
Well, I shouldn't say devices but segment off some of the V MS from one another.

799
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,669
Right.

800
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,989
True.

801
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,590
And so with containers, we just haven't had as much time to beat on them,

802
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,560
find all the security flaws.

803
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,850
And the other thing too is that containers are still evolving, right? It's not,

804
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,800
you know, virtualization is a generally an understood problem.

805
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:17,270
You know, it's relatively clear what we're trying to achieve.

806
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:19,389
Whereas with containers, you know,

807
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:22,659
I I've seen some new things come out in the last year that are like, wow, I,

808
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:23,889
I did not think of that.

809
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:25,479
That's a really cool thing to add,

810
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,629
you know, and so

811
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,550
part of the problem is, you know, you have a very much a moving target in containers,

812
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:31,879
right?

813
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:34,169
Things, we're adding things constantly.

814
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,629
Now, the good news is if you want

815
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,889
the security of virtualization, but you want to use containers, you you can do that,

816
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:44,989
you can run your containers inside of their own virtual machine.

817
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,270
It adds a bit of overhead obviously, but you then get essentially

818
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:52,649
uh the usability of containers combined with

819
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,590
the existing security of virtual machines,

820
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,350
-- which is uh for example, I believe how Google Compute engine does it
-- interesting.

821
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,719
So from the security angle as well,

822
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,219
I think the

823
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,149
the most misunderstood aspect of containers because I hear

824
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,310
on a regular basis it's in a container,

825
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,429
it's secure, which is not the case.

826
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:12,770
-- No, not yet.
-- It's

827
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,290
right that that's fair. And I, I think that's the

828
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:20,159
the logical conclusion to container technology is going to be containers that

829
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:23,810
are as secure or more secure than virtual machines are today.

830
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,830
And then we'll be talking about container escape flaws and things and whatnot.

831
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,570
But I think the current problem today

832
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:29,719
is that

833
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:34,489
when you have a system say running 10 containers, they all share the same kernel.

834
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:37,629
And the Linux kernel is a behemoth.

835
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,709
When it comes to code, it has millions of lines of code.

836
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:47,760
And so logically, millions of lines of code equals lots of security issues, right?

837
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:52,300
And so when you have lots of things sharing the same kernel

838
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,219
utilizing the same millions of lines of code.

839
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:58,379
You have a situation where you've got

840
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,179
if one container

841
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:05,020
can break into the kernel and e essentially exploit the kernel to become, you know,

842
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,300
root on the host.

843
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:09,300
Now, they can control all of the kernels.

844
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,659
I'm sorry, all of the containers running on the system, right.

845
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,780
Yeah.

846
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,780
And that's one thing where I'm currently looking at is

847
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,360
see one thing that containers give us is they

848
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,750
give us an architecture that we can actually secure.

849
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,489
Like the reality is it's hard to secure a

850
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,689
system running, you know, a large application with tens of components, right?

851
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,919
But if you break it up and decompose it in containers, you know,

852
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:35,699
have some very well defined boundaries, you know,

853
00:37:35,709 --> 00:37:38,209
you have your network boundaries, your file system boundaries

854
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,699
and you have boundaries between the container and the kernel, right?

855
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:44,580
So we already have the fact that you can drop capabilities

856
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,840
in a container, right? So you can have a container

857
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:47,780
that

858
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:52,250
cannot manipulate its own network configuration or a container that cannot,

859
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:52,560
you know,

860
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,449
manipulate its own firewall configuration or a container that is not

861
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,709
allowed to run anything set U ID or you know,

862
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,750
with route access.

863
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,659
So containers give us the ability to start creating these barriers and

864
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,540
and you know, and to start, for example,

865
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,020
dropping the privileges we don't need whereas you know,

866
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,459
trying to drop this privilege

867
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:14,080
for an application running on a on a base os

868
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:18,040
uh a base operating system would be, you know, it would be very difficult, right?

869
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,500
Trying to drop this privilege.

870
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,639
Whereas, you know, in the container,

871
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:23,560
you just say start this container and

872
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,939
drop these capabilities and never give them back

873
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,260
and then whatever is happening in that container short of some

874
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,860
sort of container escape problem can never get those capabilities back.

875
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,159
Yeah, that's fair. And I think

876
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:37,020
that's one of the other really interesting

877
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,919
things about containers is you can really

878
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:40,919
split the security view on this stuff

879
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:43,860
into two pieces where there's the host security

880
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:46,399
where even before the container runs,

881
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:50,379
certain things are happening to make sure that it's got a

882
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,409
certain amount of, of security involved

883
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:56,219
and we're going to say the word security a lot I suspect here.

884
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:57,070
Well,

885
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,550
and even better is currently running containers generally requires

886
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,770
you to have administrative level access to the system,

887
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:03,850
right?

888
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,110
You have to be or have pseudo access to run

889
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,350
and talk to Docker.

890
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,669
And I know one of the things Redhead is working on is, you know,

891
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,699
a project called bubble wrap where we're looking at

892
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,370
user space containers, right? Because

893
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,520
the other issue with containers is for example,

894
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,729
is I might want to run a container on a

895
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:22,370
machine for which I do not have administrative access to,

896
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:24,929
you know, like for example, my developer machine or

897
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,229
a web hosting server, right?

898
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,719
Maybe I want to run a a very odd version of my SQL on port 33 06.

899
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:35,830
But, well, that's already taken on the host, you know,

900
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,060
by the actual real my SQL server.

901
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,469
So I think one thing we're gonna see in the next

902
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:45,379
1 to 2 years is user space containers because quite frankly,

903
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:47,350
that means that anybody can install it anywhere

904
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,250
they want without having to ask for permission.

905
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:53,090
And those kind of solutions tend to win because people just do it.

906
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:53,879
Sure,

907
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:54,489
sure.

908
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:54,959
That's,

909
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,570
I mean,

910
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
maybe so.

911
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,800
So the thing I keep thinking of there actually is

912
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,179
user space containers make sense in certain multi-tenant environments.

913
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:07,979
But you look at where things are headed and it's just really headed into having

914
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:11,600
kind of container runtime infrastructure that you don't worry about user space.

915
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,350
You don't worry about privileges, you just

916
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,939
you have a container, you give it to something

917
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,719
and then something runs your container with no questions asked.

918
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:21,370
That is the logical end point.

919
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:24,570
But the problem is there's a lot of existing workloads that don't work with that.

920
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,429
Like a great example being wordpress, right? Wordpress assumes

921
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,810
you have a fully coherent file system

922
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,030
and a fully coherent database that is and both the file system,

923
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,679
the database end up storing data

924
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,479
and having to be state full, right? So you can't just

925
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:43,360
run wordpress in a container server request and turn it off, right? You have to keep

926
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,580
that request, for example, might have been you uploading a new picture to the,

927
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,520
to the website.

928
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,750
And so there's a lot of applications that,

929
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,479
well, they were designed to run on a real physical server

930
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,139
and making them run in a container is going to be quite painful.

931
00:40:57,149 --> 00:41:00,870
Um And once, you know, even if you do getting running in a container,

932
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,290
you're going to have to have essentially like a, a fat VM style container that

933
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:08,850
not only serves the data but then holds the data and keeps

934
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:09,719
uh

935
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,939
that keeps the state of the data, right.

936
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:14,550
So when you upload pictures to the blog or when you

937
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:17,840
when you upload the podcast, you know, there's a copy of it there.

938
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:21,320
I think what will happen though is that this this will become a transition, right?

939
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:24,239
It be it'll become easier and easier to make that transition.

940
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,550
And people will, you know,

941
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,750
transition to say user space containers,

942
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,969
get everything running in say user space containers and then realize,

943
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:34,379
hey all my stuff is running in user space containers.

944
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,250
Now I can for example, move the data out of the container and into some

945
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,310
sort of storage service, you know something, for example, like Red hat Gluster or

946
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:42,469
S

947
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:45,820
or you know, a public cloud service like Amazon S3.

948
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,010
Once you move your data out of the container,

949
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,699
now you can move your containers to one of these container runtime services and

950
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,179
get rid of all your servers.

951
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,709
Yeah, I mean that's fair, I suppose. And that's always

952
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,709
that is one of the most important aspects I think of any technology.

953
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,969
And this is where security people fail miserably

954
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:05,600
is we forget the fact that there has to be a transition from the

955
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,550
old to the new things don't just magically appear in the new place.

956
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,020
And this is we are notorious for this insecurity.

957
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,879
We're like, no, here's the new rules do it now

958
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,260
and we are often not the most receptive people to the idea of something,

959
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,800
taking some amount of time and effort versus magically

960
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,040
happening when we tell them it should happen.

961
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:26,419
Yeah.

962
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:26,699
And,

963
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:29,050
and something to remember too is we still have 3040

964
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:32,179
now 50 year old it systems that are still running,

965
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:33,669
you know, FORTRAN Cobalt,

966
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,820
uh recently, you know, the,

967
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:39,169
the Phoenix pay system that the Canadian government deployed

968
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:40,659
several years ago and has been a disaster.

969
00:42:40,669 --> 00:42:42,379
You know, people not getting paid for months on end,

970
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:44,739
they're not going to scrap that.

971
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,590
You know, they're going to try and fix it as best they can.

972
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,080
And then we're gonna, you know,

973
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,729
we're gonna be stuck with that solution for at least a few decades

974
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,330
and, you know, something like that is not gonna ever be containerized.

975
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,959
That's,

976
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,139
I don't know,

977
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,739
I would OK.

978
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,510
Never say never. All right. That's rule number one

979
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:08,020
because as soon as you say, something will never happen, I guarantee it will happen.

980
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,090
There is no better way to ensure an event takes place.

981
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,500
Than to say it will never take place.

982
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,139
This is true.

983
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,530
Humanity's history is riddled with people telling other people

984
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,709
what will never happen and it always does.

985
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:21,649
But it,

986
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:25,080
I mean, that's fair. That, that's an interesting point.

987
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,879
And this is part of the challenge I think we

988
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:29,310
have to start dealing with here around this stuff.

989
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,000
And so

990
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,760
I, I think what we should do for now is let, let's hang this one up

991
00:43:34,209 --> 00:43:36,439
and, and let people just kind of chew on some of this.

992
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:36,979
And what I,

993
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,439
I think we should do is come back maybe

994
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,399
next week and we can talk about host container security

995
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:43,679
and then

996
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,919
we can delve our way into what's

997
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:48,719
happening actually inside of the containers themselves,

998
00:43:48,729 --> 00:43:51,620
which is kind of a fascinating topic for a variety of reasons.

999
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:51,909
But

1000
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,310
I, I will admit that that container security is one of those things that I really,

1001
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,300
I'm impressed with where we've gotten so quickly

1002
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,300
and it's easy to pick on this stuff which don't get me wrong.

1003
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:02,500
I'm,

1004
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,179
I'm as guilty as the next guy of picking out what

1005
00:44:05,189 --> 00:44:07,540
the little nitpicky things are that that's wrong with this.

1006
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,699
But I think fundamentally

1007
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:10,439
we are on the right track,

1008
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:12,379
which I don't think there's a lot of technologies that

1009
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:14,580
the security folks have been able to say that about

1010
00:44:14,939 --> 00:44:17,699
this early on in its inception because let's face it

1011
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:19,209
in the history of security.

1012
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:21,169
It has been bolted onto the side

1013
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,889
long after that train left the station.

1014
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,489
And I think in this case,

1015
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,929
I won't say the train hasn't left the station but you can still see it at least.

1016
00:44:29,939 --> 00:44:33,030
So I think we have a chance maybe to get this one. Right.

1017
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:34,090
Yeah, we definitely,

1018
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,590
people definitely have much higher expectations of security in new technologies,

1019
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:38,969
right?

1020
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,179
Things that would have been past, been totally normal are now, you know,

1021
00:44:43,189 --> 00:44:44,790
basically unthinkable,

1022
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,120
you know, and we're, you know,

1023
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:47,080
for example,

1024
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:51,169
the thought of having containers not have the ability to drop capabilities.

1025
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:51,570
Right.

1026
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,760
In the past, nobody would have even known what I was talking about.

1027
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:55,540
A

1028
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:57,889
lot of people who don't know what you're talking about and, and

1029
00:44:58,379 --> 00:45:00,860
rather than go down this rabbit hole right now,

1030
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:04,729
we will come back to capabilities because that in itself is a fascinating

1031
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:09,810
topic and what's happening there is really cool and it's also really powerful.

1032
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:11,409
So for now,

1033
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,540
how about we just say thanks for listening folks and

1034
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,989
tune in next week for the riveting conclusion of our discussion

1035
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,969
-- on container security.
-- Thanks, you have an excellent week,

1036
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,189
Josh,

1037
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,939
talk to you later. Bye bye.
