Hey, this is Kurt Siefried and Josh Bresser with the Open source security podcast.

1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,689
The topic of the day is, is open source security.

2
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:14,960
So let's keep it general.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,030
And

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,559
when I go out and when I talk to people,

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:22,969
what is open source security is, is one of those topics that comes up often.

6
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:23,680
And funny enough,

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,489
the question of is open source secure comes up way more often than I think it should.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,689
And so let's start there, Kurt, what do you think open source security is?

9
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:36,380
Well, to be honest, I'm not sure what computer security is anymore.

10
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:37,659
Um

11
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:38,169
I mean,

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:38,509
a great

13
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,540
-- example,
-- we have a podcast. We, we have to pretend we know,

14
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:46,689
well, just in the, in the grand scheme of things, for example, is,

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,770
is the iphone Os Secure, right?

16
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:52,290
So we recently had that human rights activist who was sent some malware

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,409
chained together 30 days.

18
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:57,520
So that if you clicked a link, they could remotely hijack your phone.

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,520
Is your phone secure? Yes or no?

20
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:02,560
Well, some would argue no, because it can be hacked and some would argue yes,

21
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:04,319
because Apple responded quickly to it.

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,029
I think the reality is, as we've learned all software has flaws.

23
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,980
The question is,

24
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:15,690
you know, how bad are they and how fast do they get fixed once they're found out?

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,129
What does that mean in the context of open source, I think is, is the thing

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,730
we're looking to really talk about here. Right.

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,540
So, so let's back that up.

28
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:27,769
So I think with open source, one of the benefits is

29
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,180
you are not beholden to a vendor shipping you an update there is

30
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,360
potentially if you have the expertise,

31
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,160
the chance that you yourself can patch your software and fix it

32
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,730
with a closed source vendor, that's much harder.

33
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,559
Assuming it's at all even legal in some jurisdictions,

34
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,290
it's not legal to monkey with software that you've licensed.

35
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:50,569
Uh So I think so open source gives you at, at a minimum, it gives you the chance.

36
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:53,919
And then more importantly, it means vendors like Red Hat

37
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:58,430
can fix it. You know, we have the engineering resources, we have the expertise

38
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:04,010
and we typically have the experience with this software in

39
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:06,209
fixing it because the majority of the software has,

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,288
you know, a rich history of security flaws.

41
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,669
I love that software has a rich history of security flaws.

42
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:15,289
That, that's a fantastic quote, man. We should get a T shirt that, that has that on it.

43
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,970
So,

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,300
yeah, absolutely.

45
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:21,779
And one of the awesome things I think about open source and the one that really

46
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,089
just always kind of hits home I think when you start talking to people and whatnot is

47
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:26,889
the,

48
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,330
so if you look at a typical organization and,

49
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,679
and we'll pick on close source because we can, why not?

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,070
Right

51
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,929
is

52
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:36,690
they're in the boat by themselves

53
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:37,919
and

54
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,820
when there's something wrong,

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,199
they have to deal with everything from top to bottom,

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,529
including making the fixes and there's nothing wrong with that necessarily.

57
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:46,919
Right.

58
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,960
But I think the trick with open source is there's lots of people working on it

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,020
and let's face it.

60
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,600
Everybody is using open source today.

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,250
There's, it's literally, you know,

62
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,300
you're doing it or you don't know and you should is pretty much

63
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:03,399
where we're at because I don't think there's a software project on the planet

64
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,080
that doesn't have people going to github

65
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,080
and stack overflow and downloading code.

66
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:07,639
Right.

67
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:07,910
Well,

68
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,240
and even one of my bigger concerns with

69
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,520
especially close source software is that institutional knowledge,

70
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:14,000
you know,

71
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:18,080
how many people know why something was built the way it was,

72
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,360
let alone even how it was built, the way it was. You know,

73
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:25,759
and I've encountered that many times in open source where, you know, something is

74
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,559
quasi

75
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,919
abandoned. But you know what?

76
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:31,119
We have the source code, we have the notes, we have the mailing list traffic,

77
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,759
we have the discussion around, you know, how this feature came to be.

78
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,110
We have context for it,

79
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,910
you know, and I've conversely, I know people who work in the closed source world.

80
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,130
And, uh, this one firm basically had to keep paying this guy 20% more every year.

81
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:48,389
Uh, because he was the only original architect left for their core product.

82
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,630
He was the only guy that

83
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,229
knew how the whole thing was supposed to work together.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,589
And, uh, the other three guys that had worked on it had left.

85
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,160
That's hilarious for all the wrong reasons.

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,100
I love it

87
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,300
now now. Oh, ok.

88
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:03,419
So,

89
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:05,259
here's the thing too though is I think you can

90
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,809
easily make the argument that open source doesn't necessarily fix that

91
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,339
because if you're talking about people going out to the internet

92
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,529
and just downloading any random piece of garbage, they find

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,809
that's not,

94
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,209
it's, you don't get a magic solution there. Right? I mean, yes, it's open source,

95
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:22,920
but

96
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:28,010
you still have maintenance issues surrounding that even if it is free as in,

97
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:28,869
you know, a puppy.

98
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:30,920
And that's definitely true.

99
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:34,679
Um But one thing I'm seeing is people are growing up, for example, we have the, uh,

100
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,339
the No Js security project

101
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:40,869
where they not only track flaws in no Js products,

102
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,260
they have a website for it.

103
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:46,489
And more importantly, they have a No Js module that you can then use,

104
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,410
that will warn you when you're using out of date software and it will tell you,

105
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,170
you know, you should update this component you're using because of this CV.

106
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,359
Uh And I also just had another project contact me that does

107
00:04:57,369 --> 00:05:00,149
a similar thing for um I forget which language it is.

108
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,839
So a big part of,

109
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,989
I think open source is that the security side is

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,980
growing up and these people are doing public efforts,

111
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,989
you know,

112
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,730
no matter what Microsoft does,

113
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:13,790
that will only work within the Microsoft ecosystem on their products typically,

114
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,790
except even Microsoft is pulling the open source bandwagon play now,

115
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:22,260
right where they're starting to release all this stuff in public and in heck,

116
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:23,040
you know,

117
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:26,190
they're using open source in their products. There's no way they're not.

118
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,029
I imagine their cloud has tons of it on the backside.

119
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:31,209
Well, I mean, they publicly admitted to using,

120
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,149
I think it was a Debian variant for their uh network switches because I mean,

121
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:35,880
you're not

122
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:36,279
gonna,

123
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,380
you're not gonna ever build networking equipment that runs Windows,

124
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,549
never say, never

125
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,279
say never.

126
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,170
Yeah.

127
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:45,970
Well, but even Windows has had to, you know,

128
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,570
has had to basically move towards what open source is well established, you know,

129
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,000
strip down operating systems that then

130
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,609
do special purpose tasks.

131
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:57,649
You know, because, and part of it is not only because that's what works,

132
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,829
but it's also more secure,

133
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,450
like especially in the context of a network switch or

134
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:04,609
a DNS server appliance or an NTP server appliance.

135
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:08,100
You know, you don't want a full stack on top of that. You want it stripped down.

136
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,010
Yeah. Yeah, totally, man.

137
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,029
Yeah,

138
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,369
I suppose that's a fair point too because open source kind of gives

139
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,059
you that ability where you can just pick and choose what you want.

140
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,079
But I guess we, we still come back to the maintenance issue, don't we? Where,

141
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,299
where you have to take care of this stuff?

142
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:23,309
You can't just go out and take it and

143
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,350
then use it forever and declare yourself the winner.

144
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:25,720
Yeah.

145
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,339
Well, the good news there is the core of open source, like the Linux kernel G, Lipsy.

146
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:33,309
all of those are very healthy, very large upstream.

147
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:35,084
Now, granted,

148
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:40,334
there are some pretty fundamental software projects that have very weak or very

149
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:44,244
sick or even in some cases just flat out dead upstream communities.

150
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:47,885
But they tend to be more the exception than the rule, in my opinion

151
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:49,484
-- that
-- that's probably fair.

152
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:53,144
And I know like we've seen it before in, in, like Redhead and Fedora

153
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:53,984
Land is

154
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,285
when you have an abandoned upstream,

155
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,950
you either end up killing that, that library or product project,

156
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,869
I should say from whatever it is you're doing or conversely,

157
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,959
you fork it and make it new

158
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,510
or I guess you just take it over depending upon the situation.

159
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,059
I mean, I know I've run into more than one thing before that.

160
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,910
You're like, hey, I want to take over your project. Like, no, it's mine.

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,239
You can't have it. It's like,

162
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:20,040
but you haven't committed anything to it in seven years.

163
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:22,880
You know, this is clearly not a project anymore and then, you know,

164
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,029
they stick by their guns and like, no, no, no, you can't have it.

165
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,640
It's like, all right, man, whatever.

166
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,839
But I guess that's, that's the beauty of its sources. Right.

167
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,059
Well,

168
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,059
and the reality is that this kind of

169
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,299
abandonment also happens in the commercial world.

170
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,040
Right.

171
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:40,880
How many of us have a printer or a camera or something that

172
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,500
needs a hardware driver that's only available for version X of Windows,

173
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,440
Mac Os and Linux

174
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,920
and hasn't been updated in five or 10 years.

175
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,750
Oh, man. You know, there's all this Windows 95 software out there isn't,

176
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:52,600
I've heard before.

177
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:54,279
There's a defense contractor that's still running

178
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,910
Windows 95 because some like piece of C

179
00:07:57,049 --> 00:08:01,269
ad software they have only runs on Windows 95 which is hilarious, right?

180
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,519
I mean, that's so pathetically old. It hurts.

181
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:09,089
Now, I will also say though my favorite story is if Windows 95

182
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,010
could have been containerized, we would still have Windows 95 containers today,

183
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:13,450
right?

184
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,089
Because people would need it. And that's also terrifying in its own special way.

185
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,709
I mean, it will happen for sure.

186
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,529
It's already been containerized in the sense of virtual machines.

187
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,269
You know,

188
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,859
and I've seen

189
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,019
you can't

190
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,470
have

191
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,609
containers, virtual machines that'll get us in trouble. Don't, you know.

192
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:32,789
Well, no, but I mean, in the sense of people need old software to work,

193
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,030
especially when they have other old software

194
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,989
or other old hardware that's expensive.

195
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,179
You know, you can't,

196
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,130
you can't justify upgrading ac

197
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,270
ad machine or a computer aided design machine, you know,

198
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,510
for the sake of just updating the US.

199
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,489
Now, now here's a question for you

200
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:49,549
if

201
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:54,049
you need old software and let's face it. Like if you need Windows 95 you just

202
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,549
have a copy of Windows 95 run into VM, whatever it is, that, that works.

203
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,260
What happens when you have a cloud service

204
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,669
and it, it end of life.

205
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,640
So it changes the API and you have something talking to it and it no longer, I mean,

206
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,489
I guess this problem sort of exists where

207
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,359
people have gear

208
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,539
that is irreplaceable running, say an application or an operating system.

209
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,260
I mean, it's,

210
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,840
it's a terrifying place to be in.

211
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,739
Well, I mean, I know, for example, in the elevator industry,

212
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,369
uh

213
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,890
the software running those elevators is incredibly

214
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,619
old and

215
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,080
in most cases, you know, buildings have,

216
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,320
have elevator systems that were installed 1020 30 years ago

217
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,039
and until they go through a modernization cycle, that's what you have.

218
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,500
Ok. But now let's let's look at that in the context of security.

219
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,859
We also aren't hearing about security or not security secu

220
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:51,849
we don't have the problem with elevators like being an epidemic of, of

221
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,669
injuring or killing people even though they're super old, right?

222
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:58,630
And I think we all agreed that like super old,

223
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,989
say medical devices are going to be a terrifying prospect.

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,400
And when I say super old I'm talking probably a year or two. Right.

225
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,190
Not like a 40 year old elevator.

226
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,169
Well, I think it basically, I think the biggest problem here is that as a consumer,

227
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,929
I cannot make an informed decision

228
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,299
around closed

229
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,169
source software.

230
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,159
It's

231
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:19,750
impossible.

232
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:19,900
You

233
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,140
make an informed decision around open-source

234
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,849
software.

235
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:23,559
Yeah.

236
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,669
So for example, and I've written articles on this,

237
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,330
but one thing talking about looking at the change logs, you know,

238
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:31,030
do they have 100 commits in the last six months?

239
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,630
Do they have 10 commits in the last six months?

240
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,119
Do they have zero commits in the last six months?

241
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,090
You know, are there mailing lists with active traffic? Is there

242
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:43,130
active support going on? You know, there's projects with very few commits

243
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,169
simply because the project itself is very mature,

244
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,460
you know,

245
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,580
and that shows when you look at the support requests coming in because there's,

246
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,750
you know, all these only weird edge corner cases

247
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,729
and the majority of it just works for people.

248
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:58,099
-- I guess
-- that that's a hilarious way to think about it is you're right there,

249
00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:01,469
there are mature projects that don't need commits because

250
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,229
they basically do what they need to do.

251
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,179
And there's also projects that have no commits because they're basically dead.

252
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:12,010
And so how do you, I mean, from the security perspective, that's a huge difference.

253
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,109
How do you tell them apart?

254
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,169
Well, one thing is even a project with no commits can still have a healthy upstream

255
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:19,739
you know, there's still people and the beauty is,

256
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,130
you can look through the code and email them

257
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:24,650
and I have in past emailed people and said, hey, are you still working on this?

258
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,950
And they're like? Yeah. Yeah. Do you need a bug fix or something?

259
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,099
Uh, conversely,

260
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:30,770
I've also had software projects where I've tried to hunt down

261
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,809
the people involved in it and they're all dead or gone,

262
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:33,849
you know,

263
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,599
-- and impossible to find.
-- How does

264
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,179
normal person

265
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:41,280
or, or should that even be something they worry about

266
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,340
is, is

267
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,559
finding that out.

268
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,440
The reality is, I think as consumers,

269
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,359
we generally don't make very well informed decisions.

270
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,549
I mean, you look at pretty much anything we purchase,

271
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,809
you look at pretty much anything we purchase

272
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,450
and with very few exceptions, there's not a lot of good info.

273
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,880
I mean, one exception, for example is cars, there's some really good,

274
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:03,280
you know, consumer reports does, in my opinion,

275
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,690
amazing work around car reviews and safety reviews of cars.

276
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,130
But I mean, that's the exception to the rule, right? Like when you look at

277
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,710
most things fundamentally, is it Ul Certified?

278
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:17,299
So can I plug it into my house and not burn my house down? Yes. Ok. That's it.

279
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,219
Now, now I'll, I'll pick on that one. Right. I,

280
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:23,320
I went to college for electrical engineering.

281
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,669
I have friends who went to UL for work.

282
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,409
I know what UL does I understand what they do? I know people there.

283
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,830
I never look for the UL symbol on anything I buy

284
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,799
until it breaks. Then I'm like, oh, this wasn't UL approved.

285
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,950
No wonder it lit on fire when I plugged it in.

286
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,700
Right.

287
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:43,080
Yeah.

288
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:46,419
So, I mean, there's at least those baselines in some industries.

289
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:48,929
Um, and I mean, with software there is no baseline yet,

290
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:50,580
you know,

291
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,919
-- can
-- there be, I mean,

292
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,679
and so this is, this is a debate that

293
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:58,359
I, I go back and forth myself constantly, right?

294
00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:01,059
Because it's easy to say we need to certify software.

295
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,690
There should be some, you know,

296
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,460
minimum bar claiming this is the way to do it or this isn't the way to do it,

297
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:07,440
whatever it is.

298
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:08,679
But the thing is

299
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,820
there's two things that keep coming up for me is one, number one,

300
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,169
like a dude in his basement can write software.

301
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,440
So how do you, does it apply to that?

302
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,140
And, and let's face it in the way open source works.

303
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,369
Like people are gonna run that stuff in a product someday because

304
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,250
it's gonna end up on stack overflow or it's gonna end up on

305
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:29,549
github.

306
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,049
So you've got that aspect

307
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,869
but then on the other side of it also this stuff moves so fast.

308
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,150
I mean, you look at like the car industry or the airline industry,

309
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,669
you're talking about like five plus years of,

310
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:46,429
of features in hardware are in the pipeline working their way to the end.

311
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,020
Whereas in software like if we have a good idea,

312
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,340
we can have a new software thing out by the end of the day,

313
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,989
I think part of it is to remember there are

314
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,830
technically speaking situations where software is certified, for example,

315
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,260
in medical devices and

316
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,679
actually in elevators and cars.

317
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,679
But the reality is the software certification process right now is,

318
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,900
is laughably terrible.

319
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,219
-- I mean, I,
-- I

320
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:11,909
-- wouldn't
-- even say that you just think it's laugh.

321
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,349
there's nothing there, there's not even anything to laugh at.

322
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:16,869
Yeah.

323
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,510
And so part of it is, you know,

324
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,909
the reality is

325
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,270
if you could properly certify something and actually say that it is bug free.

326
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,859
Well, you've now solved, you know, turing's halting problem.

327
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,750
Good for you,

328
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,989
go collect your Nobel Prize,

329
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:31,700
right?

330
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:34,909
So by definition, if, if we had the capability to do this,

331
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,710
we wouldn't need to because the, the, you know,

332
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:39,729
the initial developers wouldn't have written code with bugs in it.

333
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,030
Um, I think what will happen though is we can definitely

334
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,580
check the maturity of the overall project and, you know, make sure that they,

335
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:51,010
you know, even simple. Do you guys have a bug tracker? Right.

336
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,179
How many places don't even have a proper bug tracker?

337
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:55,780
You know,

338
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:59,280
uh, if you look at some of these commercial software, you know,

339
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,479
enterprise products,

340
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,739
do you have a build system or does somebody just

341
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,419
randomly build it on their workstation and hope it runs?

342
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,390
You know, I've got a great story about that is

343
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,890
I was working with a project one time.

344
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,099
This was some years back and we were talking about

345
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,460
how security updates get developed. And the topic of BUILD system comes up.

346
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:20,570
And I said, you know, how do you build your stuff?

347
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,979
Tell me about your build infrastructure.

348
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,130
And they're like, oh, we build it on Bob's laptop.

349
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,340
And I said what? That's not cool. They're like, why, what's the difference?

350
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:28,179
It's, it's fine.

351
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,880
And I, you know, I give the laundry list, the viruses and malware, whatever,

352
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,059
you know, and I go through, they're like, yeah, we don't care about any of that stuff.

353
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,609
We build it on his laptop and it's fine.

354
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,460
And then I'm like, well, well, how do you distribute this stuff?

355
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:41,940
And then they're, they're telling me and they're using like, this weird

356
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,619
website not related to their domain

357
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:45,979
to put software on.

358
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,020
And I'm like, but some of your releases are over here, like, on your download page.

359
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,409
Why aren't you using that anymore?

360
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:56,650
And they were like, oh, well, our uh our web guy, uh he got hit by a bus and he's,

361
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:00,900
he's still recovering and like, like, he literally was hit by a bus and I'm like,

362
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,119
what if Bob gets hit by a bus?

363
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,849
And they're like, 00, yeah, we hadn't really thought of that before.

364
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:09,130
And I'm like, I, it literally happened to you guys and of course, you know, they,

365
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,349
they understood at least, I don't think they ever fixed any of it.

366
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:12,650
But,

367
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,450
you know, it, it took them a second to put that together in their minds and,

368
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,330
and that's like, it's my favorite story to tell.

369
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,450
Right. Where you've got this instance of people.

370
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:25,070
I, I think they don't want to believe it could ever happen to them,

371
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,340
which I guess is human nature.

372
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:29,859
Right. If that wasn't true. I don't think we'd have the problems we have but

373
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,150
-- a man
-- how many,

374
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,630
how many people build their houses and businesses in known flood zones.

375
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:40,429
And here's my favorite in Alberta. We have a town, the town is called High River.

376
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,039
-- Guess what happens every 100 years.
-- But man, the view is fantastic, right?

377
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:48,159
Like the closer you are to that river, the better the view.

378
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,780
And so every once in a while,

379
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:52,190
well, this year it was about,

380
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,210
or this time it was about five years ago and the the whole town is flooded, you know,

381
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:57,500
6 ft deep and everybody and I'm like,

382
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,549
it's called high, like they call like when the settlers moved there,

383
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,950
they called it high River.

384
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,090
That

385
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:04,098
is fantastic, man. I love it.

386
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,310
No, it, it's basic human nature, right? We don't.

387
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,848
I mean, life is so full of potentially terrible things that could happen.

388
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,589
If you thought about every single one of them,

389
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,410
uh you would hide under your bed except you wouldn't

390
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,569
accept because your bed might collapse and kill you.

391
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,589
Then you become a security person, Kurt

392
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,270
and we have to live with our reality every single day.

393
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:29,280
-- And
-- I honestly think one of the most popular coping

394
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,770
mechanisms and I know quite honestly I do this now

395
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:36,650
is to largely ignore risk unless it's like, literally right up in my face.

396
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,609
I, I mean, that's fair. Right.

397
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,390
If you had to worry about every single little piece of risk,

398
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,250
you find every single day all the time it would be,

399
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:45,920
you couldn't deal with it, right.

400
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,069
Normal people couldn't handle it and no one could handle it right? For that matter.

401
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,150
Which. All right. So let's tie it back to open source.

402
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,719
How do we talk about risk in the open

403
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:57,270
source universe when someone comes to you and says,

404
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,729
Kurt,

405
00:17:57,949 --> 00:18:00,050
I don't think open source software is secure.

406
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:02,689
-- What are you going to tell them?
-- Well, I'm gonna tell them that

407
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:05,069
if they find vulnerabilities

408
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,520
and report them that they'll probably get fixed for the vast majority of projects.

409
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,339
This is true.

410
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:15,319
Uh I'm gonna tell them that they can have auditors go through the code if they want.

411
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:18,369
They also quite often have a choice of code. You know, there's

412
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,760
uh many situations where you have a large project

413
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,599
uh

414
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:24,959
that then

415
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,880
becomes very feature-rich,

416
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,979
which in and of itself often introduces a lot of potential security risks

417
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:35,199
and then you'll have some new up and comer that does it very lean and very secure.

418
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:35,369
You know,

419
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,160
there's a lot of secure alternatives now for

420
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,079
various services that you need to be running.

421
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,609
Uh I would also say that they can participate in the community

422
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,829
and push the security agenda if they want. You know,

423
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:51,319
the reality is the vast majority of projects would be more than happy

424
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:55,130
to have people commit security fixes to them or commit security hardening to them

425
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,479
as long as they play nice and, you know, respect the community.

426
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:00,739
You know, you can't go in there with hobnailed boots and be like, yeah,

427
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,089
we're gonna do this, this and this because it's more secure,

428
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,900
that definitely will not work.

429
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,760
Yes.

430
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:11,569
Oh, man. The number of times I've tried to do that, I don't even want to think about it.

431
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:12,540
It makes me sad.

432
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,839
Uh, yeah.

433
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:15,709
Yeah, that's right. But all right. So,

434
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,260
back it up even farther though.

435
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,510
It's, it's easy to talk about, oh,

436
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,209
community and get involved in all this open source stuff.

437
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:22,869
But let's face it. Most people don't do that.

438
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,689
They aren't gonna get involved because that's the reality of it.

439
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:26,910
So what happens when

440
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:28,089
you've got like

441
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,989
an architect working at, at a company, uh,

442
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,810
a medium size company that doesn't even have enough time to do his day job

443
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,140
and he's like, everyone want, you know, I've got all this open source crap.

444
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,439
Everyone keeps throwing at me.

445
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,130
What do I do with this? How do you, how do you talk to someone like that?

446
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,704
That they they, they don't have time to verify it secure.

447
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,614
They don't have time to join communities.

448
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,665
They don't even, they don't want to for that matter.

449
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:52,744
So I would say there and this is the somewhat cynical part of me.

450
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,035
Do you need to run this software? Yes or no.

451
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:58,625
If you do need to run this software, then by definition, you have to do something,

452
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:00,295
you have to run it or find a

453
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:03,834
competing package that does the same thing that you need.

454
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:08,415
So you can either run the open source one, have availability, start using it today

455
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:12,109
or you can start evaluating commercial vendors and good luck with that,

456
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,660
you know.

457
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,880
So part of it is quite honestly,

458
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,079
I'm at a point in my life where take it or leave it because quite frankly,

459
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,969
there's enough people using open source and contributing back to it that,

460
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:24,020
you know, we're good. We're never, it's never gonna die.

461
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,180
It's just a part of the way life is.

462
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,280
And conversely,

463
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,329
there's people that will never accept open source and will always think it's evil or

464
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:31,979
strange.

465
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:36,189
Or those people don't have a choice because it's here and it won.

466
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,209
I mean, let's face it, man. Open source one. It's in everything.

467
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:43,349
You, even if you don't know it, like you're using open source.

468
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,420
I was uh

469
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:50,510
uh who is it? Mudge put a thing up on Twitter the other day showing all of the licenses

470
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,520
in, in like a, I forget what car company

471
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,020
was it Mercedes.

472
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:58,109
Yeah, they're running, like, you know, Lib P and G and Lib Tiff and,

473
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,319
like all these crazy libraries and now at the same time,

474
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,560
you know, that's terrifying because they probably just grabbed a copy of it one day,

475
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,219
you know, five years ago

476
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,520
and that's the one they're still using, which has had, you know,

477
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,380
like 100 security flaws fixed.

478
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,239
But it's,

479
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,719
it's everywhere, man. I mean, so I do.

480
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:17,890
It always chuckles making me chuckle a little bit when I've got someone being like,

481
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,280
oh, is open source secure?

482
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:19,819
And

483
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,959
you don't, it doesn't matter, right?

484
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:24,680
Like you're using it, you don't get to pick anymore.

485
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:26,709
Well, it's, you know, it's a lot like elevators,

486
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,640
a lot of people are afraid of elevators,

487
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:29,729
but they're definitely

488
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:29,880
not.

489
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:35,609
I have never met anyone afraid of elevators, maybe a two year old. Right.

490
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:37,255
Actually, there was a little kid once.

491
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:41,165
Uh I knew he was like one and he was literally afraid of elevators.

492
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,594
But other than that,

493
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:44,964
-- who is afraid of elevators?
-- Honestly,

494
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:48,974
I've met one or two people and, but the reality is even if you're afraid of elevators,

495
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:51,604
you know, if you go into a building 40 stories tall,

496
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,435
you're not going up 40 flights of stairs.

497
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:56,405
That's fair. And I can't wait for all the hate mail.

498
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,395
I'm gonna get about people who are afraid of elevators that are gonna

499
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:01,364
tell me about their serious condition.

500
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:02,885
So that'll be fantastic.

501
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,010
Alright. That's right.

502
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,959
Although honestly,

503
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:07,479
I think airplanes could maybe be a better analogy

504
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:09,949
here because obviously it carries pretty significant risk.

505
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:13,030
I mean, you don't hear about a lot of elevator deaths but when there's a plane crash,

506
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,150
like, you know it, man,

507
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,589
it's, that's news. Right.

508
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:20,349
But, uh, back to the open source thing, I mean, the reality is

509
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,390
people are using it,

510
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,109
you are going to have to use it whether

511
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,619
you like it or not because something you purchased

512
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,079
has software in it.

513
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:31,619
And if it has software in it, it almost guaranteed has open source in it because

514
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,510
like you said, there's all these image processing libraries, there's,

515
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,050
you know, nobody wants to spend money reinventing the wheel.

516
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,780
And more importantly, businesses don't have time to re invent the wheel anymore.

517
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:44,540
You know, if you're on a three month product cycle or a six month product cycle,

518
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:47,170
you can't spend two years writing an image parsing library.

519
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,260
Yeah, that's fair.

520
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,650
I mean, well, heck, I mean, back in the day you didn't need an image parsing library,

521
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:51,930
right?

522
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:54,910
Because there was one kind of image maybe, or you just made your own up,

523
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,550
everything was fine.

524
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:57,510
Yeah.

525
00:22:57,829 --> 00:22:59,819
And then to the security side of it,

526
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,150
I hate to say it because I don't wanna, you know, call names. But

527
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,979
how do we know the uh closed source world is doing any better?

528
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,000
They're totally not, you know, that it's,

529
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,410
and, and again, open

530
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:10,160
source one,

531
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,640
there's no such thing as close source software anymore.

532
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:12,920
You know,

533
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,239
you've got your open source and you might put something on

534
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,959
top of it that you aren't necessarily releasing in public.

535
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:18,280
But,

536
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:23,199
I mean, for the most part it, it, you've got open source and, and no, I would agree.

537
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:24,439
Closed source is

538
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,630
unquestionably no better.

539
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,439
And of course, you have people, I used to always tell people, you know,

540
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,229
open source is better, but that can't be backed up in any way.

541
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,400
I am willing to say that uh

542
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,579
both are equally bad

543
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:39,979
would probably be the, the nicest way to describe it. Right.

544
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,920
I think the biggest difference is that we just air out our dirty laundry in public.

545
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:44,790
Yeah.

546
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,719
Yeah, that's fair.

547
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,680
The code, the mailing list,

548
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,430
you know, because to me a big part of what's about open source, the value,

549
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:53,709
especially as a security person is not just the code,

550
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:56,540
but the whole having access to the whole community around it.

551
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,829
You know, being like

552
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,560
when somebody finds a flaw on open source,

553
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:02,239
you can get blame and find who wrote that line of code.

554
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:05,160
And, and I love that it's called get blame,

555
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:05,790
right?

556
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:06,390
Like,

557
00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:11,510
you know, when you're looking, that's why you're doing it. Who do I go get to yell at

558
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:13,930
and you know, with, I,

559
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:15,920
I've been in situations with close source

560
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,890
companies where they didn't even use source control

561
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,650
and they literally had no idea who wrote the code.

562
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,689
That's fantastic.

563
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:25,089
I, I'm going to hope that doesn't happen anymore,

564
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,530
even though I'm sure it does.

565
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:27,280
Yeah.

566
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,709
Then I'm not gonna think about it.

567
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:29,439
All right.

568
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,739
I love it.

569
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,020
Oh, man. Is there any hope?

570
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,310
How do we fix it? Curt,

571
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,680
I think,

572
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,109
I think there is hope and, and going back to the certification side,

573
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,020
the reality is you don't have to do an awesome job

574
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,900
to assess risk. Right. It's pretty easy to say that, you know, back to my favorite

575
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:53,810
metric of security is it's a dumpster fire. How bad is the dumpster fire? You know,

576
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,900
just wheel it away from the building and everything.

577
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,589
You know, you bring this up and I just read a thing,

578
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,000
I wish I would have kept it because I don't remember where it came from,

579
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,459
but it was discussing risk and,

580
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:07,119
you know, what,

581
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,939
how are you addressing your risk in your industry or your organization?

582
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:11,619
And

583
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:14,540
they said basically so obviously, you know, we,

584
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,359
we'll use a topic of breaches because that's pretty easy to understand that

585
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,579
you can estimate what the cost of a breach would be.

586
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,030
And basically they said,

587
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,849
if you're mitigating technologies be it people

588
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,150
and tools and processes and whatever,

589
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,709
if they exceed 37% of the cost of the breach,

590
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,349
you are wasting your money,

591
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,859
which is kind of fascinating to think about. I mean,

592
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:38,459
iiii I gotta go,

593
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:42,790
I have to go find this but like 37% is a very specific number so clearly,

594
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,180
or I should say clearly, hopefully someone has actual math behind that

595
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,589
and they didn't just make up a number, which I'm, is a possibility. But

596
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,189
it's, yeah, I mean, and that makes sense. Right. Because

597
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:57,349
if you're spending more than a breach would cost you,

598
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,910
it would make more sense to just accept the breach. Right.

599
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,989
Well, unless there's a branding issue. Yeah,

600
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,859
-- I mean, if you
-- have, I mean, that's part of it though, right?

601
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:09,140
I mean, you have to take into account the cost of, you know, brand to

602
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,709
losing,

603
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:11,739
you know what I mean?

604
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,140
Because there's also, for example, the ST

605
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,920
Jude's debacle currently ongoing, you know,

606
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:22,939
where that security firm found some security flaws in their pacemaker devices

607
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:25,959
and then went to Wall Street short,

608
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:28,599
sold the stock and went public with the vulnerabilities.

609
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:33,099
And so at that point now you've also got, well,

610
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,800
you've got the potential for some law enforcement related issues.

611
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,699
Um but more importantly, you know,

612
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,339
you have Saint Jude in the press largely because

613
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,500
this is the first time this has publicly happened.

614
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,339
You know, it's something new and shiny.

615
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,349
Yeah. All right. I'm looking at the stock here. I just pulled it up. It's down,

616
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,310
it was at about 82 ish.

617
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,060
We're looking at 78 now.

618
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,349
It, it the lowest 77.8. So it's,

619
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,910
yeah, that's fair.

620
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,319
I mean,

621
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,000
I will be interested to see if in a

622
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,010
couple of months if it's totally recovered because,

623
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,550
I mean, like you look at what happened with,

624
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:08,750
with Target

625
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,979
and their stock took a hit, but it's basically right back where it was.

626
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:16,750
So I think you could easily make the argument that in terms of brand recognition,

627
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,819
their incident had minimal long term impact.

628
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,400
Well, and that's the sad reality is for most, especially for breach

629
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,449
style

630
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:25,699
situations.

631
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:26,609
I

632
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,839
suspect the majority of the costs are essentially externalized, you know,

633
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,839
onto the people

634
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,280
whose information was leaked or, you know,

635
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,449
unless it's something like an ATM theft or like that, you know,

636
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:42,630
swift wire transfer fraud where actual money is stolen from the bank.

637
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,079
The majority of these companies don't actually

638
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:48,949
lose a lot of money. You know, it's not like their accounts are being emptied out.

639
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,770
It's, you know, people's personal information

640
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,790
and unfortunately it was just,

641
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,739
the name escapes me but a week or two ago

642
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,550
there was a chiropractic office in the USA Pain Management.

643
00:27:59,530 --> 00:27:59,859
Yeah. The,

644
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,530
the, you know, had,

645
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,680
this is weird to me because they're big enough to have 200,000 sets of records.

646
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,170
I

647
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:07,550
mean, that's a lot of people,

648
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,489
uh, and there's somehow it would,

649
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,160
they were breached and all this information is up for sale on the dark web.

650
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:18,449
And the company's response is we can't afford to provide credit monitoring.

651
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,920
It would bankrupt us. So we're not going to,

652
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,050
you know, and the reality is unless somebody gets,

653
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:29,829
uh, a lawsuit started and then wins it. Well, that, that's how this is gonna play out

654
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:30,859
and

655
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,079
I suspect more and more companies might take that

656
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,719
approach of while this offering you credit monitoring,

657
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,459
it is gonna cost us money. So we're not gonna do it.

658
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:39,989
Right.

659
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,010
Well, and I think that's,

660
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,890
that's part of that 37% now that people are gonna start thinking about.

661
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,589
Right? Is,

662
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:49,810
is how does like cybersecurity insurance fit into this story.

663
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:53,170
And if, if the cost of the bad thing is, you know,

664
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,709
much less than they getting insurance and proper security

665
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,180
and that's borderline terrifying in a lot of ways. And I know

666
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,630
like a lot of people pick on things like, you know, PC I compliance and whatnot.

667
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,969
But I mean, in all seriousness,

668
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:07,849
some of this compliance is good because it

669
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:10,449
makes these organizations kind of do the right

670
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:15,300
thing even if it doesn't necessarily make them super secure at the end of the day,

671
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,609
it at least makes them put some of the right pieces in the right places, which is in,

672
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,040
in an instance like that.

673
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,000
A very good thing.

674
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,339
Well,

675
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:26,199
and something to remember too about risk is we accept a lot of risk in life like 30,000

676
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:26,329
a

677
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,530
year on the US alone, right?

678
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,930
And in other parts of the world where they have less traffic controls,

679
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,319
you know, it, it's insane.

680
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,479
-- Right. But I'm more scared of sharks than I am. Of cars.
-- Yeah,

681
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:40,000
and, and you know, cars are a good example because it's something that's, you know,

682
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,479
we actually have data that says if you drive this many miles,

683
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:47,239
then the statistical chance of you getting clobbered is this, you know,

684
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:49,969
and again,

685
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,800
so we deal with it through insurance.

686
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:55,209
You know, we also have people engineering cars better,

687
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,449
but fundamentally we have an entire system around it and

688
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:00,349
it doesn't have to be perfect and it isn't,

689
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,359
you know, the number of people I know that have been in

690
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,689
car accidents and had their necks screwed up for a year or two.

691
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:07,069
You know, that doesn't sound like fun,

692
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:08,900
but it's just something

693
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,949
that happens.

694
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,359
So back to software security,

695
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,229
we don't actually have to have that great a deal of

696
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:19,869
risk management knowledge around it because we've already accepted the risk,

697
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,150
right?

698
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,030
We're already

699
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:21,750
in

700
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,010
-- the middle of the forest.
-- Nobody accepts the risk on pur.

701
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:27,069
I mean, have you ever seen like in EU L A?

702
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:30,910
The thing, it's a phone book that just indemnifies the vendor.

703
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,520
Well, and so

704
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,969
there the consumer takes the risk on,

705
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,599
you know, whether they like it or not.

706
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:41,079
I need to catch those Pokemon like I, I can't help it, you know.

707
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,540
So the reality is we've already, we've already crossed the bridge now.

708
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,199
We're realizing maybe we should have built a better bridge or maybe not gone over it.

709
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:50,510
But it's,

710
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:52,160
yeah.

711
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:55,890
Yeah, we're there, there's, there's no going back. I agree.

712
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,640
And I mean, that's one of the great challenges. Right, is how, what now?

713
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,949
And I don't, we, we don't know. Right.

714
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:05,160
We certainly have no idea what, what's going on now. However, I will admit,

715
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,000
and this is something that almost gives me hope every now and then is the fact that

716
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,880
open source one,

717
00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:15,489
which also means everything is starting to change.

718
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,420
There are things happening in this industry now,

719
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,829
unlike anything we've ever seen before.

720
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:21,969
And so hopefully, hopefully

721
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,989
we can get some of this right this time around.

722
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:24,709
Well, you know,

723
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,630
the fact that Microsoft has not only started

724
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,439
using open source internally for products and services,

725
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:32,630
but has started and not only supporting open source

726
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,550
in the form of Docker containers on windows,

727
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,880
but is actually now open sourcing some

728
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,290
-- of their tooling and their software like
-- Power

729
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,109
powershell man. That's, that's awesome, right?

730
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,219
I can't.

731
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:46,140
So, so funny enough, I had a conversation the other day with somebody that was like,

732
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,420
oh powershell, that's dumb.

733
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,709
Who wants that? I'm like

734
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,010
there are more Windows admins than probably there are Linux,

735
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,130
if you added a zero onto the end of the number of Linux

736
00:31:56,239 --> 00:32:01,010
admins, like we a huge market just opened up because of this tool.

737
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,020
You know, that's,

738
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,300
that's a big deal.

739
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,189
And

740
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,939
I think it's inevitable that like you said, I,

741
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,099
in my mind, the future of software is essentially people writing glue code

742
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,079
and very few people writing actual services or the

743
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:18,459
hard to write software like kernels or encryption software.

744
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:18,819
You know,

745
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:21,339
there's going to be small groups that do that do it well,

746
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,680
and the rest of us are just going to consume it. Right.

747
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:26,920
Nobody, nobody writes an encryption library anymore. That's just flat out

748
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:27,229
saying

749
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,859
that's a topic for another day

750
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,239
and, and people do still write encryption libraries

751
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,150
and they totally should.

752
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,400
-- They're bad. Your
-- famous stunning Kruger curve.

753
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,369
Yes. Which,

754
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:41,880
yeah.

755
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:42,770
Oh, man,

756
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,660
don't get me started.

757
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,869
All right. All right. So, so let's take it home Kurt. Open source secure or insecure.

758
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,040
I would say both. You know, it's sort of a quantum thing until you measure it.

759
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:54,790
You don't know.

760
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,520
But it doesn't matter because we're using it and it's here.

761
00:32:57,869 --> 00:33:00,729
That is the greatest answer I've ever heard of that question.

762
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:03,619
Schrodinger is open source, right? Doesn't matter. It's already here.

763
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,339
I love it, man.

764
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:06,930
All right. Cool. Well, that was fun. Kurt,

765
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,260
until next time.
