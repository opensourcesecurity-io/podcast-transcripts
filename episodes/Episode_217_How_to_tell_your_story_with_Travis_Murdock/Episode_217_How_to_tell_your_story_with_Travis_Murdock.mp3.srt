Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,529
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,319
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:15,720
Oh, man, you keep saying crime. I'm used to thought crime. Anyway, I'm ecstatic.

4
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:17,430
Today. We have, we have a guest.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,850
We have someone who I've recently become acquainted with.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,940
His name is Travis Murdoch. He's the executive vice president at R

7
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:30,530
FIN and Travis is, I guess, what, what would you describe your job as Travis?

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,409
I don't wanna, I guess upend you on this.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,430
Well, I help people tell their stories and to tell them.

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,490
Well, my job is a storyteller. How's that?

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,439
That's a lovely description.

12
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:46,290
So, so the actual topic we're, we're talking about is is functionally,

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,090
I guess public relations would be maybe the old way of saying it.

14
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:53,279
But I, I really like the storytelling answer. That's, that's phenomenal.

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,560
So why don't you tell us who you are? Travis kind of why, why are you here?

16
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:57,450
Well, I,

17
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:01,130
I do pr for a living and a lot of the place

18
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:07,209
where I focus is in helping people understand and talk about the technology

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,059
and also very often around security.

20
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:15,660
There's a lot to inform both the public and the informed public, which I might call,

21
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:19,819
say developers and, and security professionals themselves.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,739
And I love to talk about that.

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,139
So I think we're going to talk a little bit about that today.

24
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,959
Well, we'll see, we might end up talking about plumbing or something.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,580
You never know.

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,459
There is no topic.

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,260
I just, I just love how initially like my first reaction is like,

28
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,110
uh pr but then I'm like, no, we like,

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,739
infosec needs this because when I think about all the times I've seen people

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,940
tell me something and I'm like, why is it important? They're like, be because it is.

31
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:50,239
And I'm like, that's not really convincing, as I said, so, well,

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,569
that's their backup plan usually.

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,430
Yes. Is why won't you listen to me? I'm the expert.

34
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,790
Yeah. Yeah.

35
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:01,629
-- And, and you and I both used to be that person. Ok.
-- Ok. So let's

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,220
before we, we dive into the weeds, I guess.

37
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,649
And this is, this is why I wanted Travis to come talk to us because

38
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:13,600
I've, I've been interacting with Travis in, in day job.

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,490
And

40
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,970
I realized quickly that, you know, your stuff from the pr perspective,

41
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,460
but also from the security perspective,

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,660
which is not something I'd experienced in the past.

43
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:26,369
And I guess I will start the conversation with the joke.

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,830
I always tell everyone in the security world,

45
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,339
there are two kinds of people, there are people who won't talk to reporters

46
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:36,445
and people who shouldn't talk to reporters and I guess let's take it from there.

47
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:39,164
Why, why does this matter? Why should we care?

48
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:43,205
And, and I guess what is the advantage to all of this Travis?

49
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:43,645
Yeah.

50
00:02:43,654 --> 00:02:49,725
I mean, of course, people skills as we've learned from office space are important

51
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,919
but,

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,279
but commune

53
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,660
but communicating particularly to reporters is,

54
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:01,919
is really important because they're your conduit

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,619
to, to creating change. You know, security is very often

56
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:09,139
about changing of behaviors.

57
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:14,820
A lot of security incidents, a lot of security problems occur because the user,

58
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,250
the end user is making a mis a very common mistake or even sometimes the developer is,

59
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,720
is making a mistake

60
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:25,190
that communication because the, the, you know,

61
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,220
the media buy ink and barrels gives them the ability to

62
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:33,205
communicate to large groups of people and to change behavior.

63
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:33,746
And,

64
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,126
you know, without them,

65
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:39,746
we're in a situation where we have to communicate one on one and,

66
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:40,906
and we know that doesn't,

67
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:44,606
doesn't work or at least it's much harder and much more expensive.

68
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:52,055
And a security person who can speak regular talk is so valuable to a

69
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:57,485
reporter is so valuable because they don't sit in this stuff all day long.

70
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:00,531
They need someone that helps them translate it and

71
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:02,192
it makes a big difference for their job.

72
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,091
Right. Right.

73
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,712
And, and so you hit on,

74
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,751
I think a really important point and this

75
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,072
is something as very technical oriented people,

76
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:15,072
we forget about sometimes is that reporters and, and just everyone in general,

77
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:18,152
they're not steeped in this world.

78
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,752
And so they don't understand all of the

79
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:25,111
nuance and just silliness that sometimes comes with it

80
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,630
and, and I wouldn't say worse, but they also,

81
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,510
they don't necessarily have the time for this.

82
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,839
Like, they already have a job.

83
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,970
No. Seriously. Right.

84
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,480
Like, because I've, I've literally encountered technical people that are like,

85
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,160
why can't everybody just learn how to like

86
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:39,850
safely click links in their email and like identify

87
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,160
the link in the address bar and stuff.

88
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,839
And then it's like, no,

89
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:44,399
no, like these, like,

90
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,589
because I remember doing tech support once and I

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,005
was doing tech support a doctor and I'm like,

92
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:51,084
clearly this doctor's not stupid because they're a doctor, right?

93
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:53,195
Like, they generally don't let dumb people be doctors.

94
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:55,964
And that's kind of that was, I remember when I was about 19 or 20

95
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,154
that was my first moment where I realized the doctor's not the problem.

96
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,515
Maybe I'm part of the problem, but I think the technology is the problem, right? And

97
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,640
I, I didn't have a good way to explain it to the doctor. So it didn't go very well.

98
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,660
But I, I think a lot of us technical people think,

99
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,440
why can't everybody just learn that it's easy, right?

100
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,130
-- Like riding a bike upside down,
-- you know,

101
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,679
I'll also say that I've learned over time that there are

102
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,790
people who have what I would call a systems oriented mind.

103
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,329
So, you know, A then B then C and there's others who just don't. Now

104
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,230
we're all, we're all valuable people. And

105
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:31,290
so those who can explain those processes to others

106
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,040
are quite valuable.

107
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,730
Another thing about reporters is that

108
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,450
especially with the pressure today on media, they're writing

109
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,809
very often two or three stories a day.

110
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,140
And even if they're afforded, you know, maybe writing just one story a day,

111
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:51,799
that's a lot of writing. And so they're just not going to have time

112
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,859
to dig into the details. They're not going to have time to understand,

113
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,209
you know,

114
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,440
kind of the upside and the downside of what you're telling them and

115
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,660
your ability to communicate that to them

116
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,670
clearly and quickly is extremely valuable.

117
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:09,625
I mean, once they know that you're a good source, I mean,

118
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,795
for those who want to promote their own company,

119
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:15,845
once they know that you're a good source

120
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,084
that you'll provide them with clear information,

121
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,394
they're going to come back to you time and time again.

122
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:21,225
-- So
-- actually,

123
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:24,035
that also leads on to one of the other

124
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:25,845
things that I've been thinking about lately is there,

125
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:27,654
is there's a security

126
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,725
journalist that I follow and I remember he,

127
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,660
he put a thing up on Twitter,

128
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,540
probably it's been two or three weeks where basically he said I am tired

129
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:39,700
of companies trying to use me as a wing of their marketing department.

130
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,859
And so

131
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:44,820
I'm, I'm curious if you have thoughts. And like obviously, if, if I'm speaking

132
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,480
to a reporter, on behalf of my company,

133
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,010
there is a fine line right between marketing

134
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,250
and and helping the reporter write a story,

135
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,769
you know, be a real source.

136
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,109
So add value to that report, don't be just trying to extract it.

137
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:03,079
A true relationship is, is two way with reporters that I work with,

138
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:03,829
you know,

139
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,950
I will pitch them a story and of course I have clients that

140
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,540
I work with and I am trying to help sell their product,

141
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,329
but I'm not just interacting with that reporter at that moment. At

142
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,170
that pitch, I am sending them,

143
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,579
hey, I know you write about this.

144
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,500
Have you thought about this that has nothing to do with me or my self interest?

145
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,529
And I'm giving them information.

146
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,429
So I think that's, that's a key thing. If you want to build a relationship, build it,

147
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,940
you're not going to build relationships with 100 and 50 reporters,

148
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,220
you're going to build a relationship with five, pick the five,

149
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,540
find the ones that write about the things that you're interested in

150
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,119
and then read what they write

151
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,790
and then deliver value.

152
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,040
You know, maybe one other thing is, is that man do. They really hate

153
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,320
when you send them pitches that have nothing to do with them

154
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:57,049
and they get this all day long, they get hundreds of email messages.

155
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,859
As a reporter, you get hundreds a day and 90% of those are,

156
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:02,769
it's like that's not a beat I cover.

157
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,570
Why are you sending this to me?

158
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,410
This is, you know, this is just like, has nothing to do with me and,

159
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,730
and that is so frustrating for

160
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,000
Border. So being careful, just, just read what they've written

161
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,079
is what I'm sharing with them.

162
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,359
Is it relevant to what they've written in the past?

163
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:20,579
Because if it's not,

164
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:23,619
it's, it's not interesting for them now either.

165
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,179
-- Yeah,
-- that makes a lot of sense. That's, yeah. Yeah, I can, I can relate to that. And

166
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,570
I mean, obviously as people on a podcast,

167
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:35,330
we get the pitches every now and then and yeah, sometimes it's like you clearly,

168
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,530
you clearly have never even opened our website

169
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,219
you

170
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:39,390
sent

171
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:39,859
us.

172
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:43,530
But yeah, yeah, that, that's fair. That's fair. I like that. Ok,

173
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,960
so we,

174
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,130
I, I want, I want to move the conversation a little bit as well.

175
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,330
So obviously we've discussed

176
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,739
what, what it means to kind of connect with reporters,

177
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,039
but I also feel like actually talking to these people

178
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,909
is

179
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,570
an art in itself where

180
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,640
I don't think most reporters are looking to, to catch you

181
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:04,395
necessarily.

182
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,015
But I think there's also some,

183
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:10,094
I find people get confused about like the off the record on the record.

184
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:11,484
Can I say this? Can I say that?

185
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:16,255
You know, what does it mean to talk to a member of the press?

186
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:19,804
Yeah, I mean, I have lots of reporters who are my friends.

187
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,215
So I don't want this to sound wrong but,

188
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:26,905
but the reporters are not your friends, you know, they are,

189
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,174
you need to be

190
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:32,255
conscious and careful to know that when you're speaking to them

191
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,549
that it is on record, right?

192
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,710
What you're telling them is something that they're

193
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:41,270
legally and professionally obligated to report on.

194
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,890
So be very careful with that and,

195
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,729
and think about what you're going to say ahead of time.

196
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:49,679
I mean, this, this part is extremely basic, but, you know,

197
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,599
compose yourself into three bullets of key messages, you know,

198
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,549
what are you going to say?

199
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:54,979
So that

200
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:59,349
so that you can get it to them clearly and so that they can understand it quickly,

201
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,500
know that you're gonna speak to a reporter if you're lucky for 20 minutes.

202
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:03,820
Now,

203
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,070
every once in a while when they see something of a

204
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,219
lot of interest or you're delivering a lot of value,

205
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:13,349
you'll get a little bit more time out of them, but that's what you're going to get.

206
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,020
And if for some reason,

207
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,460
you're in a situation where you really are giving information

208
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,250
that you don't want the reporter to use your name.

209
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:26,020
You need to be extremely explicit about that

210
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,419
before you shared anything

211
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,039
and you need to get the reporter to agree to that you need to say to them.

212
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,239
I, you know, I want this to be confidential and I don't want you to,

213
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,599
to share my name and if they agree to that then, ok.

214
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,179
But if they don't agree to that ahead of time, know that you can't tell them at the end.

215
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,880
Oh, this is all confidential. That's not, that's not how they work. Right.

216
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,599
You know, it's, it's, it has to be before.

217
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,890
I would just tell you quite honestly,

218
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,880
if you're engaging in that kind of a conversation with a reporter

219
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,099
that you really do need somebody who helps

220
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:02,609
who is with you that understands what you're doing

221
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:05,690
and can help guide you a little bit because that's tricky.

222
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,729
That's tricky waters to be in.

223
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,489
Yeah,

224
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,429
two questions I have.

225
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,849
So like, for example,

226
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:13,979
would that be finding somebody like just a marketing person

227
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,479
at your company that can help you with this,

228
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:17,169
that kind of has that skill set?

229
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,159
Like basically like let's say a reporter wants to talk to me. And I'm kind of like, uh

230
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,919
you know, like, yeah, where do I find my adult friend to help me out?

231
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,619
Well, I would, I would actually find somebody that has media relations experience.

232
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,489
So somebody who, who does pr I, I do this very often for,

233
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,940
for people that I've worked at where they get into another

234
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,659
company and they just need a 20 minute free consulting advice

235
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:45,020
for my own marketing. I have to say that I have told everyone that I work with that.

236
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,539
Hey, look,

237
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:49,849
you have free pr advice for life and it's been really helpful to me personally

238
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,299
and people will call and say, hey, look, we feel like we need to share this story.

239
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:56,419
How do we share it?

240
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:58,599
And it is very often on,

241
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:03,210
they're tr they're thinking that they can be like deep throat here and they can,

242
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:04,859
you know, give a secret

243
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,690
something to a reporter

244
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:07,659
and I'll tell you,

245
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,530
you really got to do that the right way and it's very tricky most of the time,

246
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,130
99% of the time.

247
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,609
That's not the right way. You either say it and it's public or you don't say it

248
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,429
-- and it's not public.
-- Well, I actually have a second question, like,

249
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,659
as part of it, I've also seen, you know,

250
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,619
people who rely on talking points on the one

251
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,859
head and it annoys me because they tend to,

252
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,729
like, bang on about the same two or three things.

253
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:29,520
But on the flip side,

254
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,679
I've noticed that they do tend to at least get two or three out clearly, you know,

255
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,260
versus

256
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,510
like when I've tried to think off the top of my head and it's kind of like da, da,

257
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:38,659
da,

258
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:38,940
da,

259
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,570
-- you know, it's verbal mishmash,
-- diarrhea. We call that a podcast.

260
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:42,900
Yes.

261
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:43,674
Right.

262
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:43,885
Yeah.

263
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:44,775
You know,

264
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:46,895
and, uh, well, I mean, funnily enough,

265
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:49,255
me and Josh did discuss at one point about maybe

266
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:51,054
sort of scripting the podcast and then we're both,

267
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:52,594
like, not too much work, not doing it.

268
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,895
I don't really come up with talking points for the podcast, but I do try to, you know,

269
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:59,684
pre think a little bit so I'm not thinking on my feet constantly and I

270
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,335
was just wondering what your thoughts or comments were sort of around that whole,

271
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:04,575
like, talking points.

272
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,190
Yeah, I, I would definitely do it, you know,

273
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,789
every time you're speaking to a reporter or you're having even, you're,

274
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,020
you're speaking on a panel on a stage, make sure that you have those three points,

275
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,280
one because it organizes your thoughts in front of others.

276
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:21,750
And, and, and second of all,

277
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,000
it helps you to just think through how do I say this or where could

278
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,150
I get gummed up and secretly all executives

279
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,799
are media trained and they're taught to repeat

280
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,400
these, you know, three key messages.

281
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:39,840
And so that's why you hear that people get stuck

282
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:41,799
on that is because they've been trained to do it.

283
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,400
I would say though that

284
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,159
obviously maybe they were overtrained, you know, you need to,

285
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,989
you have to sound like a human. You have to engage with people.

286
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,840
You know, reporters are humans too.

287
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:57,020
I said they're not your friends but they, they're still humans and they're,

288
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:02,280
and they respond to warmth and in particular, if you're in a conversation, right?

289
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,919
It's like, are you a robot

290
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:10,440
or are you giving me real advice? One thing I always advise

291
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,349
my executives on is that your primary goal of this

292
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:20,200
interview of this discussion is to build a relationship of trust

293
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,799
with that reporter,

294
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,159
that relationship of trust.

295
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,489
Yes, it might get us the story right now.

296
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:30,190
But maybe so much more importantly,

297
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,830
it'll make that person come back to you time and time and time again.

298
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,489
So whatever you need to do to bridge the gap, do that,

299
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,280
-- to build that relationship of trust,
-- I think that's really powerful and I feel like

300
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:48,989
a lot of people I've interacted with over the course of my career

301
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:55,229
view, they don't understand always that, that human element to all of this. And

302
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,549
if you view the press is just your dumping ground for your talking points,

303
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:02,030
you're never going to build those connections.

304
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:07,030
Yeah, I mean, wow, like going back to that comment, I'm not your marketing tool.

305
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,510
It's like, that's exactly right.

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,530
If you're just dumping

307
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:14,130
press releases on them and saying, why didn't you cover me?

308
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:19,260
It's like that is that is not going to work in the short or long term, you know,

309
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,150
it just isn't.

310
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,030
I, I used to many, many, many moons ago.

311
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,090
This was, this was before I even worked at Red Hat,

312
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:28,210
which any listener of the podcast is well aware that Kurt and I have,

313
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,859
we both worked at Red Hat for a long time.

314
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:32,650
But, but prior to that even I remember I was at a company that

315
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:35,460
would produce press releases,

316
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,530
dump them out into the world.

317
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,609
And then the,

318
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:43,900
the CEO would get very angry when the press when no one was calling him to talk to him.

319
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:44,590
And

320
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:48,570
I remember everyone was like, I don't know a lot about the press,

321
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,760
but I'm pretty sure this isn't how it works.

322
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,299
Well, unless you're like, the press releases is beyond amazing.

323
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,950
-- Like, hey, we just cured cancer.
-- They, they weren't

324
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,210
like

325
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:04,489
it was, that company didn't make it a real long time. We'll say it was a dot Release.

326
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,200
It was, this was.com,

327
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:07,880
-- you know.
-- Oh, yeah,

328
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,219
I remember,

329
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,320
I remember like,

330
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,849
just remember the flood of press releases from these.com companies.

331
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:14,669
Like it was

332
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,270
hysterically bad,

333
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,070
you know, synergize the markets and delivering pet food to your door.

334
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,380
I tell you guys a quick negative story about me. Oh, definitely.

335
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,429
So I worked for a company and I wrote this press release.

336
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,400
They asked me to write this press release and, you know,

337
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,659
I wrote it in about four hours or so

338
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:39,659
and I sent it over to the CEO and, and it came back and it was, you know,

339
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,750
he just redlined the whole thing and every

340
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,580
single adjective or adverb he had replaced with,

341
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,599
you know, at least a three syllable

342
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:47,489
word.

343
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,489
And I was so I,

344
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I wrote it and over the week I spent more

345
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,419
than 40 hours writing this press release going back and forth

346
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,869
because it was, he,

347
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,890
he was cramming more and more and more into it and I was

348
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,469
trying to pull it out and I was early in my career.

349
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:08,510
So I didn't really have the ability to, you know,

350
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,729
kind of like explain why this didn't make sense.

351
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,010
So

352
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,819
end of the week happened, the release went out

353
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:14,589
and

354
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,348
I pitched it out and then I got an email from the Wall

355
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:22,770
Street Journal from the number one person that we were trying to influence.

356
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,300
So this is the most important person on the planet for this company at this moment.

357
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,750
And he said, Travis, I,

358
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,140
I'd like to congratulate you on winning the Buzzy Award for this week.

359
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,420
Uh

360
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:40,750
All the business reporters and every single top business publication,

361
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,939
they had this little pool where they got

362
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:46,069
together and they had an algorithm that scored

363
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,709
$100 words inside of this press release.

364
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:55,349
And ours had won the, you know, essentially the worst press release of the week.

365
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,400
So now remember every single top business publication

366
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,390
reporter

367
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,229
has now read my press release and has said that it was awful.

368
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,989
I didn't even know what to say, right?

369
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,469
Because of course, my name is on the press release. They assume I've written it

370
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:18,920
and I forwarded it to the CEO and I said here this is it. Wow. So as a,

371
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,319
I do have to say as a consolation prize.

372
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:27,270
A few weeks later, the reporter wrote a literally a two inch story two inches.

373
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,750
That's it. That's how big the story was that was buried.

374
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,390
Like on page 18 of the Wall Street Journal that mentioned my company,

375
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,500
he did that kind of as, as a joke, consolation prize for me.

376
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,260
But it was really, I mean, like those when you do stuff like that,

377
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,449
it has negative consequences and that was fairly negative.

378
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,939
So I think this is one thing in general

379
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:50,349
with any career is that learning to say no. Right?

380
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,699
Because I've seen a lot of tech, people are asked to implement something

381
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,939
and they don't say no or like this is a really bad idea that could get us in jail.

382
00:18:57,444 --> 00:19:00,604
And especially with the press, I've seen a lot of yeah,

383
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:02,775
people try to manipulate the press and it's kind of like,

384
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:06,665
well that's like trying to manipulate like a used car sales guy because they

385
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:10,145
sell like 10 cars a day and you do this once every two years,

386
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:11,165
you know you're going to lose.

387
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:16,425
Yeah. And it's, it's funny how today I now use that story to say look man,

388
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:20,895
like there's real negative consequences. I know how to say no now. Right.

389
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:24,655
Well, I mean, in all seriousness sometimes

390
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,739
see sometimes something bad has to happen to make to let something good happen.

391
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,500
So I, I assume you made lemonade from your lemons.

392
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,930
I mean, you seem to be doing all right. You know, I

393
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,750
-- I
-- did
-- continue, I persisted,

394
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:42,709
it did work. I did learn,

395
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,050
I did not have to fight with that CEO ever again when I told him

396
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,099
-- that his press release did not make sense. All of us learned well after that.
-- Nice.

397
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:53,699
Ok. Ok.

398
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:58,109
We are, we are approaching the, the end of the show in a little bit, but I,

399
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,349
I have one more topic I really want to touch on as well since we have you is.

400
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,859
So let's assume

401
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,910
I've discovered

402
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,709
an amazing

403
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:06,196
thing

404
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:07,036
and

405
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:07,855
let's,

406
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:10,635
I don't know, let's say the new, the new heart bleed, right.

407
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:12,786
The new terrible security vulnerability.

408
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,635
What, what I guess what, what do you do next? Right.

409
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:18,926
Because obviously the intent is going to be to properly

410
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:21,536
inform and get the information out into the universe.

411
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:24,115
So as a professional other than like just, you know,

412
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,995
like posting garbage on Twitter,

413
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:29,156
what would be the right thing to do as a researcher to deal with,

414
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,416
you know, some sort of sensitive and important?

415
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:35,161
Well, I'm definitely an advocate for responsible disclosure.

416
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:35,881
So, you know,

417
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:39,452
making sure that you do this in the right order I think is really important.

418
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:44,362
First thing I would do is I would make sure that you write it down from,

419
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:48,442
from a both technical and not maybe less technical perspective,

420
00:20:48,452 --> 00:20:52,342
short paper blog post that explains

421
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,401
what it is. This is before you've taken it to anyone

422
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:57,161
think through

423
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:01,040
what the problem is, what its impacts are

424
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,609
and you know, the technical exploits on it.

425
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,130
And the reason why that's important is that you're

426
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,189
going to need to pass this along to many people

427
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,359
and they're going to need to pass it to people.

428
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:16,739
So the kind of the short email I found a breach here at this point,

429
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,089
it isn't really helpful.

430
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:23,369
We all document bugs, right? But, but, but use words here to document this right?

431
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,469
In, in a blog post, like format. Second step is

432
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,250
I really advocate

433
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,800
that you don't just,

434
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,380
you're not just when you're doing responsible

435
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,290
disclosure and you're not sending it to,

436
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,689
you know, just at security at whoever.com

437
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:40,250
that you really take the time to figure out

438
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,959
real email addresses and really who you should speak to.

439
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:45,739
It doesn't take long.

440
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm gonna, I would push back there a little bit. Shouldn't these companies?

441
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,209
To me it's a signal.

442
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:52,530
If they actually care about security,

443
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,119
they're going to make it relatively easy to report a security flaw, you know,

444
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,839
having security at company name.com or having, you know,

445
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,930
company name.com/security or, you know,

446
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,849
something on their web page under contact us.

447
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,140
And the reason I say that is because I,

448
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,530
I have dealt with this where I try to chase

449
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,010
down somebody responsible to contact and it proves impossible.

450
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,910
And what that's always resulted in is this company doesn't really care, you know,

451
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,280
like, if they can't make it easy to report an issue,

452
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,910
then they're probably not going to have the

453
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,270
capability of fixing and dealing with that issue.

454
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,969
Well, I certainly agree that lots of companies don't do this. Right.

455
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:25,010
I guess I would just say that

456
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:29,219
it's not that hard to find the CEO S email address these days.

457
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:33,510
And if, if, if, as a, as a final thing, you know, you have to do that.

458
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,670
Of course, we don't want to dump stuff out into the world. And also

459
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,180
I think that

460
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,939
when you go to report this later because later it will be public,

461
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,339
I think it, I think it makes you look as more,

462
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:48,030
much more of a responsible security researcher

463
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,119
when you do that.

464
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,969
Yeah,

465
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:55,170
but the next step, as you decide that it's time to disclose, you know, publicly,

466
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,199
you've worked with the company, you, you know,

467
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,750
when you're going to disclose and it's time to disclose,

468
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,290
you should pull up the reporters

469
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:06,329
that cover this and send them an email that says

470
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:09,050
I found this, this is when we're, you know,

471
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,810
going out with it and here's the details and I'm available to

472
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:15,489
speak to you on the phone and give them the times

473
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,530
when you're available and I suspect many of them will call,

474
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:18,729
you know,

475
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:22,810
if this is a decent sized problem by bringing that

476
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,670
to them and now you have that blog post,

477
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:24,869
right?

478
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,140
That explains the whole thing to them.

479
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,849
Now, they can read that and say, ok,

480
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,060
I don't just have to trust this guy that I don't know.

481
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:35,489
I'm reading this. I see that it's big. I see that it's important

482
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:38,969
and also this person knows how to communicate with

483
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:42,170
me and then listen you can get a lot.

484
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,239
There's a few researchers out there today who are gaining

485
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,750
lots of notoriety.

486
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,530
They don't have a super technical background

487
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,530
but they have learned how to communicate.

488
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,109
They've learned how to tell reporters

489
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,489
what's going on

490
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:02,310
and that allows them to get the credit that they deserve

491
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:06,680
-- for the thing that they found.
-- Yeah, I, I think that's huge and I'm,

492
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,040
I will admit I'm guilty of this on a

493
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:14,599
regular basis where I often treat the human skills,

494
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:18,189
those soft skills as less important than the technical skills.

495
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:20,920
And in many ways, I think they are more important

496
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:25,170
than the technical skills because being able to concisely communicate any of

497
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,119
this is not only insanely difficult but insanely valuable as well.

498
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,239
You know, just simple things like, like I said,

499
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,719
having a blog post where it's written down

500
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,099
so that it's

501
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,979
available to everybody at the same time and then just giving

502
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:44,060
reporters the times when you're available to speak to them,

503
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:47,959
you know, ahead of time. So that because their schedule is packed,

504
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,930
you make it quick and easy for them

505
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,380
and understand that, you know, they are competing for clicks.

506
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,699
So if you give everyone the news at the same time,

507
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,500
you're gonna get a lot more people interested in talking to

508
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,280
you about it than if you dole it out to one person

509
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,189
and then wait 48 hours and give it to everyone else.

510
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,189
You know, it's like it's old

511
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,829
So, so, so you've lost it.

512
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,400
If you're, if you, if your interest is in getting more people to know,

513
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,619
you know about this thing you found,

514
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,089
do it at the same time. Now, I would caution you that

515
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,430
to never give this information to reporters before the

516
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,920
agreed time when you're going to release it.

517
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,150
And, and the reason is,

518
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,150
is that asking them to hold an embargo unless you've agreed to an embargo,

519
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,349
that's not how it works.

520
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,189
They have to agree to the embargo before you tell them that information.

521
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,150
And I, I just don't think it doesn't work very well with security exploits.

522
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,489
-- It just doesn't work
-- to

523
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:45,930
-- be
-- blunt.

524
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:48,689
Josh and I have been on the receiving end of many,

525
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:52,189
many totally screwed up embargoed issues where

526
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:54,760
it just went all the way sideways and

527
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,500
unnecessarily painful and not like anything terrible happened.

528
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,069
But just,

529
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,910
wow. Did it ever make things painful?

530
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:03,010
The stories we can tell?

531
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,859
So I want to end with a fun question,

532
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:11,099
branded security vulnerabilities like heartbleed and shell shock

533
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,329
and meltdown and ghost and pick one.

534
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:18,270
What do you think are, is branding security issues a good idea or a bad idea?

535
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,030
Oh, I love that. You asked this question.

536
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:26,069
I thought it was so hokey when it first came out and I just was like, this is so so silly,

537
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,660
but I realized that as a storyteller

538
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:30,540
that

539
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:31,329
it has an

540
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,260
extreme amount of value, every single one of those words that you just said,

541
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,239
I know what you're talking about. Right?

542
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:40,119
And if you would have used some numbering system,

543
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:40,770
right.

544
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,420
So long,

545
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,719
I would not have known what you're talking about and I would have had to go look it up.

546
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:51,170
That's the way our brains work. We are. We have to have a name because

547
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:55,134
can't remember something unless it has a name and we can put it in the box right.

548
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:56,984
Once it's in that box, then we can

549
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:02,303
put all the other things in with it. So I'm I'm gonna vote for these names.

550
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:05,583
-- Yeah, I think we should keep using them. Yeah,
-- I mean, I, I do agree.

551
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:10,534
I feel like at the beginning I, I found them to be silly also, but you're right.

552
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:11,323
I don't know

553
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:13,703
the CV E for heartbleed off the top of my head,

554
00:27:13,713 --> 00:27:15,904
but obviously I know what heartbleed is and I can say

555
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:19,307
lead to you and you know exactly what I'm talking about, which is, that's cool.

556
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:22,748
-- Right. That's really cool.
-- I just looked it up. I didn't remember it either.

557
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:23,978
-- What is it?
-- What is it?

558
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,147
2014? 10160

559
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:32,677
0160 back when CB still like I feel like we run out of the zero,

560
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:34,027
the leading zero by what?

561
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:35,838
Middle of January these days?

562
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:40,618
-- Well,
-- you know, it's funny because the only CV I know off by heart is CV 2009 35

563
00:27:40,732 --> 00:27:43,871
also known as El Diablo because it affected so many vendors.

564
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:44,192
It was the,

565
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:47,462
one of the first TS protocol ones that it actually broke our

566
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:50,472
reporting system because you could only update a report 100 times and

567
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:51,712
that's it.

568
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:54,041
And we actually did that and then it broke and then

569
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:57,312
some poor guy had to retype the entire thing from scratch

570
00:27:57,491 --> 00:28:00,212
so we could keep it right. Like, keep updating it and it's

571
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:01,802
no, no, it wasn't. OK.

572
00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:03,021
But like

573
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:05,352
I just know that because this is like one of the first things

574
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:09,475
that was just, it's over 100 vendor references. Like it's a monster.

575
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:13,176
And so it's, it's just, it's like the Titanic of CV. S for me, right? That's

576
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:13,416
one.

577
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:17,156
And it's the only number I remember and, and I'm a CV guy.

578
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,635
So like, clearly these CV numbers don't work for humans.

579
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:21,946
That's true. Right? We're, we're buried in them

580
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:27,745
-- all, all Travis. You get the last word before we wrap up.
-- If you are

581
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:30,036
eager to tell your story,

582
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,979
think about it ahead of time, write it down, use those key points

583
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:40,760
and add value to reporters, meaning build a relationship early.

584
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:46,300
Think about how you can give them things that are of value and make their life easier.

585
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,359
And then when you have something that you want to share with them,

586
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:52,020
they'll be very happy to, to listen to you.

587
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,619
That's, that's fabulous. I, I love,

588
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,619
I love the concept of the storyteller that's,

589
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,630
I mean, that's what we are, right.

590
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,859
We're super intelligent monkeys that love to tell stories and that's

591
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,979
fundamentally what it all comes down to. Awesome. Ok, cool. Thank you so much.

592
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:11,680
This has been so much fun. I am, I am just giddy. I I, you have no idea how happy I am.

593
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:15,810
You came, came and talked to us today. So, so thank you so, so, so much and

594
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:18,854
we'll almost definitely have to have you back someday to tell more stories,

595
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:20,515
which is super wonderful, so cool.

596
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,984
So, thank you everyone for listening. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you Travis.
