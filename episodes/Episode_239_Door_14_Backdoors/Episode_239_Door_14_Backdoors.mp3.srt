00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,329
It's December 14th, backdoors, backdoors. No, I like this.

1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,269
This is, this is a good topic and this is just kind of,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,449
one of the more general things is backdoors in open source.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,369
Keep coming up over and over and over again. Well, backdoors in all soccer.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,770
But I think in our context we can focus on open source. But yeah.

5
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:18,084
Well, and what gets me is like,

6
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:21,854
I'm trying to think of actual good examples of like proper backdoors and

7
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:25,125
open source and they're so rare that I know there's been a few,

8
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:25,424
but

9
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:27,594
they're so rare. I can't recall them.

10
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:27,924
So,

11
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:30,305
the ones we keep seeing right now are things

12
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:34,724
like Python modules and Ruby modules and node modules.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,349
Well, that's not so much a back, well, ok, technically that's a back door.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,650
They're adding back doors.

15
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,889
So people down,

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,849
they either sometimes it's a legitimate module having bad code inserted into it.

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,849
-- Sometimes it's like a misspelled module that's purposely malicious
-- or

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,119
sometimes they compromise an account and hijack the module.

19
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:54,119
Yeah. Right. Right.

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,209
But here's the thing I think that's really important with open source is

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,909
I think generally speaking, we catch a lot of these problems.

22
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:05,000
Now, granted, you could maybe argue that there's some we're not finding in the code,

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,629
but my suspicion is there aren't very many at all.

24
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,199
I would say to those people, then if you're going to use that argument,

25
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,580
then you basically have to throw the commercial software world under the bus.

26
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:15,449
And that's my whole point is

27
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,400
you find these, these large vendors

28
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,741
are caught on a regular basis and all of them where they were

29
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:23,972
inserting backdoors for what can only

30
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:27,291
be described as extremely questionable reasons.

31
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:27,571
Well,

32
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:31,372
and what I love here is the title because I just googled Cisco backdoor because

33
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,821
I know they've had a bunch backdoors keep appearing at Cisco's in Cisco's RRS,

34
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:37,991
-- right? Not just the one, but they keep happening.
-- Right?

35
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:42,412
-- So,
-- well, here's what I would say to that. I know a lot of people from the

36
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:46,304
product security team, they're really good people and they're really bright.

37
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,094
Those back doors aren't there for nefarious purposes.

38
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:53,543
I promise you that like they were put there by someone for a reason.

39
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:53,744
Well,

40
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:55,463
what always gets me is how stupid some of these back

41
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:59,073
doors are like a 1234 admin account that should not have escaped

42
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:03,073
dev some of those, some of those I think were mistakes,

43
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,603
but there are also instances where it's proper

44
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:10,076
wasn't a mistake that a back door ended up in there.

45
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:11,395
And it's always funny because when

46
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,606
you've got these large commercial organizations,

47
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:14,555
they just be like,

48
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,156
oh, never mind, ignore it, you know,

49
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,716
pay no attention to the man behind the curtain sort of stuff.

50
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:21,046
And so the discussions often die because

51
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:23,345
there's just they don't offer any information.

52
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:27,076
Whereas I think in the world of open source, you can totally figure out what,

53
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:28,205
how did this get here?

54
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,746
-- Who did this, what happened?
-- Well, we have get

55
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:34,927
right, like pretty much everybody uses source control often signed

56
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:38,768
so we can with a high degree of certainty. Say, yeah, this line of code was due to Bob.

57
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:40,988
-- I
-- don't think I'd say often signed.

58
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:41,677
Well, not,

59
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:45,457
not often signed, but I mean, and signing is not even that important because even,

60
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:47,867
you know, you track it back to Bob and you ask Bob, did you put that code?

61
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,388
And if he goes what? No, I, what I don't recognize this.

62
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:53,557
Well, yeah, you know, Bob's account got hacked and it's, it's, it happens.

63
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,927
It's rare but it does happen.

64
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:58,440
And I think that's a big part of it is, is we have the ability

65
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:01,589
to have a conversation about it because we,

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,039
we have information and not just some binary blob, but

67
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,059
we don't even,

68
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:07,970
you know, going to IOT because we talk about IOT a lot.

69
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,220
I,

70
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,660
I am 99% certain of the IOT people are buying

71
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,289
that company did not write any of that software.

72
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,080
In most cases it is just farmed out to.

73
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:17,919
Oh, absolutely consulting firm.

74
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:20,729
And So even that company can't

75
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,929
necessarily have conversation about their software.

76
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Right. They may not have the source to it, even though they shipped it.

77
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:28,279
-- Right.
-- Well, and you read all these stories,

78
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:31,565
but all these iot companies researchers contact and it's clear

79
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:33,766
no one's in charge of security at half of them.

80
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:35,526
-- Well, why would
-- there be like, there's no, it's,

81
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:37,826
-- there's no market need
-- security costs money.

82
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:41,645
And what makes it even funnier is so, like I run Plex

83
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,356
in my, in my house

84
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:45,845
and I can connect to my plex server from

85
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:48,005
anywhere on the planet because that's how Flex works.

86
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:50,005
-- They have a connection broker. It's pretty,
-- basically.

87
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:52,285
Plex is just a giant freaking backdoor into my,

88
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,001
I'm not working.

89
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:54,171
Oh, yeah. No, I,

90
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,442
I, that's, I, when I real, like,

91
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:59,231
I love Plex and being able to view stuff remotely is awesome.

92
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:00,621
You know, I can watch it at a friend's house.

93
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,811
Like I can watch my content at a friend's house

94
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,731
and, yeah, like I just, whatever,

95
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:09,052
there's a windows 10 machine with running a giant binary blob of code on my network.

96
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:11,182
-- Right.
-- Yeah. And I have no idea what's in it. And, right.

97
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:15,451
That's Flex is the reason I don't pretend my network is secure in any way.

98
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,509
What I always love is these people go through these network security shenanigans.

99
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,319
But then it's like, wait, do you ever take your laptop to a coffee shop?

100
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,609
And they're like, yeah, of course. I do. And I'm like, well, ok, then

101
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,769
didn't we just talk about unsecured networks a couple of days ago?

102
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,209
-- It definitely wasn't
-- yesterday pretty much

103
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:34,389
anyway.

104
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:37,019
So, I guess the point is so backdoors,

105
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,688
they exist, they will always exist. We're never going to make them go away.

106
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:43,968
But I think this is, while I detest Linus's law,

107
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,359
I think backdoors and open source have the unique advantage of.

108
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:51,049
They do seem to get found very often

109
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,799
-- and very quickly, more
-- to the point.

110
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:53,980
If you're putting code into something,

111
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,010
you should be able to explain why you're adding that code.

112
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:59,859
-- Like what feature does it add? What does it do? Right.
-- And if it's, if it's github,

113
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:00,890
you can't.

114
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,619
So,

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,940
all right, we will see you on December 15th.
