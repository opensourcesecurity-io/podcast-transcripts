Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:11,050
Kurt Siefried and my partner in blaming DNS.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,100
-- Josh Pressers. It's
-- always DNS. Right.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:14,750
Yes.

4
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:16,889
And do you know why it's always DNS?

5
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,819
-- There's actually a very cute underlying issue
-- is

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,030
-- there
-- because DNS is the only globally unique

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,059
name space apart from IP addresses and IP addresses are not very useful to humans.

8
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:29,549
And that's probably fair. That's it. Like because if you want to find something,

9
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,579
well, first of all, we only have 4 billion IP S.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,540
So we share DNS, we don't share like walmart.com should

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,540
in theory only ever be walmart.com

12
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:42,111
and that's the thing is there's, and, and then as a consequence,

13
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:45,291
everything that hangs off of that email web, whatever

14
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:49,431
those can be if they choose to be globally unique. So uh github

15
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,312
is a good example of github.com/whatever

16
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:53,431
github

17
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:56,981
owns that name space and keeps it unique and to the point of being annoying where,

18
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:59,131
you know, github.com/red hat is not at all.

19
00:00:59,141 --> 00:00:59,712
Red hat.

20
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:00,942
Well, right.

21
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:02,282
Or, or same things with email address,

22
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:06,304
like you could set up an email address to forward to multiple people or whatever,

23
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,853
not be globally unique, right?

24
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,454
But, and, and you hear all those stories of people are like,

25
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:12,293
I keep getting email for somebody who's handing out this email

26
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,613
address and it's like I keep canceling the flights and like,

27
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,833
oh, I know that's, I get that every now and then.

28
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:21,234
It's so weird. Like, and I own a weird domain though. Like I have my own domain.

29
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:25,753
-- How are people using my email address accidentally?
-- Well, like if you have

30
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:25,886
um

31
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,026
for example,

32
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,875
I've seen people that believe like they don't

33
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:30,816
understand the whole.in an email address thing.

34
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,115
So a dot And that's fine.

35
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,346
But the problem is, for example,

36
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:36,596
they think that some people were claiming you could register like Jane dot

37
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:40,066
Smith at gmail.com and that was different than Jane Smith at gmail.com.

38
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,195
But the part I don't get is that they would use an

39
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:44,795
email address that like and that they wouldn't get the email.

40
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:49,225
-- And then like there,
-- this is not the topic today. We are not going down this rat hole.

41
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,720
This is part of the human condition about this

42
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,919
DNS stuff where fundamentally the biggest problem with using DNS

43
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,830
is that if you provide a service on a DNS domain,

44
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:02,930
you are now making a promise that you will always own and control,

45
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,059
maybe not own but control that DNS domain

46
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,419
forever. And of course, that doesn't happen.

47
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,539
People forget to renew people let stuff expire.

48
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,399
It used to be that domains got hijacked.

49
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:16,845
Yeah, that's harder to do now. I mean, it's still very possible, but

50
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:17,654
it's

51
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,865
so, so it used to be now. Well, ok, what is it now?

52
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:24,505
A domain expires and you have, what, like, three or six months to reclaim it?

53
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,294
Someone?

54
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:30,604
-- I thought it was a while,
-- isn't it? Usually the DS registrar will hold it for a while

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,960
and then it's gone.

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,100
And so, like,

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,820
my friend forgot to renew her DNS Domain because she

58
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,910
was working crazy long hours when the email came in

59
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,149
and like the second it expired and went up,

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,509
it got sold and like we tried to reclaim it and contact them and

61
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:45,100
you know, nothing is gone.

62
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,220
Ok? I just looked, um, so the registrar I use a lot hover,

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,684
they say most domains a period of 34 days that they will hold it

64
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:57,964
-- after a grace period
-- depends on the TLD and the registrar you're using.

65
00:02:58,014 --> 00:02:59,804
But regardless, like back in the day,

66
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:05,425
I remember waiting for domains I wanted to expire and then literally gobbling it

67
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:08,884
up like on that day it expired like the moment it was free,

68
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:10,354
it was like, wow, I got it.

69
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,279
But a great example of this is siefried

70
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,880
dot I register.org dot net

71
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,860
and I was going to register.com like the next week and, and a spammer bought it.

72
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:21,339
That's funny like this is over 20 years ago.

73
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,229
They've never done anything with it as far as I

74
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,940
know it's just sitting in some spammer domain registry.

75
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:29,619
Idly, I've tried contacting them to buy it. No luck. Right.

76
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,820
And so that's the thing, like, once you lose control of a domain name,

77
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,259
unless you're some massive company who can, like,

78
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,289
basically get cloud Fflur or somebody like that to go to bat for you.

79
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,889
It's gone.

80
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,649
Yeah. Yeah. I, I remember so fun stories.

81
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,089
You know, we have open source security dot IO. It's where we crossed all our stuff.

82
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:48,429
I tried to buy open source security.org for a Bitcoin a couple of years ago and, like,

83
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,809
the person would not take it.

84
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,169
I'm like, this is back then. I think it was, I think it was 20 grand

85
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,759
is what

86
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,279
is worth and I had it and they would not take it.

87
00:03:56,289 --> 00:04:00,539
I'm like, holy crap, what the heck is wrong with you? Like open source security.org.

88
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,919
-- It's never had anything on
-- it. Yeah. It's names pro dot C A.

89
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:07,139
-- It's a domain park and, and
-- it's funny because the Rando is like, oh, yeah,

90
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:09,820
I'll take that and then literally two hours later they're like, no,

91
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,740
I can't accept this.

92
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,050
I'm like, what, what is wrong with you?

93
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,089
Yeah. For real. It was insane.

94
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,149
-- Anyway, anyway,
-- anything over, like, three or four figures.

95
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:19,980
I know. Right.

96
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:20,380
I'm like,

97
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,450
I figured for sure this was like a done deal

98
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:25,410
and I could finally have that domain and no,

99
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,369
no, nothing.

100
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:27,329
So, anyway,

101
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:30,920
ok, we have a topic that is not us rambling about DNS.

102
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,959
Then it's this uh who is server story that is making the rounds.

103
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,670
The article or the blog that was published

104
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,760
from Watchtower,

105
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:45,549
which tower spelled funny Watchtower labs is we spent $20 to

106
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:49,260
achieve R ce and accidentally became the admins of dot Movie.

107
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:50,480
So let's back it up in the moment.

108
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:54,130
So there's DNA registrars who, you know, run a top level domain.

109
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:54,839
Yeah. Yeah.

110
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:59,559
And they basically have typically one core function which is to take your money

111
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,809
and provide a DNS clue record for like food dot

112
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,489
Mobi points at these IP S that are serving it.

113
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:09,570
Another common feature that they're historically

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,209
uh supposed to provide

115
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:16,750
is a who is server and who is, is literally a command called who is one word, no space.

116
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,549
And like if you do who is see.org,

117
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,630
it'll basically, well back in the day,

118
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,079
it would have actually told you who owns it

119
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,929
and like what their street address was and their,

120
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,829
you know, abuse and

121
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,670
all of that is behind privacy stuff now because people used to

122
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,070
grab the who is domain and like span the bejesus out of all of us. And

123
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:34,459
-- so now it's all privacy registrations
-- and and it should also

124
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,700
be noted that the who is info is required by icann.

125
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,429
Yes.

126
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,910
According to icann, which I don't, I forget what icann stands for,

127
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,070
but it's basically the organization behind like all of the DNS magic.

128
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,940
And icann says, if you lie in your who is info, we will take your domain from you.

129
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,190
I don't know if they ever have,

130
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,869
but that's the threat they hand out constantly because I get the

131
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,619
notices for all my domains.

132
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,670
Like, what, once every couple of months or so, once a quarter maybe.

133
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,329
-- Yeah,
-- the reminders to update your address. And I'm like, I still live at 12345. Ave.

134
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,839
Well, no, I, I just use, um, this is one of the reasons I,

135
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,010
I use hover as my registrar is they were they let me do free

136
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,809
privacy shield whenever they call the where they fill in their info instead of mine

137
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,200
for the who is info.

138
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,869
They did that for free back when everyone else was paying for it.

139
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,269
I, I suspect it's free everywhere now, but I'm too lazy to ever move.

140
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,309
I just put in fake data all the time because how are they going to validate my address?

141
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:32,869
-- I
-- don't know, I don't want to risk that. Kurt, I'm unwilling to, to

142
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,709
have that kind of responsibility on my head.

143
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,459
So literally the who is

144
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:42,239
command on a UNIX system has like a little database of like here's a bunch of

145
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,109
top level domains and here's the who is server to to go talk to it,

146
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:46,609
right?

147
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,369
And in true classic business fashion, Moby forgot to or not Moby rather,

148
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,720
but whoever runs the who is server for Mobi

149
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,829
like forgot to renew the DNS.

150
00:06:57,429 --> 00:06:58,779
And so Yeah, researchers,

151
00:06:58,929 --> 00:06:59,209
yeah,

152
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,700
registered the DNS

153
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,929
and set up a who is server that could, you know,

154
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,700
return funny ask yard pictures or whatever.

155
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,140
Well, and there was, uh, one of the PHP apps has a real control execution

156
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,619
-- in it
-- because who is data is trustworthy. It comes from a trusted source.

157
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,010
Well, that's just it. Exactly. Like if I was writing a who is client, I would

158
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,329
incorrectly assume

159
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,739
that there are no malicious who is servers.

160
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:25,329
I would assume that there's always

161
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,709
because the who is protocol is not

162
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,269
like secure.

163
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,739
I don't know that I'm just a random developer writing a who is server in PHP

164
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,640
or who is client in PHP. Like

165
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,049
here's the thing like we're broken security.

166
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,230
People think weird normal developers aren't gonna be like,

167
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:45,369
what if the who is server is malicious?

168
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,170
-- What would happen? Then they're gonna be like whatever this is
-- the who is,

169
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:49,269
it's fine

170
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,790
or a person in the middle attack or whatever,

171
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,850
right. So, anyway, anyway,

172
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,559
so I'm, we're not going to recount all the details of this whole thing.

173
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,399
Well, there are, that's it, there are no details. They, they let the domain.

174
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:04,559
Well, there's, it's the story is interesting. They weave a thrilling tale.

175
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,750
-- Well, you have to because it's pretty boring. Otherwise
-- it is kind of boring.

176
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,089
They're good storytellers, which is great.

177
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,920
But here's the thing I've been thinking about and I put this on Mastodon is,

178
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,910
does this really matter?

179
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:16,549
And

180
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm gonna frame my thinking of this.

181
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,890
I know it's easy to be like, does this matter be like, oh, whatever, grandpa, shut up.

182
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,279
You always say that. But,

183
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,390
so here's the thing.

184
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,519
So this feels really bad because the internet is big

185
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,320
and

186
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:33,440
every time there's some sort of weird corner case bug,

187
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,130
it's easy to sensationalize it.

188
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,719
And I don't think, does this have a name?

189
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,080
Um, who knows?

190
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,210
I don't know, Moby for

191
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,150
Shell or something,

192
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,609
but who is for Shell? Who is Moby? Who is Moby? Oh my. Who

193
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,049
is Mo

194
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,099
Mo?

195
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:47,820
Anyway,

196
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,809
young people don't know. Look at Moby. He's a singer pretty good.

197
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:51,960
Um Anyway,

198
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,580
so

199
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,299
you actually got the joke. That's awesome.

200
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:58,809
-- Well,
-- yeah, because we're freaking old, like, because we lived through Moby. Moby.

201
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,849
Still look while I'm talking, look at the Mo

202
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:02,190
is still performing. So, anyway,

203
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:04,580
so here's the thing, right? This sounds important.

204
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,940
But the reality is like,

205
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,460
-- what can attacker really do with this in a meaningful way? I have
-- an answer for you.

206
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,380
-- Is Moby still on the road?
-- I

207
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:13,809
-- don't
-- know.

208
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,179
-- I keep getting things for bike stores and stuff.
-- I asked you one question.

209
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,809
Sorry. Uh, Moby singer, I guess

210
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,409
he's still, wow. He looks old. He's older than us.

211
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,090
Uh, uh, when was he born? Oh, wow. Yeah, he's born in 65.

212
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,460
-- Yeah. And I mean, he still looks like he's still cranking out stuff.
-- Good. Right on.

213
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,869
Good for you movie. Ok. Anyway. So we've got

214
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,150
this sort of thing

215
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,880
and the question is gonna be, is it, is it important?

216
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,010
And I don't think it's unimportant, but this feels like

217
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:43,989
it can

218
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:45,840
by itself, it's probably

219
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:50,289
relatively harmless. Let's say it needs to be part of something bigger.

220
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,739
And what I mean by that is, let's say I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

221
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,580
my analogy will be based in the real world.

222
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,770
There's the old saying,

223
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,979
like you can put on a hard hat and carry a clipboard and you can go anywhere

224
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,330
and that's generally been proven true, right.

225
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,369
There are tons of people that have proven you can do this right?

226
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,099
Go to a sporting event, go to whatever.

227
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,169
So let's say I have nefarious intent

228
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:10,859
getting into the venue is step one

229
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,640
and I can probably accomplish that without issue.

230
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,320
But then taking my nefarious actions after that,

231
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,890
it's now I have other security hurdles.

232
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,059
I need to get over

233
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,229
in order to accomplish whatever my goal is.

234
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:26,280
And I think this is a similar thing like by itself,

235
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,510
this is probably not a big deal because it's just going to be part

236
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,039
of something bigger and hopefully we can catch the bigger thing along the way.

237
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:35,869
So I'm not saying we should ignore problems like this,

238
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,109
but I don't think it's world ending either.

239
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:40,650
No, but the problem with catching the thing along the way is

240
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,229
there's like thousands or millions or whoever knows

241
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,909
how many clients deciding to use that.

242
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,520
Who is server? Yes, you can't fix them all or get them all to behave also.

243
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,539
Correct what this would actually be.

244
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,190
Basically, there's two real things you could do with this.

245
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
Number one, you could serve malicious,

246
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:55,549
whoa data and compromise those remote sites.

247
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,099
Sure. You know, because there

248
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:01,362
most whose clients I'm guessing are not very robust. Right.

249
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:03,672
And number two certificate authorities,

250
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:06,343
a lot of certificate authorities will issue you a certificate

251
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:08,023
and you have to prove you control the domain.

252
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,072
And there's a couple ways to prove you control the domain.

253
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,672
One is with the DNS record, one is with a web record.

254
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:14,622
Another one is through an email address.

255
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:17,682
-- Now, how do we find out what email address is in charge of a domain?
-- Right?

256
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:19,502
-- I mean, the who is info obviously?
-- Right.

257
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:20,232
Yeah, exactly.

258
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:20,812
And

259
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,495
there used to be some historical ones like root

260
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,536
and host master or postmaster that they would use.

261
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:26,216
But then we discovered that that's a bad idea

262
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:30,796
because modern systems don't have those as reserved for admins

263
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:33,176
as much anymore as they used to. And like

264
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:35,846
I have, that's one of my checks. When I check an email services.

265
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:38,705
Can I, can I be host master? I would like that email address

266
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,786
and some will tell me to take a hike and some will be like,

267
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,486
oh, that's already taken or some will be like, sure, here you go.

268
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:48,809
You know, it's like the time I took local host as my host name of my uh ISP.

269
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,630
And then my network fell over. Right. Good job.

270
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:52,549
Yeah, it was funny.

271
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,450
Then they put that on the reserve list so that this could

272
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,789
definitely be part of either remote code execution in bad clients or

273
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,645
getting certificates for daunt mo

274
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:03,775
sites. And then,

275
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:08,255
-- but again, and then more nefarious things. Right.
-- Right. And that, that's my point.

276
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:09,715
Like there's a, there's a step too now,

277
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:12,854
granted a lot of these places that you could attack,

278
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:16,414
probably have zero protections against

279
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:19,174
any of this stuff. They're, they're not monitoring anything,

280
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,400
they're not using

281
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,780
any sort of software to watch for nefarious activity like nothing. Right.

282
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:27,710
Well, more to the point if I now

283
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,030
am controlling the who is and I'm, and I managed to get a certificate.

284
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,830
Well, I can do a man in the middle attack legitimately.

285
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,390
-- No,
-- you

286
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,219
can't.

287
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,270
What do you mean? No, I can't. I have the certificate.

288
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,840
-- Uh
-- How are you going to man in the middle? Anyone?

289
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,919
Like a man in the middle attack?

290
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:49,330
-- It is
-- on a Wi Fi network on through what was part of other things?

291
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,650
No, no. Look here. OK.

292
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:56,369
I, I'm going to say this and, and like send the hate to Kurt if you like, but

293
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,880
man in the middle or, or what are we calling man? A person in the middle?

294
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:00,950
I don't recall him anymore.

295
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,270
Like I know man in the middle is frowned upon but those attacks, right.

296
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,950
Those interceptions style attacks

297
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:06,950
are

298
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,950
very hard today, even

299
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,989
with like the whole, oh, I'll use a wireless network. No,

300
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,669
no, it doesn't work that way anymore.

301
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,359
-- Like there are, well, it
-- would be part of a targeted attack.

302
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,729
-- It wouldn't be some,
-- not just a targeted attack.

303
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:22,260
Kurt, you're talking about a highly resourced attacker here

304
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:24,489
because in order to actually

305
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,669
intercept

306
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:26,799
and

307
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,479
stop traffic and then pass it along and, and kind of be in the middle.

308
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,400
You're talking about like

309
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:38,080
someone is in the ISP type event, right? This is not trivial at this point.

310
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,989
I mean, it was easier when we had like open Wi Fi

311
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,380
and we had no encryption, everything was hubs and networks and stuff like that.

312
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,260
But it is.

313
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:45,900
Well,

314
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,085
no, we had encryption on Wi Fi but everybody had the same key.

315
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:52,474
Well, there's sure. But, but you know what I'm saying? Like

316
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,015
that is not

317
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:56,844
a, I'm not saying it's an attack we should ignore,

318
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:01,054
but I don't think it's a practical attack for the vast majority of Attackers.

319
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,909
I would agree. Right.

320
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:03,619
But

321
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,369
we're saying like, what could this be part of?

322
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,169
Well, that's what it would be typically part of. Right.

323
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,159
That's why you would want to get fake certificates.

324
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,010
Well, not fake certificates, they're real certificates just for the wrong person.

325
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,330
-- I think
-- what's more valuable from a certificate

326
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,010
perspective actually isn't even getting a fake certificate necessarily

327
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,309
is that

328
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:23,719
you could get a certificate for something that looks really close

329
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:26,869
to like, like, for example, like the, the, this was dot Moby,

330
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,559
like

331
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,320
Apple dot Moby, right?

332
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,849
If you sent people there and it looked just like the Apple site, they'd be like, oh,

333
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:34,989
it's just Apple doing something weird, you know, or whatever.

334
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:39,880
Well, you can already do that because it's not like cas have. That's true.

335
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:44,030
It's not like, like when you register a business in most of the world, they do a

336
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,369
business name search, not just for like that exact name, but for sounds like names.

337
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,809
And

338
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:52,820
you can actually have apple plumbing, apple computers.

339
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,630
As long as there's like enough distinction, they'll generally allow it. Right?

340
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,380
-- Because apple doesn't get to own the word apple forever and always like too
-- bad.

341
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,659
I have a fun fact for you.

342
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:03,489
So I live in Green Bay, Wisconsin and I think I've told this before.

343
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,299
There is a store here called the Apple Store.

344
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,929
And it has been here since the fifties and they sell like apples from trees.

345
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,909
And it's always funny because if you look at like the Yelp reviews and stuff,

346
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,729
people like this isn't an apple store.

347
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,890
They sell fruit. It's like, yes

348
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,590
they do.

349
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:20,219
And they've been selling it for like 50 plus years at

350
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:23,210
this location and they're never gonna give this name up.

351
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,590
-- Like
-- Hungry Jack in uh Australia, you know, there's

352
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,010
Burger King. So now you gotta go to Hungry Jack's. If you want your whopper.

353
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:30,169
-- And,
-- and I, I just,

354
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,119
I love that like David and Goliath dynamic of like this is obviously just like some

355
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,140
crazy old person at this point.

356
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,469
That's like just fighting the good fight because they can

357
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,179
even for a reason.

358
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:43,940
But um so back to this, that's the challenge with DNS is like,

359
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,950
I've known people that have not renewed their DNS or somehow lost control of it.

360
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,260
And for us, mere mortals it's gone forever. Yes, for sure.

361
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,830
Like they're like, I've been trying to get seafood.com

362
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:58,645
back kind of for 2025 years on and off. It'll, yeah, it'll literally never happen.

363
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:01,005
It's not even parked, it's just like it's registered,

364
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:03,236
but there's nothing associated with it as far as I can tell.

365
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:04,716
And so

366
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,255
that I really,

367
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:08,265
it always drives me nuts when people talk about

368
00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:10,056
digital sovereignty on a personal level and they're like,

369
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:12,835
oh, just get your own domain name and host your own services or whatever, blah, blah,

370
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:12,995
blah.

371
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,395
And then you can pick and choose and move.

372
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:17,476
Well, for somebody like me and Josh are a lot of our show listeners.

373
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,521
Yeah, we have the expertise to do that,

374
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:22,671
but most people don't and they probably don't have the

375
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,851
money to pay for the DNS to pay for,

376
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:25,041
you know,

377
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,361
Google workspace because it's not like you can hook

378
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:29,081
a domain in up to your free Gmail account,

379
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:29,202
right?

380
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,731
You need to pay for Google workspace,

381
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,812
right. Yeah. Yeah. They used to give it away for free.

382
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:37,211
-- Yeah.
-- You used to be able to get free Google Domain, whatever.

383
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:37,762
And,

384
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:38,932
and I had a bunch of those but they've

385
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:41,392
all sort of since grandfathered out and expired.

386
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,119
Yeah.

387
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,919
I think you still have one that's kind of quasi

388
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,979
-- free. Or did they? Finally?
-- Mine's not free.

389
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:49,409
No, I, I converted it to a proper paid account because

390
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,849
I became very concerned that by staying on the free plan,

391
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:54,750
I was going to have too many problems.

392
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,210
Whereas in my mind,

393
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,729
I feel like if I'm paying them money

394
00:16:58,979 --> 00:16:59,760
they will

395
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,520
maybe read my email,

396
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,820
maybe not accidentally delete you.

397
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,439
Right. Right. I

398
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:05,989
like that

399
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,699
one.

400
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,050
Yeah. But I mean, so, so in all seriousness. So this is also the reason

401
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,660
that I use a domain registrar

402
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,040
separate from Google and all the other call providers because, like,

403
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,780
if Google for some reason decides I violated their terms of service,

404
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:20,500
like, wipe out rest.net,

405
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:22,688
I still have control of the domain,

406
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,638
I can move it somewhere else versus if they're the registrar,

407
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:26,858
-- I'm probably sol
-- at

408
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:27,298
-- that point
-- a

409
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:28,358
-- 100
-- percent.

410
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:29,168
Yeah.

411
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,688
And the problem too is like, you can't,

412
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:32,948
how do you talk to them because your email address doesn't work anymore.

413
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:35,088
-- That is a good point actually, like, really
-- thought about that.

414
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,838
And that's something my friend has is where her

415
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,088
old email address is hooked up to our Apple account

416
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:39,750
and

417
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,000
you can't

418
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,739
change it because Apple emails you a confirmation

419
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,459
which is totally

420
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:46,439
not going anywhere.

421
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:48,939
And like, even on the phone, they're like, yeah, we'll email you a confirmation.

422
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:49,520
It's just like,

423
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:50,290
that's

424
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:51,500
the problem.

425
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,489
I love it when that kind of stuff happens. All right. All right.

426
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,810
Anyway, back to this movie thing.

427
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,180
-- I don't want to keep, we keep going down the, the DNS rat hole because it's
-- well,

428
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:01,010
but it also speaks to how most companies build business

429
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,900
process around the assumption that you own this domain name.

430
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,790
You will always own this domain name and there will never be a problem

431
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:10,380
and they don't handle it very well either themselves losing it.

432
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,680
-- But
-- why would you handle it?

433
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:14,780
-- Well, why, why
-- are, well, because people do lose these domain names.

434
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,180
Not that often though.

435
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:16,530
I mean,

436
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,640
I don't think it's a common enough occurrence that you

437
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,199
can really justify planning for that in any meaningful way.

438
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:25,079
Well, a simple thing like having a backup email address.

439
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,479
-- So that on a different domain, I mean,
-- yeah, but that's,

440
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,280
that's something different obviously.

441
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,560
And, and I actually do have that for what it's worth.

442
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,650
But because I back in the day I got Josh dot Resor at gmail.com

443
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,410
and I log into it like once a year to clean up the spam

444
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,459
and then it's just there in case I ever need it for anything.

445
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:44,180
But anyway, ok, so here's the deal, right?

446
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:48,180
We've got this, these security researchers, they find this clever bug.

447
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:51,579
Well, it's not a bug. It's just, it's a, it's, the DNS expired.

448
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,349
And so they registered it, like, let's assume there's an embassy in a major city

449
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,859
and they decide to move to a new location.

450
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,579
And so they moved to the new location and the old location goes up for lease.

451
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:02,930
Well, I could lease it

452
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:05,420
and put up a flag and put up the signs and,

453
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,030
you know, a bad accent

454
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,630
and I'm guessing a lot of people like your apple store,

455
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,500
people would go to the old location because that's, you know,

456
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,689
what if that's illegal?

457
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,869
How's that illegal? Is it?

458
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,959
Well, I mean, that's

459
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:19,069
about it.

460
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,109
Maybe.

461
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,430
I mean, there's laws against Impersonating certain,

462
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,050
like officials and things like that.

463
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:27,030
Well, ok, but ignoring all that, the point is there's,

464
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,680
there are sort of this happens in the real world where businesses,

465
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,660
uh, a business fails or closes and some other business grabs that kind of good name.

466
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,189
Yeah. Yeah. Uh Oh, perfect example.

467
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,560
There's a big company out here I think I mentioned before called Standard General.

468
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:44,400
And they do paving and parking lots and road building.

469
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,160
Like they're a massive construction company, right? Big legit.

470
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,069
Like we're talking probably a couple of 1000 people

471
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,989
and there's some dude in Nova Scotia,

472
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,579
I think it was who called his company Standard

473
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:56,420
General because then on the web searches and stuff,

474
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,420
it shows us having a good review and of course he's a total scam artist and like,

475
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,290
there's a ton of incidents with him

476
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,250
and, you know,

477
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,489
so he's trading on Standard General's good name

478
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,510
and because it's in a different province like

479
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,949
that was allowed.

480
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:08,849
And so

481
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,969
the thing is as a, as a business say, like in Alberta,

482
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:16,130
I'm not going to bother to register my business name in all 10 provinces,

483
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,290
I guess.

484
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:19,920
Or what about every city? You know, like

485
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,349
at some point, I just sort of give up like

486
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,449
I've done defensive registrations of cloud security lines dot A bunch of stuff,

487
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,050
but there's over 2000 tl Ds now. So like I'm not doing them all.

488
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:30,920
I don't have time for it

489
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,079
for sure. I did.

490
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:32,584
I

491
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:38,104
mean, ok, look, I don't think that is a reasonable comparison. In this case.

492
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:38,944
I think

493
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:43,425
there are legal mechanisms for dealing with some of these situations,

494
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:44,604
maybe not in Canada.

495
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:47,305
But I know like in the US, you have things like trademark law.

496
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:48,405
Yeah,

497
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,979
you can register a trademark and a DNS name can be part of a trademark.

498
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:58,170
-- Like that is what happens sometimes,
-- but a trademark is more specific.

499
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,229
And so for example,

500
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:03,380
you can still have apple dot whatever and be an Apple store online and Apple,

501
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,650
depending on the jurisdiction

502
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:06,594
may have to pound sand and that's the other prompt.

503
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:07,675
Remembers this is global,

504
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:12,114
it is global and we're in a hole because this is completely unrelated, I think.

505
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,635
-- But
-- it is, it's it's DNS is a global system.

506
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,015
OK. No, no, I don't want to talk about DNS. I want, I want to rope us all the way back.

507
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,675
I want to, I want to ask this, right.

508
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,540
So these researchers publish this blog and they

509
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,420
even kind of towards the bottom of it.

510
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,920
They talk about, you know,

511
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,839
there, I'll just read this paragraph.

512
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:32,119
It says we continue to hold concerns around the basic reality.

513
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,270
We found this on a whim in a hotel room while escaping the Vegas heat surrounding

514
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,829
black hat while well resourced and focused nation

515
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,979
states look for loopholes like this every day.

516
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,790
In our opinion,

517
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,359
we are not likely to be the last to find inexcusable flaws in such a crucial process.

518
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:47,030
Well,

519
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,482
more to the point, DNS

520
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,832
and spammers have been doing this for over a decade where

521
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:55,802
a popular DNS Domain lapses and they grab it within seconds,

522
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:56,401
right?

523
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,812
Like this is not a new thing. This is

524
00:21:58,932 --> 00:22:03,251
-- like I let domains lapse and, and then they get snapped up,
-- stop it.

525
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:04,871
You keep going back to DNS.

526
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,041
Here's my question.

527
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:10,641
-- Is this an inexcusable process by the Moby people so
-- well,

528
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:15,343
first comment is so Mobi outsource they who is server to somebody else that or

529
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,884
they basically did such a terrible job running it that they let

530
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:21,473
the DNS for it lapse and didn't notice like to put it bluntly

531
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,173
to put it bluntly, they're at DNS registrar,

532
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:27,014
maintaining control of DNS should be a core competency.

533
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:28,644
-- That's all I got. Ok.
-- Here it is.

534
00:22:28,654 --> 00:22:30,303
Uh we discovered that a few years ago the who

535
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:32,514
is server for the dot Mobi TLD migrated from?

536
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:39,323
Who is 0.0 my goodness. It's who is dot Then dot Moby registry.net. So there's li

537
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:43,786
the letters dot After a dot Which is someone

538
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,306
thought they were clever when they did that.

539
00:22:45,316 --> 00:22:45,806
-- I'm
-- sure.

540
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:49,206
No, because it probably was grabbed. The other one was probably already taken.

541
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:52,406
Oh, that could be. So anyway, to who is dot Nick dot Moby?

542
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:57,235
And then obviously the the old domain expired,

543
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:59,365
but lots of things were still using it.

544
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:00,446
That and, and

545
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:05,526
now the question is like, is this the fault of the dot Moby people for not just keeping

546
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:08,208
the domain forever because of what they did?

547
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:11,228
-- It's
-- like when Microsoft bought the corp.com thing, right?

548
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:12,848
It's cheaper for Microsoft just to buy that

549
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,937
domain and make sure no shenanigans happen than

550
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:17,858
-- it is to deal with all the support calls if an attacker grabs it and
-- does

551
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:18,848
I agree with that?

552
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,927
-- And we, we did a whole show about corp.com, didn't
-- we?

553
00:23:21,937 --> 00:23:27,078
If a DNS registrar can't register and control a domain name?

554
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:29,277
I kind of got to wonder about their competency.

555
00:23:29,427 --> 00:23:31,667
-- I mean,
-- that's a good point. I won't argue with that.

556
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:33,598
That's right like that.

557
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:34,550
Yeah.

558
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:35,010
Yeah.

559
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,469
-- Ok. Ok. I'll accept that.
-- And so for example, we have the

560
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,000
name.

561
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,949
Oh, perfect example,

562
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:43,439
we have a piece of documentation at the CS A where somebody mentioned a domain name.

563
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:43,959
And I'm like,

564
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,750
when did we buy that domain name?

565
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:46,760
We didn't

566
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,589
and we used it as an example.

567
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,310
And so I'm like, well,

568
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,709
I better go register that and grab it

569
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,520
because it's in an official piece of documentation.

570
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,810
We're telling people something, something,

571
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:56,319
this domain name and I don't want people going there

572
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:58,719
and seeing like a porn site or something.

573
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,630
Like, remember the Heinz QR code thing where Heinz did a QR code

574
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:04,270
and it went

575
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,640
anyways, it ended up going to a porn site,

576
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,319
you know, I don't remember that. But that's pretty funny.

577
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:10,219
Let me

578
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:10,390
just

579
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,050
let the

580
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:13,380
intern generate the QR code and no one checked it.

581
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,050
Uh Yeah, Heinz says sorry for ketchup QR code that links to porn back in 2015.

582
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,219
Mine's like a trap. Everything's in there.

583
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,729
It may not be useful but it's in there.

584
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,699
Well, also I'm, I'm a Heinz ketchup person.

585
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:29,229
-- I
-- could
-- not tell you what kind of ketchup I have in my

586
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:29,949
favorite. It's the mouth

587
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:33,890
-- feel. It's got that just, it's got that richness. It's good.
-- I literally don't care

588
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,180
as long as my ketchup tastes good. I'm fine.

589
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,439
Yeah,

590
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:39,060
but um see that's the thing, right? Like it

591
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,670
on a does this attack really matter?

592
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,400
No,

593
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,709
but do I want to avoid having to deal with apologizing

594
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,849
for a porn site being linked from one of our documents.

595
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,180
-- Yes.
-- Yes, I agree with that. Yes.

596
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,800
Does it cost a few bucks a year to maintain and keep that registry up?

597
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,160
Yeah. It's kind of annoying but in the long term it's way less

598
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:02,599
-- than having to deal with a porn site there.
-- That's a good point. That's a good point.

599
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,189
It,

600
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,859
yeah.

601
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:08,790
Yeah, it's definitely, it, it's probably a signal for competency in the MO

602
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,719
-- TLD
-- fail.

603
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:10,719
But if you own a mobile

604
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:14,619
-- domain, what choice do you have?
-- I mean, there's, there's also the issue of like,

605
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,020
I wonder how many

606
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,040
instances of things like this exist where there are expired domains

607
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:22,010
that are referenced in

608
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:27,160
-- some sort of tool or document or whatever
-- for, I have an exact example for you.

609
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,239
The CWE database. I went through it

610
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,239
and I grabbed a bunch of domains that had

611
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,479
expired that were linked from the CWE database.

612
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,199
What do they link for?

613
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:37,520
Like I don't understand

614
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,260
-- like
-- for sources in C in CV E sorry. When I said CW si mean CV es oh CV

615
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,390
E oh man. Yeah,

616
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,599
like what 30% of those

617
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,439
references are dead, right?

618
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,280
-- Um Well, no, I registered the domain names. They work now.
-- Not all of them.

619
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,339
Well, no, but a bunch of them.

620
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:56,800
It was, it was several, there was quite a few links actually.

621
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,089
How many are getting hit? Do you have logs?

622
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:03,060
-- Uh I don't know, I don't, they're not set up for anything.
-- You should log that.

623
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,119
That sounds interesting.

624
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,739
But because part of it is I, I,

625
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,439
at various points have downloaded every reference link in the CV E database.

626
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:10,650
Yeah. And like,

627
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:15,040
a lot of them are dead in the sense of they go to, like, a marketing web page.

628
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:16,839
Yeah, I, I remember

629
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,609
you told me about this. It was like 20 or 30%. Right. It's,

630
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:20,800
-- no, no,
-- no, no, no,

631
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,319
it's far more because we're just gonna pretend like

632
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:26,140
all of sun.com just got deleted from the database.

633
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,420
Yeah, that's true. There were a lot of those

634
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,670
and all the old, almost all the old references are like just gone now.

635
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,079
Tons of that stuff.

636
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:37,760
Yeah. Uh Yeah, I got rid of all those domains that were uh

637
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:40,819
that were uh from. Yeah, I just let them expire.

638
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,420
Um Now someone else can register them. Exactly.

639
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,079
But yeah, see,

640
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:47,219
and that's the thing this is trivial to do because literally

641
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:50,099
all you do is you find something referencing domain names.

642
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,685
-- Well, no, it's
-- not. Ok. It's trivial to do, but the outcome is not trivial.

643
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:57,415
I think there's probably very limited value

644
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:00,094
in a lot of this, which is why it doesn't get more attention.

645
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:03,155
But we see this with domain parking where you make a type in

646
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,994
a domain name and you end up with some crappy parking site that like

647
00:27:06,155 --> 00:27:07,694
is trying to make some ad revenue.

648
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:08,694
-- Yeah,
-- I also like

649
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:13,775
github. I often do go to gihub.com because I can't type.

650
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:16,359
Yeah. And, and it's not github.

651
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,520
-- It brings me to some crappy shopping site.
-- Oh.

652
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:24,640
Oh, interesting. Uh, chrome popped up for a second. Did you mean github.com?

653
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:25,660
Ok.

654
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,750
But then that went away and it loaded the webpage

655
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,599
and, oh,

656
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,300
apparently my computer has all the internet herpes and

657
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,280
I need to contact this 1 800 number.

658
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,199
-- Oh,
-- yeah. It's like

659
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:36,535
random. It's, it, it goes to like, different things.

660
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:38,744
It's some sort of weird shopping aggregator thing.

661
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:41,275
I think that just sends you to probably affiliate links.

662
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:46,114
I get a um what I get a windows.net site claiming that I

663
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,734
have Windows defender security center and to call this 1 800 number.

664
00:27:49,744 --> 00:27:50,185
All right, github

665
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:54,114
dot com from Firefox. And this one's blocking me,

666
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,380
you block origin is blocking it.

667
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,770
I will proceed. Thank you. You block origin.

668
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,510
-- Oh, now it went to star choice
-- wise, staffing.

669
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:04,050
This is

670
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,280
ok. This is not, no, we are not ending like this.

671
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,579
All right, we're done talking about.com or whatever it is. So ok. So here's the deal.

672
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:13,699
Here's what I find. Interesting.

673
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,010
Yes, it is a problem. Yes.

674
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,650
It almost exists in probably hundreds or thousands

675
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,500
of places that are using expired domains.

676
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,810
But I also think

677
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:26,890
the, the potential badness is low at the moment.

678
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,709
It doesn't mean it will stay low forever. It is very conceivable.

679
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:32,329
Something incredibly important could expire

680
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,089
that there are, there's something we haven't thought of yet. There's some novel

681
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:37,849
attacker we haven't thought of yet.

682
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,140
Well, or a major company forgets to

683
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,579
like we have documented cases where major companies have

684
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,569
like fallen over for a day or two.

685
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,089
Well,

686
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,050
Microsoft let hotmail.com expire once and then like some Rando

687
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,489
registered it just so they could get their email back.

688
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,130
Like then they gave it to Microsoft. I mean,

689
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,010
now, but like here's an, if that happened again,

690
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:01,930
I'm pretty confident Microsoft could get that back

691
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,709
either through legal or just be like,

692
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,030
here's a bag of freaking money.

693
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,130
Give us our domain back type things.

694
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:10,099
Well, no, they, they just threaten the other registrars and stuff. And like

695
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:13,040
the part of the problem is this goes back to that kind of classic.

696
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,250
If you know who to talk to at the place, they can fix it for you right away

697
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:19,300
and you see that like all those threads on hacker news where somebody announces

698
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,660
like I have this problem with youtube or I have this problem with Gmail.

699
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,739
Who do I talk to or? Well, heck on Mastodon where like Jerry Bell is like, uh,

700
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,459
what was the pizza place that he wanted to contact for? Cosmos?

701
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:30,689
Pizza, something like that.

702
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,660
I don't know if that was serious though. Was that real? I think that was a joke.

703
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,449
I don't know.

704
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:38,790
But I've seen that where I've literally had people come to me and they're like,

705
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,430
like for some Canadian thing. And I'm like, I don't know. Tom in Toronto.

706
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,180
Like, come on,

707
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,359
all Canadians know each other. Kurt. Come on.

708
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:48,660
Like, we're contractually obligated.

709
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,500
There's what, like, a couple 100 people in Canada, like, it's fine.

710
00:29:53,569 --> 00:29:54,550
But that's the thing. Right.

711
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,270
Like, so it's kind of like that where, yeah,

712
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,010
if you know the process and the people to talk to you can fix it very easily.

713
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,849
But for the rest of us we're, we're up the creek without a paddle,

714
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,380
for sure, for sure. And then, I don't know, I guess here's the thing,

715
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,469
this will be interesting to watch, but I don't think it is world ending.

716
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,900
It is good research.

717
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,510
Like good job Watchtower folks that this was a great find like

718
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,969
DNS Parkers have been doing this for 2030 years like this is,

719
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,260
yes, it's not new, it's not new for sure, for sure. But I love when people

720
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,099
take something like this to the next level and then talk about it because just saying

721
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:31,739
we bought this domain, we'd be like big freaking deal.

722
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:36,219
Now. Now, granted, I'm also glad they didn't try to turn this into a spectacle.

723
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:37,050
It is not

724
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:40,650
because you do get that too where people are like, oh, look at this research.

725
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,099
I did and look like I'm gonna like,

726
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:45,319
hack the planet with this and the world is going to light on fire and it's like,

727
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:46,339
uh probably not,

728
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,459
I don't know. It's interesting. It's fun to watch.

729
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:50,500
It's fun to talk about, but I also don't think

730
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,459
this is

731
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:54,543
a world ending event and I have a suspicion

732
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:58,813
even though it's always DNS and even though DNS sucks and has tons of problems,

733
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:02,473
there's, it, it's really only the stepping stone to something bigger.

734
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:05,354
And hopefully we have protections in place that

735
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,634
will prevent the next step or maybe the

736
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:10,693
step after that or the step after that because there is no such thing as,

737
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,494
like most attacks are not like one and done, right?

738
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,473
You need, you need multiple steps and that's, that's how you catch people.

739
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:19,394
The thing is there are those like one and done attack

740
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:23,317
like the, the what was it the, the recent like various TCP packet,

741
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:26,047
ping things and windows and Linux that could cause code execution.

742
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:29,287
-- So they do happen. They, they,
-- yes they do. But

743
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:31,057
-- this is not
-- it walk for

744
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:33,758
she is a great example of like you just fire off this packet,

745
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:36,098
well, a couple of packets of the web server and like

746
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:37,208
go to execution

747
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:41,767
no big deal. What's interesting is in CWE there is ac we

748
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:46,208
dash 350 reliance on reverse DNS resolution for security critical action

749
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:47,338
because again, Attackers

750
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:48,761
control reverse DNS,

751
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:49,682
right?

752
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,421
So the trick is you have to do reverse DNS,

753
00:31:51,432 --> 00:31:54,621
then forward DNS and to make sure that they match up,

754
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:55,182
right?

755
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,501
Or vice versa, right?

756
00:31:56,621 --> 00:32:00,952
But you can't because one IP address can host 1000 domains.

757
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,621
Well, uh I was actually just dealing with this yesterday.

758
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,102
Google bought, for example,

759
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:08,421
uh they say it's like Google bought, dash, dash, dash, dash,

760
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:10,582
dash dot Google bot.com or whatever.

761
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,871
So you basically look for this red jacks and,

762
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:15,251
and then also look forwards and to match up.

763
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,355
All right, anyway, I'm going to call this one

764
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:18,276
and there's also,

765
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:19,326
but here's the best part.

766
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:22,865
There is nothing in CWE for like essentially

767
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,946
the domain name got hijacked by an attacker.

768
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:27,235
Somehow. There's, there's nothing in here at all.

769
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:32,536
An expired domain should have ac we because an expired domain is a legitimate risk.

770
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:37,046
The problem is this is a hard one to fix because once the attacker has DNS,

771
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,956
-- they stand up everything and look legit,
-- I mean, to a degree.

772
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:43,196
All right, I'm not going to argue this one anymore. I, I think again,

773
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,069
we'll see, we'll see how it all turns out. Thank you, Kurt.

774
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,270
