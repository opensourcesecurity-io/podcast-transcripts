Hello and welcome to episode 45 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,149
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:11,939
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,079
How are you? Kurt?

4
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:14,550
I'm doing better

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,289
better.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:21,899
What? Oh, you're cold. Yes. But now you, you lack the deep sexy voice. You had just a

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,020
mere couple of days ago.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,639
It's just, it's amazing to wake up and be able to breathe.

9
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,030
No. No. That's called being alive.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,810
-- Well, I mean,
-- through my nose, yes. Life is amazing. That's right.

11
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:34,049
Everybody, you heard it here.

12
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:35,189
Um,

13
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,740
no, II, I know what you mean. There's nothing worse than being sick for a long time

14
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:43,529
and having the horrible pain of sniffling and coughing and,

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,150
and just being sick and tired of it.

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,669
Well, you know, it's kind of like, it reminds me, like, info

17
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:50,529
that we're, like, not sick enough to actually, like, you know,

18
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,310
turn it all off and fix it,

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,569
but we're like, just a little bit sick enough to be annoying.

20
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,880
Like, I wasn't sick enough to take a sick day for sure. Right.

21
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,259
I was nowhere near that sick.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,450
So I'm, you know, but I'm also sick enough that I, you know,

23
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:04,300
enjoying life is kind of a chore.

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,699
I'm just a little bit tired and achy and, you know,

25
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:08,569
general malaise.

26
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,940
Oh, and I'm really sad because I found out these magic,

27
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:13,250
the gathering cards that I thought were counterfeit or real.

28
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,330
How are they real? They were

29
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,959
all jacked up, you said?

30
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,480
Well, uh, so a friend of ours who used to date a professional magic,

31
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:22,459
the gathering player.

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,349
So she

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,470
knows a lot about this stuff like

34
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,940
osmosis, right? Because she dated this guy for like seven years, I think. Anyways,

35
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,449
apparently those cards that are printed on both sides with a character is a new car.

36
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,400
It's a new game mechanic that they're doing.

37
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:39,559
That seems insane.

38
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,160
Yeah.

39
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,279
Um, and she ripped one or two cards and yeah,

40
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,309
they look legit and the printing looks good.

41
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:45,879
Like I, you know,

42
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:48,339
showed her the picture with the rosettes and stuff

43
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,480
and the rosettes seem to match up what's online.

44
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:53,989
So my next theory is that somewhere somebody is

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,989
shucking packs of magic cards to find the good ones

46
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,349
and then putting the garbage into these packs and

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,870
selling them on to the dollar store to like,

48
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,589
essentially monetize their garbage.

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,540
I can vaguely understand that.

50
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:06,230
Uh

51
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,290
Interesting.

52
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,270
Is that

53
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,919
apart from counterfeiting or like, you know,

54
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,110
monetizing your garbage cards? I, I

55
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:17,869
-- cannot imagine what other scenario these cheap cards fit into it
-- is.

56
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,309
I, what, what's the year on them? Are they, are they last year's cards?

57
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,479
Uh, they are.

58
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,630
I've seen, this is, I don't even know.

59
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,960
Oh, yeah, they are. Uh, well, they're copyright 2016.

60
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,610
So I, I wonder if they, last year's set because what, what magic has done actually.

61
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,149
And this is really clever of them.

62
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,089
It used to be. You just kept buying cards and buying, and buying and buying.

63
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,770
And obviously there were some really good cards from every set

64
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,740
that, that got released and then at some point they basically started saying,

65
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,179
all right, this is the 2016 set.

66
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,690
All the tournaments held in 2016 are going to be

67
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,389
done with 2016 cards to level the playing field.

68
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,699
Interesting note, here's one from

69
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,110
-- 2014. So
-- I wonder,

70
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,539
I wonder if those are just old cards that they

71
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,300
had like a warehouse and they're unloading them because,

72
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,089
because let's face it too.

73
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,160
If you're a like magic player,

74
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,169
you don't want last year's cards because you can't use them in tournaments,

75
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,600
right?

76
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,220
And in fact,

77
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,559
this is a great scam too because I bought magic

78
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,440
the gathering off of steam some time ago for,

79
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,119
I think it was like 2013 or something.

80
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,179
And then

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,300
they, they offered to let me buy the 2014 edition for a mere 10% off.

82
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:29,139
And I thought this is crazy.

83
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,419
I will admit, I'm kind of sad. These aren't counterfeit cards because

84
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,809
I, I had kept meaning to go to the,

85
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,220
the local dollar store and see if I would find the same thing.

86
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:42,270
And so I guess you, you've just saved me probably a bunch of money,

87
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,389
but I was also hoping that this was going to turn into like,

88
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:48,339
some sort of crazy detective story, which it clearly is not.

89
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,649
Yeah. No, it's,

90
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,389
uh,

91
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,789
what I really, well, hm.

92
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,580
Is there like an app where I can take a picture of the

93
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:57,630
card with my phone and it'll tell me what the card's worth.

94
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,889
I don't know. But I know there are websites you can go to that, that sell these cards

95
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,899
and you can obviously do it like on ebay,

96
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,020
but there's a certain amount of risk involved.

97
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:12,179
And so people are hesitant sometimes,

98
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,988
-- but there you heard
-- about that guy whose mom cleaned out his room at home in Japan.

99
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:19,658
What? Right now?

100
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:23,459
So there was this guy in Japan and his mom cleaned out,

101
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,169
like he's an adult and his mom was like,

102
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,838
cleaning out his room and she basically posted to some card

103
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:32,549
auctioning site. Like, hey, I found a bunch of old cards in my son's room. Oh, man.

104
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,278
And one of them was a black orchid,

105
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,459
black lotus,

106
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,940
black lotus. Sorry. Yeah.

107
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,089
And, uh, so that's apparently worth like upwards of 30 grand. Super

108
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,720
expensive. I, I do. I still, I used to know a guy that had one.

109
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,920
-- I don't know if he still does. I, I'd have sold it long ago if
-- I own it anyway.

110
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,899
So it's it's kind of sad because she,

111
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,625
she took down the auction with like some message that basically we stated,

112
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:56,024
like my son called and yelled at me for a while.

113
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:58,584
And so we've taken the auction down now.

114
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:02,394
-- But
-- you know what's really funny about that is this, this reminds me of,

115
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:03,605
of baseball cards

116
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:04,424
is

117
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:09,265
in the US people collect baseball cards. Well, they, they kind of used to, it's not

118
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:10,144
as popular,

119
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,184
it used to be.

120
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,825
And like when I was a kid,

121
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,035
you always heard these stories about these people with like, you know,

122
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:18,774
Mickey Mantle rookie card that's worth like a billion dollars or whatever.

123
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,225
And,

124
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,975
and so everybody has saved all their baseball cards

125
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,540
and they have almost no value anymore

126
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,290
because everyone has them, you know, if you have the really old ones, they,

127
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,470
they have value and

128
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:30,630
it's

129
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,440
right, exactly where everyone's keeping them now.

130
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,260
And the only reason the old stuff have value is because like everyone's

131
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,880
mom threw them away because they thought this is just junk under the bed

132
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:40,820
and,

133
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,549
and I suspect there's, there's kind of a security story in this for us,

134
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,140
we can tie this back to is

135
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,570
we often

136
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:50,809
like to think about things in the context of the past.

137
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,230
And in fact, I have a blog post, I'm working on about this, which

138
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,190
it's, I, I did not do this on purpose, not to plug myself. But,

139
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,049
you know, we think about things like five or 10 years ago.

140
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,880
Like my favorite example is run antivirus.

141
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,510
No,

142
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,200
you don't need it because your operating system comes

143
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:10,390
with various features that are vastly superior to antivirus.

144
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,760
And when you install antivirus,

145
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:15,690
a lot of times it turns this stuff off and it's basically just insecure crap anyway.

146
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:17,859
And so you're actually in worse shape today

147
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:20,000
if you're running antivirus than if you're just letting

148
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,390
you know your, your, your operating system kind of secure. You.

149
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,519
Well, what really gets me about antivirus is I, I mean,

150
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:29,769
I still sort of see the argument on P CS for a lot of people, but fundamentally,

151
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,239
I can't think of a single person. I know with a mobile phone that has antivirus on it,

152
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,399
it doesn't really work there.

153
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,739
But I think even in the context of the PC,

154
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,829
if you're running a modern version of Windows,

155
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,739
it comes with something called Windows Defender,

156
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,820
which is essentially antivirus built in.

157
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,529
Plus they have all of their

158
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,940
secure boot and you need signed binaries and all this stuff.

159
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,859
And so basically, if, if you don't mess with your machine,

160
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,790
you're in pretty good shape.

161
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,869
I mean, realistically speaking,

162
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,380
-- well,
-- I thought Windows Defender started life out as a,

163
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,390
basically an antivirus light.

164
00:06:59,399 --> 00:06:59,940
Wasn't

165
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,829
it got additional features

166
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,230
-- I
-- pick some up, which I don't think is a surprise,

167
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,989
but I think it falls into the good enough camp and I know there's

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,910
probably a lot of people shaking their fist at their computer right now or,

169
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,380
or phone or whatever it is, you're, you're listening on.

170
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,910
But, I mean, let's face it, it, it's good enough.

171
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,700
It's not perfect, but it's certainly good enough.

172
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:19,429
Yeah.

173
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:22,739
Well, what I'm really impressed with was, you know, with both ecosystems.

174
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,399
Android and, uh, Apple.

175
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,980
Um, I know nothing of the Windows phone ecosystem.

176
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:31,040
I've actually only ever seen one in the wild twice now in, like, over 10 years.

177
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,549
And I've actually, in the last like probably five years,

178
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,440
only seen a blackberry device twice.

179
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,720
I haven't seen a blackberry since

180
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,730
I, I can't even remember.

181
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:45,529
But the only reason I see a Windows phone is because my brother in law owns one and I,

182
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,369
I mock him incessantly about this.

183
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,450
And

184
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,410
yeah, anyway,

185
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,010
anyway, but, but at the same time,

186
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,019
the Windows phone ecosystem is essentially dead at this point.

187
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:57,970
I mean, let's face it there, there's nothing there.

188
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,799
But, uh, but basically as far as I know both Android and Apple,

189
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:04,170
uh

190
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,700
you know,

191
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,600
don't really have a problem with viruses in the traditional

192
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:10,290
sense of like arriving via email or web pages,

193
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,589
you know, to your device.

194
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,100
It's, it's often malicious apps

195
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,260
which I mean, if you're going to download and run dancing hamster dot EFC, then,

196
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,040
you know. Yeah.

197
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,459
Right.

198
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:27,000
And, and even then my understanding is on I OS, this is not near the problem,

199
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,859
it is on Android for a couple of reasons is so on.

200
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,750
I Os, you can't install random

201
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,280
I OS apps off the internet. Right.

202
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,010
Uh, you can only get stuff off the Apple store as far as I know.

203
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,090
And the other way to do it is through the developer stuff.

204
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,250
But I mean, to do that, you got to jump through a bunch of

205
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:46,679
things.

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
You know, my mom's never gonna do it.

207
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,049
I've never done it and I probably never will.

208
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,429
Right. Right. And on Android

209
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,010
it's not

210
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:00,479
as easy as kind of one click. But you can get unsigned absence too.

211
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,130
Right.

212
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,400
And so you've got that,

213
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,479
but also the Android App store from what I understand is

214
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:09,820
slightly less curated than the I OS App store is.

215
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,500
But most importantly

216
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:16,320
is most of these Android phones haven't seen a security update ever.

217
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,929
And so it's easy to get root.

218
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,349
Yeah, that's, I mean, that's one of the reasons I, you know,

219
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,280
I keep saying I went with the Apple ecosystem is I know for sure.

220
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:28,409
I get 3 to 4 years of updates without a carrier in between me and those updates.

221
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:28,609
And,

222
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:31,809
-- and
-- this is why I bought a Nexus phone straight from Google

223
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,250
because I wouldn't dream of buying a phone off a carrier.

224
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:35,809
But, I mean,

225
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,700
the reality is how many people are going to have that as a

226
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,049
-- major or even a minor buying decision when they get
-- a phone.

227
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:41,770
Nobody,

228
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,770
-- nobody does
-- security

229
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,549
-- people.
-- And I,

230
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:49,119
I, I shudder when I see most people take their phones out of their pocket because it,

231
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,039
it's got like, you know, the, the local carrier branding all over it

232
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,799
and, you know, it hasn't seen a security update ever.

233
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,119
Well, it's like, what's funny is, uh, so at school on my kids' school,

234
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,369
obviously they have ipads with educational apps loaded on them.

235
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:02,640
Right.

236
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,380
And so I

237
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:03,580
went

238
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,465
into the, uh, settings

239
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,465
storage to basically just to take pictures of all the apps that are installed,

240
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:12,844
right? With the names. So I could hunt them down and put them on my kids' ipad at home.

241
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:13,965
Right. So they have the same stuff

242
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:14,315
because,

243
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:17,955
you know, he's like, I want to play this game and I'm like, what the heck is that right?

244
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,484
And it's like something that they have at school that they play.

245
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,195
That's educational. Ok, cool.

246
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,090
And this poor ipads, like I really want to update to I OS 10.3 please, please, please,

247
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:27,520
you know this

248
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,849
and I'm like, uh, I like, I really wanted to hit that button.

249
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:33,909
Oh, God, I wanted to hit that button so much, but I didn't because, you know,

250
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:37,849
uh, then that ipad is not available for like the next half hour, you know,

251
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,289
some kids gonna fri out.

252
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,250
But, um, you know, that's what got me is like, these are not super well cared

253
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,239
for devices oftentimes,

254
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:49,250
right? They're people's phones, they turn them on, they turn them off.

255
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,349
Apparently a lot of people don't even have a lock like a pin for their lock screen.

256
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,030
Uh They don't.

257
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,700
And this is actually one of the reasons I,

258
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,599
I love the fingerprint scanners they're adding because fingerprint scanners,

259
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:02,320
people like using those but people won't add a

260
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,830
password to their phone because it's too inconvenient.

261
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,659
So,

262
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,070
and that was actually only the only consistent reason

263
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,205
I've actually heard of people who bought uh like

264
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:13,255
apple smartwatches was so that they didn't have to

265
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,565
haul their phone out of their pocket to like,

266
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,135
check what a text or a message was.

267
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:19,705
-- You know
-- what I think about that sometimes is I see that as an advantage,

268
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:23,594
but you have to charge the stupid things every single day, which I see is

269
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:24,155
my

270
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,234
disadvantage.

271
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:29,385
I, my phone runs down to usually 20 30% by the end of the day, you know,

272
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:31,765
especially if I'm running a castle crush

273
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:35,994
or, you know, some 3d game like minecraft, you know, playing with my kids and

274
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,955
that just canes the battery. Like if it's just me using it

275
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:42,429
for boring stuff, then, you know, it's like 20 30%

276
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:43,250
for

277
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:43,809
a day.

278
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:47,080
So I charge my phone every night. So I, I don't see that as a problem because it's like

279
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:47,989
I put my gla

280
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,659
or when I used to wear glasses, right?

281
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,590
I would put my glasses down on the desk next to me

282
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:54,080
and go to sleep and then wake up and put them on

283
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:54,989
the

284
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,679
same keep my phone by my bed.

285
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,609
I purposely leave it in my office downstairs. And so I basically just plug it in.

286
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,330
Sometimes, not even at night, quite often,

287
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,929
I'll just set it on the desk and plug it in in the morning because, you know,

288
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,320
it takes like an hour to charge you things now.

289
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,440
And I,

290
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:13,940
I, I'm,

291
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,570
I understand what you're saying,

292
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,570
but for some reason,

293
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,510
my brain tells me that this is super inconvenient and you don't want one.

294
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,369
So, whatever,

295
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,330
like I agree partly.

296
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,320
But here's one thing I'm really looking forward to

297
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,489
is when things have induction chargers built into them,

298
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,460
it has an induction, it,

299
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:31,900
that's how it charges.

300
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:35,239
So

301
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:35,659
we should

302
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,030
just put it down on your night stand on the pad.

303
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,950
That's exactly how this works.

304
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,070
But there's also the issue of, I don't even want to do that. I want to just charge.

305
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,500
Right.

306
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,000
Yes, I know.

307
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,145
But here, right. Anyway, anyway, let's move on to another topic.

308
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:51,424
That makes me sound less crazy.

309
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:52,664
Well, you know, these little,

310
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:55,655
it's like those stupid stickers on fruit now that I hate.

311
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:56,265
Right, because,

312
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:57,465
you know, those are edible.

313
00:12:57,895 --> 00:12:59,625
-- They are
-- obviously because people,

314
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:00,304
you know,

315
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:01,114
but uh,

316
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,554
what I love is when I get a piece of fruit that doesn't have one and

317
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,104
I'm turning this piece of fruit around and

318
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,664
around and around and around until I'm like,

319
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:06,815
oh, yeah,

320
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:07,364
sticker,

321
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,534
you've been doxed by fruit.

322
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,179
Uh, anyway, anyway, let's move on to Squirrel Mail,

323
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,020
which I think is one of the more interesting things that happened

324
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,619
-- over the last probably week or two. Do you want to explain the bizarre story?
-- So

325
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,750
-- Squirrel Mail actually is a program I used to use.
-- I, I think everybody did, man.

326
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,450
I remember when

327
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,299
came out. It was amazing.

328
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,419
Well, it's ok. So what Squirrel mail is, is it's a PHP application.

329
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,140
So, you know, it's good.

330
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:34,880
Yeah. Uh

331
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:38,340
it's been around forever and it basically provides

332
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:39,929
a nice interface to your email box.

333
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,729
Uh either pop

334
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,090
imap and then, you know, smt,

335
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:42,549
let's

336
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:42,859
face it

337
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:48,109
too late. This was, this was web mail back when like hotmail was just barely a thing.

338
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,169
And so it was huge that you could get your own web mail.

339
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:51,919
Yeah.

340
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:55,599
And so I actually set this up for myself and quite a number of people who have like,

341
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:55,989
you know, a

342
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,679
custom domain on a, you know, on a web host provider, right?

343
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,640
Because that's the other thing, right? Because it was PHP.

344
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,349
You literally just un tarred this package set like three variables, like the

345
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,880
IMAP server, the SMTP server and like the domain name.

346
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,179
And that's literally it. You were done. It just worked. It was awesome.

347
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,229
You could send and receive attachments, you could,

348
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:18,719
oh, it was a lovely package, right? And then of course Gmail came along and bloop

349
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,000
um

350
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,320
you know, nobody wants to run their own email anymore. That's just clearly insane.

351
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,030
Um,

352
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,969
so, yeah, I mean, so Squirrel Mail, I think part of it is, uh, it's a mature project.

353
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:32,619
Right. Because it's been around for going on 1015 years.

354
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:34,460
It's pretty old.

355
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,140
Yeah.

356
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:38,770
Or maybe even more than 15 years. It might have been pre 2000.

357
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,869
Well, no, it wouldn't have been because PHP anyways

358
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,789
point being is that it's pretty mature and stable and, you know,

359
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,250
what's interesting to me though is they still have nightly builds

360
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,539
of it and they do have like a little bit of,

361
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:50,690
you know, uh activity going on with it.

362
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,669
Um sort of maintenance, like make sure it works with current PHP.

363
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:55,940
Um But anyway,

364
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,010
there was a really bad flaw in squirrel mail uh that

365
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,710
basically allows remote code execution via like sending a wonky email

366
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,119
and um you know, like kudos to the developers, they actually fixed it

367
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,659
in the

368
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,739
uh in the source code.

369
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,960
Um They don't appear to have one of their emails said they cut a new release,

370
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:15,940
but I can't find that new release and they host off of Source Forge,

371
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,380
which is a nightmare to.

372
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,340
No, nobody should be using Source Forge anymore.

373
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:22,510
What I love is there's that one ad blocker

374
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,919
that just blocks like all of Source forge now

375
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,309
because if you go to Source Forge now,

376
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,299
like it literally looks like one of those casino websites

377
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,099
-- from like two 1000.
-- I know it's so bad,

378
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,840
-- you know, it's so sad because it was, you know, how the mighty have fallen.
-- Right.

379
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:40,359
-- Uh
-- It, it's the nature of everything. I mean, someday that will be

380
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,460
github and I know people don't like it when I say that, but it, it's going to happen.

381
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,090
I

382
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,900
mean, look at slash

383
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:46,219
talk.

384
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,270
Uh, slash

385
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,599
That is still mildly interesting, at least.

386
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,979
Yeah. But I mean,

387
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,650
-- I
-- don't know, I

388
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,840
have an ad blocker and I only ever look at

389
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,369
stories through the RSS reader and I won't lie.

390
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,270
Usually if it's on slash dot It was on Reddit yesterday.

391
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,989
So I don't usually look at them, but every now and then.

392
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,049
So, yeah, they still only have the 1.4 0.22 release on their Source Forge page,

393
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:13,590
which is from 2011.

394
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,789
-- Yes, that was that release.
-- That's

395
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,809
crazy.

396
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,289
Well, so here's, here's my take on this is

397
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:22,969
even if they updated the code

398
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,729
and they cut a new release to fix this one issue,

399
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,090
they haven't done a release in a very long time

400
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,159
and it's no secret that software doesn't age. Well, if you just

401
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,809
maintain your software and you, you're fixing minor issues

402
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,039
in reality, if, if you think of it as kind of a, a graph, your graph is going down

403
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:46,140
to the right, it is not going up, it is not staying the same.

404
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,369
You have to be constantly taking care of this because

405
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,820
as software gets older,

406
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,919
there are new ways to attack it.

407
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,750
There are new libraries that work better and let's face it,

408
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,190
scroll mail probably has some old scary libraries

409
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,270
in it from PHP that are just dangerous.

410
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:05,439
It doesn't work on a lot of modern PHP unless you're running a DEV version. Right.

411
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,219
Because PHP

412
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:07,483
for the last 10

413
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:08,035
years,

414
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:08,444
that's

415
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:10,185
what was that, that setting,

416
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:12,255
uh use global or something where it would

417
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,425
just magically take uh get and post parameters,

418
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:21,795
variables and, and automatically assign them in PHP with such a train wreck.

419
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,535
Well, but you know, it worked,

420
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:24,983
right. People built

421
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:27,265
apps with PHP that worked and they got stuff done and,

422
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,170
you know, as much as all,

423
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,229
all I do hate these languages sort of at a very

424
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:36,569
visceral level for making it so easy to be so bad.

425
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,050
-- People get stuff done in
-- them.

426
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:45,010
They, they do and working and wrong beats, correct and non-existent every time.

427
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:45,699
I mean,

428
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,060
there's been massive ecommerce platforms built on php.

429
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,569
I mean, wordpress, it's like a third of the websites

430
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,010
like doesn't, doesn't Facebook use PHP on the back end,

431
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:58,449
right. Yeah, they, and they built that whole um

432
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,209
not

433
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,030
z what was the other thing, the accelerator that precompiling stuff and

434
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:04,890
all sorts of crazy stuff for performance, right?

435
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,729
Um You know, same thing with like, you know, uh what was it, Ebay using Java,

436
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,010
right? I'm not a big fan of Java, but I think it was ebay

437
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,160
was using Java for the longest time and I mean, clearly it works.

438
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:18,369
No, they were,

439
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:22,079
were, they know who's node anyway, whatever it doesn't matter.

440
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,989
And, and I guess part of it too is

441
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,250
there is every language you can imagine in you somewhere no matter what it is.

442
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,280
And, and I guess the lesson here is

443
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,140
if, if you're consuming something, make sure it has updates in maybe the last,

444
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,349
let's say two years,

445
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,150
six years is too long.

446
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,349
This comes back to that argument of, you know,

447
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,310
kind of what does it mean when you see software with no CV S,

448
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,645
uh, that means it's terrible and nobody's looking at it.

449
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:53,125
-- That's what that means,
-- basically. Yeah. One of three things has happened.

450
00:18:53,344 --> 00:18:54,994
One, nobody's looking at it.

451
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:59,334
Two people have looked at it but the upstream has fought those CV S and, like,

452
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:01,324
managed to get them not assigned.

453
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,045
It's worse than number one.

454
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:04,135
Yeah, exactly.

455
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:05,545
And then number three is, of course,

456
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:08,484
absolutely nobody's using it or even aware that this thing exists,

457
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,125
which is the same as number one, I think.

458
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,819
I, I think fundamentally it's, if, if there are no C DS for something, it, it's bad.

459
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:16,849
That's a bad thing.

460
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,599
Like, you know, run away.

461
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:20,239
So, anyway,

462
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:22,979
yeah, it's, uh, but I mean, what, what really

463
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,109
is interesting to me is, I mean,

464
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,819
I think a lot of people probably pick squirrel mail for the same reason I did,

465
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:29,650
which was set up is so simple

466
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:32,000
and I mean, there are clearly far better,

467
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,650
you know, solutions now like round cube.

468
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,079
Uh what is it

469
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:36,900
is round

470
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,609
still around even II, I remember that.

471
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:44,310
That was exciting because that was an Ajax mail reader similar to Gmail

472
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:48,339
and Squirrel mail was very HTML. At least the last time I read it, I, I suspect

473
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,520
here we go CV. From,

474
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,930
-- well, this year, last year,
-- see, that's a good sign.

475
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:58,619
Most of them exercise too, so not too severe. You know, that's also nice to see.

476
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,930
Right.

477
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,849
I would agree with that.

478
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:04,189
And so anyway, the lesson here is probably don't use squirrel mail

479
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:08,849
and more importantly is before you use something, take a look at it and make sure it,

480
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,489
it actually has somebody taking care of

481
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,810
it properly because I think even though squirrel

482
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,089
mail might have commits,

483
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,089
they aren't releasing updates so they clearly aren't taking care of things

484
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,369
on the back end the way they should be. And so don't use Squire Mail. Kids.

485
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,869
Part of me wonders are they able to release updates?

486
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,939
Because, I mean, I've seen projects where it's sold,

487
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:28,250
but the guy that has the access to do it is gone.

488
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,930
I've, I've heard of that before

489
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:30,640
and it,

490
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,660
it, I don't know, you know what, let's, let's move on to something happier.

491
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,589
How about because all of our stealing,

492
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,339
stealing all my mail. That's what was the site, uh,

493
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,569
-- that
-- bulk unsubscribe. Unroll me Unroll dot

494
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,219
unroll.me. That's it. Thank you. That

495
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:49,099
I,

496
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:51,689
I don't even know what to think about this.

497
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:55,729
And I have to admit at first I was really confused, but

498
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,569
so literally, all Unroll me.unroll.me does apparently is

499
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:04,709
helps unsubscribe you for mailing lists and junk newsletters, which I,

500
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:07,339
I thought that's what the spam button in gmail was for.

501
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,869
I guess,

502
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,270
you know, why would I need that third party?

503
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,640
So, and apparently unroll.me of course,

504
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,729
was you'd have to give it like access to all your stuff,

505
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:17,795
mail.

506
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:21,165
It wanted access to all of your mail because logically it has to read

507
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:24,375
all of your mail in order to decide what to unsubscribe you from.

508
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:27,074
And then the thing they don't tell you is they're also kind

509
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:30,785
-- of uh taking it all and storing it and selling it to
-- Uber

510
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:35,094
and other companies and apparently storing it not well secured as three buckets

511
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:35,285
and

512
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,765
why, why would they care? Right. I mean, let's face it.

513
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:38,984
It,

514
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:44,525
I, but here's, here's what I guess I think about this is this is clearly a service for,

515
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,979
we'll say technical ish people. I don't expect anyone to find this.

516
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:53,400
Like I would not expect my parents to come across this service, for example. Right.

517
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,979
They might if the word of mouth or targeted advertising because I,

518
00:21:56,989 --> 00:21:58,500
-- I've seen one thing where like
-- I literally

519
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,849
confident my parents would never come across this

520
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,640
or it's one of those things I've seen,

521
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,250
I've seen similar things on Facebook like this stupid app that does blah, blah,

522
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,430
blah.

523
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,449
And I'm like, oh Lord, are people actually installing this and using it, you know.

524
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,010
Yeah, the answer is yes they are.

525
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,040
-- But
-- ok,

526
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,459
so people buy into multilevel marketing schemes.

527
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,819
Normal people probably wouldn't understand the context of this.

528
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:21,780
But I think anyone who even has a

529
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,219
remote technical background should honestly understand this,

530
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:25,660
this

531
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,660
how the permissions work of things linked against like your Google

532
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,469
and Facebook accounts and in whatever all of these kind of o

533
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,939
office

534
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,420
type accounts

535
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,260
is,

536
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,989
it's not a secret.

537
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,329
And if you don't understand it, like where have you been for the last five years?

538
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:43,150
I just went to unrolled on me and you know what?

539
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,589
It's really easy and clean, like it literally says,

540
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,599
clean up your inbox instantly see a list of all your subscription emails,

541
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:50,459
unsubscribe easily from whatever you don't want.

542
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:50,900
Get started.

543
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,939
Now you click get started now and then it literally says sign up,

544
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:56,670
it's got four buttons, sign up with Google, sign up with Yahoo,

545
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,500
sign up without looking, sign up with AOL.

546
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,339
And if I click sign up with Google, obviously, I'm not gonna do this.

547
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,939
Uh I get a uh terms and privacy policy,

548
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:06,849
it's gonna be a disaster.

549
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,310
Let me and nobody reads.

550
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,989
If I click continue, then

551
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,250
uh unroll.me would like to read, send, delete and manage your email,

552
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,650
view your email address,

553
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,030
view your basic profile info and manage your contacts

554
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:21,770
uh we're gonna click, deny.

555
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,599
Oh, oops. Looks like you declined access retry sign up.

556
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,810
No.

557
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,109
So

558
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,750
for a normal person, they wouldn't understand what that means. And I get that.

559
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:34,689
But I also suspect

560
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:35,869
this is,

561
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:36,800
I don't know,

562
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,079
I feel like this is targeting slightly more technical

563
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:42,650
people because normal people don't subscribe to mailing lists.

564
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,750
So part of it I've noticed is when I do sign up for stuff that wants me to sign up,

565
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,209
you know, with an all

566
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:47,750
off account

567
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,540
is I'll click on my options.

568
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,770
Like, usually it's like what Twitter, Google, Facebook,

569
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,290
linkedin are kind of the four,

570
00:23:54,189 --> 00:23:54,290
right?

571
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:57,800
And what's really fascinating to me is quite often a lot of them,

572
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,479
very different

573
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,329
um

574
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:05,430
levels of access that they want or need.

575
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,060
And I suspect for some of them, like,

576
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,560
you know, I suspect some of them are pushing back a bit more, you know, um

577
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,699
than the other providers, right?

578
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:16,739
Like Facebook is basically quite happy to give quite a bit of access to

579
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,300
your stuff or a lot of these things almost always ask for access to like

580
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:24,780
send and receive tweets. And I'm like, you know, good Lord.

581
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:27,949
And it's weird to me that Twitter like allows that, you know,

582
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,900
-- a very narrow group of specific apps,
-- let's face it, they don't really care.

583
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:38,199
But I, I had an app on my phone once and I don't even remember what this was, but they had

584
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,939
a thing where they wanted to link it with Facebook.

585
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:45,880
And it said one of the permissions was post to my wall. And I was like, nope.

586
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,569
And they said in it they said post to your wall, we promise not to do this.

587
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,439
And I'm like, then you don't need it.

588
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:52,410
You just

589
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,290
come on guys, that's

590
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:54,459
how,

591
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,510
-- you know, it's like, oh, I just need to,
-- uh, you gotta love it.

592
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,439
But I guess at the same time how would a a normal person will say my parents

593
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:08,119
even remotely found them? Oh, they said they won't do it. It's probably fine.

594
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,199
It's like, don't please just don't do that

595
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,640
well and see traditionally companies had

596
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,949
a bit of, you know,

597
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:19,329
trust and brand that they worried about but like something like unroll me,

598
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:20,189
you know,

599
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,939
-- day
-- care,

600
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,319
you

601
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:22,750
know, they'll just fold up

602
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:23,130
shop.

603
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:27,760
So this is, this is a good, a good topic as well is

604
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,770
we

605
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,869
I I don't,

606
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,650
I guess it's still a thing but the obsession

607
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,810
with brand and brand image and what it means.

608
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:34,930
But let's face it man.

609
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,810
If you look at Target,

610
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,239
if you look at Yahoo,

611
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,099
-- if you look at all these companies that have just
-- targets a very bad example,

612
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,089
horribly pumped

613
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:42,520
in

614
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:45,390
Canada. Perhaps that that's another story.

615
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,979
But you get the idea right?

616
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:51,520
There's all these companies that have had terrible things done to their brand

617
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,150
and they like literally cause harm to people because their identities were stolen

618
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,479
and at the end of the day

619
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,469
it doesn't matter,

620
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:58,060
you know, the

621
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,900
-- phones to catch fire.
-- Right.

622
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,199
Exactly.

623
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,680
And I mean, I'll never forget it.

624
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:07,359
I was, I was at a, I was at an event one time talking to somebody about

625
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,920
Yahoo getting hacked. This was like the fourth or fifth story.

626
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:11,719
You're

627
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:11,989
gonna have

628
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:12,319
to come

629
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:12,969
out there were,

630
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,670
there have been a

631
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,030
lot.

632
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,150
It would. Right. And that's just it. Right.

633
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,810
-- That's part of it is,
-- it's like the old Sony

634
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:18,640
hacks, right?

635
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,160
We're talking about this

636
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:21,550
and he's saying, oh man, you know,

637
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,079
this is gonna be terrible for them and then

638
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:24,780
they need to get better at security and this.

639
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,589
And I said, all right, let me ask you a question,

640
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:30,300
what is happening to the Yahoo stock, right? This minute.

641
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,000
And this was literally like the day this kind of known.

642
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,959
So this was like as hot as news gets

643
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,329
and he says, oh, it's gotta be tanking. And I said, it's up, it's up, it's up two points

644
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:43,849
and he's like, no. And I pulled up my phone, it was actually up like 2.5 by then.

645
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:44,619
And,

646
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:49,060
and I said, look, man, people just don't care like that's the reality of it.

647
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:52,930
And which is also terrifying to me because as soon as some of these brand,

648
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:55,790
people figure out that like the brand is nearly untouchable

649
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,969
once you've built some a certain level of trust.

650
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,219
That's terrifying.

651
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:03,219
Look at what Nestle did in, like, was it India or Africa with pushing?

652
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:04,219
That was Africa.

653
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:07,099
Yeah. Pushing condensed milk for babies. And then they,

654
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:09,310
yeah,

655
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,239
well, no, it ended, they were pushing, uh, I think it was Coca

656
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:13,189
Cola as a better

657
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,089
healthier alternative than.

658
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:15,650
Right. But

659
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,140
that's not

660
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:16,410
something

661
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:17,510
-- but
-- whatever.

662
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,160
But

663
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,349
the point is these companies are doing things that are like horrendous.

664
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,670
Um, and then my favorite is somebody's like, oh, well, these companies have never,

665
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,959
like, killed a whole bunch of people.

666
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:27,920
And I was like, have you ever heard of Union Car Buy?

667
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,989
They might have, it's, it's happened,

668
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:32,349
right? But we don't need the EPA, it's fine.

669
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:38,489
So the reality is a part of it too is like, well, appliances are a great example.

670
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,739
There's what, four appliance manufacturers like globally now, basically.

671
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,640
Um, or like, you know, internet service in Canada, you know,

672
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,530
we were talking about that before the show and

673
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:51,880
Josh is apparently quite horrified about what I have to pay for, you know, uh,

674
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:55,060
-- internet access on my phone. You
-- know, it's really funny about that though.

675
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:57,719
And this is totally human nature. It makes me feel better about my

676
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,599
service.

677
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:00,000
But then at the same time I'm like, no,

678
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,760
this is not like I shouldn't feel good because Kurt has something worse than me.

679
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,680
Like we both want better.

680
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,239
Yeah, exactly.

681
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:12,579
So, you know, like a lot of it now is like, for a lot of these companies, you know,

682
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:14,800
I can't really

683
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,959
opt out because I need these services or products,

684
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,410
you know, a great example. Um,

685
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:23,969
how many major Canadian banks do you think support two factor authentication?

686
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,189
Uh

687
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,969
100. That's, I was close.

688
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:33,859
Yeah, true. You were close. But yeah, so I was,

689
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,900
I was trying to find a bank in like a major bank in Canada.

690
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,910
I don't, you know, so that when I travel, I, you know,

691
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,780
can find an ATM or a branch like in Vancouver or Toronto.

692
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:43,829
Uh,

693
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:44,280
no.

694
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,520
Uh, you know what I, I

695
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:51,150
think about this a lot and my bank does not offer two factor authentication either.

696
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,589
And, but here's the deal is

697
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,979
if somebody breaks into my bank account,

698
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,089
I

699
00:28:59,640 --> 00:28:59,670
have

700
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,189
a

701
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,479
problem though.

702
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,040
I mean, they're gonna, granted I won't have money for a little while,

703
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,290
but at the end of the day I'm going to get it all back.

704
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:10,939
See, here's my, my current threat profile is my six year olds.

705
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:16,729
No, if your kids can log into your bank account and steal your money,

706
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:19,359
-- like they've earned it as far as I'm concerned,
-- keeps trying to pass

707
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,819
like the, the protocol now is ok,

708
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:25,069
Felix turn around and he has to turn around and cover his eyes.

709
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,729
-- I
-- thought you used last pass.

710
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:31,949
I do. But I mean, when I'm typing in my pin to my phone or, well, not my phone but my, I

711
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,189
read.

712
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,349
Yeah, I do.

713
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,459
And that's why that's why I upgraded to an iphone

714
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,680
se was to get the fingerprint reader so he can't

715
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,750
get into my phone.

716
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,400
You're solving your problem with technology.

717
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:45,219
But uh, you know, my kids could easily grab my credit card out of my wallet.

718
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:49,229
-- Register an Amazon account and like start buying all the candy.
-- Look.

719
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,500
All right, man. If your kids do that, like

720
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:53,140
you, you raise deviant

721
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:53,640
and

722
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,180
right, you, you, your, your, your problem is gonna be keeping them out of jail,

723
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:58,979
not like your credit card.

724
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,040
Let's face it

725
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,489
anyway. And I, I suspect that's not a practical threat model. But,

726
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,089
and so anyway, but here's the thing is I,

727
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:10,300
I've come to realize is I'm less concerned about my money in

728
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,310
my bank account than I am about like my gmail or Facebook accounts

729
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,369
because they're tied to lots of stuff.

730
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,459
And if I lose them, it becomes insanely difficult to get them back.

731
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,030
Well, there's also a very clear, well established legal and procedural framework,

732
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:29,189
-- dealing with your money getting ripped off. It's
-- regulated.

733
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,709
That's the, that's the word

734
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,410
here. It's,

735
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,099
you know, the challenge,

736
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:35,880
for example comes in when you have to deal with identity theft,

737
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,390
right? That's much more difficult.

738
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,479
And even then there is still ways you can

739
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,810
put credit freezes and you can alert your bank.

740
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:42,010
And

741
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:43,689
I was actually just reading on Reddit and

742
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:45,699
they were talking about um some threads on this

743
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:46,959
and um

744
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:48,949
you know, this person,

745
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:54,150
uh who in their state is a person with the exact same name born on the same day.

746
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,189
Oh,

747
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:55,680
man, that's brutal.

748
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,660
Well, and the problem is police checks,

749
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,119
right.

750
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,670
Whenever they do a police check,

751
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,369
they don't look up the picture or the signature or whatever description,

752
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,050
it's just like,

753
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:08,650
you know, name, like, what's your name and birthday?

754
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:09,349
Actually?

755
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,109
You know, it's really funny is I've, I've heard of these stories before where, yeah,

756
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,540
they use primarily name and birthday as not even birthday in some instances.

757
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,189
But I knew people with names of, we'll say, uh,

758
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,050
convicted felons

759
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:22,869
and

760
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,790
they would struggle in some instances to, to interact with, you know, certain,

761
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,359
like, banks and shops and things like that

762
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:31,229
name. Saddam Hussein in the UK, who can't get a bank account?

763
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:33,430
That's brutal. And it's kind of like,

764
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,390
well,

765
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,050
I would, I, I mean,

766
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,579
I can't speak for this individual but in my case I

767
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:42,650
would just change my name to almost anything else like.

768
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,229
Right.

769
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,430
I mean, let's face it,

770
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:48,599
change it to Donald Trump. Everything will be cool. Like,

771
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,719
well, I, I get that too. I mean, that would be like if your name was Adolf Hitler,

772
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,719
you've got,

773
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,130
you know.

774
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:55,069
Right.

775
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:59,040
Right. But you know what I mean? Well, it, it's tricky.

776
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,329
-- It's,
-- well, the problem is, for example, there's like, there's been cases where,

777
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,280
like the four year old has the same name as somebody on the watch list and they get,

778
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:12,250
uh, in fact a friend of mine, his dad gets, uh, pulled off to the, whatever they call,

779
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,050
like, the, the terrible inspection.

780
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,479
Right. Right.

781
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:18,520
Because he apparently has the same name as someone on the no fly list.

782
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,479
Even though this guy travels like hundreds of thousands of miles a year by air,

783
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:26,790
they keep pulling him out of the line because he has the wrong name.

784
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,640
Yeah. Well, and again, these systems are basically, you know, creaky

785
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,880
old ancient systems, like they run on like name and maybe birthday if you're lucky.

786
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:38,619
Right. You know, like,

787
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:39,900
yes,

788
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,880
I hate to say it, but this is one of the few arguments I have for a national,

789
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:49,439
you know, biometric database is

790
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,930
to sort of try and get rid of these false positives and make it, you know, a little bit.

791
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:54,760
I don't know.

792
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,130
I just, but knowing the government, well,

793
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,569
pretty much any government would make a bit of a hash of it.

794
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:02,390
It's, and we'd have a whole new set of problems, you know, because for example,

795
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,310
apparently fingerprints aren't as unique and individual as we thought they.

796
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,170
-- That is what it's looking like.
-- Yes.

797
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,880
You know,

798
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,540
so, ok. Well, I've read things like, you know, the, the blood vessels in your hands.

799
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:12,849
They, um,

800
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,709
apparently Japanese ATM S use that the advantage also being that

801
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,709
you don't have to touch anything just as a thermal camera,

802
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:17,849
you,

803
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,295
-- your hand above it.
-- That's

804
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:20,025
awesome.

805
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:20,505
That sounds

806
00:33:20,655 --> 00:33:21,734
so Japanese, I

807
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:21,994
love

808
00:33:22,094 --> 00:33:22,114
it.

809
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:25,665
Um You know, because quite honestly I know that these things aren't gonna like,

810
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:27,814
it's not like an old D and D trap where you, like, you know,

811
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:30,415
you put your head up and appear in the hole and a spike comes out and

812
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:31,364
you in the eye.

813
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,834
But at the same time, like every time I see like those movie Irish Readers,

814
00:33:34,844 --> 00:33:37,824
that's like my first thought is like, oh D and D, you know that dungeon master,

815
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,694
he's a bit of a, you know, jerk and

816
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:41,895
you're gonna get a sharp spike in the eyeball.

817
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:46,015
Uh Where do you bank? Clearly? Not where I do.

818
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,199
But uh and also, you know, there's people without eyes and stuff,

819
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,150
-- right?
-- And that's the other problem with biometrics is that

820
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,880
somewhere, somebody's missing that piece of their body?

821
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:57,489
Yes.

822
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,709
Yes, they are. And,

823
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,810
and then, you know,

824
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:02,479
they're going to have to jump through a billion hoops to like get

825
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:05,770
into their ATM account every time they want to withdraw 20 bucks,

826
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:06,859
you know,

827
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:08,570
and that's what really gets me is my

828
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,489
fear of standardizing on a biometric system is that

829
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:14,659
the failure scenario will be really ugly because it'll be like, oh,

830
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:16,020
well a computer says

831
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,550
that's how it works.

832
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,260
Now, man, I mean, if you go to nearly any institution and you try to say,

833
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,320
get a loan or open an account or something and

834
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,310
if the computer pops up a window that tells them,

835
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,899
do not give this person help.

836
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,540
That's the end. They, they're not gonna help you.

837
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:31,678
Yeah.

838
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:32,329
But I mean,

839
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,898
when it's tied to your identity and it's maybe your basic form of proving identity,

840
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:36,688
then it really

841
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:36,858
becomes

842
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:37,099
a

843
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:37,478
-- problem
-- and

844
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:43,168
you can get replacement ID right now as long as you have an address to mail it to,

845
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,217
um, things like that, you know.

846
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,248
I know. I know.

847
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:52,339
Oh, it's madness. Uh, let's talk about

848
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:54,259
gr security.

849
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,739
-- Yeah.
-- What do you think of that one?

850
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,469
Well, I think it's like Nessus,

851
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,100
I mean, here is a guy and a small company, you know,

852
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,879
pouring a lot of work and time into a product

853
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,860
that then a whole bunch of other people, you know, free ride on.

854
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,250
Well, let's, let's talk about what GR security is.

855
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,810
First is there, is a fellow named, uh, Brad Spengler.

856
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:19,439
I

857
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:19,729
thought

858
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:25,379
Spender is his handle. Uh, and we'll refer to him as Spender from now on.

859
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:25,719
So,

860
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,340
Spender has a patch set for the Linux kernel called, well,

861
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,709
there's GR security and there's packs and he's involved with both

862
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,120
of them and I don't totally understand the relationship there,

863
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,760
but fundamentally brand is

864
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:39,949
scary, smart.

865
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,469
And he created these security patches for the Linux kernel

866
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,639
that add a significant amount of real security and like this stuff is the real deal,

867
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:49,040
right?

868
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,310
No, it actually does make it

869
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,340
-- right.
-- It's, it's very good.

870
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:56,719
And what's basically happened though is brand has a

871
00:35:56,729 --> 00:36:00,320
company that kind of I guess supports these patches

872
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:03,840
because it, I mean, it's GP L two code. So you can't really,

873
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,209
you can say it's being sold but anyone who has the

874
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:09,760
source code can pretty much do whatever they want with it.

875
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:12,189
But kind of the trick here is there have been a

876
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:16,030
number of organizations that have just taken these patches and used them

877
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:19,409
without paying for support in any way and, and in the open source universe,

878
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:22,219
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that necessarily.

879
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:24,520
But I think the thing I do have a problem with

880
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:28,179
is they were bragging about including gr security

881
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,209
in their product

882
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:34,580
and that's not really OK. But, and then at the same time, the upstream kernel

883
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,810
wasn't super receptive to working with these guys,

884
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,770
nor were they receptive to the upstream.

885
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:41,260
And so

886
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,010
none of their patches really ever made it anywhere. And so it, it,

887
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,320
it's just a strange, crazy story and I guess, well, it's,

888
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,790
it's happened before where you have this free rider problem.

889
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,050
And typically one of two things happens, you continue to have a free rider problem,

890
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,000
but whoever is doing the work, manages to figure out a way to deal with it.

891
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,360
Like

892
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,719
I, I have this already with CV CV has a huge free rider problem

893
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:02,284
in that.

894
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:05,875
Even companies who are like becoming CNAs and stuff don't want to do the work.

895
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:06,945
They're like literally like,

896
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:09,125
well, who writes the descriptions will you?

897
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,844
But we don't have the resources to do that.

898
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,385
-- Well, if you want to participate in CV, you kind of
-- maybe

899
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:19,665
this is why you just need to assign everything. A CS S score of 10.

900
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:20,844
You don't like it, give

901
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:21,584
us a better one.

902
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:26,935
But anyway, so that, that's kind of what makes the DWF really tricky to do is I'm,

903
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,425
I have to build a system that accounts for

904
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:36,510
basically 99.999% of users of DWF will never contribute a thing.

905
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,750
And in fact, we'll try and take our time and energy and be like, oh,

906
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,550
can you please explain XY or Z,

907
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:42,860
you know,

908
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:46,260
like not only do they not contribute, but they will try and suck our time and effort,

909
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,679
you know.

910
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:49,530
Um And

911
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,479
or alternatively,

912
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:55,030
you have like the N A situation or the GR security situation where they're like,

913
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,419
fine,

914
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,239
we're, we're gonna take our ball home,

915
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,229
-- right?
-- You know, end of story, right? Like

916
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,310
you want to play with our nice ball, then you've got to be.

917
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:07,709
-- So
-- here's the difference in your example though, is in the case of GR security,

918
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:10,850
you're not talking about something that's kind of widely used.

919
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,449
But CV E is like the fundamental standard

920
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,270
that, that all of our security is based upon.

921
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:17,800
So in that instance, like

922
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,469
Miter

923
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,110
just can't say we're taking our ball

924
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:21,429
and

925
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:23,360
has funding from DH S. So that's

926
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,969
basically they have a sustainable business model

927
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,350
and the government simply pays it

928
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:29,120
and that's, that's fine. That works.

929
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:31,290
I mean, if I could get funding from DH S to run the DW,

930
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:31,689
if I'd

931
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,320
probably not say no to it.

932
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:34,010
But

933
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,449
that

934
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:34,780
be

935
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:35,639
an American.

936
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,320
Yeah. The, the minor detail. Yeah. But

937
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:39,659
I mean, that's a perfect example.

938
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:42,610
That would be a potential business model for GR security. Right.

939
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,810
Where the DH S goes, you know what?

940
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,429
We really want the links kernel to be more

941
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:48,370
secure because that'll make life for America better.

942
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,850
We're going to fund these guys, right? As an example. And that's the problem, right?

943
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,570
It's hard business models around open source are not easy.

944
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,250
-- If they were, we'd have a lot more open source companies. It,
-- it's very true.

945
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,050
I, I totally get this as,

946
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:01,300
you know,

947
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,149
obviously I worked for Red Hat previously and I

948
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:05,669
work for Elastic and we have even in general

949
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,340
problems,

950
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,280
software models around soft or uh sorry

951
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,610
business models around software even in the,

952
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,620
in the close source world are, are still not easy, like look how many fail

953
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,739
-- or don't do well, you know, when they have a spectacular product,
-- right?

954
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:17,939
It,

955
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:19,969
it's very true and I think this is one of

956
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:23,340
the reasons we see as a service being so popular.

957
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,580
But I,

958
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:25,449
I, I guess

959
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:30,110
here's kind of my view on this is I don't blame Brad

960
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,270
for the actions he's taken,

961
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:35,639
ignoring all of the other kind of tertiary

962
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:39,110
issues around co-operation and working with upstream and,

963
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,810
and things like that because

964
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,389
I can understand how degrading it is when

965
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:47,389
you're doing good work and you see other people

966
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,699
essentially just taking your good work and not properly

967
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:53,580
crediting you or rewarding you for what you've done

968
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,939
well. Or in some, I know with

969
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,500
NUS, there were consultants making tons of money using this thing to scan networks,

970
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,850
produce a report,

971
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,399
charge lots of money and like not even contribute

972
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:07,219
a dollar or a minute of effort back to

973
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:07,709
NUS

974
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:08,399
and,

975
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:08,899
you

976
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,070
know, and just tricky,

977
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,159
uh you know, it's, it's, it's disheartening and it's, it's, well, like I said,

978
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:17,479
you know, it's the tragedy of the commons, except in this case, you know,

979
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:20,340
the people who run the commons can be like, well, we're, we're, you know,

980
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,560
we're putting a fence around it,

981
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,199
right? And now,

982
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:27,959
II I kind of view this in the light of security

983
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:29,350
where

984
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,709
security is like the ultimate thankless project

985
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:35,669
where you have people working on this stuff and they

986
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,699
often get no real benefit back from what they're doing.

987
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:41,340
They aren't appreciated by the people, they're trying to help

988
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,699
and in many cases, they're seen as the bad guy.

989
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:47,149
And so it is very difficult

990
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,780
to kind of work in an environment like that.

991
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,949
And we don't have a good answer to it today.

992
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,530
I mean, you and I both know that,

993
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,129
that trying to get security built into products is super difficult and it's crazy,

994
00:40:58,139 --> 00:40:58,830
hard to do

995
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:00,350
I,

996
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,159
-- or
-- even get people to use CV S to

997
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:05,050
make it easier to identify the vulnerabilities when we're,

998
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,129
you know, talking about them.

999
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:10,600
-- Like, which one are you talking about?
-- Right. Yeah. Yeah. No, I, I agree completely.

1000
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,100
It's,

1001
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,350
this is a tricky one and I don't know what the answer is.

1002
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,429
I don't know if there will ever be an answer

1003
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,870
just because this, these are problems unlike any we've really, ever seen before.

1004
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,239
I mean, historically speaking,

1005
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,899
you had companies

1006
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,899
or, or organizations or whatever,

1007
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:28,659
that would make a thing and then people would buy the thing and that,

1008
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:31,969
that's kind of how it worked and that's, that's not how it is anymore.

1009
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:32,419
I mean,

1010
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:33,780
it is weird.

1011
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,439
Well, it kind of reminds me of like building codes, building codes are,

1012
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:40,270
I think a good idea in general because when you see what people will do,

1013
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,590
it's terrible.

1014
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:45,340
But building, you know, but what gets me is when they say build to code, you know,

1015
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,550
what they're actually saying is built to the legal minimum standards

1016
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,870
so we could get away with.

1017
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:50,229
In fact,

1018
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,870
that's really funny actually because I

1019
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:54,830
know some licensed plumbers and electricians

1020
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:55,909
and

1021
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,110
I was talking to them one day kind of about how they got their licenses

1022
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,590
and what that meant and everything and basically the tests they have to take,

1023
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,459
they have to know what the bare minimum is according to the code like that.

1024
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:09,820
That's how they passed their test. It's not about doing something. That's right.

1025
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:15,500
No, no, it's doing the absolute bare minimum to pass the inspection. It's like

1026
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:17,209
that's great.

1027
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,379
Well, to pass the inspection properly. Right.

1028
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:21,250
Because if you do more than is needed that

1029
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,850
it literally, I've seen cases where that might confuse the inspector and end up,

1030
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,520
-- you know, with a whole pile of her.
-- That would not surprise me.

1031
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:31,389
I, I would not doubt that at all. And

1032
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:34,110
anyway,

1033
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,280
it's heck in security. I take bare minimum at this point.

1034
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,209
-- I mean, we don't even have,
-- we haven't even defined a bare minimum.

1035
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,639
You know, we can't, like I said, we, well, we can't even

1036
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:44,550
agree on antivirus.

1037
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,800
Uh, actually, you know, this,

1038
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,520
this is a great transition to kind of the next

1039
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,969
story that came up and it sounds like a lot.

1040
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:52,520
You remember all the baby monitor,

1041
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,870
horrific stories from like a year ago where people

1042
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,629
were hacking into the baby monitors and whatnot.

1043
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,840
Well, it turns out that

1044
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,270
it sounds like a number of these companies are kind of

1045
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,389
cleaning up their act and they've added security to their products.

1046
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,790
And so there, there might be hope

1047
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,300
there might be. I'm not saying there is,

1048
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:09,020
but

1049
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,060
I think it's possible and, but then the question becomes

1050
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,590
so there, there's people saying, oh, you know, customer demand made them do this,

1051
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,909
which I'm sure it was part of that.

1052
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:20,909
But I wonder how much of it was really they just didn't even know this was a problem.

1053
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,389
I suspect there's a lot of that. I mean, what really blew me away many years ago.

1054
00:43:26,399 --> 00:43:28,750
Remember the huge Firestone tire recall?

1055
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:33,610
Yes. And what was most interesting to me about it? Was that on the news?

1056
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,629
They basically took a car, put like

1057
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:39,550
two or three bad tires on it and like a couple of good tires

1058
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,389
and then took it to like 10 or 20 different garages

1059
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,239
to see, you know,

1060
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:44,840
like

1061
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:48,500
what, you know, like, oh, I heard about the Firestone tire recall.

1062
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,580
Can you please check my tires and tell me if I like need to worry or not.

1063
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:54,760
And of course the answers they got range from like, oh, all your tires are good to,

1064
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,100
all your tires are bad too.

1065
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:58,159
Like the good tires were identified as bad tires and

1066
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,290
the bad tires were identified as good tires and like,

1067
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,679
you know, every single possible combination they're in.

1068
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,750
Right. And

1069
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:07,219
yeah, you know, it's, it's

1070
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,040
something as basic as here's a list of serial numbers. Please check them

1071
00:44:12,439 --> 00:44:14,530
people, you know, mess up right. And

1072
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:18,739
the industry as a whole didn't realize like the tire industry didn't realize like,

1073
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,159
oh, these garages, they're idiots

1074
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:22,870
like they can identify these things, you know.

1075
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:27,649
And so they went to, uh, my understanding now is that's why we have RF ID tags in tires

1076
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,629
-- is so that we can at least get the damn serial number off of them.
-- But

1077
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:32,370
even with that,

1078
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:36,120
how many garages have the equipment and software

1079
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:38,520
-- to read and interpret those RF ID
-- tags?

1080
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:39,389
I don't know,

1081
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:39,739
but

1082
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:41,370
it's a step in the right direction.

1083
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,159
It totally is. I agree with that. It totally,

1084
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,969
you know, I just, well,

1085
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:49,689
it's so funny story this weekend I was doing bicycle maintenance and on my bike,

1086
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:52,419
I took photos again of the serial number on my bike

1087
00:44:52,919 --> 00:44:55,260
and on my girlfriend's bike, I couldn't find the bloody serial number.

1088
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,419
-- There's no serial number stamped on her bike.
-- Is it like a cheap bike?

1089
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:00,100
It's a cheap bike.

1090
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:00,879
It's like,

1091
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,100
I just bought my kids a new bike. 100 and 40 bucks, you know, little kids bike.

1092
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,610
And it's got like a serial number.

1093
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,989
A $140 little kid bike. It's not a cheap bike.

1094
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,379
Like the cheap kids bikes are like 50 bucks.

1095
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,169
-- Yeah, I, I need something that will survive.
-- Well, I agree with you. I'm, I'm

1096
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:20,419
of paying lots of money for bicycles because you won't regret it.

1097
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:25,129
I actually was really, so the bike I have now, I think I paid like 500 bucks for.

1098
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,129
It wasn't, it wasn't cheap, it wasn't super expensive

1099
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:29,590
and it replaced a bike that was bought for me.

1100
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,860
That was one of those, like, like Walmart type bikes. Right. Really cheap.

1101
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:33,929
Not, not very good.

1102
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:34,830
And

1103
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,330
it lasted me,

1104
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,850
I think about a year and I just, like, destroyed it.

1105
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:41,489
Well, it's like lawn mowers now.

1106
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,620
-- Uh,
-- I

1107
00:45:42,629 --> 00:45:43,500
-- haven't
-- my lawn

1108
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,879
100 and $50 lawn mower and it might last one or two seasons.

1109
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:51,739
-- No,
-- no, I bought 100 I bought a lawn mower that cost $100 like, 10 years ago,

1110
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:53,040
10 years ago.

1111
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,739
I don't, I don't change the oil. Like, I don't do anything to this

1112
00:45:56,929 --> 00:45:57,719
and I've reached the point.

1113
00:45:57,729 --> 00:46:00,570
I'm like, some, it's just going to die and I'll accept that fate.

1114
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,149
No, I, I've got like a 15 year old lawnmower.

1115
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:05,889
My dad gave me his old lawnmower and it was a cheap lawn mower.

1116
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:07,530
But, you know, back in the day they were built,

1117
00:46:08,024 --> 00:46:08,504
well,

1118
00:46:08,514 --> 00:46:10,475
maybe we were looking at lawn mowers now and

1119
00:46:10,485 --> 00:46:12,735
like a decent lawnmower is going to cost 3,

1120
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:14,304
400 bucks and up.

1121
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:17,304
-- I,
-- that could be, I don't know, I haven't bought one in a long time.

1122
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:19,135
But, well, in this thing, even now, granted,

1123
00:46:19,145 --> 00:46:22,175
I've done a bunch of maintenance to keep it alive because cables fell off.

1124
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:23,344
Spark plugs are broken.

1125
00:46:23,354 --> 00:46:26,625
I've had to replace all the wheels more than, I mean, it was a crappy lawn mower.

1126
00:46:26,635 --> 00:46:27,935
But anyway, it's,

1127
00:46:28,195 --> 00:46:28,574
yeah,

1128
00:46:28,675 --> 00:46:30,985
I'm waiting for it to die. I haven't started it yet this year.

1129
00:46:30,995 --> 00:46:33,304
We'll see if it still works pretty soon.

1130
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:35,199
-- Yeah,
-- you

1131
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:35,949
-- gotta
-- love it though.

1132
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,090
But I also also,

1133
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,229
I wonder with these baby monitors if part of

1134
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,389
it is by adding security into the newer models,

1135
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,790
that sort of helps them obsolete the older models

1136
00:46:44,459 --> 00:46:45,469
because when you think about it, right.

1137
00:46:45,479 --> 00:46:47,590
Baby monitors are something that people typically buy,

1138
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,790
they only need them for like a year or two unless they're crazy people.

1139
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:55,350
And then quite often, you know, they give them to a friend who has a kid.

1140
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:56,250
So,

1141
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:58,639
you know, I don't know if we gave ours away.

1142
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,419
I had dumb baby monitors from back in the day

1143
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,100
and

1144
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:02,659
I

1145
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:03,379
didn't even

1146
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,870
-- bother with them.
-- Well, we had uh

1147
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,260
why, why did we need one?

1148
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,139
We, we would often the, the,

1149
00:47:09,149 --> 00:47:11,379
the room we were in to like watch TV in

1150
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:14,260
the evening was very far away from the child's room.

1151
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,770
And so it was handy for that or if we were like outside, whatever.

1152
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:18,300
But

1153
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,780
anyway, anyway,

1154
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:23,120
I also wonder if it's because these things are recording audio and video.

1155
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:25,679
Now we're starting to talk about wiretap laws and certain

1156
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,780
legalities that are, you know, just previously weren't present.

1157
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,379
I haven't heard of any of the legalities.

1158
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,810
It sounds like from what I've read in this story in this story.

1159
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,989
Granted, II,

1160
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,159
I don't think I'm gonna trust it a ton and

1161
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:39,020
I haven't found any kind of corroborating evidence behind it.

1162
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:40,620
But the point is,

1163
00:47:40,629 --> 00:47:42,969
I think the fact that this is even being talked about

1164
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:46,100
is a huge deal because even a year or two ago,

1165
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:50,090
like the concept of secure baby monitors was what,

1166
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,889
who, who are you talking about?

1167
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:54,969
And now, at least people vaguely understand the problem.

1168
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:55,899
Yeah.

1169
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,209
Well, it's true of most devices. I mean, the number,

1170
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,510
what really impressed me is when I bought that new router for my, uh,

1171
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,090
friend's parents.

1172
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:09,040
Um, it came with a sticker on the router and a sticker, the same sticker on the, uh,

1173
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:09,770
the booklet.

1174
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:13,830
And it had, I mean, what looks to me like a random password set.

1175
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,429
Very cool. Although I

1176
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:15,709
saw,

1177
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,479
I saw 11 time this was on a picture on the internet

1178
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:23,790
but the password was just the last eight characters of the Mac address.

1179
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:25,149
You know what?

1180
00:48:25,689 --> 00:48:28,419
That's not reasonably terrible in that.

1181
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:30,100
At least it can't be hacked over the internet.

1182
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:30,449
It's

1183
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,639
admin, admin. But still,

1184
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,800
and the nice thing too is you can, you can automate that right.

1185
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,060
You can have a script that reads the Mac address value

1186
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,040
-- and then it is true to that when it
-- is true.

1187
00:48:40,169 --> 00:48:41,760
It's not completely terrible,

1188
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:45,250
-- but
-- it's definitely better than a static password across the fleet,

1189
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,149
you know.

1190
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:49,120
Um, it's, it's so, it's a step in the right direction

1191
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:49,659
for sure.

1192
00:48:49,669 --> 00:48:53,310
I mean, now you're, you're limiting it to local physical Attackers essentially,

1193
00:48:53,919 --> 00:48:57,780
which is a, we'll say it's less exciting

1194
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:58,300
but

1195
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:00,449
still, well, it's thousands of people instead of

1196
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,689
all of the internet.

1197
00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:03,010
-- Yeah,
-- that's true. That's

1198
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,570
true. You know.

1199
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,530
So it's a definite improvement now, it's not ideal like this, you know, I, I,

1200
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,070
hopefully they did a unique password for each one of these routers that

1201
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,550
I bought and put the sticker on the router and on the,

1202
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:13,860
uh,

1203
00:49:14,189 --> 00:49:17,229
-- on the pamphlet.
-- Totally. That, and nobody would know.

1204
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:18,090
Exactly.

1205
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:20,110
Yeah.

1206
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:21,770
It's, I mean, part of me is, I mean,

1207
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,780
I think we were talking about this a few episodes ago but there were

1208
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:28,929
like $20 wireless routers at the store now and I'm so tempted to buy one

1209
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,889
just to see how terrible it is.

1210
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:31,790
You should,

1211
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,080
you should get it and drop it on the internet and

1212
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,300
do nothing and see how long it takes to get pumped.

1213
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:37,770
Well, I love that.

1214
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,530
I couldn't even trace down the Chinese manufacturer of this thing.

1215
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,489
Like when I googled the make and model and stuff,

1216
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:43,959
there's no result.

1217
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,030
How is that even possible?

1218
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:49,879
Like the only result was that, you know, on the website of the store it was on.

1219
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:50,449
So,

1220
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,090
anyway, anyway,

1221
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,500
whatever. All right, man, we should, we should bring it home.

1222
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,239
It's been, it's been fun.

1223
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,530
Oh, well, I don't know. What's, what's the verdict?

1224
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,830
Are we more or less doomed than we were before we started?

1225
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,189
I think awareness is,

1226
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,179
I do. I feel like things are starting to slightly move in the right direction.

1227
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:10,750
I don't feel like any of the stories we had today were, were terrible.

1228
00:50:10,879 --> 00:50:14,159
This actually comes back to that comment I made to you earlier about the,

1229
00:50:14,169 --> 00:50:15,949
the White House correspondents dinner,

1230
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,189
right?

1231
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,860
So I was watching the White House correspondents dinner and the, uh,

1232
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,159
the guy they had doing the main speech, uh,

1233
00:50:23,169 --> 00:50:26,870
from the Daily Show can't remember his name off hand and he gave the phrase,

1234
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:30,070
uh, that I thought was really interesting talking about the media

1235
00:50:30,189 --> 00:50:31,620
and about how

1236
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,219
trust is more important now than the truth.

1237
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:37,860
And I suspect maybe we're sort of getting

1238
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,909
to that point in information security and that

1239
00:50:39,959 --> 00:50:44,739
we've had a lot of smart people saying what is by and large the truth,

1240
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,060
but nobody really trusts or understands them

1241
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,919
and they haven't been super effective.

1242
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:51,679
That is

1243
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:53,719
probably reasonable.

1244
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:58,300
And, you know, if we do want to talk to normal people and sea level people and,

1245
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,989
you know, people making buying decisions,

1246
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:03,429
-- we need to have their trust.
-- That's a good point. It's kind of,

1247
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,679
otherwise we're just a bunch of crazy people

1248
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:07,830
yelling about random stuff that makes no sense.

1249
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:10,030
That is exactly true. And it's,

1250
00:51:10,219 --> 00:51:13,010
what is the quote from the big Lebowski, you know.

1251
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,070
Yes, you're right, Walter, you're still an asshole, but you're right.

1252
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:20,590
That's kind of what I feel like sometimes is we need to get over that and,

1253
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,639
-- and we
-- need to make sure

1254
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,070
the classic phrase you should have, you know,

1255
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,610
somebody comes to you with a security problem or something

1256
00:51:26,739 --> 00:51:29,020
bad happened and you're like, well, you should have made backups.

1257
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:29,959
That's not,

1258
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:30,929
you know,

1259
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:31,250
that's

1260
00:51:31,469 --> 00:51:31,500
not.

1261
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:32,280
Yeah.

1262
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,179
Ok.

1263
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:36,750
I know. I know. All right. Anyway, anyway, let's take it home, man. Uh

1264
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,429
Thank you everyone for listening. Thank you, Kurt. It was fun.

You too. Hope the weather is warm there.

1272
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:08,239
It's raining again. So I'll live anyway. That's better than snow.

1273
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,989
I know. All right, man. Take care.
