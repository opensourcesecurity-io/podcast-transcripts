Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,979
and my partner in

2
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,460
-- Kvetching about stuff, Josh Pressers.
-- That's all we ever do. I mean,

3
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,930
anyone who listens to us is well aware that just complaining is our only skill.

4
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,629
-- Yeah.
-- Well, but complaining is a valuable skill in, in.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,430
There's, I think there's two aspects to it is number one

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,409
complaining about the right thing

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,610
because a lot of people complain about the wrong thing,

8
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:33,699
right? They, they either

9
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:35,598
they complain about something and it's not the real problem.

10
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:36,819
There's like an underlying problem.

11
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:38,848
And number two complaining effectively,

12
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:45,430
I'm just gonna say no. If you have a complaint just be the change.

13
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:48,189
Well, I come back to see something, say something.

14
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:49,180
I mean,

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,389
maybe,

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:50,970
maybe

17
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,669
like Felix spotted a nail sticking out of the deck and he's like, dad,

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,630
there's a nail sticking out of the deck.

19
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,619
I'm like, awesome. And I pulled it and put a screw in.

20
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,180
That's when you teach him to get a hammer and

21
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,000
-- pound the nail down
-- the deck needs to be replaced.

22
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,110
It's the, you know, it's, it's, I think it's original to the house.

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,220
Like I've already replaced one third of the boards because, you know,

24
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,260
somebody sat in a chair and the chair went through the deck.

25
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,000
Epic. Right. And I'm just like, oh, yeah, that,

26
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:15,419
ok, I'm like, these boards are a bit more rotten than I thought.

27
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,610
So, I went around whacking them with a hammer, you know, and spray,

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,889
painting them orange and then

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,419
ripped out about a third of them. And then,

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,389
yeah,

31
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,269
so nobody falls to the deck anymore.

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,769
I mean, that seems like a feature of a deck you'd want to have.

33
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,410
Yes. Yeah. It's a good, it's a, it's a valuable feature.

34
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:33,370
Like, I think that's a valuable feature on most floors

35
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,970
don't fall off the floor right

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,110
through the floor

37
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:41,470
is falling through the floor the same as falling off the floor.

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,900
No, those are different

39
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,010
because generally when you fall off the floor, you're not gonna, like,

40
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,330
fall a story into, you know, whatever's under the deck,

41
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:53,029
-- which is probably leftover construction debris
-- anyway.

42
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,069
Anyway.

43
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,459
All right. What are we talking about today?

44
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,769
I'm always shocked at some of these big vendors

45
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:00,989
that have lots of money and still manage to,

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,430
you know,

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,110
instructions on clear house on fire. Right.

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,819
Like, they just managed to make such a hash of a problem that

49
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,669
shouldn't be that difficult.

50
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,110
And it's something, you know, in this case it's, it's bug bounties and bug, like

51
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:14,740
accepting bug reports

52
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,660
and then doing something with them

53
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,110
so that, well, we're going to, I thought we're going to focus on Apple.

54
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,770
But I mean, Microsoft recently had that where, you know,

55
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,660
a Microsoft VP went off on the guy who reported a bug

56
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:28,779
publicly went off on him and his linkedin and the guy's like,

57
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:31,619
look, you know, you were told about this bug five years ago.

58
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,660
-- There's like a US C certain number for it.
-- I have not seen that one.

59
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,740
It's, it's a credential exposure with Microsoft Exchange.

60
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,220
-- Ok.
-- Story of the creds leaking exchange. Auto Discover flaw.

61
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,860
The one Microsoft wouldn't fix even after five years.

62
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,889
So,

63
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,509
yeah, like last week the security firm called Guarico.

64
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:49,770
This, it's a,

65
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,860
there's an auto Discover protocol where you can basically

66
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:54,979
connect out to an exchange server and like,

67
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,440
give it your credentials and see if it has an email for you.

68
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:01,169
That sounds really safe.

69
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,229
I, I, yeah, I know. I'm like, what I'm like, don't you just

70
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:06,820
configure your, I don't know, whatever.

71
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,979
And apparently it, like, doesn't check the host certificates properly or,

72
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:13,619
and somebody pointed out even if it does check those certificates, you know,

73
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,740
like it is possible to get a certificate that's valid

74
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:21,020
easily. Like it's called getting a certificate

75
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,259
anyways.

76
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,710
Right. And so, you know, this guy goes off and it's like Microsoft, like

77
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,539
you were told,

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,789
I, I think what really gets me is ok. They were told about this issue five years ago.

79
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,750
They have never fixed it

80
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,539
and it's, it's been long enough that they've kind of forgotten about it.

81
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,389
So, when somebody kind of re reports it to them, they're like, oh, my God, this is new.

82
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:38,610
You know,

83
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,210
you have to, you have to behave in a certain way this, with this flaw.

84
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,300
And it's like, but it's been public for five years

85
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,690
and it's just

86
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,399
wait, is it, was, it, was it public? Public?

87
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,179
Yeah.

88
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,309
So it was public and then some research

89
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,720
company just wrote a report about a public flaw

90
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,289
and then someone from Microsoft got mad about that.

91
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,100
Basically. Yeah,

92
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,289
that's stupid.

93
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,850
-- So
-- here we go on August 10th, 2016,

94
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,619
Marco Van

95
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,830
Beek, managing director at UK based it consultancy supporting role,

96
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:12,039
emailed the Microsoft Security Response Center to disclose an auto

97
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,089
discover exploit that worked with

98
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,929
multiple email clients including Microsoft outlook

99
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,770
quote.

100
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:16,130
Basically,

101
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,790
I've discovered that it is extremely easy to

102
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,649
get access to exchange and therefore active directory,

103
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,010
user passwords in plain text unquote.

104
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,339
He said wrote quote,

105
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,410
it doesn't necessarily require any breach of corporate security.

106
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,140
I know it's most secure is only as secure

107
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,269
as file level access to the corporate website unquote.

108
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,369
His report received a case number from Microsoft and a reference number from us.

109
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,769
Cert,

110
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,380
so I don't know that it was public public,

111
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,559
but like us cert knew about it and gave it a number

112
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,250
-- but
-- still five years.

113
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,329
I mean, if you don't fix something in five years,

114
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,899
you clearly don't care about it it can go public.

115
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:42,920
Yeah.

116
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,880
Well, it either doesn't matter. It's like inconsequential or.

117
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,570
Well, I mean, if you, yeah, if you're not going to fix it after I would say five months,

118
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,559
let alone five years.

119
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:53,350
Yeah.

120
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,440
So Microsoft, some people at Microsoft, you know, had their tantrum and it's like,

121
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,040
yeah, I'm sorry, this isn't how this works.

122
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:01,579
No, I, I agree. I don't, this isn't a story even. This is like Microsoft.

123
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,869
Honestly, they're probably mad because they look dumb.

124
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,950
They're probably not mad because anything got disclosed.

125
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,579
I mean, the same thing is happening with Apple, right?

126
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:12,440
Like Apple's bug bounty people are reading between the lines.

127
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,320
It sounds like Apple. Bug bounty doesn't pay out a lot of money.

128
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:16,959
No. No, it doesn't.

129
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:21,359
I mean, Apple has historically been adversarial to security researchers.

130
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:22,279
This isn't new.

131
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,489
Even before they had a bug bounty.

132
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:28,109
It was very difficult to get them to take security reports seriously.

133
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,059
They've tried to,

134
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,059
or they've essentially tried to shut down that

135
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,959
company that makes the I OS emulator that,

136
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,019
you know, is really popular with security researchers.

137
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:38,265
-- Uh, they did, they, no, I don't think they did shut
-- them

138
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:38,605
down.

139
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:39,605
They tried to shut them down.

140
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:41,084
Tried very grossly.

141
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:42,734
The other thing is like Apple,

142
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:47,054
if there's a company that has no excuse for not paying high dollar bug bounties.

143
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:52,195
Apple now has 100 and 95.57 billion in cash on hand up 2% from last quarter.

144
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:54,595
Well, yeah, because they're not paying bug bounties with it.

145
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,269
I OK. So there's a couple of pieces to this,

146
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:03,619
all of this I think and including the new Microsoft story is there is

147
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,119
the concept of vulnerability disclosure

148
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:10,130
and this is when a researcher tells you about a thing

149
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,769
and then you have to do something with the thing.

150
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,239
Ok. Five years is unacceptable. Ok. So there's that

151
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:20,320
there's the angle of just the interactions between the researcher and the company

152
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:26,470
and then there's the bug bounty aspect, which is I would say the newest of the three,

153
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,989
but also hugely interesting.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,600
And I guess there's kind of 1/4 which is the black market,

155
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,500
which is where a researcher can just be like screw apple.

156
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,779
I'm going to go sell this thing to zero DM or whoever

157
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,100
and make a crap ton of money.

158
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:42,089
Most security firms and researchers have actually become quite a

159
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,019
bit more professional over the last decade or two.

160
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,459
And

161
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,459
it's sort of like Apple and Microsoft

162
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,260
are, they're not consistent.

163
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:54,619
Maybe that's what it is is their lack of consistency because you think at this point,

164
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,049
like a company, the size of Apple or Microsoft would be applying six Sigma to their,

165
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,140
like when we worked at Red Hat, we handled how many thousands of bugs a year.

166
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:06,940
At that point, you have to industrialize, apply six Sigma best practices, you know,

167
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,260
and you, you reduce variance.

168
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:12,350
You, you try to improve the process because honestly,

169
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:16,179
if you squeak out a 1% improvement across a couple of 1000 bucks, that's a big deal.

170
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,489
I heard at one point and I don't remember where I heard this

171
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:26,350
but the micro, the security at microsoft.com account gets 500,000 males a year,

172
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,950
which I totally believe.

173
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,709
Think about that. How many people do you need to deal with 500,000 males in a year.

174
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,399
What is that per day? Let's check on the

175
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,279
14,

176
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,290
1300.

177
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,829
I don't know. Let's, let's, let's do the math.

178
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:48,829
500,000 divided by 365 equals 1369.8 emails per day

179
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:51,339
per day.

180
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,200
Yeah.

181
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,299
Also I'm a note that you're running, it's 1369.9

182
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,250
whatever 0.86

183
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,589
you're an engineer basically.

184
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:01,179
I don't care.

185
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,890
But uh yeah, I mean, and, and

186
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,679
well, and that's the thing that gets me is, yeah,

187
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,700
you're the size of Microsoft. That's a gnarly problem.

188
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:13,230
Too bad. Like you get to go deal with that.

189
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,140
Well, I mean, look when you become a, the larger your company becomes,

190
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,220
you obviously need certain infrastructure.

191
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,399
I mean,

192
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,190
you think about the toilet paper budget at Microsoft

193
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,230
probably exceeds the annual revenue of most companies.

194
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,670
-- You know,
-- even more to the point

195
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:30,859
most of the people Microsoft is dealing with.

196
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,380
It's let me put it this way when somebody

197
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,219
emails me claiming to be a security researcher.

198
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,799
It takes me about all of 10 seconds

199
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,869
to determine if they're like a legitimate security

200
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,659
researcher or not because they will have a

201
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,520
massive online footprint if they're truly legitimate.

202
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,690
And so that means then you have a lot of the potential for like diamonds in the rough.

203
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,440
Like a no coming in with something new.

204
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,229
-- And
-- I want, I have one complaint.

205
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,200
I want to interrupt you and interject here is I deal with

206
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,719
secure the security address at work

207
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:02,080
and there's nothing more annoying to me when they mail like legal at, with a,

208
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm a security researcher and it's like,

209
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:07,250
maybe you could have freaking researched the security at email address.

210
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,919
Dude. I literally drive me crazy.

211
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:11,450
Yeah,

212
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,510
I generally speaking when somebody sends a

213
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,789
security report to not our security address,

214
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,020
like we have security at cloud security lines.org for security reports,

215
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,059
I, I cannot make it simpler than that.

216
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,940
Well, except I can,

217
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,099
we also have a security dot TXT that

218
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:27,320
says to email security at cloud security alliance.org

219
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,400
again.

220
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,960
I don't know how much simpler I can make it

221
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,080
except I think it's also on a web page somewhere.

222
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,669
But

223
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,270
yeah, like when a security researcher can't,

224
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:38,400
like when they email support with something, I'm just like

225
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:43,000
the chances of this being like something legitimate are so close to zero

226
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:44,520
and

227
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,880
so far it's, yeah,

228
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,799
so of that 500,000 emails, you know,

229
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,330
a couple 100 or 1000 of them are going to be from

230
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,840
people they know already who are on their top 20 bug bounty.

231
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,109
So you listen to those people, you know,

232
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,179
somebody like Tavio emails you and you Google Tavio

233
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:03,020
plus, you know, vulnerability. It's kind of like, oh,

234
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,190
we should probably brew a new pot of coffee

235
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,210
if you're accepting vulnerability reports and you don't know

236
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:10,760
who most of the Google project zero people are.

237
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,270
Like,

238
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,260
you should probably figure that out.

239
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,650
I'm actually kind of shocked only, oh, you know what I was gonna say,

240
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,760
there's only 16,000 results for him in vulnerability.

241
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,580
But the second one is his Wikipedia page.

242
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:21,719
So that's the thing.

243
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:22,659
If you're dealing with the security

244
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,229
vulnerability researcher who has a Wikipedia page

245
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,659
make two.

246
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,460
This is the thing, right? This is not hard to do for a large company.

247
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,179
Well, I, I think that's,

248
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,109
I, I think it is hard to do.

249
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,710
I think it's hard to do well and I think just because you're

250
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:43,780
a large company doesn't necessarily mean you should be good at it.

251
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:44,429
I think

252
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,929
this is very much a cultural thing.

253
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,619
And I think if you look at the, like if you look at the culture of Microsoft,

254
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,659
I think their security

255
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,260
gravitas has improved greatly.

256
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,419
But I mean, they still have a ways to go and everyone does for sure.

257
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,619
And, but I do think that when they deal with, with vulnerability researchers,

258
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,859
they do better than most

259
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,159
is my experience now we look at Apple. Apple has a long history of not

260
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,159
working well with anybody.

261
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,380
So I don't think it's clearly a cultural matter, right.

262
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,630
Where they don't want to pay researchers, they don't want to talk to researchers,

263
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,229
they don't want to do any of this stuff.

264
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:25,039
And historically, that was it. Right. You tell Apple something. Apple's like.

265
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:25,909
We don't care.

266
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,479
Now what? Right.

267
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,619
But now with the zero day market, I think this has been turned on its head and I,

268
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:35,164
I think Apple needs to do some serious soul searching in this space.

269
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:35,645
Well,

270
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,875
it's interesting because I was doing some worldly mapping around

271
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:40,565
the whole vulnerability thing and it boils down to.

272
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:41,604
There are two

273
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:43,114
user cases

274
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:45,984
for vulnerabilities. There are the people that want to fix it.

275
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,695
So they're like operationally responsible for a system that is vulnerable,

276
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:49,294
they want to fix it.

277
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:50,965
So it's not vulnerable and life goes on.

278
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:51,705
Right?

279
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:53,275
And then the second group

280
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,130
is the people who want to exploit those

281
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,349
vulnerabilities for typically bad reasons like ransomware.

282
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,280
That's, well,

283
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,719
there's actually an enormous amount

284
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:08,119
of state sponsored vulnerability purchasing.

285
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,280
-- Yes,
-- I would count them as the bad guys.

286
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:13,640
There's a book actually, I we should, we should read, I'm reading it now.

287
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,520
You should read it and we should talk about it someday.

288
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,780
But it's called, this is how they Tell me the World Ends by Nicole Plot.

289
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,395
I'll put a link in the show notes,

290
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:23,275
but like anyone interested in this topic needs to read this book.

291
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,645
It is frightening

292
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:26,195
for all the wrong reasons.

293
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:26,794
Basically,

294
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:29,715
it boils down to the people who want to fix it and the people who want to exploit it,

295
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:30,955
you know, and all the scanning and,

296
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:33,054
and all the pen testing companies are effectively in

297
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:34,445
support of the people who want to fix it.

298
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:34,775
Right.

299
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:38,875
The problem is, does that? Yeah, up until recently, there was

300
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:42,434
no path, no easy path to monetization

301
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:44,914
for vulnerabilities. Not really no.

302
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:45,945
-- And
-- now there is,

303
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,390
I mean, well, there's two, there's bug bounties

304
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:51,640
and they're selling the exploits

305
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:58,820
and the exploit market is probably 10 to 100 times the payout of a bug bounty,

306
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,739
plus they're probably less hassle to deal with.

307
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,700
Uh

308
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,460
It would not shock me if they are. I mean,

309
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,690
there is, I would say the bar is similar

310
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,150
for the burden of proof for each of them because I know, I mean, I, I work with

311
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:12,284
a

312
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:17,385
bug bunny like we have one at work. I talked to hacker one on a regular basis.

313
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:22,065
And there is definitely an expectation that when you are the hacker reporting a bug,

314
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:25,875
if you, for example, provide a weaponized exploit for the bug,

315
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:29,044
you're probably going to make a lot more money than if you say, hey, oh,

316
00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:32,875
I found this bug in your stuff and you don't have a good reproducer, right?

317
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,034
The odds are high,

318
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:35,655
you're never going to see a dime from

319
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:38,145
that same thing obviously in an exploit market where

320
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,349
if you go to an exploit broker and you're like, oh, I found a buffer overflow.

321
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,760
They're gonna be like whatever nerd.

322
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,400
But if you're like, OK, I have like a functional exploit that gets me shell,

323
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,640
they're gonna be like, please come inside.

324
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,520
Let's talk.

325
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,270
Yeah.

326
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,760
Well, you know, it's the difference between saying, hey Edmonton,

327
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,400
there's a pothole in the road and hey Edmonton,

328
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:59,820
there's a very specific bad pothole causing problems at this exact location.

329
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,530
-- If a truck can fall in it, you know, there's a problem.
-- Exactly.

330
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,590
So,

331
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,570
and, well, the other thing I find really interesting is that

332
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:14,570
bug bounties will only exist if that company decides to pay for it,

333
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,130
right?

334
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:17,609
The odds of some other

335
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,210
entity funding a bug bounty for good.

336
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:24,460
It kind of happens, but it's more at the level of like, um,

337
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:26,979
eyesight or eye defense where they basically would pay a

338
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:29,299
bug bounty for vulnerabilities then go to the vendor.

339
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:31,859
But they would leverage that vulnerability as part of their, you know,

340
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,179
the service of reporting vulnerabilities to their clients.

341
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,979
Or uh there was that HP thing where they, they built a network product that, you know,

342
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:40,539
was a intrusion prevention

343
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,799
system. IP S

344
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,940
that they would buy zero days, create a signature to block it and then tell the vendor

345
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,020
and, you know, their whole thing was like, essentially, it kind of struck me as like

346
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,809
Hey, you know,

347
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,750
that's an awful nice window you've got there and

348
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,789
somebody over here found a pile of bricks.

349
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,020
Yeah, it'd be a real shame.

350
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,479
So,

351
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,760
so there is another, actually, there's another piece of this

352
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,099
that I didn't mention at the beginning is there's also the angle of like,

353
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:06,739
what do we do about open source?

354
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:09,320
And actually hacker one just announced the,

355
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,059
it's internet bug money two or something they called it.

356
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,330
I'll try to dig up a link to it,

357
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,140
but basically they're, they're funding.

358
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,359
Well, there's a bunch of companies that are dumping money into a bucket

359
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,700
and then they're using that bucket to fund

360
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,500
hackers finding flaws in critical open source packages,

361
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,500
which is really cool

362
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,159
the

363
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:28,849
whole eu

364
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:31,844
thing all over again. Right? Like, like we pointed out is

365
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:35,585
it doesn't matter how much these companies want to help. They can't

366
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,895
really, other than here's a like, oh,

367
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:39,784
we can write a check to this organization that'll then

368
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:42,424
eventually filter it down to bug reports that get fixed.

369
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:42,854
Ok.

370
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,585
That's better than nothing.

371
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,969
I mean, it, it's something this is,

372
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:50,869
I think this is going to be one of the challenges we see in open source is

373
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,190
there's so much

374
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,619
effort that's needed.

375
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,900
I think in a lot of these spaces and it's really hard to work with some of these people.

376
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,380
And I mean, I don't know what the answer is.

377
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,239
I'm not going to even speculate at this point,

378
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,630
but I I do think this is one of the next challenges we, we have to solve.

379
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:06,570
Well, we have to,

380
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,909
that's one thing I'm grateful for Red Hat.

381
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,030
But they taught me about sustainability and open source. Right.

382
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,570
That's a big mantra at Red Hat.

383
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:15,549
Yeah. Right. Don't strip mine it like

384
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:16,909
you got to cooper.

385
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,830
And so I think in general open source as such as generally sustainable and it's ok,

386
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,669
like it's, it's been pretty healthy for the last 20 years.

387
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,520
I think we're ok.

388
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,989
I do worry a bit about some of the cloud companies strip mining it, but whatever.

389
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,419
But,

390
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,950
but security is a little bit different and a little bit

391
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,919
harder because there's a whole bunch of different incentives and problems.

392
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,950
And I was saying,

393
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:41,669
well, to me it's a, it's a slightly more complicated subset of open source, right,

394
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,349
with its own

395
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,289
new set of problems

396
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:45,000
and,

397
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,780
yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure. I don't think there is one answer per se.

398
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:51,500
I think it will take probably dozens of different efforts.

399
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,200
And I, you know, note, I'm not saying education because, yeah,

400
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,200
because we'll just train our way out of this problem.

401
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,590
-- That'll work.
-- It's always worked before. Yeah,

402
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,159
exactly.

403
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:02,539
The last 50 years it's been awesome.

404
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,329
-- But no, I, I think part of it is, you know, things like bug bounties using rust
-- anyway.

405
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,118
All right. I, I think, I think we've gone off into the weeds in a direction.

406
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,219
I don't like I want to go back to

407
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,270
interacting with researchers from a like

408
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,848
vulnerability disclosure perspective because I've seen

409
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,489
every possible reaction to researchers. You can imagine

410
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,880
everything from companies being hostile to them, from companies welcoming them.

411
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,209
In one of my favorite is when you report something they're like, oh, this is great.

412
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,489
Thank you so much for the report and then you never hear from them again. And like

413
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,930
there's, there's so many pieces to this and, and this is one that's,

414
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,339
it is a difficult problem.

415
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,089
And in fact, we were just talking the other,

416
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:48,614
the Linux foundation just published like a vulnerability disclosure handbook,

417
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:49,375
which

418
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:53,694
is, it's ok. Like it's got a lot of weird stuff in it, but,

419
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,564
-- well,
-- it's like 20 years late.

420
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:56,385
Yeah, it is.

421
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:57,324
I mean, I think they,

422
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:59,915
they wrote a vulnerability disclosure handbook

423
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,814
for vulnerability disclosure in 2005.

424
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:03,354
But that's kind of another problem. But

425
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:03,944
like,

426
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:06,415
and this is one of the challenges I think is

427
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:10,515
the world changes so fast and so much and it,

428
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,949
it is difficult to keep track.

429
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,680
-- The
-- world is so inconsistent, especially in the open source world. Like

430
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:19,489
there's everything from the Apache foundation to a guy doing the

431
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,609
time zone file who got sued by that Crazy Astronomy Company.

432
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,969
-- Oh,
-- there's a new complaint I read about the time. This is really funny.

433
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,949
So apparently

434
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,250
I'll try to find the I this, I forget where I even found this.

435
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,550
It was on Reddit or something. But

436
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,959
so the time zone guy has a bunch of people mad at

437
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:39,869
him because I think it's the Belgian time zone before the A PC

438
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,280
in 1970 obviously, the names of time zones and time and everything is kind of a mess.

439
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,989
And apparently they decided

440
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,410
like the Belgian, no, Austria, Austria.

441
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,869
Um, um,

442
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,270
yeah, I think it's the Austrian time zone.

443
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,790
The time zone people decided was just Germany before 1970.

444
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,589
And now a bunch of people in Austria are really mad at them and

445
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:01,829
it's like,

446
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,780
it's apparently breaking certain things because of the way

447
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,020
it's returning the time zone name and it's just,

448
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:07,699
it's, I,

449
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,229
I laughed out loud when I read it because it,

450
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,510
I'm sure it's really important to these people.

451
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,949
-- But, well,
-- in fairness there, there is a bit of history there around, you know,

452
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,890
the

453
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,219
naming of parts of.

454
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:21,469
Yeah.

455
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:21,859
Yeah.

456
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:23,180
Yeah.

457
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:27,079
Yeah. Anyway, anyway, I'll, I'll try to dig it up and I'll put it in the show notes.

458
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:29,020
But, but anyway, so you are

459
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:32,949
now, I want to say the concept in the open source world,

460
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:36,170
especially of there being like companies dealing with an individual people,

461
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,619
you're dealing with or not companies, but like foundations and individual people

462
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,839
is nothing new.

463
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:41,290
In fact,

464
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,050
I think there are more individual people today than there have ever

465
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,609
been because if you look at like the node package manager ecosystem,

466
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,449
it has millions of packages that there are probably

467
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:55,530
hundreds of thousands of people who own node packages.

468
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,089
That's

469
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,250
amazing

470
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,369
-- and terrifying.
-- Well, I mean, part of it is

471
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:05,280
honestly, some of these software packages don't really need more than one person.

472
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,150
Some of them are pretty simple.

473
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,030
Like I remember looking at one,

474
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,160
it was called American Date and it took a perfectly normal fine

475
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,380
time stamp and mangled it into month, day, year.

476
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:20,180
-- And I stand by my words, which is the
-- worst format. I'm not.

477
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:25,390
Although I will say I also hate day, month, year, year, month, day is the only format.

478
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,260
-- Anything else is wrong.
-- That's how I'm bringing up my Children.

479
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,520
And it's funny because

480
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:29,819
that's

481
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,219
right sometimes. Yeah, I anyways,

482
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,229
that's right there. It's the only date format like at me on Twitter, I'll,

483
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:37,920
I

484
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,069
care about this enough. Like I will, I will ride this ship down.

485
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:44,109
But

486
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,000
I just

487
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,300
anyway, but no, you, you're absolutely right. I think

488
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,150
the,

489
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,469
a lot of things, it's ok. It's one person,

490
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:58,390
but at the same time now we have the challenge of if I'm a person working in my free time

491
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:01,550
and I get a security vulnerability report and I know

492
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,910
you're going now tell the story about what the XML D

493
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,109
thing with Red Hat and a guy worked on the weekend. But like

494
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,959
this is a legitimate issue of, if I'm busy,

495
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,650
I'm not gonna fix it right now.

496
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,260
But here's the other frustrating part is a lot of these security vulnerabilities.

497
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:20,859
I can literally count on one hand, the number of security vulnerabilities that

498
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:24,319
essentially an initial look at it. Oh OK. So the solution is X,

499
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,030
right? The vast majority of security vulnerabilities I've ever seen

500
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,709
have a very

501
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,239
generally simple solution.

502
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,829
And the, the examples,

503
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,890
the essentially the only two counter examples I

504
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,790
can really think of are bash shell shock

505
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:40,000
where that thing turned out to be a bit more complicated than we thought.

506
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:42,339
And the Linux stack guard stuff, right where, you know,

507
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:45,349
Wallace did amazing work and was like, I think we can, you know, one

508
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:48,800
megabyte uh guard pages and everybody was kind of like, yeah,

509
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,410
that sounds about right.

510
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,739
And then of course, Florian was like,

511
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,369
oh look at what I found and we're all like, damn it,

512
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,260
you know, OK. And it took, you know,

513
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,545
a lot of engineering effort to fix.

514
00:21:57,744 --> 00:22:00,714
And I guess then the other example I can think of would be, you know,

515
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:03,094
some of the CPU based stuff like meltdown and stuff where,

516
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:07,354
and that was more and that was more a case of fixing. The problem is easy

517
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:11,234
fixing the problem. So you don't cripple the CPU with a 20% performance hit.

518
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:13,385
-- Oh,
-- that's tricky.

519
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:14,810
But basically

520
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:18,500
that's literally 20 or 30 vulnerabilities over the last two decades.

521
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,020
There aren't a lot. I agree. I think many of them are easy.

522
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,430
And so what I'm getting at though is for the majority of vulnerability

523
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,839
reports in general.

524
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:29,670
If a security researcher is competent enough to understand

525
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,500
a code base to find a vulnerability in it,

526
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:33,670
I would say probably nine times out of 10,

527
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,500
they should be competent enough to come up with a reasonable patch for it.

528
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,400
I mean, some of them do. Some of them don't though. I mean, I, I,

529
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:42,800
one of my pet peeves,

530
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,680
I remember when there would be researchers who would

531
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:48,520
mail the old vendor sech mailing list with a,

532
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,760
here's like 1000 font files.

533
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,469
I does that crash? True type

534
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:57,180
fix them? Like what? No, like this is ridiculous. And of course it was two bugs.

535
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:58,959
But, well, my favorite was when they,

536
00:22:58,969 --> 00:23:02,760
they wanted me to triage and CV them and fix them and I'm like, no, come back and,

537
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,760
and the person would come back three days later with like,

538
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,819
oh, it's

539
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:10,459
one bug and it's a doss, it's not exploitable. And I'm like, thank you for playing.

540
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:13,239
-- Now.
-- Now I'm gonna, I also want to add

541
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,660
that if you're a security researcher

542
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,859
and you find a bug, like you don't owe anyone a patch.

543
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:19,780
I mean,

544
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:21,714
that's part of the challenge is like, yes,

545
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:25,415
it is extremely polite and helpful if you show up with a patch or,

546
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:27,964
or work with the project to get it fixed.

547
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:33,354
Now, I will say this is true for open source. If you go to Apple with a bug,

548
00:23:33,535 --> 00:23:34,984
you can't give them a patch.

549
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,550
Uh You could give him a binary patch in theory.

550
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,449
-- But yeah, realistically, but
-- you can't know no one's going to use that.

551
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,209
That is not realistic.

552
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:43,709
But the point is as well.

553
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:47,189
When you see a company like Apple that has huge buckets of money,

554
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,430
I think the expectation is very different and I think it should be different.

555
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:55,109
And I think the story about the way Apple handled these bugs

556
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,109
like

557
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,650
this is

558
00:23:58,569 --> 00:23:59,390
it is

559
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:02,430
it is negligence on the part of a company like Apple.

560
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:07,109
I think, I think the, the expectation from them should be higher and I think

561
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,239
they're not living up to it.

562
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,449
It kind of reminds me of, uh, remember all the tire recalls about, oh jeez,

563
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:16,449
this is over a decade ago and then that's why they started sticking RF ID

564
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,469
tags and tires because I remember specifically watching

565
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,569
the CBS evening news with Dan rather,

566
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,020
although I think it was Connie Chung at that point.

567
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,969
But anyways, they did that investigative report, they put like, what was it?

568
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:25,119
Like,

569
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,020
two out of the four tires were supposed to be

570
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,209
recalled and they took it to like six different tire shops

571
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,619
and, you know, they got answers from, they're all

572
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,680
bad to none are bad to like the two that are good

573
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,709
or bad and the two that are bad or good and like,

574
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:37,089
just

575
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,510
like this, this is stuff that can kill people,

576
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,300
you know.

577
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,209
Well, and it was killing people

578
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,560
and I I view software. You know, we're getting to a point.

579
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:44,709
Well,

580
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:47,469
my favorite story right now is that whole Tesla thing where Tesla is rolling

581
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:50,579
out the self driving feature to quote unquote drivers with a high safety score,

582
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,520
whatever that means,

583
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,150
so that they can start using this beta

584
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,250
feature of like self driving and crowd environments.

585
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,925
And it's kind of like, I've noticed that the whole, what is it,

586
00:24:57,935 --> 00:25:00,165
the Batter Meinhof effect where you think of

587
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,875
something and you start noticing it all the time

588
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:05,285
and I've started noticing that there's actually quite a few Tesla cars in Edmonton,

589
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:09,204
-- there's just a lot of them everywhere
-- and I'm not really sure,

590
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:12,494
I'm comfortable being on the road with something that's beta testing,

591
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:13,645
self driving software.

592
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,550
So here's,

593
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,589
here's what I keep putting in my brain is

594
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,869
I think that is the normal expected reaction but

595
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,099
is

596
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,709
a Tesla beta car

597
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:31,930
safer than a human driver because human drivers are hilariously bad.

598
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,630
And that is the question I would like to know the answer to.

599
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,609
Well, and unfortunately, that data though, unless it's spectacularly awesome,

600
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:40,910
Tesla won't release it.

601
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,890
I, I don't think

602
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,819
anyone would ever release that particular data because I feel like

603
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,609
it is going to be full of dragons and monsters.

604
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:51,050
Well, I mean,

605
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,959
Google had that incident of why are our self driving cars getting rear ended so much?

606
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,530
And the answer is because you're actually reporting every crash,

607
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:58,250
whereas

608
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,229
there's a lot of rear ends where people don't report it because, like,

609
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:05,719
I literally got rear ended twice by a pregnant woman in space of 30 seconds.

610
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:08,739
Like, she kind of bumped me. I was stopped and she kind of just lurched into me

611
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,849
and then, like, lurched into me again

612
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,079
and, like,

613
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,130
basically left a dust imprint on the back of my car. I,

614
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:20,880
I own a very old pickup truck that is in terrible shape and I've been bumped into many,

615
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,400
many times.

616
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm like, I don't even care like whatever.

617
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,939
But when I think about it, I know for sure there's two or three rear end collisions,

618
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:29,050
I could have reported that I

619
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:30,420
just never bothered to.

620
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:32,369
I suspect that it's, well,

621
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,849
my favorite is Canada's worst driver where they

622
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,180
had this one person who essentially had been in

623
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:38,689
something like 40 or 50 accidents and thought that

624
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:41,050
that was normal and then they're asking everybody,

625
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,930
you know, is this normal?

626
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:45,699
And they're like, no, I've only been in one accident or zero accidents

627
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:48,030
and this poor lady was working three jobs trying

628
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,630
to pay off all these debts from these collisions

629
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,479
and, but it was just insane like it was just

630
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,609
anyway, anyway, vulnerability disclosure.

631
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:58,680
Well, and that's the thing like vulnerability disclosure, these companies now,

632
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,280
I,

633
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,800
so we know how many vulnerabilities are sort of publicly reported,

634
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,329
how many vulnerabilities were privately reported and sat on or ignored

635
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,030
and how many vulnerabilities were found, but just sort of uh whatever.

636
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,540
-- I don't
-- care or how many have been reported

637
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,689
in private to a intelligent agency or something.

638
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:19,420
I mean, look at like the NSO group,

639
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,209
they were talking about this, how all of these groups,

640
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:25,800
like the NSO group try to maintain a 2 to 3 deep vulnerability pipeline,

641
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:27,239
I'm sure because,

642
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,359
yeah, they don't want to, you know, oh, our vulnerability got fixed. Ok.

643
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:32,660
Our product doesn't work for three months while we find a new vulnerability.

644
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,319
Exactly

645
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:36,760
what drives me nuts is, oh, this was on Twitter. But somebody basically said that

646
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:41,390
Safari on iphones had more zero days than say Firefox. How do we know that?

647
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,405
Because there's more zero days publicly reported.

648
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:44,125
And it's like, yeah,

649
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:48,885
because nobody's looking for zero days in Firefox as much because like, it's not

650
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:50,444
available on the iphone.

651
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,204
Like there's, there's no market for it.

652
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:57,564
-- I,
-- I think it is dangerous to claim one application is more secure than another.

653
00:27:57,574 --> 00:27:59,685
I don't think there, there. That's true at all.

654
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:02,204
Especially based on highly biased public data.

655
00:28:02,454 --> 00:28:03,324
Right. Right.

656
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:04,344
The thing is,

657
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:06,209
guess how many

658
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,420
CV ES there are for Firefox.

659
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,170
-- It's over 2000.
-- I, I believe that. I mean, I remember

660
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,930
so a long time ago

661
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,459
I worked with them on their releases because for whatever reason,

662
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:21,229
when I was at redhead, I got suckered into doing all the Firefox security updates.

663
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:22,349
And

664
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,829
I remember I assigned all their CV ES for a long

665
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,119
time and it would usually be 5 to 10 per release.

666
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,550
And that was,

667
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:32,689
I mean, one a month basically, I think back then

668
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:33,369
like

669
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:34,250
it's,

670
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,410
that's a lot.

671
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,609
That's a lot, man.

672
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:39,410
And so if a, if a, if a code base is large,

673
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,849
it has vulnerabilities and if a code base

674
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:44,339
is large and has 2000 plus known vulnerabilities,

675
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:45,729
there's more,

676
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:47,449
I mean, well, yeah, it's,

677
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,689
and look at parsing HTML is potentially one of

678
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:54,170
the most complicated things humans have ever done.

679
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,209
I mean, it's madness.

680
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:57,229
Yeah.

681
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:00,939
So it just drives me nuts when people look at these data sets and,

682
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,459
and extract meaning from.

683
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,329
No, no, there's half the data set isn't even there

684
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:07,119
or

685
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,270
to, to pretend that there's no or

686
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:12,670
to pretend somehow that there's not going to be as many zero days in something.

687
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,670
And yet there's 2000 plus security flaws in it

688
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,209
that we know of that have been fixed guaranteed.

689
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,699
Actually, I had a really funny conversation a couple of months ago where we were,

690
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:25,119
we were looking at two different open source libraries

691
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:28,530
and one of them had like 10 CV ES and one of them had zero

692
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:31,989
and the developer was like, oh, the one that is zero must be better. I'm like, no,

693
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,589
the one that is zero is significantly worse.

694
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,869
-- Nothing has zero security issues.
-- Nothing.

695
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:40,699
I was going to say they don't have a maturity, a mature security process.

696
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,099
No, it means they probably don't even have

697
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,290
a

698
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,630
process. That's right.

699
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,510
And no one's looking.

700
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:46,699
So it, yeah.

701
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,829
Right. Exactly.

702
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,869
-- Or
-- they just,

703
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:49,400
like,

704
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,750
I've run into a lot of major projects where they actually have

705
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,150
really good security change histories and zero CV S and they're just,

706
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,040
-- they lack that maturity
-- and that's a different problem.

707
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,650
But, yeah, that happens all the time. Absolutely.

708
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,270
I mean, look, one of my favorite examples I give people is if you go on github

709
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,800
and you put in, in the double quotes,

710
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,239
like search as a whole word or whatever prototype space pollution,

711
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:13,630
there are 3.9 million issues.

712
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,810
That is a ridiculous number.

713
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:19,760
And now granted, I'm not saying there's 3.9 million security issues, but I bet it's,

714
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,739
we'll say

715
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,680
a million

716
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,599
maybe.

717
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,030
-- You know what I mean? It's a lot.
-- Well, part of it is just the amount of code and github.

718
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:29,439
You know, it's, it's like every time they swab, what is it?

719
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:32,380
They swab buses or public transit for pathogens. And it's like

720
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,680
they find everything.

721
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:36,530
Well, yeah, when you, when you run a couple of 100 people through a bus,

722
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:39,750
yeah, I'm sorry. But some of them didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom.

723
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,380
That's right. That's why you wash your hands when you get off. Really. Anything

724
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,280
like anything at all, wash your hands

725
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,400
and I'm gonna have to go wash my hands after this.

726
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:51,550
But anyway, anyway. All right. All right, we're coming to the end.

727
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,030
I feel like

728
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,689
the bar. OK? So number one,

729
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:56,989
when you are a company,

730
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,660
you are going to receive security vulnerabilities from people. Researchers

731
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,969
have a way to receive them

732
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,069
that have a way to receive them. Be nice to them.

733
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:08,250
And, and I think one of the most important things,

734
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:14,739
a lot of people don't always grasp it is OK to say we aren't going to fix this,

735
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,670
you can publish your data.

736
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:20,060
The problem is most companies want to say we're not going to fix this now,

737
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:21,170
please never talk about this again.

738
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,599
-- And
-- that's not ok.

739
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I don't agree with that at all. I think it is ok to say we're not going to fix it.

740
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,800
They can publish your data and if not fixing it is the right decision,

741
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:35,780
you should be able to add a quote to the data or just reply wherever that says,

742
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,525
this is why we made it this decision.

743
00:31:37,614 --> 00:31:41,084
And if you made the right decision, no one is going to complain.

744
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:43,364
If you made the wrong decision, they might and then you can be like, all right,

745
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,435
maybe we screwed this up.

746
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,765
Let's let's think about it.

747
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:48,244
Well, and in line with this, I would say companies,

748
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:51,285
the security dot TXT standard is actually apparently now an

749
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:54,885
RFC draft like it's going to become an actual standard,

750
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:56,005
I would say at this point,

751
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:57,400
go do it.

752
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:00,550
Yeah, I mean, right, there's no reason not to or at least in github,

753
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:03,020
you can put your security dot MD, you know, same deal.

754
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,040
Well, to me, having,

755
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,900
if you don't have the maturity to put a simple text file

756
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,040
on your website that says here's how to report a security.

757
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,430
That's true.

758
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:12,780
Come on.

759
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,829
And I guess that not everybody can have security

760
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,619
at their domain name because apparently Microsoft has that since

761
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,130
the eighties for their campus security.

762
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,459
And so that's why they have that.

763
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:23,239
Yeah, that's apparently because everybody, well,

764
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,150
it's like the same thing with Red Hat.

765
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,400
It's sec

766
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:26,500
alert at Red hat.com, not security at Red hat.com.

767
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,020
And no, I actually don't even know why.

768
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,109
Actually, they both go to the same place, but Redhead always pushed se

769
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,599
alert instead of security at

770
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,979
probably because of Microsoft or something. I don't know.

771
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:36,819
Exactly. So, ok,

772
00:32:36,949 --> 00:32:40,219
but you should be able to put a text file on your website

773
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:43,099
and more to the point if you can't get, buy in to do that,

774
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,290
then you don't have buy and to have a security program.

775
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,089
-- Uh,
-- yeah. Right. That's very true actually.

776
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:51,859
And, and that means without executive support, like you got nothing.

777
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,689
So there's the aspect of your company. Now, when you are a researcher,

778
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:57,890
there is

779
00:32:58,229 --> 00:33:02,329
a certain amount, I think if you are working with the bug bounty, you, obviously the,

780
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,160
the transaction is a little different.

781
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,969
If you're reporting something essentially for free,

782
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,829
you can make some demands and you can have some expectations and I

783
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,660
don't think there's anything wrong with saying it's been 90 days like this.

784
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,880
I, I, I'm going public with this right

785
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,040
now. If you're getting paid by them as a bug bounty, they will use the money

786
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,599
as the stick of we paid you,

787
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:25,339
you will do what we say and there's a degree of truth in that I think.

788
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:26,469
And so that's a little different.

789
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:29,459
But if you're just reporting something and they wait 90 days and you're like,

790
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:30,780
I don't like this, I'm going public.

791
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,280
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

792
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:34,099
Um,

793
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:37,089
well, two comments. One, I think it's like any negotiation.

794
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:40,959
It kind of depends on the size and power of the two entities, you know,

795
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,920
single researcher versus Apple versus like large

796
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,910
security company versus single open source person.

797
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,449
Right? Those are two very different equations.

798
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,630
And number two,

799
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,589
the vast majority of bugs aren't gonna matter that much and publishing them

800
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,520
publicly is not going to result in the power grid being shut down.

801
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,280
Let's hope

802
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:58,719
not.

803
00:33:59,569 --> 00:33:59,989
Right.

804
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,719
The vast majority of bugs

805
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,630
can and should be public and not have, you know,

806
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,949
play secret security squirrel embargo games.

807
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:09,379
Yeah. No, I agree. I agree. I, I think,

808
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,300
I think if you are a properly functioning project or company,

809
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,330
you should be able to fix the fast enough that it doesn't matter if it's,

810
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,870
if it's essentially zero date,

811
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,478
you know.

812
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:18,739
Well,

813
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,270
and ideally you're architecting your stuff so that you don't have

814
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,540
world ending bugs popping up in it all the time,

815
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:23,750
right?

816
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,438
Like the whole

817
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,889
iMessage thing with apple where it's like, oh, oops.

818
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,639
Well, it's like, you know, Microsoft with their,

819
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,708
why is their font processing in the kernel?

820
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:34,610
Well, it's not anymore but, well, exactly.

821
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,090
But I mean if, if you do stuff like that then,

822
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:42,000
-- well, again you have deeper problems than just bug reports but
-- look how fast it is,

823
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,399
you know.

824
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,290
Anyway. Anyway. yeah, I agree. I think we're all on the same page here.

825
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,810
Alright, man, I'll let you get the last word on this one.

826
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,350
Um Try to be kind to each other,

827
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,370
you know, the whole iterated prisoners.

828
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,469
Dilema start with kindness and yeah, if they're a jerk,

829
00:34:56,478 --> 00:35:00,139
then you can be a jerk but start by try being nice to start.

830
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,860
Agreed. Agreed. I like it. All right.

831
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,729
