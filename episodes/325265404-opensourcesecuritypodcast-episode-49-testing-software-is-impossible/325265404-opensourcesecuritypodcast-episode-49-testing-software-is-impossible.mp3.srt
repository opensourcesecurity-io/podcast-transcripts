Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode

1
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,060
49 with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime,

2
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:11,829
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:13,920
Kurt, where do we start?

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,430
Uh with

5
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,440
what is most on fire

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,659
it down to like four things,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,590
right.

8
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:23,760
Let's start with

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,309
Samba. How

10
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:24,629
about

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,879
Samba? I think is the most interesting

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,159
-- of, of all the things I don't know if I'd say poor Samba that well,
-- it just,

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,110
it does when you think about it, right?

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,040
This guy,

15
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,369
well, and team wrote, you know, an implementation of the, well,

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,790
originally server message block.

17
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,200
Now, what is it called common internet file system?

18
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,150
You know, and they managed to

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,700
through a combination of talking nicely to windows and

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,259
uh there was that court case to get the documentation and then, you know,

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,759
just probably some like really horrendous late nights

22
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,020
of like staring at binary packet dumps,

23
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,020
you know, they actually make this thing that works.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,099
It does, it works very well. And, and they,

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,860
one of my favorite stories actually from the Sama guys is, I guess,

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,819
way back in the day when they were working on one of the first versions,

27
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:11,860
they realized that you'd authenticate against a remote windows server.

28
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,900
And

29
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,500
it would just tell you you're wrong,

30
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,040
it wouldn't actually block anything.

31
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,169
So you could just, like, keep going, like everything was fine.

32
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:18,970
Right.

33
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,019
And they, they told Microsoft Microsoft said, well, there's a bug in your client

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,989
and they said

35
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,589
that's not how it works guys.

36
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:28,430
Anyway. Anyway,

37
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,089
that's

38
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,099
true. That's true. It was.

39
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:37,269
-- Right.
-- Right. And, and this was way long, long, long ago. So, anyway,

40
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:40,430
this, this Samba bug though is super interesting.

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,949
It, it involves kind of one line of code where you open,

42
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,349
you upload a file and then open it as a pipe

43
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:50,029
and then the file get, if it's a shared library, it gets executed.

44
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,790
Which is,

45
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,029
yeah, it doesn't get any better than that. I mean, let's face it.

46
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,790
Well, see,

47
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,449
I that's one thing I love about UNIX is

48
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,900
this is this metaphor of like everything is a file

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,470
-- you want to talk
-- to

50
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:03,190
strength and its greatest weakness.

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,930
Well, it's, it's just, yeah, because there's a great example of like when you,

52
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,649
you know, if you treat everything as a file,

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,070
some behaviors are reasonably well defined and understandable.

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,029
Like if it's att Y and you shove date in it,

55
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,949
shoves it over whatever magic line to whatever remote system.

56
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,619
Well, I do

57
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,789
appreciate the permissions model because permissions are easy to understand.

58
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:22,910
Yeah, exactly.

59
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,759
But yeah, when you have something like, OK, well, it's a pipe

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,850
that's, you know, a shared library or a pipe that's an executable, you know,

61
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,389
the kind of,

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,429
because typically, well on the command line, at least if I pipe to a lot, you know,

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,190
a binary

64
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:36,720
I kind

65
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:37,529
-- of
-- expected to run.

66
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,949
I'm talking from the metaphor, right, from the metaphor perspective of like,

67
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,490
what am I expecting to happen?

68
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,710
And that's fair.

69
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,770
That makes sense. You know,

70
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,289
it, it,

71
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:52,220
I love it. But so here's the bigger thing, right? So Samba has a security problem.

72
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,729
It's, I think seven years old someone said, and

73
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,750
whatever that happens, right. People make mistakes.

74
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,210
It, it is life, they fixed it. They, they released an update. Everything is fine.

75
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,639
Well, but kind of, here's the problem is

76
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,729
I was talking to a friend of the show, Rich Morell, who you and I both know

77
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:12,080
and Rich pointed out to me that there are

78
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:15,970
literally millions of devices out there running old versions of Samba,

79
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,669
everything from

80
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,279
router,

81
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:17,539
sharing

82
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,750
files

83
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:19,179
from

84
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:19,610
windows. Yeah,

85
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:20,149
exactly.

86
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,710
Right. Oh, that's true. Printers too.

87
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,369
Right.

88
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,039
You've got like NASA and you've got routers, you've got,

89
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,210
and some of these cost $10 and some of them cost, you know,

90
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,389
thousands and thousands of dollars and fundamentally,

91
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:39,130
they're all vulnerable to an extremely trivial security issue now and,

92
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,929
and let's face it, most of them aren't going to see updates.

93
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,199
Well, and you'd also mentioned that, um, I guess, well, for a variety of reasons,

94
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,589
a lot of these devices are on what sound but I want to say two point whatever.

95
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:53,929
Yeah. The old version before they switched to GP LV three because a lot of

96
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:54,979
that.

97
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:55,789
Yeah.

98
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
But also the version that's been around forever and, you know,

99
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:59,600
we got it working and we're not going to like,

100
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,240
upgrade to sample version three or four because, you know, we'd actually have to,

101
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,399
like, spend a couple hours on the product.

102
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,160
That's true. It's, it's much easier to do nothing

103
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,600
than it is to do something.

104
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:12,449
Well, and in fairness, I mean, you know, like

105
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:15,360
people who expose their file server to the internet,

106
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:17,028
you know, it's

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,009
ok.

108
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,808
No, no, I don't think that, that, that's a valid reason anymore though is I think,

109
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:24,169
saying that a long time ago made sense.

110
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,968
But with the concepts like zero trust networking now,

111
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,808
you cannot trust your network.

112
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:29,579
Right? Well, see,

113
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,218
that's what gets me,

114
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,299
well, it's like the whole VNC thing I get that there are many times where you,

115
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:39,098
you really do have a legitimate reason to have, say Samba or, you know, VNC.

116
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:41,639
So you can remotely manage the system or look at what's on it,

117
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,459
you know?

118
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,049
But at the same time you need to recognize that.

119
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:47,799
Yeah, the internet is an incredibly hostile place now, right?

120
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:51,269
Like, what, what was that guy tweeting that he was putting up windows honey nets

121
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,609
and they were all getting popped in like 2 to 3 minutes and I

122
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:55,230
saw that

123
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,989
and they were getting popped with and then he

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,730
was putting it through virus total and like,

125
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,589
he was getting like, zero detection rate.

126
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:06,779
Yeah, I saw that 11 attempt per minute basically is what it sounds like, which is

127
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,640
less than I would expect to be honest with you.

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,019
I

129
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,079
figured it's way worse than that.

130
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,769
You know, it's so,

131
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:19,250
uh, on the one hand I get it, you know, these, these, you deploy a router.

132
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,839
Well, how are you going to put like a VPN in front of your router?

133
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,109
You know, that's the problem for a lot of these devices and stuff like

134
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:26,489
Samba,

135
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,339
they're so low end and cheap or

136
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,529
they're like your basic network infrastructure piece.

137
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,390
Well, yeah, how do you put like a VPN or something in front of it to secure it?

138
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,570
Well, so in so in the case of my router, actually, which,

139
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:41,690
which I played around this a bit, I do not run Samba on it for this very reason,

140
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,679
but it,

141
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,649
it, it does not expose Samba to the internet by default.

142
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,829
You can make it

143
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,730
you shouldn't.

144
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,290
And then internally obviously the the permissions model is terrible.

145
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:56,049
So generally, I would assume most people are allowing guest access,

146
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:58,019
which is obviously the issue because in

147
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:03,049
this instance, you have to be able to upload a file somehow and then make a call to it.

148
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,910
And so if you, if you can't log into Samba,

149
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,570
you're fine. But again,

150
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,660
I think in many instances, you've got Samba shares that you either have semi

151
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,420
untrusted users with access to or

152
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,940
you just have a guest share.

153
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,299
Because I mean, let's think about every organization on the planet has

154
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:22,934
like the, the guest directory, right where anyone can upload a file

155
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:26,385
and that's now incredibly dangerous. If you're using

156
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:26,575
Samba,

157
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:27,184
it's

158
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,595
remember public FTP S man where they had

159
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:33,095
the incoming directory and it was just full of wares on every system,

160
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:35,375
man. Those were the days.

161
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,239
Yeah.

162
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,579
No, I, I do remember that like all those, all those, you know, and then, yeah,

163
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:41,760
when pro FTP D and all those guys got it.

164
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,950
So you could like basically have an upload directory that

165
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,170
you couldn't download from. I was like, oh, thank goodness,

166
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,049
I've got a great story about that is a

167
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,429
long time ago.

168
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,350
Then it was my first job out of college

169
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,829
and

170
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,160
one day I set up M RT G to start graphing the network traffic coming from the internet,

171
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,339
right?

172
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,250
And I thought, oh, this will be fun to watch and, and I start graphing and I said,

173
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,109
uh why, why do we have

174
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,869
constant incoming traffic all night long?

175
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:09,489
Right?

176
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,750
Because you could, you could see when everyone left work and there was still there,

177
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,989
there's a couple of megabits coming in from the internet.

178
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,420
And I remember going to the windows admin, I'm like,

179
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,380
what's going on here because they, we were running windows,

180
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,019
whatever their firewall thing is called at the time for internet access.

181
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,239
And he's like, oh, so and so left their media player on

182
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,540
and I thought that seems like a lot of traffic.

183
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,510
But ok, that's fair and it happens again.

184
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,809
And I, I go to so and so, and I said, hey, what's up with this?

185
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,470
Why are you leaving your media player on? He's like,

186
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,179
and this guy says, I, I know what you're talking about.

187
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,279
And so I,

188
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:42,700
after speaking with him, I realized there's no media player.

189
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,410
So, so that's not it.

190
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,980
And of course,

191
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:47,970
my suspicion is the windows admin didn't even know what I was talking about.

192
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,809
And so he just made some crap up to make me go away.

193
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,609
And anyway, I started doing some investigation.

194
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:56,339
I was sniffing some traffic and whatnot and it turned out that there was a,

195
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,540
an FTP incoming directory

196
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,720
available to the internet which also allowed download.

197
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,130
And uh

198
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,220
Star Wars episode two was being uploaded to it

199
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,410
three days before it came out in theaters.

200
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,279
And I'm like,

201
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:14,380
I, I shut everything down. I deleted everything and, and I, I went home

202
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,130
and I said, I didn't even know what to do here. Like this is just, this is ridiculous.

203
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,109
I didn't keep it. And

204
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,690
all my friends were like, dude, you should have kept that file.

205
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,880
And I said, no, just, no,

206
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,880
this is like my hope now is the authorities just don't show up, you know, that's like,

207
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:32,039
well, I, I remember, yeah, that was always those holy grails, you know,

208
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,119
people are always looking for corporate machines or, yeah,

209
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,429
university machines with, yeah.

210
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,179
You know, like a

211
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,080
fast internet connection. Right.

212
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,599
-- Well,
-- and everybody did this. Right.

213
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:42,820
Because, like, you'd have, well, everybody did. Right.

214
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,049
You have to, like, because you couldn't email files larger than about, oh,

215
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,559
like four kilobytes back in the day, you know,

216
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,700
without horribly breaking everything.

217
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,479
And, well, and you know, what makes me laugh is to this day we still have this problem.

218
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:57,080
Here's a great example. I want to share a two gig file to you. What do I do?

219
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,130
Uh, you share a multi 100 megabyte file with me once a week and we use Google Drive.

220
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,309
Exactly. But like, ok, well,

221
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,640
let's, let's up it. I need to share a one terabyte file with you.

222
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,979
I can't even imagine how you would do that.

223
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:13,770
Amazon S3

224
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,770
-- or Dropbox. I mean, it would have to be like one of those services,
-- right.

225
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:21,700
I don't think S3 doesn't do files larger than two gigs, does it?

226
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,880
No, you'd have to, like, chop it up or whatever using like,

227
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:25,770
or whatever split.

228
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,469
But, I mean, fundamentally that's the thing, right?

229
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,640
So, like it's a terabyte now, but back in the day, like four kilobytes and, and it,

230
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,140
you know, there's a lot of people that legitimately need to share, you know,

231
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,739
lab data sets or backups.

232
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,789
Right. And we're still stuck in this. I love how we're still, you know,

233
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:46,109
um, I had to transfer like a couple 100 megs of data to, uh, my parents, you know,

234
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,059
all the photos of the kids and stuff and it was like, uh,

235
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:53,380
that just put that crap in like Google photos or something and share it. Right.

236
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,390
Yeah, pretty much. But, um,

237
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,710
no, it's, it's, I love that we still have these problems with sharing, you know,

238
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:02,159
whatever, whatever is considered a large file nowadays is still a pain in the butt.

239
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,539
It

240
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,820
is. But it's way easier than it used to be, man. You got to admit.

241
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:10,530
Oh, true. It's getting better. But for example, we just ran into an issue with, uh,

242
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,650
one of

243
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:15,489
a thing that was blocking email attachments larger than six megabytes.

244
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,119
I'm, I'm comfortable with that.

245
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,700
Don't, don't send you emails people. It's a

246
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,599
PDF S or whatever. But, uh,

247
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,599
anyways back to Samba. So,

248
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,710
yeah, I mean, the reality too is, I mean,

249
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:33,510
what always gets me is, you know, what underlying assumptions did we make about?

250
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,669
Oh, this is a file. So, how do we treat it? Right.

251
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,690
And I would bet a dollar.

252
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,190
But, you know, there's going to be a similar flaw in sound,

253
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,049
but at some point in the next 5 to 10 years,

254
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,320
I, I'd be surprised if there aren't a bunch more and, and in fact,

255
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,659
I'm sure people are looking now so it wouldn't surprise me.

256
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:52,650
If we see another one or two of these in the next couple of weeks.

257
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,500
Yeah.

258
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,289
Well, and the thing to remember too is it's not just Samba's fault. So, uh

259
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,190
tying this into uh well, that latest Windows thing, you know, the,

260
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,599
the MS D Os reserved device names, right.

261
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:05,340
So MS D Os back in the day had a couple of magic device names.

262
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:07,679
There's about 21 or 22 of them in total.

263
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:08,739
Oh

264
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,150
yeah, it, it still exists in Windows 10 even.

265
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,510
And, and so it's magic things like, you know, calm one or LPT one or whatever pr N.

266
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,109
So you know, these D OS apps could print

267
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,840
to LPT one and that would just magically make, you know, printing happen.

268
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,619
And so these device names are reserved by the

269
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,950
operating system except their behavior is not 100% consistent.

270
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,460
So for example, if you do like a maker,

271
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,099
Pr N on Windows,

272
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:32,599
it will fail and say that's a reserved device name.

273
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:36,130
But if you at least back in the day when I tested it, if you did a maker

274
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,520
with the full UN C path name, you know, universal naming conventional Windows,

275
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,080
it would work.

276
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,169
-- You know,
-- I remember

277
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,429
with this directory called PR N but now you like like good luck deleting that.

278
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,890
I remember that because I, I remember doing this to friends is you create and,

279
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,530
and you'd always create the printer one because

280
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,780
when they would try to do something to it.

281
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:01,559
It would almost always end up spewing garbage out of their printer then.

282
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,229
Which made it really funny.

283
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,479
-- Oh, we are, we are nerds
-- anyway. We're old nerds. That's, yeah, we're old nerds now.

284
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:10,830
Yeah.

285
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,669
But, um, but yeah, so, I mean, this, you know, you can't,

286
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,890
if you look at all these programs, like

287
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,900
Apache's great example, you know, they ran into this many years ago where, you know,

288
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:22,090
if you made a request for slash pr M on an Apache web server

289
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:25,169
-- on Windows, it just basically tipped over
-- is that actually

290
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,119
apache's fault though?

291
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,280
Well, exactly right. Like, you know, that's the thing, right?

292
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,780
You, you have this magic device name behavior. And

293
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,479
so the the problem is any program that interacts with the Windows file system,

294
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,260
which is like

295
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,460
every program running on Windows,

296
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:40,950
I I can't think of a single program that

297
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,179
doesn't interact with the file system in some way,

298
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,419
you know, is, is has this problem and you have to like code around it.

299
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,460
That's, that's clearly insane because, you know,

300
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,520
every single program has to be coded,

301
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,979
has to code around this one, you know. Gotcha.

302
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,739
You know, that's what worries me about this,

303
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,690
this whole with these magic pipes and device names and all this stuff is,

304
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,479
you know, when the behavior is not well defined,

305
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:05,419
we can't expect every single piece of software running on it

306
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:06,760
to do the right thing,

307
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,789
right? That's clearly never gonna happen.

308
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,359
Right. So I, I, you're not wrong

309
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,419
in all this about opening files and how

310
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,510
everything's arranged and all this crazy stuff.

311
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,549
But ee even if we ignore that,

312
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:20,950
I think the real story here is just,

313
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:26,099
nothing is going to get updated and we're going to literally have millions

314
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:30,780
of devices sitting on networks that are vulnerable to a super trivial flaw.

315
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,659
And in fact, there's a meta slight module for this.

316
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:36,130
-- It came out what, like 24 hours after it was released
-- 12 or 24 hours later.

317
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,859
Yeah, it's, I have a bunch of routers that, you know, I put DDW RT on.

318
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,640
Uh, but even DDW RT doesn't update for like, really old routers. Right.

319
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,340
I mean, because, you know, I

320
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:50,539
can't expect DDW RT to support something like f, you know, five years old, like,

321
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:52,640
come on, they got, you know, better things to do with their lives.

322
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,549
So I'm actually looking at that as an

323
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,280
-- excuse to upgrade my wireless infrastructure
-- and you,

324
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,530
any

325
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,169
excuse is good there.

326
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,460
I mean, obviously the, the real answer is disable Samba and everything. You can

327
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,340
no, granted some things you can't because, like, if you have a N A

328
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,859
that's kind of its job.

329
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,010
Right. Exactly.

330
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,250
Yeah.

331
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:11,090
No.

332
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,140
And I guess this kind of brings us to the bigger issue of

333
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,710
what do we do with all these weird little devices and,

334
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,109
and just stuff that's everywhere.

335
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:22,669
I think the reality is what's going to happen whether we like it

336
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,570
or not because it only takes like one dude to write this is

337
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:27,630
there's going to be iot brick worms.

338
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,409
Well, there was one, wasn't there where they use the, the mirror

339
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,140
botnet.

340
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,010
Yeah, the telnet

341
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:36,710
was going in through telnet through hard coded credentials and,

342
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:39,270
and uh bricking devices by, you know, basically

343
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:43,650
wiping, you know, slash DEV slash and then all the kind of busy box,

344
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:46,169
whatever possibilities there are and then like

345
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:49,450
scrambling, what was in memory or whatever and then rebooting it, you know,

346
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,080
so doing their best to break the device,

347
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,530
I

348
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,030
mean, you know,

349
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,630
the thing I always say is vigilant justice isn't justice, but at the same time,

350
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,400
it's like, is this the,

351
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,049
is this worse than having that device on the internet?

352
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:03,919
-- And, well,
-- you know,

353
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:06,869
if it's hooked up to an MRI or something and somebody's getting AC A T scan

354
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,010
-- and that's the problem, right? You know,
-- like the whole NHS running windows XP.

355
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:14,390
It's out of like,

356
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:18,710
I, you know, on the one hand, I'm like, you know, I, I don't like the NHS doing that,

357
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:19,570
but on the other hand, you know,

358
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:22,750
the politicians in Britain cut funding to the NHS. And so,

359
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,609
you know, as the NHS, what are you going to do?

360
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:28,059
Like cut patient care or like upgrade windows XP to something more recent?

361
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,010
Well, obviously you're not going to cut patient care.

362
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,799
And so, you know, they're, they're in, they're,

363
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,289
-- they're between a wall and a tree chipper,
-- you know, I,

364
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:40,539
I, right. I, I'm sorry, your grandpa died but we upgraded to Windows seven.

365
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:41,000
Right?

366
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:43,640
Yeah.

367
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,989
And, and so, but I don't, but the reality is whether or not we,

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,119
we like this kind of vigilante justice, it's gonna happen, right?

369
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,309
Because I literally like, look at the, um, the wanna crime malware

370
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,030
that doesn't take like a huge nation state level team.

371
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,479
No, no.

372
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:01,989
You know, it takes like one dude, I mean,

373
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,349
this Samba thing, you have a Metis point module,

374
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:07,739
like you literally just go to like cut and paste

375
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,099
a bunch of code together from like stack overflow metas

376
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:10,710
and

377
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,169
whichever botnet

378
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,710
-- strikes your fancy and, and you're done.
-- Right.

379
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:15,789
Right. Right.

380
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:16,479
It,

381
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,270
no, I know, I know it's,

382
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,710
here's, here's a thought though and this is something for us to chew on is

383
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:26,250
through having thinking about this at length last

384
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,070
week and having a handful of discussions,

385
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,000
the topic of regulation always comes up. In fact, Schneer

386
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,349
published something basically decrying regulation as, as their only savior here.

387
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:36,229
And

388
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,770
of course many people are,

389
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:41,919
are incredibly anti regulation and many will even say you can't possibly regulate

390
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:45,549
all this stuff because it only costs $5 and who's gonna pay,

391
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,429
who's gonna deal with that?

392
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,270
-- You know,
-- do regulate things that cost even like,

393
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:51,890
you know, fasteners, fasteners are a great example.

394
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,859
I love fasteners because I buy fasteners,

395
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,030
bolts and nuts and screws and stuff at Home Depot and at Lona and Ro,

396
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,549
uh, whatever and, and they all work, they all are compatible.

397
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,299
-- They're all
-- correct.

398
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,770
I don't know if that's necessarily regulated by the government that

399
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:05,810
are hard

400
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,650
and have a certain strength rating are definitely regulated.

401
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,709
-- That's
-- actually fair.

402
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,560
-- And that's an even better example than, you
-- know,

403
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,339
because I don't want my car seat flying off in a car

404
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,618
or, or when you build something,

405
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,180
you don't want like the building to fall down because you use sub par.

406
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,699
Although

407
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,420
I use 50 pound construction screws and I use like eight of them to hold up, you know,

408
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:27,550
100 pound dynamic load,

409
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,209
those better be 50 pound construction screws.

410
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:33,290
But, but again, even if they're not, you've used eight of them.

411
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,140
So,

412
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:35,020
right,

413
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:35,849
you've got

414
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,069
built in.

415
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:40,800
But unless, you know, they're like five pound construction screws.

416
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:43,180
Right.

417
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,349
Right. Right. So, so, but anyway, that, that, that's a great example, right?

418
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,979
Is, that's an incredibly inexpensive thing

419
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:52,489
that apparently regulation has worked with.

420
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,959
-- But now
-- the problem is too, is it's an incredibly mature

421
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:56,780
industry,

422
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:58,099
well understood.

423
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,699
-- Testing. It is easy, right? Testing software. Oh my
-- God. It is impossible.

424
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:05,349
It is impossible. Let's just face

425
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:05,849
it.

426
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,189
And, and right, that's the second half of this.

427
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:10,630
Well, actually, it's, let me actually let me make one comment,

428
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,079
testing software to prove that it's secure is definitely possible.

429
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,530
But testing software and being and generally proving that

430
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,079
it has a flaw is actually not that hard,

431
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:21,930
especially if it's bad software, you'll typically find stuff really fast

432
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:25,770
and even automated stuff like the Mudge. What's his real name?

433
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,709
I can't pronounce his last name. It.

434
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,829
Yes. Uh, you know, he's working on that sort of automated,

435
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,630
sort of smell, test of software to, you know, do like a consumer report.

436
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,439
-- He's
-- not anymore. He's

437
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,290
-- the
-- CEO,

438
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,339
well, his wife is still doing it. Uh, the, the CITL stuff.

439
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,239
Uh, where did we

440
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:49,250
go? He, he just got a job somewhere. I forget. Is it?

441
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,760
He's like their, their

442
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,660
ciso or something like that.

443
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,750
Let me look.

444
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,229
Well, and, and see, that's the thing that gets me,

445
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,689
even if you can get the software testing, that kind of works.

446
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:03,030
And you can say, like, look, this software is provably terrible. Well, then what?

447
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:03,969
Right.

448
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:04,170
I mean,

449
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,010
the manufacturer is probably not going to want to spend

450
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,160
thousands or tens of thousands of dollars fixing it.

451
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:08,920
Uh,

452
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,699
yeah. No, I know.

453
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,550
And so actually you brought up a good point though

454
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,209
is

455
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,560
you talked about

456
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,959
bolts were easy to test

457
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,479
and it's not that they're easy to test. It's that we,

458
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,260
we understand the use like you can just test the bolt,

459
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,930
but let's say you have a bolt that's under heavy vibration.

460
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,939
Now it's changed. Right. And,

461
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:30,890
and

462
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,530
I think over time

463
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,160
we have basically, there's a failure

464
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,890
and they create a new standard or they update an old standard

465
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,599
-- or
-- they update the testing

466
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:39,880
and I

467
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,750
think that's our watching

468
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,459
and

469
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,599
watching when I was binge watching all those airline disaster things.

470
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:45,989
That's one thing that became apparent is the

471
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,569
testing regimes for a lot of these parts.

472
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,739
You know, after, like the Sioux City, um,

473
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,130
airline disaster crash, you know where that giant titanium

474
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:53,989
ring

475
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,030
snapped,

476
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,709
like it just broke apart and now they're using all

477
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:59,219
those fluorescent dyes and stuff to look for small cracks.

478
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,329
Yes, exactly. That's exactly correct. Is, is, that's kind of what it is. All right.

479
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:05,150
Just, uh, Mudge went to stripe

480
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,420
that. That's where he

481
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,189
just looked it

482
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:07,339
up.

483
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,689
Yeah. Yeah.

484
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,800
Yeah. Yeah. Good for him. It's,

485
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:10,989
I

486
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,000
get it and, and the CITL work has been kind of slow. So,

487
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,949
my, my, I'm just

488
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,109
not

489
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:16,410
-- sure
-- there's a

490
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,290
good market for it. That's my concern.

491
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,619
That's probably part of it.

492
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,199
Well, it's being funded by the government right now, which is ok.

493
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,189
And then what,

494
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,510
uh,

495
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,280
maybe nothing. That's how regulation works though.

496
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,920
Regulation doesn't have a, then what? It's just it exists.

497
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,640
True.

498
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,630
Well, and actually that,

499
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,555
that's the whole, that's really,

500
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:37,954
that's the story of everything we talk about is the vast majority of this stuff.

501
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:40,814
There's no market, there's no economic incentive.

502
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:41,515
Right.

503
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,275
It's quite the opposite. There's

504
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:46,015
incentives to just avoid it and run away in life.

505
00:20:46,824 --> 00:20:49,074
And, and so this is kind of where we need, like

506
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:52,275
the government's job isn't to have economic incentives.

507
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:53,064
It's

508
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:53,895
like you,

509
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:57,555
you have the crap job and you deal with it like that's what you do.

510
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:00,540
Yeah. I mean, that's the problem with all those externalized costs. Right?

511
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,199
Is there's often no way to,

512
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:02,569
in,

513
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,560
like, there's no way to change it so that, you know,

514
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,400
they actually have an incentive to do the right thing.

515
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,079
It's just, yeah, you say, as the government look

516
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,699
this huge negative externality, like, pollution or bad off or whatever, look,

517
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:12,569
we just can't have it.

518
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:12,920
So

519
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,319
either you fix it or you don't ship it.

520
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:15,689
Uh

521
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:16,400
Yes,

522
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:17,040
yes.

523
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,750
And of course,

524
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,329
there are challenges around that and I think it's easy for us to throw

525
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:23,880
our hands up in the air and say this is too hard to do.

526
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,310
But II I don't think we cannot do it.

527
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,459
You know, it reminds me of actually is,

528
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,839
do you remember the really old refrigerators that

529
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:33,369
had like that crazy metal latch on them?

530
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:34,949
And the,

531
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,989
the issue being that uh Children

532
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:40,589
and, and granted this probably happened to like 10 kids,

533
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:43,229
but Children would get locked inside and they couldn't get out.

534
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:43,880
Ok.

535
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,229
And I'm sure this is like mobster's best friend

536
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:50,510
and, and basically what happened was one day the industry said, well,

537
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,719
reg regulators said, uh you can't use those latches anymore, right?

538
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,079
This is, this is not working out.

539
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,119
And of course,

540
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,199
the refrigerator industry like they were wailing and gnashing

541
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:01,560
of teeth with how could we possibly fix this.

542
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:04,119
This is just the way they work, but there's nothing we can do.

543
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,290
And then somebody was like, uh, let's just put a magnet on the door.

544
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,079
And

545
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:08,969
also

546
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,530
I just checked the refrigerator safety act is codified, uh, blah, blah, blah,

547
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,790
as public blah, blah, blah, blah

548
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,089
in 1950 six.

549
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,010
Yeah, it's, it's pretty old

550
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,890
and, and

551
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,420
this is what I feel like

552
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,430
security is, is, we're, we're,

553
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:28,369
we're busy proclaiming we can't possibly fix the latches on these doors.

554
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,550
And the real issue is no one's thought of the way to do it.

555
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,010
And I know that sounds overly simplistic because

556
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,949
there isn't gonna be one easy answer.

557
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:39,319
That's kind of what I feel like is

558
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,589
it's too easy just to declare it too hard to fix and then to,

559
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,150
to go on to the next emergency.

560
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,380
But I mean, I think we've reached a point like

561
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,869
every day I wake up and I just wonder, I wonder what's on fire today

562
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,349
and,

563
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,170
-- and it never falls. Speaking of.
-- So, for example, I actually, um,

564
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,989
one of the last motherboards I bought, I think it was an Asus

565
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,729
has a built in hardware firewall that, you know,

566
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:05,709
there's a windows user space program to interact with it.

567
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:09,170
And so that actually runs like on the network card.

568
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:10,719
Yeah,

569
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,930
it's a really nice nifty feature.

570
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:14,959
-- So
-- this is like a level

571
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,010
what zero.

572
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:21,209
-- So wait, it interprets it
-- built into the TCP/IP chip set, right?

573
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:21,609
Like

574
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,209
you have a TCP/IP chip set on your motherboard.

575
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,810
-- That's amazing. Well,
-- to some degree, I mean, it had,

576
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,439
it does,

577
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,079
does it?

578
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:30,390
Yeah,

579
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:30,920
it was,

580
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,280
what level are you filtering at? TCP,

581
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,400
Ethernet something

582
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,400
beneath it. Well, there's

583
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,150
-- really nothing I believe it was
-- TCP/IP.

584
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:39,900
That's crazy to me. And this is done in hardware.

585
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,719
Well, I believe so. I mean,

586
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:48,239
it works basically, it claimed that the packets wouldn't even be seen by windows.

587
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,189
This, this is amazing to me. I'm,

588
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,489
-- this
-- has been around for a while. Hang on a sec, a

589
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:54,270
firewall.

590
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:58,380
I know such technology exists but like not just into a motherboard,

591
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,079
right?

592
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,270
Well, these things get cheap after a while.

593
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,050
Yeah, but

594
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,780
so the two things that come to my mind is number one, that's super cool.

595
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,109
Everything should do that. And number two is

596
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:10,890
how much do you want to bet there's security issues in that code?

597
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,869
Of course, there are.

598
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,819
Oh, good Lord.

599
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,920
I can't even begin to imagine how bad they are.

600
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:17,550
Yes.

601
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,439
-- Well,
-- and more to the point,

602
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:21,719
it doesn't really matter anymore because you have to do things like allow port 443,

603
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,209
which is the new, allow any.

604
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,199
-- It's
-- true. Right. H DJ

605
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:28,790
is the magic protocol and it can do anything so it doesn't matter.

606
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,849
I love it. Well, that's like I always love too.

607
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:33,040
There's all these VPN services and things that run in

608
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:37,670
443 because nobody blocks port 443 and it works through proxies so

609
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:43,260
-- well.
-- A lot of I SPS will block VPN traffic on residential connections. Now,

610
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,829
I do not have that problem. Thank goodness.

611
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,599
But a lot of countries do this as well

612
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,119
in

613
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:49,770
Tel

614
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:56,040
-- Telcos wanna have that sweet, sweet call revenue or
-- they have a repressive regime

615
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:56,910
who is

616
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:57,949
Right.

617
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:01,400
Right. Right. And, and they may have uh firewalls around countries.

618
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,540
Yeah.

619
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,530
Well, speaking of repressive regimes, the whole, uh the whole

620
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:08,020
watershed moment,

621
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,459
potentially of banning every piece of electronics bigger

622
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:11,880
than a cell phone on the plane.

623
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,500
Oh, man, that's so crazy.

624
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:16,380
And what's interesting to me is so 20 years ago, like,

625
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,619
nobody had cell phones basically.

626
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,839
Well, they were big phones

627
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,020
and here's the thing, right? They're, they're,

628
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:21,415
is,

629
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:23,405
I think at this point there is literally no

630
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:26,055
way you could ban cell phones in pretty much any

631
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:28,925
area other than like change rooms and like the pool

632
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:32,974
-- because
-- remember when airplanes had phones in every seat,

633
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:34,954
like that big ugly telephone. Oh,

634
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:35,765
that's a blast.

635
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:40,064
Anyway, we should back this up first is so right now as we're recording this,

636
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:43,939
there are certain countries in the Middle East predominantly

637
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,540
that you are not allowed to have a,

638
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,680
a laptop

639
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,030
in the plane cabin

640
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,640
as it travels from the country to the United States,

641
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,199
you have to put it in your check bag

642
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,599
due to security reasons we're told.

643
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,479
And supposedly they're talking about now enforcing this ban

644
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:02,199
for every country flying into the United States,

645
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:02,589
all

646
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,410
international flights,

647
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:03,729
all,

648
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,650
and you know, the next step,

649
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:06,430
all

650
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,119
-- flight as well
-- outgoing to the fantastic, that's just great.

651
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:11,510
Well, you know,

652
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,910
you know, that's next. Right.

653
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,170
Assuming there's any reasonable justification to this, which,

654
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,189
which everyone suspects there isn't,

655
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,920
but whatever that, that's neither here nor there. The bigger point is

656
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:26,459
if nobody's allowed to bring a computer on an airplane, like,

657
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,510
well, that's crazy.

658
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:29,030
What do you

659
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:29,739
know,

660
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:32,020
what am I

661
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,760
on the zoo for? Four hours?

662
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,790
-- Four
-- hours.

663
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,969
I just flew to the Netherlands a couple of weeks ago and it was like 8.5 hours and

664
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:43,170
they did have the, the onscreen entertainment do hickey.

665
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:46,000
But the thing that would scare me more is

666
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,689
I would be very frightened to check my computer

667
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:49,959
in my bag,

668
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,229
which I forget which airline I flew.

669
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,000
But they don't have the in seat entertainment systems anymore.

670
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,810
They have, you know,

671
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:58,170
the little wifi server on the plane with media and I

672
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,849
think it was Delta and you have to download the app

673
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,609
so you can access the content and they did have tablets

674
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,489
for like five bucks that you could rent for the flight.

675
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,770
I never stupid question.

676
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,339
I think it was Delta.

677
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:10,410
Anyways, whatever the point being is,

678
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,030
would the airlines be allowed to have like

679
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,209
their loner tablets or laptops on the airplane?

680
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:17,660
I would assume so because it would go through

681
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,170
some rigorous security check and we'll put them,

682
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,780
-- but
-- then where do you leave those things on the airline? And, like, what the cleaners

683
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,109
that was like when they were talking about the whole, you know,

684
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,430
guns and cockpits thing and everybody was like, yeah, think this through,

685
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,140
it might not be a good idea, you know,

686
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,180
because, like, what are you gonna do when you park the plane? Like, who takes the gun?

687
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,859
Where does it go? Right. Like, what does the cleaning crew do with it? You know, like,

688
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:43,229
well, it just, what gets me is, is this seems like, you know,

689
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:45,520
it's a real pain in the ass policy change, but

690
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:50,329
I suspect it would actually be like a significant watershed moment for technology

691
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:55,140
because it would force a lot of change in behavior for people.

692
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:57,410
I don't know if it would. I think

693
00:27:57,689 --> 00:27:58,709
this would,

694
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,729
I, I think if they do this

695
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,930
as soon as the first senator

696
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,270
gets on an airplane and can't bring his computer, he's gonna get pissed off and,

697
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,969
and go pass some legislation that neuters the Ts a

698
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,150
well, see, and that's,

699
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,680
that's the other thing that really gets me about

700
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,000
this legislation if they were talking about banning cameras.

701
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,380
And, like I said, anything bigger than a cell phone essentially.

702
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,160
And here's the problem, like, it's one thing, you know, I went to, um,

703
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,010
I was flying home from Germany and I, I had, I bought a new corkscrew really nice one

704
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:27,030
and I totally forgot that they were at that time banned. Right.

705
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,810
So I get, you know, to the airport and they're like, you know, they,

706
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,329
like, they're like, here's your cork screw. You can either mail it or you can, like,

707
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,000
put it in the bin and I'm like, obviously I'm not gonna spend 20 bucks

708
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:36,250
this home. So, here you go.

709
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:39,020
Whatever, I'm annoyed. It was a really nice corkscrew. But

710
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,079
such is life.

711
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,579
People are not going to do that with their laptop or their tablet. Right.

712
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,339
These things cost like 1000 bucks or 2000 bucks, you know,

713
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:52,060
and like, you can't just mail a tablet without, you know, it's gonna get wrecked.

714
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,920
And is it, you get through customs?

715
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,250
I mean,

716
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,060
exactly

717
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:56,530
in

718
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:56,859
a

719
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,900
foreign country. Good luck.

720
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,640
Um, and so, yeah, I mean, people can't, like, they're not gonna walk,

721
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,260
-- here's
-- here. Let's even set that aside. Let's think about this. Just

722
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,810
we, we'll say from an insurance perspective.

723
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,020
Oh, God. No, no.

724
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:13,310
Is the cost of

725
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,520
the potential damage that's gonna be done because let's face it.

726
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,380
You're gonna lose one, maybe two airplanes, right?

727
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,060
Is the, is the monetary loss of that?

728
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,140
Less than,

729
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,280
than the loss that will exist from people not being

730
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,260
able to bring their computers on airplanes and do work.

731
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:28,150
And

732
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:28,479
again,

733
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:32,060
it's one of those classic externalized costs. So the airline doesn't give a rats.

734
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:36,729
Uh, they don't have to care, but I suspect societal cost.

735
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:40,739
I suspect the cost of society would outweigh by several magnitudes.

736
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,280
The cost of an actual attack happening. But in reality,

737
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,449
you'd be better off thwarting this attack by

738
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:50,310
having like proper security at check in and,

739
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,849
-- and to get through the little line. Well,
-- the Israeli methods with

740
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:54,650
you

741
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,910
make sure you're not nervous.

742
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:56,489
Well,

743
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,560
this reminds me of it's kind of like the whole nuclear power

744
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:03,280
plant versus coal power plant debate when it comes to radiation release,

745
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:03,589
right.

746
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,859
Nuclear power plants tend to not release a lot of radiation

747
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:09,579
except once in a while when they break like Fukushima,

748
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,660
which

749
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:10,780
three Mile Island,

750
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,319
right?

751
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,380
And, but then you compare that to a coal

752
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:18,439
plant which is burning coal which typically has various radioactive elements in it

753
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,640
and they're just constantly putting out a low level of radioactivity.

754
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:21,890
Well,

755
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:22,349
not just

756
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,439
there's all these other terrible chemicals.

757
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,400
I mean, I know people that, that own property that was downwind from a nuclear,

758
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,939
I mean, a coal plant and like their,

759
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:35,300
their soil is just contaminated beyond reason at this point from all the,

760
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,859
the mercury and the sulfur.

761
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,069
Yeah. But I mean, it's one of those classic things.

762
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,859
-- If you do it a lot, sort of at a low level, you, you basically can get away with
-- it.

763
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:43,739
You know what it is?

764
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,560
It's just like if you look at airplanes versus automobiles,

765
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,660
lots of people are afraid of airplanes.

766
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,489
But your odds of,

767
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:53,859
I, I think this every time I, I get on an airplane is

768
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,930
the odds of dying on the ride to the airport were

769
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,130
significantly higher than the odds of me dying on the airplane.

770
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,469
Right.

771
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:02,619
But no one, no one's afraid to ride to the airport,

772
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,369
but people are afraid to get on that airplane.

773
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,489
And additionally

774
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,089
an airplane crashes, huge news. Right.

775
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,030
Literally thousands of people die every day from automobiles.

776
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,260
Nobody talked about it.

777
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,329
Yeah.

778
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,010
Yeah.

779
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,209
So, yeah. No, it's, I, I think this would be interesting because

780
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:20,329
I can't even take my laptop to a foreign,

781
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,050
you know, country without checking it. And, I mean, it,

782
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,900
the bags, I mean, I've seen what they do to bags.

783
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:26,719
Oh, I know.

784
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:30,689
Every time I check a bag, especially on international flights it looks like a truck,

785
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:32,170
ran it over when I get it back.

786
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,369
Probably because a truck ran it over. Right.

787
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,280
-- Yeah,
-- it's got tire marks on it. I've actually, yeah, I mean,

788
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:38,150
yeah.

789
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,000
No, it's, but I'm just really curious because, you know what it would this really,

790
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:42,530
you know, because

791
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:44,050
I remember back in the day, you know,

792
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,000
teleconferencing is going to destroy business.

793
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,569
Travel. Well, no, no, face to face meetings are still very much a thing.

794
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:52,329
So, here's the thing I keep thinking of

795
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:56,729
in the context of this, this travel ban is

796
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,770
if I can't bring my computer with me in a reasonable way,

797
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,170
I'm either not going to use a computer which

798
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,910
seems ridiculous or what's more likely is I'm just

799
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,010
gonna get somewhere and I'm gonna buy a chromebook

800
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,770
because you can get them for next to nothing.

801
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:11,650
Well, I mean, the,

802
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,750
the good thing now is cell phones have gotten

803
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,859
to a point where they're powerful enough to,

804
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:16,380
you know, uh,

805
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,530
hook up to a TV and basically be a little baby

806
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,780
computer and especially if you're using stuff in the cloud,

807
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:23,319
you know, the heavy lifting can be done on the back end,

808
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:26,239
you know, with respect to word processing and spreadsheets. And

809
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,209
because there's what is it?

810
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:28,239
I want to say, a Samsung,

811
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,219
that that's actually seems to be the major part

812
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:32,160
of their ad campaign is like the little phone,

813
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,359
lots of,

814
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:37,030
lots of companies have been trying to do this for a long time because I think motor,

815
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:39,994
-- you don't have a choice anymore.
-- Right? Yes, seriously.

816
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:42,854
And, and I think even the canonical phone did this, right? The bu

817
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:43,464
phone,

818
00:32:43,604 --> 00:32:44,464
I think that was they,

819
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:46,734
-- they tried to make that their selling point and
-- every

820
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:49,755
single apple phone currently can do a Bluetooth keyboard.

821
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:50,635
Uh

822
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:53,354
They do not do a Bluetooth mouse as I understand it.

823
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:57,849
And you can easily like with an Apple TV or a Mac, you can display

824
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,829
-- that
-- actually you could get away with this with

825
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,810
an Android phone because if you had a chromecast and

826
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,969
Android will do a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse or heck,

827
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:10,569
you can even just plug a wire to in if you have the right adapter.

828
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:11,609
So,

829
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,560
and now you have a trusted web browser that you can put

830
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:17,160
your credentials into and you don't have to worry about using some,

831
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,040
you know, public terminal.

832
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,319
Like we were talking about those hotel

833
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,449
business machines.

834
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,640
-- People who
-- God

835
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,189
-- only
-- knows

836
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,020
it, it, it pains me to see it happen.

837
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,819
-- So,
-- no, I think that's honestly kind of the future because we,

838
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:31,739
we're already there where everybody is carrying a phone around in their pocket.

839
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:34,219
And I know I've had to make the mental switch of,

840
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:38,510
from carrying a phone in my pocket to carrying a computer in my pocket.

841
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,589
That also happens to make phone calls.

842
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:43,829
I, I almost never use mine for phone calls.

843
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,380
Yeah.

844
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:47,800
You know, but I, I mean, I still think of my phone kind of primarily as a phone,

845
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,739
not as a computer for my kids.

846
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,079
They don't make like to them, an ipod is an iphone.

847
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:55,060
It's just, it has like poor internet connectivity when you're on the road or,

848
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:57,959
you know, but that's kind of what I see it as too is,

849
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:03,020
is my phone, the data connection is worth far more to me than minutes.

850
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,109
Oh, yeah. Yeah. If I had to give up data or

851
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:06,880
-- minutes.
-- Oh,

852
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:07,839
it's,

853
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,020
I

854
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,418
want,

855
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,159
in fact, I don't, my phone never rings. Nobody calls me.

856
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,280
We just use text messages and, and,

857
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,270
and what not.

858
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,728
It's, this is

859
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:19,688
what a mess.

860
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,719
That's all I'm gonna say it will be interesting

861
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,889
to see what happens here because my suspicion is

862
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,719
we're either going to get

863
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:29,629
good security out of this because the right people,

864
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,050
we're not annoyed and I don't think we will

865
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,510
-- or
-- the TS A has had the chance to do good security forever and they've tried it,

866
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,159
you know, they have the

867
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,370
-- training and all that other stuff
-- but

868
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,030
they haven't

869
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,438
happened.

870
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,929
No one's made them,

871
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,330
they basically had a blank check to do nearly whatever they want.

872
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:45,620
And,

873
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:48,120
and do you remember a couple of years ago when they kind of shut down

874
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,139
a bunch of security lines and security at the airports was taking forever and a

875
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:52,350
day

876
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,110
because

877
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,310
they were, they were upset about something. I don't even remember what it was now

878
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,040
and of course, everyone just talk about,

879
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,419
I'll get to get TS a precheck and that's kind of the, the, the savior of it all,

880
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,310
which I had,

881
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,330
which did make a huge difference. By the way,

882
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,739
I'm still waiting for my nexus travel card.

883
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,580
Right. Right.

884
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,989
But anyway, the point is, uh, you know,

885
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,929
what happened is people got annoyed and they gave them the

886
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:14,330
money they needed to hire the people or whatever it was.

887
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,600
Right. They, they didn't fix it by everyone getting precheck.

888
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,489
They, they actually made the experience less painful.

889
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,919
And so I'm, I'm hopeful that they will make this less painful,

890
00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:27,879
but I'm not at all convinced it will be the case,

891
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:28,540
I

892
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,969
think part of the big problem with air travel though

893
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:34,209
is that you've got just so many different types of,

894
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,070
you know, like I go to the airport and there's obviously the people that, like,

895
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,209
business travel constantly and they're just, you know, they're the pros,

896
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:41,010
they know what to do.

897
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:43,030
They're, you know, they, they don't,

898
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:46,330
they get on the plane, they get their bags in pretty quick, you know,

899
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:48,570
and then, and, and you've got that all the way, like,

900
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,340
somebody like me who only travels a couple times a year.

901
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,510
But I'm, you know, I'm a relatively well behaved air traveler, I think. You know,

902
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:55,239
and then I've seen people where, you know,

903
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,500
because of baggage fees and stuff like a family of

904
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,830
four has one bag and the airline lady is like,

905
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,379
no, it's like way too heavy.

906
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:01,750
Like,

907
00:36:01,939 --> 00:36:04,360
it's 100 and 20 pound bag, you know,

908
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,290
you're gonna have to take some stuff out.

909
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:07,040
Right.

910
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,270
And, and they're all like,

911
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,689
wailing and gnashing their teeth at the front of the line and it's

912
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:13,870
like I just need to check my bag and get on the airplane.

913
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:14,780
Get out of my way, please.

914
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:17,639
You know, if you're a frequent traveler, you just don't check bags. I

915
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,939
know this.

916
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,580
I know I'm, I'm getting there. I'm, I

917
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,830
almost never check bags now because

918
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,300
actually this is part of it too is if I had to check a bag with a computer

919
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,209
in it every time I'd get super annoyed because

920
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:32,070
I hate checking bag because it takes forever.

921
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,070
And then when you get there you have to sit and wait for that stupid carousel.

922
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:38,500
And then your bag looks like it was run over by a truck because it was.

923
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:38,719
But

924
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,340
conversely, you've got people trying to shove absurdly large bags into, you know,

925
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,939
these, like, regional air jets.

926
00:36:43,949 --> 00:36:44,439
Where,

927
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,879
uh, yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm,

928
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,370
I know it's,

929
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,149
-- you
-- can't,

930
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,570
but anyways, the, the, what I was getting at is the problem is if, you know,

931
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,290
if you were doing security for a bunch of seasoned travelers, it would,

932
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:57,129
you could,

933
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:00,659
you'd essentially have the chance to train them and get the system working well.

934
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,199
But the problem is you've got all these people who almost never fly or fly,

935
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:06,290
it's their first time or whatever and they just,

936
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:07,840
they just gum it up.

937
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,360
Right.

938
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,389
They don't know, to take their shoes off before, you know, while they're in the line,

939
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,580
they don't know to take their belt off.

940
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:13,929
Like,

941
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:15,570
how many people have you seen go through the metal

942
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,909
detector and have to go back and forth like,

943
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:19,110
four times because they keep taking crap out of their pockets.

944
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,149
I experienced that

945
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,949
on Friday.

946
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,770
Yeah, exactly. So, see, that's my concern is even if you have a really good,

947
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,120
you know, system,

948
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,449
these people just don't know how to behave in it.

949
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,550
Right. And they're just gonna do silly crazy things and just muck it up and,

950
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,840
you know,

951
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:37,989
uh,

952
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:42,229
yeah, I, I, so I don't think really air travel will ever,

953
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:44,830
you know, be super well oiled, uh, like,

954
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,080
look at driving people drive every day of their

955
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,270
life and they still don't know what to do.

956
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:53,229
-- So,
-- here's, here's to, to also kind of define this is while you were talking,

957
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,750
I just looked it up and it says, uh, like,

958
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,320
less than 10% of travelers are what you'd call, like,

959
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,500
frequent flyer type travelers that have, you know,

960
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,270
the awards for the people who travel a lot.

961
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:02,629
Right.

962
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:03,389
Yeah.

963
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,919
And so you think about that

964
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:08,409
90% of the people on the airplane are not frequent travelers,

965
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,909
we could maybe assume 20% have a clue.

966
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,750
And then so basically 80% of these people, like they,

967
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,570
they don't know what they're doing and this is going

968
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,860
to be a monkey show like we've never seen.

969
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,270
And then you've also got like the random drunk guy

970
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,669
on the plane who in some cases it's so bad.

971
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,239
They have to, like, land the plane somewhere and boo,

972
00:38:25,649 --> 00:38:28,510
I'm so glad I've never been on an airplane with that guy.

973
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,030
Well, you know what else I think of is we hate security lines. Now,

974
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:37,179
imagine when the TS A is standing there telling people

975
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,699
you can't bring your computer on the airplane, you have to check it

976
00:38:41,129 --> 00:38:42,179
and then they're gonna say,

977
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:46,120
but I don't have a bag to check or they've already checked their bag.

978
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:48,229
Do you think the airline's gonna go dig that bag

979
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,899
by the time you get to the security line?

980
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:50,500
Right.

981
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:52,090
That's the whole point of that.

982
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:52,570
Oh,

983
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,580
my goodness. This is gonna be,

984
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,100
I, I, again,

985
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,010
I don't,

986
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:57,139
I,

987
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,679
I don't think the answer is going to be

988
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:01,729
everyone using their phones because let's face it too.

989
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,449
We're

990
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,280
as lame as we think we are. Sometimes we are

991
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,340
way more tech savvy than nearly every other human on the planet.

992
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,149
Right.

993
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,879
So, so normal people are,

994
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:14,669
are not going to be able to use their phones even if they wanted to.

995
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,439
They, they don't know what a Bluetooth keyboard is.

996
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:18,209
They don't want to know what a Bluetooth keyboard is.

997
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:20,669
They will never learn what a Bluetooth keyboard is.

998
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,469
Right?

999
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,790
And so you're gonna have a situation where it's going to be so bad.

1000
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,469
I don't see how they can do this long term. I suspect they will try it

1001
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,350
and it's going to explode

1002
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,179
and then they'll,

1003
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:35,639
they'll find some reason why the threat is gone now and everything's fine.

1004
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:37,790
It's like, it's like, remember when you used to,

1005
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,149
you couldn't bring like fingernail clippers on an airplane

1006
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:41,270
right

1007
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:45,399
now. Now it's fine. What changed? People complain. They wanted to bring their

1008
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,620
finger clippers like that's all they

1009
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:46,860
did,

1010
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:47,610
you know.

1011
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:51,800
Well, but the thing is, you know, that's a relatively low impact, low,

1012
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:54,500
you know, risk thing and it's, it's easy to change.

1013
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,169
I mean, they still don't allow a lot of stuff on planes that they used to allow,

1014
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:00,189
you know, um, like small knives.

1015
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,649
Like, it's, what, two inch blades or something now, like,

1016
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:04,560
so if you buy a set of steak knives, you know,

1017
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,159
you got to throw them out things like that,

1018
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,439
-- you know,
-- I, I don't know, I never tried taking a blade on an airplane,

1019
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,070
-- so
-- I know, I know in, uh, oh, jeez, which airport was it? Um, anyways, I was,

1020
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,830
they gave us like plastic cutlery

1021
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,149
but we weren't past security yet.

1022
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
And I was like, what? And she's like, yeah,

1023
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:26,310
so what happened is somebody, like, grabbed

1024
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,110
a knife and went running at the security people. So now

1025
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,239
all the, like, metal cutlery has been banned in the airport, like,

1026
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,110
whether or not you're on the security side or not.

1027
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,550
And I'm like,

1028
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:36,159
I'm like

1029
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:36,969
one

1030
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:37,989
airport, right?

1031
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:38,290
Not

1032
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:39,850
-- just the
-- one

1033
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,669
and it's just like I, because I really hate those little plastic knives,

1034
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,270
you know, they're

1035
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:44,679
so

1036
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:45,050
annoying

1037
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,669
actually. What was, where was it?

1038
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:50,959
I was on an airplane once on a, on a flight and they gave us like, real silverware

1039
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,449
and I thought,

1040
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:54,159
no, no, it was not

1041
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:55,340
the European

1042
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:55,560
airline.

1043
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:56,209
It was,

1044
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,860
but I, I was flying from the US O

1045
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,659
so II, I just kept thinking, I'm like, this is

1046
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,739
why are they doing this? This seems,

1047
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,560
yeah, whatever. Anyway.

1048
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,070
And, and amazingly the plane still got there and,

1049
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,600
and nobody stabbed anyone else with the, the dull metal.

1050
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,419
Well, I feel like, yeah, like I just, I, I have this, like,

1051
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:17,719
mental image of you sitting in the bathroom for an hour, like,

1052
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:19,659
sharpening that knife on something.

1053
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,840
I'll show that you have like your tiny little stabby thing.

1054
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:24,459
Well, it, it's Schneier

1055
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:27,520
always says this is, you know, we can't keep weapons out of prison.

1056
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,050
How are we going to keep them out of an airport?

1057
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,919
You know, if somebody wants to build a sho

1058
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,429
they're gonna do it.

1059
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,090
It's just, people don't want to because they're generally there for a reason.

1060
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:37,669
-- Right to
-- go.

1061
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,860
People are reasonably sane and well behaved.

1062
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,989
They are, they are

1063
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,260
for the purpose of noting each other random,

1064
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:45,189
the crazy people ruin everything.

1065
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,239
Yes, they do

1066
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,219
anyway.

1067
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,689
And security people, maybe the

1068
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:53,639
part of me actually really hopes they do this just

1069
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:55,810
because if nothing else it'll be such a gong show.

1070
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,860
I, I will appreciate the gong show

1071
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,290
of this but I travel enough that I don't want to do

1072
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,469
because

1073
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,530
I'm gonna be stuck in line behind the, like 75 year old man that doesn't,

1074
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:10,560
they'll have a line for no electronics and then for everybody else.

1075
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,929
-- Yes,
-- we need more lines and security. That's exactly what the solution is.

1076
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,409
If we already have two,

1077
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,409
we need more.

1078
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,520
Mhm.

1079
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,790
Just have your, well,

1080
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,189
I guess we already have the evil bit in terms of you can get a pre clear.

1081
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,310
So we have the good bit.

1082
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:24,310
-- Uh,
-- they do,

1083
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,070
they do.

1084
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,350
-- But
-- anyways,

1085
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,949
let's bring it home, man.

1086
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:31,179
It's, it's time to go. All right. Thanks for listening, everybody.

1087
00:42:31,189 --> 00:42:33,709
Thank you, Kurt for this bizarrely enlightening conversation.

Thanks everybody.
