Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,090
Probably one of the best well known security podcasts on the internet with myself,

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,750
Kurt Siefried

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,329
-- and my partner Josh Pressers.
-- Against my better judgment. I let Kurt talk me into

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,729
recording an episode where I have no knowledge of the topic.

5
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,409
-- And that intro does not spark joy.
-- I

6
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,329
just told you what the topic is, what you, what

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,190
we're going to talk about, well known security dot TXD.

8
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:35,000
-- That
-- thing. I heard the Dutch government is mandating it for all the websites. Now.

9
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:35,520
That's cool.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,799
That's actually really cool. I think

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,380
here's the fundamental problem I have with security dot TXD by definition,

12
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,669
anyone competent enough to know about it

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,860
is also probably competent enough to just blindly fire

14
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:49,439
an email to security at your domain.com or whatever

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,810
or otherwise find how to contact you

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,799
people that don't use well known security dot TXD.

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,389
Keep emailing our, our data protection officer or sales or

18
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:59,479
whatever.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,840
But one thing I will say where security dot TXD

20
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,599
is of benefit is places that have a bug bounty.

21
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,620
Cool, good. But which one like which provider? Right?

22
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:10,519
Because I've been in a situation where I, you know, somebody's like, oh,

23
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,250
they have a bug bounty.

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,959
I'm like a, huh? Like, do I get a hint?

25
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:13,800
Which one

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,139
you

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,230
got to find out?

28
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:16,500
Yeah. Uh,

29
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:18,300
look, there's

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,819
a reason these people email, like,

31
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,919
your legal department or your sales department or your DPO or whoever

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,680
-- the,
-- well, they're all the big bounties. Well, but

33
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,870
those places usually res

34
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:31,980
respond and that's why they do it because a lot of

35
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:34,279
times if you email a lot of companies at security at

36
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:37,540
it, it might be a black hole. There was somewhere with

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,760
-- Red Hat where security at went
-- to

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,459
Microsoft you're thinking of because it was

39
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,239
originally set up as like campus security.

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,889
And so that's why

41
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:44,080
they

42
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,419
had

43
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,660
Microsoft does it

44
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:47,660
actually at least

45
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,239
why was Red Hat secular, not security? I always wondered that, but

46
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,860
it was some bizarre old reason that apparent, well,

47
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,309
security went to the same place but

48
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,540
they always told people secular because apparently

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,400
in like 1997 or something, some security nerds decided it should be se

50
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,660
alert for alerting to vulnerabilities or something. I don't remember the details.

51
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,419
I just know

52
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:15,830
it was one of those bizarre historic decisions that

53
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,729
haunted everyone involved for decades to come

54
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:21,649
because I always found it super awkward.

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,139
Well, but the thing is though, if we actually get security dot TXT more widely known,

56
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:31,229
one nice thing is, well, for example, scraping websites

57
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,979
to find it as trivial

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,740
compared to trying to find a security contact.

59
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,259
Although honestly, with chat GP T and analyzing web pages and stuff,

60
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,509
it's getting easier to like, look at a random web page and say, like, you know,

61
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,800
tell me what color the product is or is, you know, there's security

62
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,660
reporting mechanism on this web page, right?

63
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,710
I mean, sure, I, I also feel like

64
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,199
I feel like putting this,

65
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,889
how do I put this nicely if you can't

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,369
get a security dot TXT on your website

67
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,289
and, or technically, or you can't, like, sell your management on doing it.

68
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,190
Well, there's your answer as far as report,

69
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,270
what will happen to reporting security bugs to that organization?

70
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:10,080
Right.

71
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,330
No, I mean, I,

72
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:15,660
I don't view security dot TXT necessarily as having value in the contents.

73
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:19,410
Just the fact that if you have one, it shows a certain level of maturity.

74
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,149
Oh, it's that signal that we're probably not gonna sue you for reporting a bug to us.

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,529
Right. Because how many places like, I will never email a bank a security flaw

76
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:32,710
because I've just heard too many horror stories

77
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,190
and I'm just like, not my monkey, not my circus.

78
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,169
Right. Right.

79
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:37,080
You know what I love is,

80
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:39,710
I'll talk to people and I'll say things like that and they're like,

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,949
but what if your money's at the bank?

82
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,509
I'm like,

83
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:43,022
bank has insurance.

84
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,013
Have you not heard of the FDIC?

85
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:45,723
We, we,

86
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:48,263
we literally just went through this whole thing with Silicon

87
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:51,483
Valley Bank where even if your money's not properly insured,

88
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,632
you'll still get it back.

89
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:53,382
-- Right.
-- Right.

90
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:55,662
And then I also love that then the conversation turns into,

91
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:58,623
but what if someone logs in as you and, and steals your money?

92
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:01,802
I'm like, that's called fraud also insured. Like we're still fine.

93
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:02,302
It's

94
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:02,682
ok.

95
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:07,615
It's funny, we actually just, uh, on Wednesday did a threat model for

96
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,455
essentially the scenario where

97
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,936
the attacker is able to run some code or get you

98
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:15,716
to do something like run a bookmark on your web browser.

99
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:19,055
So they have code running within your web browser, steal your security token.

100
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:19,935
And how

101
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:22,665
do you know what, what can we do to prevent that?

102
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:23,985
And actually we'll have to have a discussion

103
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:26,256
about step up authentication at some point later.

104
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:27,829
Yeah, not today.

105
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,630
But yeah, back to this. Like

106
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,070
I fundamentally feel like when I look for the security dot TXT,

107
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,640
especially a security related vendor and they don't have one.

108
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:37,709
I'm just like, oh,

109
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:38,769
you know, I'm

110
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,029
well, it's like email like you,

111
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:45,010
well, now you have to do SPF and DC M if you want your email to get anywhere.

112
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,880
I mean, basically, I don't know if security TXT will ever catch on

113
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,910
to that degree.

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,019
-- But
-- because, well, it was, the thing is like you have to do SPF and D Mark and DC

115
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,109
M on your email if you want it delivered.

116
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,510
Like it's just that simple, same thing. With http S

117
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,209
Google search engine optimization, like the HTTP S is part of your ranking.

118
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,730
So everybody's like, oh, well, I guess we have to finally turn it on,

119
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,070
you know,

120
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,250
and I get that it's complicated like the BBC had that excellent write up on

121
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,100
why it took them like two years to enable HTTP S across their websites.

122
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:16,510
You know,

123
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,049
because the third party includes in ads and

124
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,820
everything and obviously now it's a lot easier,

125
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:21,380
but back in the day it was not.

126
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,559
So anyway, that's the thing. Security dot TXT will never have that driver.

127
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:26,309
Ok.

128
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:29,329
I want us to back up a little bit because there are going

129
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:32,600
to be people listening who don't understand what security dot TXT is.

130
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:36,540
And so let's start at the very beginning and explain what it is and how it works.

131
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:36,970
I will start,

132
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,799
I just looked it up RFC 9116.

133
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,809
So this has been adopted by the I ETF.

134
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:46,170
Yes and Ashley, let's back it up. Even one more

135
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,700
well known U Ria, well known U I is a uniform resource identifier for

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,570
L path prefixes that start with slash dot well, dash known slash.

137
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,239
They are implemented in web servers.

138
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,070
So that request to the server for well

139
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,170
known services or information are available at U

140
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:01,160
L's consistent

141
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,070
well known locations across servers. And there's actually about

142
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,910
uh there's a couple dozen of these, for example, there's the

143
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:11,359
Acme challenge one, you know, for doing uh domain verification.

144
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,260
There's things like there's one for Apple account

145
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:16,809
based user enrollment for mobile device management anyways,

146
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,440
the point is there's a whole bunch of these and,

147
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,720
but what's interesting is the list at Wikipedia

148
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,980
only security dot TXT has its own page.

149
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:25,779
The rest of them are like, I have no idea how widely used they are.

150
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,920
If at all are the other ones. RFC. Si bet not.

151
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:33,209
Uh, some of them are and some of them are backed by vendors.

152
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,579
-- Let's
-- let's talk about security dot TXT.

153
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,660
I got the RFC pulled up, I'll put a link in the show

154
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,769
notes, right? So there's sections that are defined

155
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,369
for security dot TXD. Number one

156
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,410
Acknowledgments.

157
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,540
This is where you can acknowledge security researchers for their reports.

158
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:52,739
This used to be the only thing we did for security researchers who sent us reports.

159
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:52,940
Yeah.

160
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,440
Well, and again, we've talked about that on the show where, you know, I,

161
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,820
I would love to send you money but like legally I can't

162
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,700
or it's just too much work

163
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,799
and then they have next section canonical.

164
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,790
It's a field indicator, canonical URL S or security dot

165
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,230
te file is located whatever. Not exciting.

166
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,579
Well, no, that's important because for example,

167
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,410
you can have a lot of sub properties just point at your main security dot TXT

168
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,750
because also you got to remember subdomains.

169
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,260
So like, ideally,

170
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:20,910
ideally you serve a security dot TXT on every

171
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:22,510
the host name that

172
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,000
you have.

173
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:24,429
Right.

174
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:27,390
Reminds me I should probably set up a cloud flare rule for that anyway.

175
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,869
I just serve it off the route because

176
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,890
close enough. Right. I agree. I agree completely.

177
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,320
So, the canonical one is actually, it's quite good.

178
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,890
-- Uh, contact is obviously the next one. You can't. No,
-- don't just give ahead.

179
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,670
I'm reading the list. You don't read the list.

180
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:41,529
That's right.

181
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,529
That's right. Don't be, don't be getting out of your stay in your lane. All right.

182
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,489
-- So contact, right. Just remember
-- who has the six buttons.

183
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,809
I then no one, no one understands what that means. So anyway,

184
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:52,589
anyway,

185
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:53,260
I'm, I'm

186
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:53,640
getting a

187
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:58,630
contact contact field, uh, how researchers can contact you, right? Email address.

188
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,410
For example, it could be a URL, whatever makes sense, right?

189
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,290
In their example, they have a telephone number

190
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,820
part of me wants to do that now just because I think it would be awesome.

191
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,149
Well, and again though, it's, for example, if it's a bank, like, come on,

192
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,450
that's fair. That's fair.

193
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:13,880
Or,

194
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,690
and the thing to remember is that telephone number may not

195
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,970
be externally reachable or it may be going into IVR hell,

196
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,019
or it might just

197
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,329
-- get to a mailbox if
-- it's not externally reachable like it shouldn't be in this.

198
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,700
Anyway, we're going to keep going.

199
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,779
-- Does the
-- spec actually say that this stuff has to be publicly available?

200
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,489
Because I don't,

201
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,070
my understanding of security dot TXT is it doesn't have to be public.

202
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,820
-- Like this could be for internal resourcing too.
-- I'm not going to get into this.

203
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:42,270
Anyway. Encryption encryption key, you can use AC P GP key is the intended key. P GPS.

204
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,940
The funny thing here is uh the discussion on hacker news about this.

205
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,219
Everybody just basically says either one

206
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,010
nobody's ever sent us encrypted email and

207
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,849
I'm trying to think of red hat. Like how often do we get encrypted email to sec

208
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:55,260
alert?

209
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,369
We got it a couple times a month for sure because we had the

210
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,849
that banana signing server we had to use for decrypting things.

211
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:04,799
But for the majority of people,

212
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:07,599
they're never gonna see an encrypted email and more to the point now,

213
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:10,049
all emails pretty much encrypted on the wire.

214
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,250
-- So like close enough, right? Whatever,
-- whatever, it's fine.

215
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,130
-- I
-- think the encryption thing basically, if you're implementing this,

216
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,440
you can basically ignore it.

217
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,059
Uh expires. I love this field so much.

218
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:21,469
I

219
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:22,859
do it. It says

220
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,909
I'm just gonna read it because I'm gonna screw it up if I don't,

221
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,010
the expires field indicates the date and time after which the data contained in

222
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,739
the security dot TXD file is considered stale and should not be used.

223
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,619
I love this and it says that the value of the

224
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,580
field should be less than a year in the future.

225
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:41,724
This reminds me of the the the certificate problem where

226
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:43,924
people get certificates once a year and they forget.

227
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:47,335
So it take two weeks to remember how to request a certificate

228
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:51,034
and get it versus purposely expiring something on a regular basis.

229
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:53,934
So you're forced to deal with it constantly.

230
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:56,650
-- It's perfect.
-- It's, it's even better than that where

231
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,140
if you encounter uh uh security dot TXT with like a short time frame then you know that

232
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,619
it was probably put up not too long ago and it's sort of still active now in fairness.

233
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,729
like the one for the CS A I just said it to 2050 but also

234
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,330
cloud security alliance.org, like we're kind of known for doing security stuff.

235
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,440
-- You know what I mean?
-- You shouldn't set it to 2050. You lazy bum.

236
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,650
I just, I can't be bothered to automate updating it

237
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,270
-- anyway.
-- Moving on.

238
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:24,572
I like it looking, hiring security jobs.

239
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:25,892
That one is great.

240
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:29,851
-- I think that one is lovely. This reminds
-- me, was it, who was it? Was it

241
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,012
cloud flare? Someone who

242
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:36,971
who you like when you look at the HTML, it would say like if you're looking at this,

243
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:38,281
you should call us or no

244
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:39,552
Akamai I think did that.

245
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:43,322
Yeah, a couple of them have done it and like Nintendo had one for developers.

246
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:46,541
Yeah, they had like an actual like if you dug through the code,

247
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:48,921
there was like a side scroller anyways, it was pretty cool.

248
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:49,874
It was a Nintendo

249
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:50,254
maybe

250
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:51,763
anyway,

251
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:54,013
policy in the next field.

252
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:59,653
Uh It has a link to the vulnerability disclosure policy, which is great. I like that.

253
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:02,554
There are vulnerability disclosure policies.

254
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:07,934
I I get that it's one of those documents that will explain what is going to happen

255
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:10,893
when a researcher reports a vulnerability to you.

256
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:15,133
Part of it is some researchers have absolutely insane expectations.

257
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:16,693
Like I remember working at Red Hat

258
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:19,616
and somebody reported a cross site scripting vulnerability to us.

259
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,736
And I've used the story before and they wanted daily updates and I'm like, no,

260
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:24,216
we'll fix it when we fix it.

261
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:26,135
And I got them to,

262
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:27,895
I don't know, necessarily to calm down,

263
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:30,495
but I got them to stop bugging me by pointing out here's another

264
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:35,575
publicly logged XSS with the CV E in the product that like it,

265
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:36,375
they'll fix it.

266
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:36,656
Some,

267
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:41,546
I always felt bad and got annoyed when a researcher would report

268
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:43,966
something that was minor and it's like we acknowledge this report,

269
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:44,216
but

270
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,838
you're not gonna fix it for the foreseeable future. And it's like I,

271
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:50,687
-- I just called your baby ugly and kicked it. But I'm sorry, man. You
-- see.

272
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:55,288
And I think part of it is again when you do things at scale, you kind of get over that.

273
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,098
Like I love reporting stupid,

274
00:11:57,107 --> 00:12:00,588
simple little vulnerabilities back in the day as a way of introducing myself.

275
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:02,487
I hated you so much courage. You

276
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:03,247
know, when

277
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:05,237
you, when I worked at Redhead and you didn't,

278
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
you would keep reporting these worthless temp file issues.

279
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:08,768
Oh, my goodness.

280
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:11,697
Well, part of it is, I was also trying to get some metrics to see what would happen.

281
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,450
We hated you. That's what happened. Ok. Fair.

282
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,820
I think what?

283
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,830
Well, but also what gets me is it's kind of like that whole and again,

284
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,260
this is another show but like I remember I was on a flight

285
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:25,070
and the thing that holds the curtain for the galley

286
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,109
was like broken and ripped out and I'm like,

287
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,210
oh, like that thing's broken.

288
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:30,289
He's like, oh, yeah, we have a zero defect tolerance policy.

289
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:31,250
We'll log it and I'm like,

290
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,979
well, clearly it's been broken for a while and your policy on zero defects is like,

291
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,940
like, hopefully they're triaging in like engines first,

292
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:43,229
you know, control surfaces and the, you know, the, the curtain for the galley,

293
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,780
-- whatever, you know, we'll fix it
-- later.

294
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:46,039
I'm sure they logged it.

295
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,909
Right. But anyway, all right, let's keep going. Preferred languages.

296
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,219
This makes sense what language we can contact you in.

297
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:52,070
Yeah. Right.

298
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,369
I,

299
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,969
and I think that matters a lot less now

300
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:58,390
that translation has become AAA very like Google translates

301
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,000
pretty decent and obviously the new chat GP T

302
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,780
and stuff like that is actually a lot better.

303
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,309
So,

304
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:07,950
and I mean, you and I both have as a skill probably on our resume, you know,

305
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,260
reading English as a third language,

306
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,349
poorly written security vulnerability reports.

307
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,390
Maybe because like some of the stuff that came into Red Hat was like,

308
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:19,469
you learn to parse weird stuff after a while.

309
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,710
Now. That's,

310
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,349
that's it.

311
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,539
Those are the fields.

312
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,469
It's very simple. It's,

313
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,349
it's one of those things anyone can do

314
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:31,599
and most of us don't, I don't have one at work and I should, I keep, it's on my list.

315
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,710
In fact, I have a, to do list it totally on there.

316
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,789
But it's one of those things that it's also minor

317
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,750
which makes it difficult to sometimes remember to do or to prioritize.

318
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,549
And I think that's one of the challenges this has.

319
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,130
So it's easy to say everyone should have one, have one and they should,

320
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,950
but they don't.

321
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,169
Well, again, that's, it's a good signal for like, do they do the details?

322
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,163
Do they take care of that little things? You know,

323
00:13:52,872 --> 00:13:57,302
-- I agree.
-- How many people have an extra roll of toilet paper in their bathroom

324
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:58,263
versus

325
00:13:58,403 --> 00:13:59,903
like what's on the wall is all you got?

326
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,982
I am confident that my Children have no idea how

327
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:05,143
toilet paper gets under the sink in my house.

328
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:07,643
I'm completely 100% certain of this fact.

329
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:09,583
I think they also don't understand that light

330
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:12,403
switches have an on and an off mechanism,

331
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:14,163
but that's another story.

332
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:16,963
I like it because it's short. It's simple.

333
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:20,853
It's, and it's a really good signal that this organization is probably not gonna

334
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:21,015
to

335
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:21,455
you

336
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:21,916
if you,

337
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:24,416
why did you want to talk about this?

338
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,596
Just because the Dutch government said everyone should use

339
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,616
these or was there some other nefarious reason,

340
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,375
mostly just because we've never talked about it officially on the show.

341
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:35,815
And it's been one of those things where it's been around kind of forever.

342
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:36,645
It's been a while. Yeah.

343
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:41,716
Like it was first done about what, uh five, I think the RFC is five years old now

344
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:43,536
according to,

345
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,015
-- but
-- it was before that,

346
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,375
according to Wikipedia,

347
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,486
the internet draft was first submitted in September of 2017.

348
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:51,010
Yeah.

349
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,549
And it was like one or two years before that where it was kind

350
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,309
of kicking around and some people did it or didn't do it or whatever.

351
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,840
But it's just

352
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:01,950
when I think about how much time I've spent trying to track down, like,

353
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,919
how do I report something to somebody?

354
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:04,880
Right.

355
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,440
Because if I, if, if this doesn't exist,

356
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,919
I go to the website and then I go to the contact and

357
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,150
there's almost never security contact. It is rare. Yes.

358
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,429
I randomly search maybe two or three of the

359
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,460
bigger bug bounties and maybe they show up,

360
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:17,309
maybe they don't.

361
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,299
Yep.

362
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,940
And then at that point it's kind of like, well,

363
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:22,419
yeah, I'm not gonna,

364
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:23,659
I'm just gonna

365
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,200
-- just forget about it.
-- Well, ok, look. So there's, I think

366
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,760
another piece to this story and

367
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,900
there's some history behind

368
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,659
the universe of disclosure. Mhm. Back in the early days

369
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:40,619
you either couldn't contact a company because they

370
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,260
just didn't have a mechanism or it was dangerous

371
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,270
and it was,

372
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,669
you just post things to full disclosure or to bug track or whatever and be like YOLO,

373
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:51,049
we're, we're gonna do this

374
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,909
and then of course, that created a mess for its own reasons.

375
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,059
And you had organizations like Microsoft,

376
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:01,940
Microsoft would specifically call people out for behaving what,

377
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,570
what they thought was poorly.

378
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:06,549
And this is where the term responsible disclosure came from, right?

379
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,010
Which responsible disclosure really meant

380
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,260
you better do what Microsoft says

381
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:14,960
or else and there was no or else you just were put on their naughty list.

382
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:17,859
But we're seeing the thing with A I now, you know, it's gone from, have you,

383
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:19,729
did you notice that Google for example,

384
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:22,159
has dropped all the ethical A I stuff and gone to

385
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:25,419
what is it safe A I or some meaningless term

386
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,500
that essentially means whatever we want it to mean.

387
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,559
Yeah, like don't be evil A I, oh wait, no, we're not doing that anymore.

388
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,780
-- And
-- now they're all calling for regulation because of course they,

389
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:36,205
I want to pull the ladder up behind them. So start ups and

390
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:39,474
the open anyways, that'll actually be another show, open source A I,

391
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:40,244
right.

392
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:45,125
The thing I think is sadly unlike say email security or http S

393
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,125
there's nothing to drive

394
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:51,164
adoption of security dot txt other than organizations that mandate it much like,

395
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:55,445
oh perfect example, DNS EC is, is in the same boat like I've done kind of

396
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,395
um scans to see who actually uses DN Ss SE

397
00:16:59,534 --> 00:16:59,554
C.

398
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:00,775
And so, for example,

399
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,439
there's a couple of larger payment providers that do like paypal,

400
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:07,689
but the vast majority of payment providers, for example, don't.

401
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:12,729
-- Ok. TLS is good enough. Why would you do DNS X? She's gonna break stuff.
-- This is the

402
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,229
perfect example.

403
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:17,910
So I'm a payment provider. I'm not using DNS Sec.

404
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,290
How many times has my DNS been hijacked?

405
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:21,890
-- Exactly.
-- Zero.

406
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:25,118
Right. I'm not saying it's, it's completely zero for everyone.

407
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,499
But the reality is it's a very, very low number.

408
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,979
Well, and even if they hijack the DNS there, everything's TLS now.

409
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:32,369
Right. Well,

410
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,899
yeah, I mean, basically,

411
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:37,129
basically, well, you could potentially get it whatever.

412
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,328
No, no. Like, like Visa, for example, Visa, for example, actually has a, they don't,

413
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:41,968
basically,

414
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,818
they have a subset list of all the TLS providers as a developer you're allowed to use.

415
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:50,088
-- Ok.
-- Right. But if you control a domain, you could get a certificate for that domain.

416
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,048
Right. But like,

417
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,119
if you can hijack visa.com somehow

418
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,630
that, no, that's not happening.

419
00:17:55,969 --> 00:18:00,099
-- Right.
-- I mean, anyway, anyway, the, the point is DNS Sec

420
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:03,959
doesn't solve the problem it was set out to solve

421
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,079
and I think it's been shoehorned into something similar.

422
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:10,040
I think the problem it's set out to solve doesn't really exist anymore.

423
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,410
-- Well,
-- because almost all of this security, let me put it this way.

424
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,150
What if we had to, let me put it this way? What if we had lets and crypt.org in 1995.

425
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,930
No, I'm serious. Right.

426
00:18:21,939 --> 00:18:26,089
What would have happened to the security posture and all these security RFC S,

427
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,010
the vast majority of them,

428
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,969
like Dina SEK would have been stillborn. Like that would just be like,

429
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,920
we don't need this.

430
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,170
-- But
-- anyway, anyway, my comparison to security dot TXT,

431
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,670
I think it's kind of similar where security dot TXT

432
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:45,109
is solving a niche problem and the problem isn't contact information.

433
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:53,099
The problem is we need a way to signal we are not hostile to security researchers

434
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,579
and you could easily put a, put it just text and security dot Txt.

435
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:00,160
That's like we're not giant a hoes,

436
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:03,750
you can report stuff to us and that's basically the same thing

437
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,040
pretty much. Yeah.

438
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:05,569
Well,

439
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,939
-- you know what, that's a step forward.
-- It

440
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,609
is, it is,

441
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,410
I think you, at the very beginning of the show, you were like

442
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,689
anyone who has a security dot txt probably also has

443
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:24,329
a security reporting site or page that is findable by a person with moderate skill.

444
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,670
Right?

445
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:28,670
And it is, I'm ok with it.

446
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,750
I'm not saying you, I still think people should have a security dot Txt.

447
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,150
I think it's good to have one

448
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:34,229
and I think

449
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,270
it is,

450
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,300
it is unfortunate

451
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,180
that

452
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:41,300
today not having one doesn't mean

453
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,099
you

454
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,719
are inept at security.

455
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:46,979
It just means maybe the security team hasn't had time to do it yet.

456
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,780
You know what I mean?

457
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,579
Because there are definitely companies hostile towards security.

458
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,900
And then there are companies that aren't and, and maybe someday

459
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,500
not having a security dot Txt will be the signal of there'd be dragons here.

460
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,939
-- I don't know.
-- I did forget one thing, there is one thing security dot Txt is missing.

461
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:02,510
That is

462
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,449
a real pain in the butt nowadays.

463
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:06,719
But that, and that is scope of coverage.

464
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,819
You can put that in your disclosure policy. That's what a disclosure policy is for.

465
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,520
Well, yeah,

466
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,439
but it would be nice if it was machine readable because especially for giving URL S

467
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,540
right,

468
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,569
it'd be kind of nice

469
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,430
like because we actually a perfect example at the cloud security

470
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,619
lines we have if you go to clouds security lines.org/security,

471
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,689
um we do have a what is in scope for security

472
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,890
reports and it's a giant list of all our domains.

473
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,689
But then we also have a list of what is

474
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:33,219
out of scope for security reports because for example,

475
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,170
we use, we use off

476
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,760
zero.

477
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,540
So there's cloud security lines dot off

478
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,060
zero.com which they run it's and it's like a redirection

479
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,709
magic thing for the authentication

480
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,589
and everybody's constantly like, oh, it redirects URL.

481
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,130
So I'm like, yeah, that's how the Samal stuff like has to do that.

482
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,589
And they're like, oh and I'm like number one, it's not our site.

483
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,579
Number two, that's how it works. And number three, you go ask all

484
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,209
zero to fix.

485
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,079
I would kind of like it if they did

486
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,500
or same thing for github.

487
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,300
Like we're like,

488
00:20:57,469 --> 00:21:00,160
you know, github.com/cloud security line slash star,

489
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,810
please fill out an issue in github for that thing.

490
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:04,599
And so it would be nice if,

491
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,119
if I could just put that in the security dot txt,

492
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,969
here's the deal.

493
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,000
You could do this if you wanted to. There's nothing stopping you.

494
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,800
It's a text file, put whatever you want in it, put a freaking poem in it.

495
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,349
It doesn't really matter when you work with bug bounties. The,

496
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:24,739
the list of things in scope and out of scope is generally just text on a website.

497
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,900
I, I don't think,

498
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,349
I don't think there's a convenient way to make that list, machine readable.

499
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,449
-- Even just having the urals are in or out of scope.
-- Maybe, maybe, I don't know. I'm not

500
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,349
fundamentally, I, it's, it's less about machine readable and more about, you know,

501
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,900
me redirecting users to like,

502
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,030
-- I'm sorry, we're just not gonna, it's here is out of scope
-- and, and,

503
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,500
and there's things you can't, I get that.

504
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,430
There's third party stuff you just can't. And it, it's, it's annoying and it sucks.

505
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,890
And because I remember when I ran the bug bar need elastic.

506
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,079
They were like, what's in scope? I said everything

507
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,469
they're like, what do you mean? I'm like,

508
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,530
everything's in scope.

509
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,510
If someone reports something we don't control,

510
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,459
I'm gonna give him a bounty and then I'll add it to the out of

511
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,369
scope list. Like that's the way it's going to work.

512
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,150
Well, that's, yeah,

513
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,089
that's why I added any best practices for SPFD Kim D Mark Betls http headers

514
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,810
and I just got tired of it.

515
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:11,410
So, all in all,

516
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:12,849
I mean, I think

517
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,069
I like it. Security dot TFT is cool. I don't have a lot else to say.

518
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:16,530
I feel like,

519
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,630
and I love that the Dutch government is sort of officially signaling now

520
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,890
we're not going to be jerks about you reporting stuff to us.

521
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,510
I mean, like this sets the tone from the top,

522
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,290
you know, it's like when uh was it.gov or whatever it is, like we're doing DNS SEC,

523
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,479
whether you like it or not and it sets the tone.

524
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,979
I think the government

525
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,030
having this file is less about maybe setting

526
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,949
a tone because the Dutch government has historically been

527
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,349
phenomenal in the context of cybersecurity.

528
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,270
Like they are ridiculously good and amazing.

529
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,410
They're like top five.

530
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:51,390
Yeah. If any of you are listening, like, come on the show, we'd love to talk to you.

531
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,790
But, but anyway, so

532
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:53,459
I

533
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:55,170
think for them,

534
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,760
it's probably more about legitimately making

535
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,699
the lives of security researchers easier.

536
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,579
Like they don't need to signal virtue,

537
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,719
virtue, signal, whatever the words are hard.

538
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,849
But you know what I mean?

539
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,189
They don't need to signal to anyone that they're the good guys.

540
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:11,900
I think in their context you just need to know. Ok, I'm a security researcher.

541
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,410
I found an issue in this Dutch website. Who the heck do I tell?

542
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,979
And in that context that is, I think the,

543
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:22,961
what security dot TXT is technically supposed to be for versus the

544
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,390
reality we see of virtue signaling of we're not giant a holes,

545
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:27,840
you know.

546
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,240
Well, to me it's, I mean, fundamentally it boils down to, I also,

547
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,801
when I'm testing providers look for signals and

548
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:38,630
actually a perfect example of something I'm really struggling with right now.

549
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,801
So 1015 years ago,

550
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:42,470
I was looking for providers that did HTTP S

551
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,090
and that was easy to check,

552
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,600
right?

553
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:48,421
You add an S to the URL and see if, if the little dinosaur pops up or not.

554
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:51,021
But nowadays, you know, one of the biggest challenges I'm looking for

555
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:55,021
two fa support for hardware tokens, number one and number two,

556
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,982
more importantly in a way support for more than one token, right?

557
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:00,501
Because like Google, Amazon, Microsoft github,

558
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:02,631
they all do this fine, they do it perfectly.

559
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:03,302
But for example,

560
00:24:03,312 --> 00:24:07,901
slack.com just recently force is forcing all workspace owners and admins

561
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:11,802
to go to two fa and I'm like, oh, that's good. And then I go to the page and I'm like, oh,

562
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:16,103
I can give them my phone number for S MS or I can install an authenticator app.

563
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:20,192
It's not great but not bad, but I can only do one and my phone number I can't have,

564
00:24:20,203 --> 00:24:21,723
for example, two authenticator apps,

565
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:22,603
I see.

566
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:24,623
-- Right.
-- So I if my phone breaks.

567
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:25,253
I

568
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:28,042
just use single sign on for that thing. It's way easier.

569
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,932
-- We
-- do and they're still forcing us to go to two fa,

570
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:31,682
oh, really?

571
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:32,142
Yeah,

572
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:33,052
I

573
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,133
have two, like

574
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:35,613
the cloud security lines,

575
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:38,683
we single sign on since like five minutes after I turned it on.

576
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:39,703
Hence the name,

577
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:41,723
right? Because I'm just like, this is,

578
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:44,703
this is easier, like anybody from cloud security lines.org.

579
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:47,713
Just how do I get into Slack? Well, you just go to Slack and click

580
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:49,213
but

581
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:55,904
the point is checking this stuff is hard and well, like well known security we need,

582
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,624
I think we need at least some public signals.

583
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,014
Otherwise people spend a lot of time,

584
00:25:00,024 --> 00:25:02,685
waste a lot of time trying to figure out if it's safe for who to report to.

585
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:04,635
Well, they, they don't even have to be public. Look.

586
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:08,444
I have, I have a great example of this. So I complained to you, I think last night

587
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,535
that, that the cake was a CE A

588
00:25:10,694 --> 00:25:12,635
IQ from stands for something.

589
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,844
-- Yeah, common assessment initiative questionnaire.
-- All right. There we go. Right.

590
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:17,505
It's just a gigantic questionnaire.

591
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,204
You can fill it out with details about your security posture.

592
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:22,574
I I filled it out for version 3.1.

593
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:25,665
I think internally for work version four just came out before.

594
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:27,045
It's like an incredibly

595
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,020
c service provider focused

596
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,260
which falls outside of the, the problem that I need this for

597
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:39,369
because I need to explain our internal security to external parties, right?

598
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,530
And so whatever, I'm just gonna keep 3.1 for the foreseeable future.

599
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,369
My answer

600
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,459
to that is like, well, unfortunately, the cloud security line,

601
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:48,689
so we do tend to be cloud security focused obviously,

602
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:50,479
but having said that I,

603
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,896
I am raising what you brought internally because I think

604
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,067
part of it too is cake is big enough now that

605
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,467
-- it's kind of one. It's
-- fantastic. But anyway, so here's the deal.

606
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:00,067
I have a customer that's like, hey,

607
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:03,827
I want to see all of your security policy documents and I was like,

608
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:05,427
-- we
-- get
-- those all the time,

609
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:07,546
but here's, here's what happens, right?

610
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:08,067
So I'm like,

611
00:26:08,077 --> 00:26:10,837
absolutely not because they're obviously filled to the brim

612
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:13,707
with like pi I and internal system information,

613
00:26:13,784 --> 00:26:15,394
like all kinds of stuff I'm not distributing.

614
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:19,193
So I say here's a cake, take this and then they come back like this isn't good enough,

615
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,004
send us your documents.

616
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:21,284
And I'm like, no,

617
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,723
I'm not sending you these documents. Let's have a call.

618
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:25,723
I want to understand your problem and it turned out

619
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,923
what they actually wanted was they wanted to understand our internal

620
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:32,543
security software development life cycle, our SDLC, right.

621
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:36,923
I'm like, oh, well, that's easy. Like I've got that filled out over here for you.

622
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,260
I'll just here take this, but it's like one of those things where

623
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,041
when you are dealing with, I think a lot of vendors, especially small vendors,

624
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,220
they don't know how to talk about this stuff or how to do this stuff.

625
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,821
And so sometimes it's probably easier to just make ridiculous requests, like,

626
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:57,270
send me all of your policies than it is to try to figure out what's going on.

627
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:00,100
So we get security questionnaires all the time

628
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:02,510
because technically speaking, when,

629
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,430
when a company or an organization becomes a CS A member,

630
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,390
we do have the pi I of the billing contact

631
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,380
and for some of them, that's enough to trigger this like giant process

632
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,229
of filling out. I've literally filled out spreadsheets with 20 tabs

633
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,609
and

634
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,739
yeah, it drives us nuts.

635
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,640
-- But we're like, we've tried teaching them and it's, this
-- is why the cake is so good.

636
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,800
There have been a ton of vendors that were like, here's my 7000 page questionnaire

637
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,800
and

638
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:35,650
I remember one time II, I was like, oh, I don't want to do this and I go to it.

639
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,780
And the first question was like, do you have a cake?

640
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,170
I

641
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,760
click upload

642
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,400
and then it grayed out every other question. It was like, thank you. I'm like, what?

643
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,660
It was so good. It was so amazing.

644
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:48,750
No, that makes me happy to hear because, well, obviously that, you know, like,

645
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,439
-- I think the cake has value and is
-- useful.

646
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,770
I love it. It's a great document anyway. All right. All right.

647
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,800
I think we've, we've kind of run ourselves out of time,

648
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,530
I guess

649
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,760
in closing,

650
00:27:56,939 --> 00:28:01,739
this was a much less terror inducing topic than I was worried about when,

651
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,869
when Kurt tries to do this to me, I usually give him a hard, no.

652
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,869
But for some reason, my better judgment failed me today. But I think it worked out.

653
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,420
I think security dot Txt is cool. If you don't have one, it's a good idea.

654
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,819
But I get it if you don't like, it's, it's one of those things. So,

655
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,119
and I guess at the end of the day it's really about just be

656
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,170
nice to security researchers because they're usually

657
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,979
cool people and they get crap out

658
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,479
of them.

659
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:23,459
That's true.

660
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:26,989
-- There are some who aren't cool people but,
-- well, and it's, it's not that so much.

661
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,010
It's just, I get the bake bounty because money, like,

662
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,599
people got to pay the rent.

663
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,930
And actually, you know, it's weird.

664
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:36,839
I just realized we haven't had one come through in about six months,

665
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,520
-- but a bug bounty reporter
-- thing.

666
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:38,689
A big

667
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,209
bounty.

668
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,550
Yeah. I, I haven't had one either.

669
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,380
Now that you say that, I wonder, I wonder if something

670
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:43,119
did they,

671
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,109
was it just a small group of people doing it? And then they gave up because we

672
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,410
just kept telling them, no, I don't know.

673
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,295
Or maybe they, maybe Bug bounties official.

674
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:52,275
Bug bounties may become lucrative enough that it's

675
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:54,334
not worth trying to beg bounty yet.

676
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:58,305
-- But anyway, anyway, we say beg bounty. What we mean is people would send
-- you,

677
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:00,555
-- your SPF is not minus
-- all. Yeah.

678
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:04,025
Like, they'd send you these ridiculous things to emails, usually to legal a

679
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:05,114
or something like that.

680
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:07,474
And then they'd also beg for money at the end.

681
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:11,635
What they'd say is, I believe this bug report has value.

682
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:16,354
You should too, blah, blah, blah. Right. And I'd be like, uh huh. But our policy is no.

683
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,709
And my other favorite is when they'd be, like,

684
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:21,219
I found a very serious vulnerability in your website.

685
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:23,349
You should pay me and I'll tell you what it is. Like,

686
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:24,400
I don't think you did.

687
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:25,119
But

688
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:29,219
anyway. All right, I'm gonna call this one. This is fun. Thank you, Kurt.

689
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:34,390
I'm, I can, I can calm down now now that I, I know what the topic was.

690
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:37,750
Thank you, Kurt. Thank you, everyone for listening. Go to, ok, before I end this.

691
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,339
Actually,

692
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,510
I just need to comment, Kurt is wearing a Waldo shirt

693
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,949
and, and I haven't made any jokes about it yet.

694
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:47,050
So I found you, Kurt. I see you right there.

695
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,760
No one else can but Kurt is wearing a Waldo shirt. I have a Waldo hat.

696
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,609
Maybe I should 10 to 2.

697
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,530
Anyway. All right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you, everyone for listening.
