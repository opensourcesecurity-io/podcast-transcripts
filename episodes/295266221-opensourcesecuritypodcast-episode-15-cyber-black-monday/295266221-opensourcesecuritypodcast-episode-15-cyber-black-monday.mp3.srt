Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,920
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,770
Am I supposed to talk or?

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,229
Hey, I'm Josh.

4
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:21,270
Oh, you were gesturing at me? Yes, of course. I saw that through my

5
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,719
speakers

6
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,739
but I guess Happy Cyber Monday. Kurt.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,670
Yeah. Yeah, I, I cheated and did all my shopping on Friday

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,919
on Black Friday.

9
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:34,180
Cyber Monday.

10
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,729
But you live in Canada. So, do you have Black Friday?

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, we do. Yeah, we celebrate Black Friday and Cyber Monday

12
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:43,090
after the fake Thanksgiving, right?

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:43,779
Yeah.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,259
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:49,080
That's not last week. Too close to Christmas, man. It's just crazy.

16
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:50,549
So.

17
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:55,619
-- Well, so I think we kind of have a special Black Monday episode.
-- Cyber

18
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,270
Monday.

19
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:57,369
You could call it black.

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,349
I think

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,599
by the time we're done with it, I think Black Monday will be appropriate.

22
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:04,330
That's my childhood coming out.

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,819
Uh So, yeah, so it's Cyber Monday,

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,970
which means we're all supposed to be shopping online.

25
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,379
-- Um, more than we usually do
-- I

26
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:13,959
think. You mean

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,809
we're all supposed to be having our identities and credit

28
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,260
cards stolen online as we purchase crap we don't need.

29
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:21,949
Yeah. Yeah.

30
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:22,629
So

31
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,010
what, what I love about this is if you Google it, there's like

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,849
a ton of sites ranging from like what you

33
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,849
would expect like uh say trend Micro or Tom's guide

34
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:36,730
ranging all the way to like NBC

35
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,019
uh talking about

36
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,900
uh safety tips for cyber Monday.

37
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,220
Uh specifically, I guess with shopping online,

38
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,300
-- I would
-- expect everyone to want to get in

39
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:49,360
on this just because security is super exciting now.

40
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,419
And so Lord forbid you miss out on, on a hip exciting story. Right.

41
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:55,339
Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,360
And uh, so anyways, so we've got,

43
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:02,849
well, basically here's my thought, I'm gonna read you. What I think are some of the,

44
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,709
I, I think that they're well meaning security tips.

45
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,619
But what really gets me is, I mean,

46
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,160
I in general a security tip, either you use it or you don't,

47
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,559
it's not just one day of the year.

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,759
Right. Right.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,869
And, and well, ok, so I'm gonna take issue with the concept of security tips,

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,320
but that won't stop us from, I, I assume

51
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,899
going through reasonable and not terrible advice, but here's the deal is

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,169
you shouldn't need security tips

53
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,529
to stay safe

54
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,539
and let's face it.

55
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,610
Two people aren't going to follow this stuff

56
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:40,570
because they either don't care or they're gonna forget

57
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,089
or, or whatever. Right. There's a million reasons.

58
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,240
And so

59
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:48,190
telling people like if you do these things, you'll be more safe than if you don't, is,

60
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,529
is madness.

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,649
It, we have to make this stuff. So you don't need tips

62
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,869
to not let yourself on fire. Right.

63
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,940
Well, I think one of the challenges, not all these tips are technical in nature.

64
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,589
Right. Some of them are sort of more processed.

65
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,009
Like what, what this kind of reminds me of is, and this is a terrible thing.

66
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,470
Uh,

67
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,830
in the last two months here in Edmonton we've had

68
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:11,259
two pedestrians run over by city buses in marked crosswalks.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,580
Uh, and in one case, the bus driver didn't know he ran over somebody and he kept going.

70
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,380
I'm

71
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,539
not,

72
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,429
it's terrible.

73
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,399
And I mean, you know, here I am, I'm,

74
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,839
I'm at the stage right now where I'm teaching my kids like how to cross the road

75
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,080
and,

76
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,320
you know, normally it's like, look left, look right, like, or a four way, look like,

77
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,020
look behind and in front, like, look all the ways

78
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,639
and then proceed when it's safe.

79
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:35,320
But now, you know, there's, I,

80
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,000
it's kind of like those Halloween candy scare stories.

81
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,639
It's like, but,

82
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,580
you know, buses might run over you.

83
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:43,429
Well, no, apparently this actually does happen and it's happened,

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,199
like I said twice in the last two months.

85
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:50,229
Apparently these buses have a bit of a blind spot or something in the front of the bus,

86
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,789
which is

87
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,800
like,

88
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,389
I don't understand.

89
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,770
Yeah, exactly. So,

90
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:56,250
you know, I'm having to,

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,059
I'm having to teach my kids to cross the road the way I cross it, which, you know,

92
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,710
having lived in Europe is, look all the ways.

93
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,389
Take a step, look all the ways, you know,

94
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:07,389
you look all the ways all the time or you get run over.

95
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,509
Right. Right.

96
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,580
-- You know, but North America people don't do that.
-- So,

97
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:14,529
so my, my joke actually is, is before you go on,

98
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,100
I, I always say that I look both ways before I cross the street

99
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,339
in London

100
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:20,220
and Boston

101
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,019
and especially in one way streets

102
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,809
for, for very different reasons. Right.

103
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,290
Because London, obviously they drive on the wrong side of the road

104
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:28,730
and in Boston

105
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,730
everyone drives like crazy people.

106
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,940
Yeah.

107
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,209
Yeah.

108
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,570
So I think the reality is like,

109
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:37,890
either you do these things kind of all the time and then hopefully, you know,

110
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,209
because what, what,

111
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,049
what I really wonder about is how many people almost got run over by a city bus.

112
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:46,089
But we're paying attention enough that they, you know, dodged at the last second.

113
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,130
Right.

114
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,869
You know, because I,

115
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,630
I can't imagine these two incidences are the only ones that have happened, like,

116
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,760
or would have happened this year.

117
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:55,760
-- But anyways, so,
-- so let me, is the city doing something about this?

118
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:59,600
Have they decided they're gonna somehow make the buses safer or they just be like,

119
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,440
whatever,

120
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:04,989
it's, it's a bit of a outcry because the first, uh, you know, the most recent one was,

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,720
I believe it was a 13 year old girl

122
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,850
and, you know, obviously people are a bit annoyed about this.

123
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:13,869
Um There's talk of this blind spot on the buses in the front

124
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,220
which even if there's a blind spot on the front of the bus,

125
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,429
like, as a driver, my understanding is like,

126
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,829
it's literally your job not to run over people, right?

127
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,559
Like, I'm pretty sure that's in the job description or a part of the driving test,

128
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:26,959
you know,

129
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:29,790
don't run over people like literally.

130
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,600
So I, I don't know what's gonna happen, but obviously, you know,

131
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:35,850
I mean, it's a statistical aberration, right? Because

132
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
this doesn't hopefully happen that often. But,

133
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:42,579
you know, two in two months is obviously people are a little bit, you know,

134
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,459
concerned.

135
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,010
That's terrible.

136
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:48,250
Yeah. So, and that's kind of what these tips remind me of, right?

137
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,980
Is like, well, if these are good security tips,

138
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:52,869
then shouldn't you do that all the time and not just Cyber Monday?

139
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,250
All right. Let, let's hear a man.

140
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,679
II I can't wait.

141
00:05:59,399 --> 00:05:59,899
So

142
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,720
now we should say for the enjoyment of the audience that I, I have no prior knowledge

143
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:10,399
of these, what I assume are fabulous security tips.

144
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,510
So I, I, I'm very excited. I can't wait to hear what you have to say.

145
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,029
All right. So, uh well, let's go with this one.

146
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,869
Buy apps only from legitimate stores like Apple Store and Google Play.

147
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:25,230
Ok.

148
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,779
I can you buy

149
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,079
some

150
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,489
on your phone?

151
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,589
I know that's what I was thinking. It's like,

152
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,299
unless you've jail broken your phone, in which case you're, you're obviously

153
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:35,399
there.

154
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,019
Android

155
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,779
stuff. Actually, you can side load apps fairly easily. So, I guess you could

156
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,750
conceivably

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,579
trick someone into doing that. But you're still,

158
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,390
man,

159
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,429
-- I would
-- like, I know from my Mac,

160
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,299
I buy stuff directly from vendors that don't sell through the Apple store.

161
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:53,350
Like, for example, um,

162
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,119
uh, the firewall, little snitch. Right. Great product.

163
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,299
And as far as I know it's not in the store,

164
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,529
right?

165
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,660
Yeah. Could they be talking about?

166
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,480
I don't want that.

167
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:06,470
What else you got?

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,480
This doesn't make sense.

169
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,130
Don't buy

170
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:12,679
from somewhere else.

171
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:18,290
Don't buy apps from a guy like on the street, I guess, you know, a guy, I just,

172
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:21,320
I have this mental image of him opening up a trench coat full of like, you know,

173
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:22,420
QR codes

174
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:24,200
lining the inside, right?

175
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,959
Uh So here's a great one. This is my all time favorite.

176
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,690
Uh Don't use free public Wi

177
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,920
Fi to do your shopping.

178
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:35,450
Oh, man, I'm always torn over free public Wi Fi. It's,

179
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,140
you can tell people not to use it all you want, but like, like

180
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,529
let's face it, man.

181
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,730
Everyone does it. I bet you do it right.

182
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,440
So my I one of my I SPS Shaw, the cable company, they also run this thing called Shaw

183
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:50,320
Xo or Shaw

184
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:50,760
Open.

185
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:54,619
So basically, you know, if you buy a cable modem from them with Wi Fi capabilities,

186
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,380
boom, you're part of the, if you're a business.

187
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,850
You're part of their public hotspot monstrosity, right. Which,

188
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,130
you know, so, like, 95% of the time I don't even realize I'm using

189
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,589
whatever wifi because, like, my phone just

190
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,089
logs into it automatically. Right?

191
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,690
Because I've told it to, like, you know,

192
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,720
it's like every time I walk into a Starbucks anywhere on the planet, it's like, oh,

193
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,529
I'm on Wi Fi,

194
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,209
you know.

195
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,640
-- Um, so you join once and
-- then? No, no, here's a question though. Ok, so

196
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,589
we love to demonize public wi Fi.

197
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:22,279
But

198
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,980
does anyone have any statistics on how often this stuff actually gets hijacked?

199
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:29,459
And your data is stolen off of it? I mean,

200
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,549
I, I, if I'm just gonna guess,

201
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,549
I bet it's not that often.

202
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,260
Well,

203
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,599
you need physical proximity or you need to

204
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:38,320
have hacked the access point in which case,

205
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,000
like you're gonna hack an entire is P's worth of access points

206
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,380
and just hijack

207
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,880
you could, you could hijack one shop,

208
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,630
right? It's not out of the question. But I think

209
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,590
when you think about how many, there's got to be literally millions,

210
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,260
probably tens of millions of access points

211
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:56,450
in, say just North America,

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,619
I'd be more concerned about situations where you're at somewhere,

213
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,880
like say a Starbucks and you join, there's like two Starbucks wifi.

214
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,059
I mean, because the thing is you can,

215
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,969
you can spoof the SS ID and you can spoof the Mac address and everything.

216
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:11,419
So if I just walk around spoofing that I'm a Starbucks coffee shop,

217
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:12,520
wi fi access point,

218
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,500
like 95% of all the phones and tablets within

219
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,520
range of me are gonna automatically join me,

220
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,780
right? Because they have in the past

221
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,599
um

222
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:24,909
So on this, I ascribe personally, I ascribe to the whole sort of

223
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,960
uh what is that Google project called again?

224
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,000
Uh I wanna say New Horizons or Google,

225
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,049
the thing where they're basically, they,

226
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:33,900
they no longer believe in a network perimeter.

227
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:34,929
Everything is like

228
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,770
untrusted essentially,

229
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:37,969
you know.

230
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,809
And so the idea is, for example, like,

231
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,789
I don't,

232
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,890
I don't really actually go to any websites

233
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,369
anymore that are not http s encrypted because,

234
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,549
you know, it's just not a good idea, especially if I'm gonna spend money there.

235
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,760
But, but you can say that,

236
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,200
but I guarantee you if, if, say my parents

237
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,229
open up a laptop

238
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:02,020
and it brings them to the Google login page, they're just going to log in,

239
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,690
right? Regardless, they're not going to look at the URL.

240
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:06,109
Yeah, I,

241
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,929
well, the thing is there's no way to manage this properly, right?

242
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,289
Like my phone just automatically flips on to Starbucks wifi or onto

243
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:16,729
the shaw or on to, you know, it was funny actually when I was on my last trip

244
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:19,469
because I've been through some of these airports before

245
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,030
my phone just automatically

246
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,809
joined.

247
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,020
Yeah.

248
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,190
You know, like in Chicago and in DC and in, um,

249
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,200
Toronto,

250
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:31,270
it just automatically, you know, jumped on the Wi Fi because, hey, I know this one

251
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,510
so

252
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,510
-- well,
-- but you can even say that

253
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:38,219
the cellular networks aren't necessarily trustworthy because I,

254
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:41,070
I read a report I remember at, at Black Hat.

255
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,520
Was it Black Hat? No, Defcon.

256
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,950
At defcon. The number of three G towers like doubled,

257
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,489
-- which is clearly not because they added more capacity.
-- Right.

258
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:53,309
Yeah. No.

259
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,159
So, so for our listeners that aren't aware,

260
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,989
there's a couple of different cell standards

261
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,789
and so there's a couple of different cell standards and the um

262
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,789
sort of the one of the more popular ones is three G.

263
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,309
It was a former, you know,

264
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:06,789
global standard still is a standard obviously.

265
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,869
Um but the encryption used for it is incredibly weak by current standards.

266
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,799
So as an attacker,

267
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,719
um if you, if you want to spoof

268
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,059
a tower and be able to, you know,

269
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,380
monkey with the encryption three G is a great way to go because

270
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,580
you can basically do it in real time on a modern laptop.

271
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:25,489
So, yeah, I,

272
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:30,200
I don't know, I mean, personally this is why I do the majority of my shopping online

273
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,809
at home.

274
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,780
-- Right? It's just one less thing to worry about.
-- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,090
But you and I are probably not normal,

276
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,150
but I guess,

277
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,619
well, so

278
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:42,309
you know what else though? So here's, here's the other half of that though.

279
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,590
So let's say

280
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,070
I go to Starbucks

281
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,119
and I connect to a mini

282
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,669
malicious access point

283
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,270
and I buy things

284
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,109
and my credit card gets stolen.

285
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,049
I just get your credit card.

286
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,010
Right. I mean, let's

287
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:54,229
face it.

288
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:59,090
There's limited damage that happens here now. Yes.

289
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:02,919
If you're doing your, your online banking and your bank account gets, you know,

290
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:03,650
robbed.

291
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:04,919
Ok, that's bad.

292
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,849
But

293
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:06,650
it,

294
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,380
you know, I,

295
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:07,619
I'm

296
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,309
gonna

297
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:08,619
give

298
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:08,820
my

299
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,359
own cyber

300
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:09,659
tip

301
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,460
your

302
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:10,789
own.

303
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:12,849
Now, I haven't read it yet,

304
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:16,419
but this is, you should probably shop at sites

305
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,440
that you've already shopped at and have.

306
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,140
And this is the funny part

307
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,859
that store your personal data because

308
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,380
my one thought would be, you know, I don't care if my credit card gets stolen,

309
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,539
I can get a new number in like five minutes.

310
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:28,750
Right?

311
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,650
You phone the company, you say my credit card was hacked or stolen and they're like,

312
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,549
yeah, it's canceled.

313
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,070
Here's a new one

314
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:33,549
before

315
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:33,760
you

316
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:34,229
do.

317
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,580
Exactly.

318
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,429
But you can't change your personal info, like your name and address,

319
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,919
like without moving and filling out a lot of paperwork.

320
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:41,179
Right.

321
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,219
So my thinking is like, for example, if I shop at Amazon,

322
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:47,280
Amazon will never prompt me to enter my name

323
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,500
or shipping address or anything because I already have

324
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,780
and, and they've, I've told them to remember it.

325
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,770
That's actually fantastic advice. And it may be the only piece of usable advice

326
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,090
that we're going to talk about today.

327
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,330
So,

328
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,340
-- congrats
-- preregister with the vendors you want to do business with.

329
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:04,450
You don't have to.

330
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,960
That's true because I always, I guess I always view it as just

331
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,659
ease,

332
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:13,369
but it, it really does add a certain level of safety because I'm never actually

333
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,049
physically typing in

334
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:16,890
any personal information

335
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,549
-- when
-- I use

336
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:17,900
a

337
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:18,770
lot of

338
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:19,419
entered

339
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:21,450
about once every,

340
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:23,599
essentially whenever I move,

341
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,729
I have to re enter my, my address and my billing address and that's it.

342
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:31,690
And then whenever my credit card rolls over, I, I put into my new credit card number.

343
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,219
So about every two years, maybe three years at Amazon, I,

344
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,599
I enter some information but apart from that, I don't.

345
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,380
So if they asked me for info, I would be a little suspicious.

346
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,080
I'd give anything for one year.

347
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,539
Although I'm,

348
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,869
I'm going on like probably four months without

349
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,820
having my credit card stolen at this point.

350
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,200
So

351
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,969
I consider that a success.

352
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,299
That's awesome.

353
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,179
Uh So here's a, here's my uh favorite one

354
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:02,340
-- only shop on sites which start with HTTP S in the address bar.
-- That's good advice.

355
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,039
-- This
-- means they're secure.

356
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,729
That's bad advice. So,

357
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,900
yeah, see, and this is one of those terms where like for you and me,

358
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:12,979
the word secure has a lot of meaning and for the average person,

359
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:16,020
you know, it's, it's like whatever, right? And

360
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,880
so to me it's fundamentally you shouldn't shop at a

361
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,000
place that does not use HTTP S because it's free now

362
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,739
right to get it.

363
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,640
Yeah.

364
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,159
Well,

365
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:29,059
or cloud flare.com and they'll even serve your content

366
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,119
for you and make it faster for free.

367
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:32,080
Um

368
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,190
And let's encrypt is uh for those of you who

369
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,799
don't know let's encrypt is uh Electronic Frontier foundation.

370
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,080
So the eff nice people,

371
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,229
uh they basically decided that the whole

372
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,440
certificate authority hierarchy and the way that they

373
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,200
uh the amount of money they charge for these things is a bit obscene and,

374
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,710
and it sometimes is a bit obscene.

375
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,109
So they basically got a

376
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,059
certificate that is trusted by your web browser, be it Chrome Firefox Safari,

377
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,440
whatever

378
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,510
and they issue what are called domain validated certificates.

379
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,219
So this basically means that all they validate is the domain name

380
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,739
that the person is asking for for the certificate,

381
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,210
which dirty little secret is like 99.8 or 9% of all

382
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,770
the certificates currently in existence anyways, right? Very few people have

383
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,460
what's called extended validation.

384
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:19,679
So if you go to like paypal, you know, you get that giant Green Bar saying,

385
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,299
but this is paypal as opposed to just the name is correct.

386
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:23,760
So in my mind, if,

387
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,000
if an online shop can't be bothered to even implement free security,

388
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,440
that takes about 15 minutes,

389
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,729
you really don't want to shop there.

390
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,469
Are there, man, I don't think I've even seen a

391
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,099
dodgy website that doesn't have HTTP S

392
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:39,979
you know why?

393
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,539
Because especially with online shopping, they're all consolidated now, right?

394
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,919
They're all like Etsy or ebay or um like I

395
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:51,099
buy stuff on amazon.com all the time from who knows?

396
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:54,219
Like, I don't know who it is because it's like third party reseller or whatever.

397
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:54,739
It's cheap.

398
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,809
II, I,

399
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:02,070
I, a couple of years ago will say, purchase some dodgy video game equipment.

400
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:03,859
Ok. We'll just leave it at that

401
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,010
and,

402
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,859
and I bought a prepaid credit card to do this because I

403
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:10,909
wasn't typing in a real credit card number into the site.

404
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,940
But they still had hetps man.

405
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,219
And, and the stuff did, it did get it delivered for what it's worth.

406
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:18,429
So I wasn't, I wasn't stolen from at least.

407
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:20,549
Yeah. Well, that's the thing too.

408
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,200
I mean, the Attackers are going to do HTTP S because,

409
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:26,080
uh, I don't know if you saw recently but I, um,

410
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:29,070
people, you know, like, for example, like ebay.com.

411
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,900
Well, what about like Ebay, like ebey.com? How many people wouldn't notice that?

412
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,940
That's not ebay.com, you know, or,

413
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:37,140
or some of those, uh,

414
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,809
unicode characters where you've got like those funky GS that look like normal GS,

415
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,140
you know, they are not

416
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,299
the normal G.

417
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,830
Um, but I mean, again,

418
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,619
that would take more of a targeted attack or some spectacularly poor typing

419
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:52,200
for you to end up there. So again, I wouldn't worry too much about that.

420
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:54,049
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair.

421
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:58,429
So, to me it's more like I won't eat at a restaurant that doesn't have bathrooms,

422
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,989
like a sit down restaurant that doesn't have bathrooms.

423
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:04,118
Does such a thing exist.

424
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,140
Yeah, there's a Mexican place with really good food here.

425
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,560
So they're an exception to the rule,

426
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,479
but they do not have a public washroom, which is technically not 100% legal.

427
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:14,160
But

428
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,189
in general, like, especially when I'm in larger cities, you know,

429
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,800
to me it's a, it's a signaling indicator if they like part of it is,

430
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,979
I want to know that they have a bathroom and that they're like, you know,

431
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:27,160
because most i most jurisdictions require, if you serve food

432
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:30,009
and drink, you have to have a bathroom available. Right.

433
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:30,649
Sure.

434
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,689
But also it's like, because I like to see the bathroom,

435
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,329
you know,

436
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,780
um, great example I walked into, uh, there's a bar near my house from the outside.

437
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,449
It looks beyond terrible.

438
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,780
You walk inside and it's like, oh, ok, it's clean,

439
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:45,930
you walk into the bathrooms, they're spotless and they smell nice

440
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,890
and it turns out the food there is awesome.

441
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,250
And, and

442
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,290
what is the point of this story again?

443
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,250
Well, so basically it's,

444
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,489
it's one of those things where I want to know in advance whether or not,

445
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,530
you know, they're good or bad guys, like, are they keeping it clean?

446
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,550
Are they taking care?

447
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,130
Right.

448
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,099
And, and that to me is what HTTP S is, is if you can't even be bothered to do that,

449
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:07,609
then you're probably not keeping your bathroom clean and you're probably not,

450
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,150
you're probably keeping my credit card information on like a you know,

451
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,689
a text file on a public web server or something.

452
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:13,890
So,

453
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:19,010
I mean, like I said, though, I, I haven't seen a shop in forever that didn't have

454
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,800
HTTP S so let's,

455
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,589
let's move on to the second part of that though is the

456
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,359
thing, right? People doing the like fire sheep

457
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,189
style.

458
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:28,810
That

459
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,430
actually completely correct. Right. Absolutely.

460
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:34,199
Is if your man in the middle, someone could be stripping

461
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,660
the, the HTTP S off, you know,

462
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,640
essentially removing the TLS and serving you up things in plain text.

463
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,310
So,

464
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,260
so that, that's fair. That's fair. But let's talk about

465
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,180
the it's secure part

466
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,979
because I think a lot of people do kind of have that feeling of look,

467
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,209
it shows the lock everything's fine

468
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:54,939
when in reality

469
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,099
everything is not fine.

470
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,430
Perfect example, right? You go to my domain

471
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,290
cree.org

472
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:05,829
and it's HTTP S totally encrypted, secure great configuration, right?

473
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,819
Well, except that's the Cloud flare edge servers,

474
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:14,489
right? And from cloud flare to my servers, it's uh i it's encrypted, but

475
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,709
I think I have some of the lax settings on for some reason I should probably update it.

476
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:18,969
But,

477
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,260
you know, you don't know that that connection to the back end is secure and, you know,

478
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,920
especially with more and more traffic being

479
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,780
served through places like cloud flare.

480
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,089
I mean, it looks secure but is it,

481
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,660
who knows? That's a

482
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:29,959
good

483
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:30,219
point.

484
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,930
I guarantee you that.

485
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:35,459
Well, I mean, let me put it this way cloud flare offers a variety of options.

486
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,310
You can have uh like really strict ssl between cloud flare and your servers.

487
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,609
Like the certificates have to be all correct up to date

488
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,060
completely legit

489
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,689
all the way to. It's

490
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:48,969
like just old, plain old http with no encryption at all.

491
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,969
Right. Because

492
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:51,969
you know, some people can't offer that. Right.

493
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,280
So just because you're seeing http

494
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,530
all that means is that you're, you're definitely getting encryption

495
00:19:57,939 --> 00:19:59,209
to their edge server.

496
00:19:59,219 --> 00:19:59,390
Now,

497
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,569
whether or not their edge server is actually

498
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,939
like the server serving the content or is it

499
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,209
a service or is it like a load balancer? Like who knows?

500
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,729
Right. Right.

501
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,170
Right. So

502
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,130
to me, I

503
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:16,260
would say basically boils down to if you see HTTP run away,

504
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,939
it's definitely not secure.

505
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,410
But if you see htps, it may or may not be.

506
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:26,140
But even Google is starting to rank HTTP S search results higher than http.

507
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,020
So I think it's fair to say like

508
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:32,020
the, the death of HTTP is, is certainly

509
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,729
on the horizon.

510
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:36,520
I also wonder how much of that was prior to

511
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,119
certificates being free through places like Lutz and Crypt.

512
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,530
Because

513
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,619
one of the things uh that I've consistently seen with the bad guys,

514
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:45,239
they don't want to spend money

515
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,099
on things that they don't have to, right? Like

516
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,079
uh domain names, you know the back,

517
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,829
I don't know if you remember way back like 20 years ago,

518
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:55,199
you could actually get domain names for free.

519
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,640
Right. And of course, that led to a ton of abuse. So they started charging money,

520
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:02,910
but they had this idea of, and this is the, one of the,

521
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:06,459
as it turns out most stupid things ever uh for like

522
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,099
unanticipated effects

523
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,280
they had what was called domain test

524
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,949
tasting. Do you remember that?

525
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,349
Oh, that's where you could register a domain for free for like a day or something,

526
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,640
right.

527
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,530
Was it? No, you get a refund or

528
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,530
-- you basically,
-- I think it was about three or four days.

529
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,410
You could use the domain before you either had to pay or give it back.

530
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:31,000
And that's exactly what Attackers wanted was like, I want domains that are,

531
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,640
I only need them for like two or 34 days

532
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:37,130
and, and you know what they did to really cut down on that and make it

533
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,160
like, just to basically get rid of the problem,

534
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,260
they charge 25 cents,

535
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,380
right? And that's enough

536
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,819
to, to largely make the problem go away.

537
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,810
Now, now, I, I think though there, there's two sides to that is,

538
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,989
there's the people don't want to spend money angle,

539
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,569
but there's also

540
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,030
when bad guys spend money,

541
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,670
it leaves a trail.

542
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,030
Even if it's stolen credit cards or prepaid credit cards or whatever,

543
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,589
you're still leaving a trail behind. If you're doing something with that Bitcoin

544
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,239
anymore.

545
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:14,339
Not with Bitcoin. That's true. That's true. That

546
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,989
is being accepted at more.

547
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:18,270
Bitcoin has

548
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:21,750
a certain amount of traceability to the. Like, for example,

549
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:22,709
there's uh

550
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:25,729
there's the San Francisco. No, no, no.

551
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:29,189
But here, here's the point is so, you know, the San Francisco Municipal,

552
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:31,869
uh whatever it is had the ransomware attack and

553
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,550
they, they were supposed to send $73,000 in Bitcoin to a certain address.

554
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,339
And so some clever people were just watching the address

555
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:40,849
to see if it had been paid yet and,

556
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,339
and last I checked it had not

557
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,209
so like Bitcoin, I won't say it's anonymous.

558
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:48,520
It's better than a credit card, but there's still certainly

559
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:52,670
a certain amount of traceability. And so I think any time you're talking about money

560
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:54,010
there is,

561
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,109
it's never gonna be totally anonymous.

562
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,420
Well, maybe the cash, but we won't get into that today.

563
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:02,219
Bitcoin is not technically totally anonymous, but it's very close.

564
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:04,969
If you look at some of the Bitcoin washing sites where they,

565
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,939
they do what's called tumbling the Bitcoin.

566
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:10,310
So they basically break the Bitcoins up, break onto lots of loans.

567
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,390
Exactly.

568
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,630
Like,

569
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,020
so they basically take all these different transactions from all

570
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,170
these different people and basically put them through a blender

571
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,319
and then the stuff comes out and you have no idea, you know where it went basically,

572
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,250
although in theory,

573
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,010
you could track it down if you were sufficiently sophisticated.

574
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,170
Um,

575
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,040
yeah,

576
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,369
and, but at the same time, I suspect the people

577
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,170
the criminals are trying to avoid

578
00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:34,439
are sufficiently sophisticated.

579
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,530
One would hope

580
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,479
-- so.
-- Anyway,

581
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,560
here's,

582
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,239
you know what I gotta say, this is actually a decent tip pay by credit card.

583
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:48,589
You'll have less liability in the event. Something goes wrong than with debit.

584
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:50,959
Absolutely. I, I know a ton of people

585
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:52,439
that have come to me and been like,

586
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,810
someone stole my debit card and I lost all my money and

587
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,459
the bank said it'll take a month to get it back.

588
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,770
And I'm like, yeah, you use your credit card, you know, they

589
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,719
just don't use your debit card.

590
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,949
I guess. Maybe these people don't have credit cards,

591
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,229
although you can get prepaid credit cards.

592
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:11,869
I don't know any, everyone I know who's had this happen to them,

593
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:15,689
they were just using their debit card for whatever reason and they had

594
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:19,790
credit cards and now they use them exclusively after they had their incident.

595
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,349
So

596
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,849
there's,

597
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:24,699
I mean, whatever, why someone who was doing this,

598
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,739
I suspect it's just they opened their wallet and they picked out which

599
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,829
thing was in front

600
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,670
and

601
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:32,420
what? Right. And, and that's just kind of how it was.

602
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:33,209
So, I,

603
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,670
it good advice. I don't think anyone can complain about that.

604
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:39,079
Well, I'm also wondering like, yeah, I guess, yeah,

605
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:42,319
I forget now that my debit card does have that long string of numbers on the front.

606
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,569
-- That is technically a credit card number format. So I guess it is a
-- credit card.

607
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,520
Yeah, I mean, basically,

608
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:48,530
ok,

609
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,489
I've actually never used it as such because that just strikes

610
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,209
me as a really terrible idea because that's not my money is

611
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,670
and here's what I love because it's sort of true, but it's such a pain.

612
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,439
Nobody will do it.

613
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:58,959
Uh,

614
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,229
sorry to give a spoiler,

615
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:04,130
but keep an eye on your bank account to spot unusual transactions early on.

616
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:04,719
I

617
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:06,000
mean, that's

618
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:07,439
sure.

619
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:08,650
Yeah. But who's gonna do that?

620
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,369
I do.

621
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:10,969
Um,

622
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,020
I am meticulous.

623
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,010
I can tell you where every penny I've spent for like the last 20 years is gone.

624
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,380
I guess if you, if you're using something like mint or those other money sites,

625
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,300
that would be a lot simpler.

626
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:22,349
No,

627
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:23,550
man, I'm hardcore.

628
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,729
I use G new cash,

629
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:28,180
which is like the most ridiculous train wreck of accounting software.

630
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:29,099
But the things I've been

631
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,520
using

632
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:29,920
it.

633
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:30,709
Yeah. Yeah.

634
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:34,319
It's still taken care of and I've been using it for so long at this point that I'm just,

635
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,719
I'm so invested into learning this program that I'm totally unwilling to change.

636
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:42,729
Even though I know there are alternatives that are magnitudes better out there.

637
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:47,040
This is the sunk cost fallacy at work right here.

638
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,359
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

639
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:50,050
Yeah, I was gonna, well, but it's true,

640
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,089
especially with the accounting records and legal records.

641
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,510
Like, once they're in there getting them out,

642
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,290
I honestly, I've never even investigated how hard it would be.

643
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,050
But, but the point is I think

644
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:02,250
regardless of Black or not Black Friday,

645
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,900
Black Monday, uh regardless of Cyber Monday or online fraud or whatever

646
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:12,550
it is wise to understand your finances and to pay attention to them.

647
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:17,800
-- Right.
-- I mean, that's just that, that's like the, the human 101. Right.

648
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:19,949
Yeah.

649
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:23,930
Uh, sorry, I'm just trying to find one of the more hilarious bits of information.

650
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:24,180
Sorry.

651
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:28,439
There's, there's like, it's weird, there's so many of these lists and they're all,

652
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:30,479
like, five or 10 or 12

653
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,119
and there's like, very,

654
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:36,489
like, there's a lot of overlap, sort of, but not really, it's really quite bizarre.

655
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,630
But anyways, uh, I can't find it right now,

656
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,959
but basically the one piece of advice was saying, use the vendor apps

657
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,550
don't use the web browser because the vendor has more

658
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,000
control over the app and thus it's more secure.

659
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,099
Like, like, you mean the Amazon app or

660
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:52,859
do they?

661
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:54,160
Yeah,

662
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,109
like, so, yeah, like, say the Amazon app on your phone, which you can buy stuff,

663
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:02,579
which I'm assuming it's just like a little bit of stuff wrapped around a web browser.

664
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:05,310
Probably un unless you have AAA Tesla

665
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,689
app that keeps your authentication in plain text

666
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,310
on disk. Right.

667
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,520
Yeah,

668
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,160
-- it's that,
-- that, that could be good advice.

669
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,104
I, I guess, I don't know enough about a lot of these apps to say one way or the other.

670
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:19,755
Oh, here's the weird thing.

671
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,194
So they, ah,

672
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:22,405
here it is fine vendors have more control over

673
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,614
their own apps than they do over mobile browsers

674
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,515
which often don't display the web address of the

675
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:28,364
sites to which you're giving your credit card information.

676
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,025
Well,

677
00:27:29,435 --> 00:27:31,864
yeah, they do. They have like the address bar at the top.

678
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,255
And then, I mean, if you,

679
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:34,385
-- if you
-- use your phone

680
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:34,614
look at

681
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:34,925
the

682
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:36,035
form where it's going,

683
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:36,714
the

684
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:37,655
address

685
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:38,395
right

686
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:39,329
on my

687
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:39,569
phone,

688
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,270
you can see it but you have to

689
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,630
make, you have to do something to make it appear right.

690
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,670
-- Safari shows it all the time on
-- your

691
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,310
iphone

692
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,790
iphone. Yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at, I'm looking at it right now, like when you

693
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,469
select something. Yeah, I'm like just looking at it and

694
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,589
uh, when I scroll down the web page,

695
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,819
it kind of smooshes the address bar a bit but it still shows the address bar

696
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:05,410
and

697
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,349
an Android.

698
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,589
As soon as you kind of start scrolling around, the address bar disappears.

699
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:17,689
-- Oh, even if you, like, what happens if you pull the web page down,
-- then it comes back.

700
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,010
Oh, this is weird

701
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,000
when I go to my, my own personal website which is, you know, HTPS.

702
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,510
It shows the little lock but that's it for the icon.

703
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:29,989
I thought it would have showed it in green or something.

704
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,819
Um Oh, here's interesting.

705
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:35,729
It shows the address bar when my phone is like vertical but when I put my phone flat,

706
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:36,699
like to make it wider.

707
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,219
Uh, the address bar only shows if I like scroll the web page.

708
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:43,709
Like if I scroll all the way to the top and kind of do that pull down action.

709
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,020
Interesting.

710
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,739
So, ah, I never really paid attention to that before. Ok. So,

711
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,119
I think that's not the greatest advice, but at the same time

712
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,489
it's probably relatively harmless advice.

713
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,270
Assuming the app doesn't do something stupid.

714
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,969
Like, I don't know if you remember all those banking apps,

715
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,280
somebody looked into a few years ago

716
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,930
and found out, like, almost all of them were keeping your, like,

717
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:05,390
password in plain text,

718
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,890
which is just like the Tesla problem.

719
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,069
Yeah, exactly. So, you know,

720
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:17,449
oh, let's see. Let's, let's look for some Canadian tips. Oh, this is a great one.

721
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,750
Never send a check or cash in the mail.

722
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,819
See, I feel like that's not advice for Cyber Monday.

723
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:26,469
-- I feel like that's advice for life in general.
-- Human 101 advice

724
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,030
also. Isn't it illegal to mail cash?

725
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,780
I don't know if it's illegal. It's dumb.

726
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:34,599
Uh,

727
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:34,949
the

728
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:37,699
US postal service loses very little stuff.

729
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,780
They, they do. It's still dumb.

730
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,239
Well, no, no, here's the problem with, with cash though.

731
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,359
And, and I've actually been bitten by this in a handful of times where

732
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:49,560
my kids will have some event. They're in a club or a sport or whatever.

733
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:51,530
And they're like, yeah, we need, like, five bucks and I'll just be like,

734
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,300
here's five bucks.

735
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,459
Right.

736
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:55,170
And I give it to him then a week later, like, hey, they give me five bucks and I'm like,

737
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,599
dude, I handed you $5 last week.

738
00:29:57,719 --> 00:30:00,430
He said, well, I didn't, it's not written down. I'm like, oh crap.

739
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:02,000
-- And I just pay him again because it's
-- not

740
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,189
your video on your iphone or on your phone

741
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,869
-- or
-- just, like, find, like, send them money another way.

742
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,819
Even this is actually a place where checks are superior to cash

743
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,959
except for the minor.

744
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,319
Like, I can steal your money when I have a copy of your check thing.

745
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:14,880
Yeah.

746
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,410
And you have to pay like two bucks to cash a check.

747
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,959
Uh, not here. It's still pretty much free in the US.

748
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,170
Guess what? It would cost me to get 50 checks printed from my bank.

749
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,719
And I'm talking about the super generic checks with like

750
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:32,250
-- the cheapest checks I can get from my bank.
-- 50 checks.

751
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,719
Yeah, that's the smallest number they'll do.

752
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:37,550
-- I actually
-- need to order new checks and I order them in batches of 100

753
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,979
it cost me $13.

754
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,719
Oh, here my bank charges $53 for 50 checks.

755
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,040
Yeah, they really don't want you using checks

756
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,089
and I, I won't do. You can email money. You can text money in Canada now.

757
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:49,640
I

758
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,829
can

759
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,420
text you my worst thing ever. I, I hate checks.

760
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,619
They, they, I, I loathe them.

761
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:56,520
I refuse to use them

762
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:59,719
and like everybody I deal with now it's like, what's your email address?

763
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:02,530
Ok, I will email you the money and they're like what you can do that. I'm like, yeah,

764
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,699
so I find

765
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:04,329
people use

766
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:04,680
it,

767
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,160
have some sort of,

768
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,689
-- uh,
-- the,

769
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:06,839
uh,

770
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:10,640
the, uh, uh, well, technically it's branded through interact.

771
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,239
They're the people that do the debit cards

772
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,079
here in Canada.

773
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:15,464
-- So it's kind of like a visa type deal. But for debit
-- cards.

774
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:16,444
So,

775
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:17,704
interaction fee

776
00:31:17,854 --> 00:31:18,314
on that.

777
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:18,685
Uh,

778
00:31:18,814 --> 00:31:22,185
yeah, there is, but it's like a buck or a buck 50 which is basically

779
00:31:22,454 --> 00:31:25,515
about the same as a check, but it's way more convenient.

780
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:31,244
So, but cashing checks is free in the US. At least for the banks I, I use

781
00:31:32,074 --> 00:31:34,064
here. It varies. Some are free, some charge.

782
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:35,905
Most of them charge though now because like I said,

783
00:31:36,114 --> 00:31:38,875
they just really, they want to get away from paper. Right.

784
00:31:39,145 --> 00:31:39,155
Oh,

785
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:40,854
no, I get it. I totally get it.

786
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,550
Although what's crazy you can do now is,

787
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:44,890
so, I, I've, I,

788
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,589
I did this once and I've never done it since because it kind of freaks me out.

789
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:48,869
But

790
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,229
with the app on my phone,

791
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,310
I can take a picture of a check

792
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,550
and deposit it into my account

793
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,180
and the picture apparently is good enough.

794
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,079
Yes. Do you know why that is?

795
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:02,300
-- Because
-- interstate

796
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,180
banking laws?

797
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:08,229
No, it's because back in the day and I mean, by back in the day, five years ago,

798
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,969
tens of billions of dollars worth of checks were

799
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:12,949
flown across the US every day to clear them.

800
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,050
Right. Because you had those, all those banks that couldn't go beyond

801
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,760
like the state line, right?

802
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,040
Banks were restricted in the US to being within a single state.

803
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,319
Um So anyway, so in the US, you have like,

804
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:27,699
well back in the day you had like literally thousands of banks, right?

805
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:30,689
Which means if you write a check from a bank in Wisconsin to a bank in Hawaii,

806
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,719
they physically had to transport the check there before it would clear. Right.

807
00:32:33,939 --> 00:32:34,599
So,

808
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,170
you know,

809
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,359
checks in the US or I know us checks here

810
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,920
would take something like 30 business days to clear.

811
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:40,229
Right.

812
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,689
Yeah, here in Canada

813
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,449
because we only ever had like six major banks.

814
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:50,089
Now, it's like four, we had a centralized check clearing house for like ages, right?

815
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:53,050
So checks in Canada were always clearing within a few days. No big deal.

816
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:53,910
Um

817
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,260
And in the US, obviously, I mean,

818
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,989
that's a huge expense flying like having to physically move checks around to,

819
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,010
you know, to clear them.

820
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,530
So that's why they went to the picture thing because let's face it. Right.

821
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,130
Check fraud by and large

822
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,369
is not a huge problem anymore.

823
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,750
Like I don't remember if you ever saw Catch Me If You Can, you know the Frank F

824
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,550
nail story.

825
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:11,500
Yeah.

826
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:14,030
And if you want to learn about check fraud, that is a great

827
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,859
movie for learning about check fraud.

828
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,979
Although none of that stuff works anymore because of, you know, computers,

829
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:19,699
right?

830
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:22,390
Uh Let's see. Here's

831
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:22,560
a,

832
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:25,199
well, and here's one that I just find kind of annoying. It's like,

833
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,770
basically almost every site has this one and it's ensure your

834
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,030
system has the most recent recommended system and security patches.

835
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,150
And in my mind, either you, you're either updating on a regular basis or you're not.

836
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,810
And if you're not, you're,

837
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:40,510
-- you're basically up the creek
-- if you own a modern computer.

838
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,310
Is this something you can even

839
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:46,780
do anymore? I mean, because Macs Auto update now. Right. Windows, I think

840
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,349
still disable it if you're really, you know, wanting to.

841
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:50,270
But

842
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,030
by and large they want to update by default,

843
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,589
this stuff all updates itself magically.

844
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,329
You know, what's

845
00:33:56,699 --> 00:34:01,150
really got me is, uh, in the second or third last iphone update,

846
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:04,469
they added a thing basically saying automatically update if your phone is

847
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:07,060
plugged in like between the hours of like midnight and five.

848
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,239
Nice. So, just overnight. And I'm like, that's exactly what I want,

849
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,978
you know, just because I'm not, I'm not using my phone.

850
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,418
I don't have to worry about losing any data. Right.

851
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,590
Because all the apps are happy about being turned off and on,

852
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,739
you know, my desktop computer annoys me to no end because I keep getting, you know,

853
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,270
oh, I wanna update and I'm like, no, no, no, I, I'm working on a file.

854
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,050
Don't, don't bug me right now. Stop. No, don't reboot, you know.

855
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,050
Oh, man, that's,

856
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:31,168
I have a, I have a Windows computer for the kids

857
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,120
and, and every time, like, they do something ridiculous.

858
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:38,290
Like kids, they break stuff and I don't know what they do but they, like dad,

859
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,040
the computer is broke again and I'm like, I don't even know what you did,

860
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,889
but then I managed to reboot it and I know

861
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:46,478
every time the thing reboots the windows is like,

862
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,668
please wait, Windows is applying updates and they're like, what's going on?

863
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,850
This is weird. I'm like, yeah, go find something else to do. Be here a while.

864
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:58,770
That's actually the reason I disabled automatic updates on my Apple TV is because

865
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,810
I would turn it on and it would be like updating and I'm like,

866
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,610
-- no, I wanna watch something now update at
-- like 2 a.m.

867
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,979
I know, but it's not that hard.

868
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,449
Yeah. Oh,

869
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,189
this is silly. Monitor your credit through a third party for identity theft.

870
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,000
Didnt

871
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:16,790
Symantec just buy Lifelock

872
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:20,629
$2.3 billion.

873
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,659
Didn't that guy

874
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,580
have his, the CEO, didn't he have his identity stolen something like 13 times?

875
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,719
It's been a lot,

876
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:30,209
but he did put it on the side of a truck that I was driving around the country,

877
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:32,310
-- but
-- that's like literally their whole stick.

878
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,760
You know,

879
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,989
you don't have to worry about this.

880
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,090
So I know they've been fined by the FCC a couple times.

881
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:43,179
I, I honestly don't entirely know. However, I will say regardless of whether

882
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,330
you think the Identity Protection Services work or not

883
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,260
any time there's any sort of incident at an organization.

884
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,879
What is the default response? One year of free credit monitoring? Right.

885
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:00,300
So, like that, that's a, it's a money tree right now because, you know,

886
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,820
as more and more companies get hacked,

887
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,300
what's gonna be the solution? One year of free credit monitoring?

888
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,310
Dialing it up

889
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:12,600
in a previous episode we talked about was it, it was a chiropractic,

890
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,070
a chiropractor or whatever it's called clinic member that got hacked and like,

891
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,179
and they basically said,

892
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:20,379
like it was too expensive to offer credit reporting to people.

893
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:21,419
So like, too bad.

894
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:22,639
Yeah.

895
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:23,159
Yeah.

896
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,110
You know,

897
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:28,560
and I guess that's ok. Now, like, that's just how that works.

898
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,199
I,

899
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't know about that. I, I suspect that's gonna end up in court

900
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:34,959
but

901
00:36:36,229 --> 00:36:36,770
it's

902
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:38,860
anyway. Anyway. Uh,

903
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,110
-- right. Let's not get into this rat hole. Let's go over to
-- Britain for a moment.

904
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,979
The Merit Summit.

905
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:49,169
-- Let's go to
-- Britain for a minute. Britain apparently does Black Monday too.

906
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,370
-- Um,
-- we keep calling it Black Monday.

907
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:54,479
This is a good one.

908
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:59,139
Don't trust whatsapp messages offering

909
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,820
cash even if they're from your friends.

910
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,949
Ok. This week action fraud warned consumers of a new whatsapp.

911
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,169
How do I pronounce that by the whatsapp?

912
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,219
Like, what, whats

913
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:11,830
app?

914
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:12,479
I think it's

915
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:12,860
supposed to be like,

916
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,129
what

917
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,489
like was

918
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:15,729
it?

919
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,750
Ok.

920
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,409
Um

921
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,810
Anyways users have reported receiving messages

922
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,290
offering Topshop and Sainsbury gift cards.

923
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,120
Uh, so I know Sainsbury's is like a grocery store. I'm assuming Topshop is like

924
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,310
a shop of some sort

925
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,389
with

926
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:29,610
top end gear.

927
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,340
Um,

928
00:37:30,725 --> 00:37:35,084
well, not a top hat shop but anyways, uh that appeared to be sent from a phone contact.

929
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:36,705
The link takes you through to an

930
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,235
official looking site which requests personal details.

931
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:39,784
Of course,

932
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:43,034
action frauds and clicking on the link would also allow the fraudsters to collect

933
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:44,504
personal information from your device that could

934
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:46,225
track you delete messages like these,

935
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:48,564
even if they look like uh they've come from someone

936
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:50,465
you trust and install security software on your device.

937
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:51,905
Stupid question.

938
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:56,024
So I know there's antivirus for phones, but does anybody actually use that stuff?

939
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:57,540
You know, I,

940
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:00,239
I've never met anybody with it. I don't use it.

941
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,570
-- I mean, I
-- don't know, I remember I looked at some of it once a long time ago

942
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,659
and I was incredibly unimpressed by it.

943
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,080
Well, and so here's the other half of that problem though is

944
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:16,229
by definition, these apps can't really interact with each other.

945
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,929
And so there's not a lot they can do.

946
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:20,879
And the only way to let them interact with

947
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:23,000
each other means you give it elevated privileges,

948
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,449
which means you've now kind of ruined your phone security

949
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,610
by giving one app magic.

950
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,219
Well, and especially an antivirus app like um so for our listeners,

951
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:36,159
um there's a guy named Tavis Ormandy who works for Google works for their project,

952
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,010
which is their sort of security one of their security groups

953
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:41,679
and uh a

954
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,969
few months ago and continuing, he's been looking at antivirus songs.

955
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:47,159
He's been looking for a long time and, and,

956
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,969
well, not only that. All right.

957
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,979
So Tavis is super freaking smart and like,

958
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:55,030
I think once the vendors find out he's looking at their stuff.

959
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,550
II, I can only imagine they,

960
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
they buy a bunch of whiskey and just start rocking

961
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,860
in the corner because he's gonna tear it up.

962
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,429
-- And that's just,
-- well, my favorite was,

963
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:05,149
did you see his tweet from this weekend or last week where

964
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:10,125
a vendor took a, a safe function uh called STRN copy.

965
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:12,445
So it basically copies a string of data

966
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:16,564
and like, make sure it isn't like way too long or some other insane value

967
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:19,854
and they replaced it with the unsafe version STR copy,

968
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:21,685
which just does whatever it's told to do.

969
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:22,645
Um

970
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,280
because it's faster,

971
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,110
it speeds up the scanning time.

972
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:27,699
You know what the thing is though?

973
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:30,350
I mean, you're talking about a difference of probably

974
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,949
if I had to guess,

975
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:35,590
maybe 10 instructions at this point because we have this stuff pretty optimized.

976
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:41,010
What are they doing? That? Saving 10 instructions makes a difference.

977
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:45,310
I know in my workstation there's over a million files and I like have no, like,

978
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,389
I assume maybe it's time machine backups.

979
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,429
I don't know, but there's like apparently over a million files on my workstation.

980
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,169
And so scanning this thing with an antivirus scanner. Now takes forever. Right.

981
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:57,909
Because just going and opening every single bloody file, even if it takes like,

982
00:39:57,919 --> 00:40:00,909
only a millisecond, that's still a lot of milliseconds.

983
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,979
And maybe, I don't know, still d

984
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,229
don't, don't do that.

985
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,689
Kids don't use, drink

986
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,110
coffee.

987
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:09,100
Oh, and here I think is our final

988
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,179
tip.

989
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,020
Uh, and it's an oldie, but a goldie. And it's terrible, in my opinion,

990
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:18,969
use a unique password and log on information for every site you visit.

991
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,310
Ok. Ok.

992
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,129
That is correct

993
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:26,750
because your password should be coming from a password safe

994
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:31,550
and not written on a sticky notes stuck at the front of your

995
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,530
sticky notes taped to your monitor at home, I think are not that bad of an idea

996
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:36,209
because there's

997
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,530
-- somebody
-- break

998
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:36,949
into your

999
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:37,350
house. I

1000
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,060
-- mean,
-- they're better than

1001
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,580
using the same password everywhere,

1002
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,199
but the correct solution is to use a password manager.

1003
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,340
However, however,

1004
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:51,739
now we're back to that problem of how do we get normal people to

1005
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,989
basically a adopt a behavior they don't understand or know about

1006
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:57,949
nor will be able to find out about

1007
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,750
yet. The solution is

1008
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,909
phenomenal to this problem.

1009
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,139
You know, part of me wonders and hopes

1010
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:10,570
maybe the next PC I so uh payment card industry security standard,

1011
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,020
maybe the next one could require something like

1012
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,159
either using either proper two factor authentication.

1013
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:19,560
And by that, I don't mean like two separate passwords because that's just silly.

1014
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,689
Uh So requiring either proper two factor authentication.

1015
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:24,100
So, like an app on your phone,

1016
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,729
um or requiring you to use like a secure login through another website, like,

1017
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,379
say Google or Twitter or Facebook.

1018
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,389
Because quite frankly, that's one thing I love is when a site is like,

1019
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,639
you can log in via Google.

1020
00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:35,169
I'm like,

1021
00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:39,070
-- great. That's one less account I have to go create.
-- I totally agree. In fact,

1022
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,949
I found myself recently

1023
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,719
where if I go to a site and it wants me to create an account for something,

1024
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:47,760
if it doesn't have a Google log in, I'm like, uh I don't really care

1025
00:41:47,889 --> 00:41:50,750
and then I move on to something else or I look at an alternative

1026
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,020
that might happen and then I'll use that instead even if it's worse.

1027
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,639
Just so I don't have to add another thing to my password safe,

1028
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,399
which is currently enormous.

1029
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:02,699
Well, here's a question. When you talk about a password safe.

1030
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:05,159
Are you talking about a stand alone application

1031
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,159
or

1032
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:08,570
for example, something built into your web browser?

1033
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,290
Because for example,

1034
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,479
I use the safe password feature on my web browser all the time because like

1035
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:17,120
-- I at last count have over 1000 accounts.
-- Does it generate random passwords for you?

1036
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,639
Uh No, but I just mashed the keyboard.

1037
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:21,459
So

1038
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:23,570
what happens if you have to enter it twice?

1039
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:26,719
Uh I mash it into notepad and then cut and paste.

1040
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:30,909
Um Although uh on my phone, it does auto generate safari on the phone.

1041
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:33,270
Is smart enough now to generate a password.

1042
00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:34,699
So I just maybe

1043
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,790
you know what it is.

1044
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,010
I use chrome on my Mac, not safari.

1045
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,929
So I bet safari on the Mac does it like the password generation?

1046
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,689
So I actually use uh I, I run Linux

1047
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,850
as my desktop which you have to be kind of a special,

1048
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,300
sort of crazy to do that to begin with just because it's,

1049
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:53,919
yeah, it's, I, I still iii I don't value my time,

1050
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:54,689
but

1051
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,100
actually, it's not too bad these days.

1052
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,729
But anyway, I, I found this,

1053
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:01,929
this safe called PW Safe that I've been using for a long time.

1054
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:04,590
And the thing I love the most about it is

1055
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:09,030
that when I go to paste the passwords,

1056
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,010
it opens a connection to the X clipboard

1057
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:17,229
and it tells me which app got the password and it only pays it once

1058
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:19,909
because I know like some apps will just put the password in the clipboard,

1059
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:22,750
which means anything that, that, that can listen to the clipboard

1060
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:23,899
will steal it

1061
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,070
and like, literally everything could do that.

1062
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,870
But with PW safe,

1063
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,070
it only gives it to one thing

1064
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:31,830
and it tells me what took it.

1065
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,310
And so that pleases me greatly. But at the same time, I also, I found a bunch of bugs.

1066
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,939
One time there was, uh,

1067
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:39,590
like a VNC viewer or something and the VNC viewer

1068
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,260
was just like eating everything put into the clipboard.

1069
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,429
And that annoyed me So I,

1070
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:46,219
I found a new VNC viewer obviously because there's no reason for that.

1071
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:46,909
But

1072
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:50,659
that's why I think two factor authentication is the long term.

1073
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:54,899
I, I think basically how do I securely use a password? Is the wrong question?

1074
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:58,459
I think the correct question is how do we get rid of reliance on passwords?

1075
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,120
Totally, man. Passwords are dumb.

1076
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,169
It's what we got

1077
00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:04,360
it. It is what we have.

1078
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,879
Although I will admit that I don't know if you've

1079
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:09,159
ever looked at the U two F tokens that exist.

1080
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:10,760
Now, they are very cool.

1081
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,850
I've been meaning to buy one because now chrome supports it.

1082
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:16,149
-- Uh
-- If you get a AUBK

1083
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:17,689
four,

1084
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:20,719
it comes with U two F as one of the

1085
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:23,639
countless options that are built into the little device.

1086
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,250
So you can buy like the U two F standalones, which I, I actually, I have a, an older UI

1087
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:29,899
key

1088
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,080
and a U two F key. So I have two and I have a UB key four in my desk drawer

1089
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,860
that I'm just quite frankly too lazy to set up.

1090
00:44:37,169 --> 00:44:40,350
But when I do that, I will have one instead of two.

1091
00:44:40,479 --> 00:44:41,449
But the beauty of U two

1092
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,820
F is, it's basically kind of like an RS a key on board.

1093
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,979
And

1094
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,699
when you go to a website, because one of my complaints with using two factor

1095
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:54,020
off on my phone in the app is I have like 400 sites

1096
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:56,649
in my Google Authenticator app.

1097
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,850
And I've got to figure out which site it is and, and then type in the little key code,

1098
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,030
right?

1099
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,750
But with U two F, it's 11 token

1100
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,020
and it works with like all the sites just

1101
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,310
because it kind of does some challenge response with,

1102
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,989
with uh public key encryption,

1103
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,870
which is super cool,

1104
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,800
aren't they using like o

1105
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:13,899
author or

1106
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,310
something like that?

1107
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:16,320
Something

1108
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:16,679
like that?

1109
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:18,570
No, no, no, those are, those are kind of different.

1110
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,219
This is, I don't know what the protocol is called necessarily, but it,

1111
00:45:22,229 --> 00:45:23,669
it's essentially like RS A, right?

1112
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,030
We're like

1113
00:45:24,419 --> 00:45:26,560
you hand out the public key and you keep the

1114
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:26,780
public,

1115
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:27,679
right?

1116
00:45:27,689 --> 00:45:30,580
I mean, that's basically what's going on where I ha I, I tell the website,

1117
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,520
here's my public key.

1118
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,840
I keep my private key, everyone's happy

1119
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:37,860
and then I can give every website the, the pub public key obviously.

1120
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,000
And everything's cool

1121
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,689
and it's a little more complicated than that. But

1122
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,439
how does this work? Say on a phone where you can't plug a USB thing in?

1123
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:47,560
Yeah, that's uh that's one of the problems is,

1124
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:50,659
could I ask you questions, Kurt?

1125
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,699
The idea, I guess is to have some sort of Bluetooth functionality eventually.

1126
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,780
But for the moment,

1127
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,570
-- I'm just nervous
-- about turning Bluetooth on in public spaces

1128
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:02,899
and you should be,

1129
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,290
but

1130
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,000
it's

1131
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,659
also not a topic we will discuss today on, on Black Cyber Monday.

1132
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,729
So, yeah, I think that about summarizes sort of the main groups of tips.

1133
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:15,340
Um,

1134
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:16,739
you know, one thing I'm curious,

1135
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:21,350
what does anybody out there have any other tips that they think are useful or not?

1136
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,530
Completely insane?

1137
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,969
No. No, they don't.

1138
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,280
Well, you know, ok, so, so here's the thing

1139
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,780
that kills me with all these tips

1140
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:32,570
is

1141
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,439
we are security people.

1142
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:36,260
We've been doing this for a long time and we

1143
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,179
read this stuff and we laugh at it because we,

1144
00:46:38,189 --> 00:46:41,000
we know it's ridiculous and we know it doesn't work for whatever reason

1145
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,439
or we can pick it apart and find all these problems with it.

1146
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:43,719
But

1147
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:48,719
let's say we had to make up a list of five things for people to do

1148
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:51,620
to stay secure, let's say all year long.

1149
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:52,969
And

1150
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,159
I guarantee you, we could spend a week building a list

1151
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,310
and as soon as we showed it to one other security person,

1152
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:01,699
they would tear it apart.

1153
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:03,020
Right.

1154
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:06,840
Because this is one of the problems I see is the

1155
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:10,399
fact that there isn't universal agreement on what's good or bad.

1156
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,360
But I think more importantly is just,

1157
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,590
you can't expect people

1158
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:16,320
to change their behavior.

1159
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:18,629
We have to change the things they interact

1160
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,229
with to do what's right versus expecting people

1161
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,459
to do what's right because people will always pick the lazy way out every time.

1162
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,790
It's not even a lazy way out. It's like, quite often. I don't

1163
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,949
know,

1164
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,310
like what is the secure behavior? Right.

1165
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,870
And I know instinctively based on the physical world, kind of what I would do,

1166
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:40,229
like lock the door or look both ways before I cross the street.

1167
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:40,550
But,

1168
00:47:41,189 --> 00:47:43,679
you know, for example, uh,

1169
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,290
you know, when I go to buy something online,

1170
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,250
is it good that they store my information or bad?

1171
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,750
You know, and I, I choose to believe and hope that large sites like,

1172
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,949
say Amazon are doing it securely

1173
00:47:56,149 --> 00:47:57,040
-- because if they're not, I'm up
-- the

1174
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:57,350
creek.

1175
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,989
Let's face it. Google and Amazon and Facebook know more about you than you do.

1176
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:02,750
So

1177
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,580
I think giving them your address is fine.

1178
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:08,300
Well, I mean, more, I'm concerned from the point of view of like, you know,

1179
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,100
they get hacked and all that data gets leaked and I have to deal with

1180
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:11,800
it. I'm

1181
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:11,979
not

1182
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:12,129
so

1183
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,370
worried

1184
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,310
about the tax

1185
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,580
of Amazon and Facebook and Google is,

1186
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,179
there's nowhere to store all the data if someone

1187
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,790
wants to steal it because there's too much.

1188
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:25,500
So, I don't know.

1189
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,090
I mean, I, I generally this is one of the reasons I, you know,

1190
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,489
keep my shopping down to a few major sites is to, yeah, is to reduce that risk.

1191
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:33,739
Uh, and you know,

1192
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,520
and where possible I use paypal because then

1193
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,979
they don't even get my credit card number.

1194
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,050
Although I have no idea what the charge back process is like with paypal.

1195
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,320
I've never done that. Thank God.

1196
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,639
-- I've
-- heard it's fairly,

1197
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,179
uh, pro buyer.

1198
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:48,949
No,

1199
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:52,189
when, when you have an issue. I've never, I've never had a problem,

1200
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,429
but I've read horror stories of sellers dealing with difficult buyers and

1201
00:48:57,689 --> 00:49:02,469
apparently like a buyer who's just, like, purposely a jerk can like ruin

1202
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,790
paypal for you.

1203
00:49:04,169 --> 00:49:07,620
Well, in fairness, I just did have the experience of buying a laptop on ebay,

1204
00:49:07,629 --> 00:49:10,889
paying through paypal and then 20 minutes later getting a refund because, you know,

1205
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:12,949
the, the product is supposedly not available.

1206
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:13,699
Why,

1207
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,659
-- what
-- exactly they said the product's either damaged or not available.

1208
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:19,590
So you don't get to have it.

1209
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:23,129
Uh What I suspect is is because my bid and

1210
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:24,189
in general,

1211
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:28,469
the bidding on this product were about $50 lower than comparable auctions.

1212
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:32,570
And so I think they just want more money. So they're just gonna relist

1213
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,919
it in a week or two and

1214
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:35,350
-- isn't
-- that fraud?

1215
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:36,810
Well, there's,

1216
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,449
-- here's
-- the,

1217
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,639
there's no way to report it.

1218
00:49:39,649 --> 00:49:41,659
I was digging through the messages in the web interface

1219
00:49:41,669 --> 00:49:43,919
and there's like no way to leave seller feedback,

1220
00:49:44,229 --> 00:49:46,800
right? Because I wanted to leave feedback saying these guys are jerks.

1221
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,879
So if they don't sell it to you, you don't get to leave feedback.

1222
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:50,620
No.

1223
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,540
Well, here's the thing.

1224
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:55,780
Technically, in my opinion, they sold it to me because they took my money,

1225
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:56,610
right?

1226
00:49:57,189 --> 00:49:58,870
And then they gave it back, which is nice of them

1227
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:01,300
that all of the money back or was there?

1228
00:50:01,429 --> 00:50:01,550
Like

1229
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:02,179
it was a

1230
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:02,379
full

1231
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:02,590
refund?

1232
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,540
Uh Wait, actually, I got to double check that now that you mentioned it.

1233
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,030
Uh It looked like it was about the right. It was only about 100 and $80 Canadian.

1234
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,820
So it wasn't too much like it was, I think

1235
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:13,649
the one came,

1236
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:16,989
it was a used Lenovo think pad that I want to get for the kids, for

1237
00:50:17,129 --> 00:50:17,610
Minecraft

1238
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:18,300
Minecraft

1239
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,419
-- laptop for the kids.
-- Yeah.

1240
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,639
Yeah, because you know, mods, it's a thing.

1241
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,110
Diamond Mine Cart, man. Diamond Mine Cart.

1242
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,199
It's a guy on youtube. Apparently my kids watch him a lot.

1243
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,939
Um But yeah, so I mean

1244
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,239
that to me, it was like I've never seen, I've never had this happen before, right?

1245
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,780
And that to me is a really interesting way to hack the whole ebay process because

1246
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,129
yeah, if you take them, like, if you somehow cancel the sale or something,

1247
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,189
my understanding is that, that kind of, you know, that gets logged and stuff.

1248
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:46,120
But if I take your money and then refund it

1249
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:48,760
fully and give a supposedly good reason for that,

1250
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,520
then apparently you get away scot free because like I said,

1251
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,340
I cannot leave feedback to these guys

1252
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,100
saying that, you know, I'm pretty sure they're

1253
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:57,850
not happy because the laptop didn't sell for enough money.

1254
00:50:58,449 --> 00:51:01,429
Uh And now that I know this, you know, I'm kind of tempted to like,

1255
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:05,080
use this, you know, instead of setting a reserve price, you just do this trick.

1256
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,860
Wow, that's crazy, man.

1257
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,429
Now that you've said that on a on a public podcast, you

1258
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:10,580
uh

1259
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:12,590
-- you can't do that
-- well.

1260
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,510
And hopefully other people don't too because I'm guessing ebay has this

1261
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,629
data and they must be able to look at these people and,

1262
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:21,949
you know, to, to run the numbers and see, like, look, you know, these guys,

1263
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:24,010
when the bids are a couple bucks lower or whatever.

1264
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,429
Do they

1265
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:28,290
-- do this? You know shenanigans? They
-- might do, they care.

1266
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,820
I don't know. I mean, it's crazy.

1267
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,909
This was a high volume seller with like over 30,000 sales.

1268
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:35,679
So like

1269
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:38,820
ebay is probably gonna let them do whatever they want,

1270
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,300
you know, with the amount of money they bring in.

1271
00:51:42,149 --> 00:51:42,929
Crazy man.

1272
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,870
So, well, you know, that's the thing, right? You have a marketplace.

1273
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:47,090
People are going to try and game it.

1274
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,520
That that's like

1275
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,810
the history of the world, right?

1276
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,149
Pretty much.

1277
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,389
-- Oh
-- man.

1278
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:54,439
All right, Kurt.

1279
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,830
I think it's uh it's time to put this uh Cyber Black Monday to bed.

1280
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,899
Yeah. So I guess the moral of the story is

1281
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,229
don't use public wi fi

1282
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:10,419
just don't, don't do anything right? Like living life is dangerous.

1283
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,820
That's the moral of the story.

1284
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,229
-- Stay in your house and cover the windows in tin foil.
-- That's right.

1285
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,600
Just drink and rock in the car quietly.

1286
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:20,510
All right.

1287
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,689
Well,

1288
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:22,810
you have a good night and everybody else stay

1289
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,649
safe and hope you had a good Cyber Monday.

1290
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:27,659
-- It's
-- been fun. Thanks everybody until next time. Bye bye.

1291
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:28,860
Bye.
