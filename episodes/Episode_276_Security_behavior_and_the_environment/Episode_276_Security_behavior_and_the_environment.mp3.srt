00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:02,440
I feel bad for the archaeologist who like,

1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:07,329
listens to all the raw audio to try and suss out what the hell happened in 2020

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,380
that's staying in.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,879
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

4
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:22,559
Curtsy Fried and my partner in breakfast, Josh Bresser.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,040
All right. I, I don't even want to figure this out. I will start with

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,549
vaguely related to breakfast.

7
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:34,610
There was a solar eclipse this morning where I live. It was not where you live.

8
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,799
I actually looked so I could tell you if it was, but it wasn't.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,909
And I got up at five o'clock in the morning to look at an eclipse

10
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,099
and it was totally worth it. It was only partial, but it was still awesome.

11
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:45,090
Well, I still,

12
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:46,709
to this day remember seeing Haley's comet

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,540
through a reasonably good telescope at the,

14
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,090
at the science museum when I was a kid.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,509
I remember when I was a child

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,869
it was like pizza hut or, or mcdonald's or somewhere like that,

17
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:02,049
sold a little like cardboard telescope you got

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,239
in their like kids' value meal or whatever.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,980
-- They was
-- happy meal. The meals were happy.

20
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:10,050
Well, the meals were happy only at mcdonald's everywhere else.

21
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,209
It's just, you know, contempt and neglect.

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,839
But

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,250
yeah, it was like a little telescope to look at Haley's Comet. In hindsight.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,040
I wish I'd kept it because I'm sure that would be a fascinating

25
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,470
piece of, you know, just history. But

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,559
yeah, it was, that was, man, I was young. That was a long time ago.

27
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,809
One thing I love is when people show those pictures of

28
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,919
the old mcdonald's Happy Meal toys from 2030 years ago.

29
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:35,010
-- And they are just so garbagey.
-- Some of, yeah, they were, they were bad.

30
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,569
I've got, for some reason,

31
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:42,089
I found some at my parents' house when I was cleaning something out about a year ago.

32
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:45,654
It's like some weird little Mario things and like they're just, they're garbage.

33
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:48,444
They're so bad. Although the toys today are terrible as well.

34
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:52,014
-- I won't say they're any
-- better. Kinder surprise eggs have terrible toys in them.

35
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,175
-- Now,
-- don't get me started on kinder surprise eggs.

36
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,925
They are literally illegal in the United States and you

37
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,875
have no idea how annoyed I am because of that.

38
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,834
But I mean, kinder surprise eggs are actually illegal for a very good reason,

39
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:06,294
which is, you can't have non food stuff in food, which

40
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:08,934
when they made that law, I think it was in the thirties in the U si.

41
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,014
Mean, that was a real problem. You know, we're,

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,220
I, I don't want to be eating food that has industrial shavings in it to, you know,

43
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,009
bulk and

44
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:18,059
-- to bulk it up or whatever.
-- I mean,

45
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,399
I understand the intent of the law

46
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,449
but it doesn't mean I can't be angry that I am

47
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,300
unable to enjoy a kinder surprise egg in the United States.

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,660
Well,

49
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,699
the other thing is that the quality of their chocolate has dropped drastically,

50
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,940
like my son won't even eat them anymore.

51
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,539
He kind of crushes them open and

52
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,500
looks disappointed and kind of looks at me and I'm like, sorry, bro,

53
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,570
I haven't had one in almost two years now because

54
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:47,990
it was, it was the last time I was in Canada. Every time I go to Canada, I have them

55
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:51,399
and I did not attempt to smuggle any out this time.

56
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,800
-- And I don't remember why that was, uh,
-- because it's a 2000 $500 fine.

57
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:56,479
Remember I looked it up because I was going to mail you some

58
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,509
-- and you're like, don't do that. And I'm like, why not? Yeah.
-- Right. Right.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,910
I definitely don't break that law all the time. Uh, but anyway, anyway,

60
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,050
what are, what are we talking about? Something about breakfast?

61
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,470
I don't totally understand this one.

62
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,520
-- So,
-- yeah, breakfast.

63
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:12,229
Well, it's, it's what's interesting to me is, is people really poo poo breakfast

64
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,339
and it is literally the start of the day. It's how you get going.

65
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,100
It's, you know, it's the,

66
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,539
for the rest of your day.

67
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,710
I mean, not necessarily like,

68
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,490
-- I don't eat breakfast a lot and who cares
-- when you're crouchy,

69
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,419
that's just normal.

70
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:26,820
Like, it doesn't matter if I eat breakfast or not.

71
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,149
Well,

72
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,830
and what I love though is they've done all these studies

73
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:33,619
that show essentially people's blood glucose levels are directly correlated to,

74
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,779
you know, decision making, both ability.

75
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,410
And for example, all those studies where they've, you know,

76
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,500
done with parole boards and judges and looked at, you know,

77
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,789
their decisions before and after lunchtime

78
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:46,929
and it consistently boils down to, you know, if you're having a parole hearing,

79
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,559
you better hope that it's right after the judges.

80
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,300
-- I mean,
-- is it because you eat though,

81
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:56,690
the story you sent me seems to focus on a break more so than necessarily consuming

82
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,160
-- some sort of energy.
-- Well, it's a combination of both, right?

83
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,669
It's, it's a combination of

84
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,320
either breaks or eating people

85
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,380
with low blood glucose can't think. Right.

86
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,880
I mean, Snickers, you know, you're, you're not you when you're hungry

87
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,500
so eat candy to fix it.

88
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:15,130
Well, as a short term solution.

89
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,019
-- Yeah,
-- I mean,

90
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,720
I can relate to this because I think there

91
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,225
are countless instances is where when I am hungry,

92
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:24,265
overly hungry,

93
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:28,355
it can be very difficult to concentrate. I will not argue with that point.

94
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:29,864
Well, so for example,

95
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,105
there was that thread on Twitter a week or two

96
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:34,184
ago talking about incident response and kind of how,

97
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:34,355
you know,

98
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:37,105
what kind of warnings or what would you tell companies about and I pointed out like,

99
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:38,880
well, when you're doing incident response,

100
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,869
are you planning to let your people take breaks and sleep and maybe

101
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,510
eat and exercise because these things can take more than a day?

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,029
No one ever does that. And people make terrible mistakes when they're tired.

103
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,549
Remember all the DHS Fusion Centers and stuff? They were building out a long time ago

104
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:57,190
and same in Canada, they were building out this, you know,

105
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,119
terrorism kind of management center.

106
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,459
And the press got a hold of it and ran with the story like, oh,

107
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,559
look at this opulent terrorism management center.

108
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,980
It has an exercise room and it's like, yeah,

109
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:09,049
because these people might be like living in this building for two weeks

110
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,529
while dealing with something. So

111
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,350
yeah,

112
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,649
-- like they need to shower, you know, they need to sleep.
-- This is something

113
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,329
I, I can totally relate to this. I mean,

114
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:25,410
there's, I think a lot of cultural push behind some of this.

115
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,299
I mean, one of my favorite examples is I remember back in the day

116
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,380
when I would work on Firefox and Mozilla at Red Hat,

117
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:40,269
I had built a little bot that would play a loud noise at my computer when

118
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,119
the build finished because the build took hours

119
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,880
and hours and hours to build these things

120
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,690
because it was very common that I would fall asleep at my desk

121
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,059
while trying to get things to rebuild because there would be the

122
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,079
developers would do what needed to be done to build a package.

123
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:56,850
And then often they were in Europe and I would take over

124
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:59,799
and I would basically stay up all night long till they showed back up.

125
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,600
And then I would go to sleep, which of course,

126
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:04,279
at like three in the morning I'm making awful decisions.

127
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,450
And I, I mean, I remember that but that was

128
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,149
kind of expected and no one thought that was weird.

129
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,170
And in hindsight, it's like this was ridiculous. It's a miracle.

130
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:14,029
We didn't completely break something.

131
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,369
I remember reading,

132
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,149
looking up some studies because I was working for

133
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,649
a company that wanted to essentially have 24 7 coverage

134
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:22,450
and was toying with the idea of essentially making us work

135
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,619
like swing shifts and day shifts and switching it around.

136
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,850
And I'm like, no, don't do that

137
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:27,869
because

138
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,230
you will mess with people's sleep patterns and

139
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,750
it just won't work.

140
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,989
And I found two fascinating studies. One was an Israeli study essentially.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,920
Once you've been awake for about three or four days,

142
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,790
it's the equivalent of being legally drunk,

143
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,920
like you can function and you can do sort of

144
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:45,250
mechanical things or things that you've been drilled on.

145
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,339
Yeah. If you want to get a creative decision or thought out of this person. No,

146
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,709
I'm skeptical. It even takes a couple of days of being awake. I would bet one day

147
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:58,559
if you don't sleep one night, I bet your decision making is completely impaired.

148
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,730
And then what was really fascinating is I found a study from the first Gulf War

149
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,440
where they had given the pilots, uh,

150
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,890
various medication that they could optionally use.

151
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,350
And what was interesting is the younger pilots tended to take the

152
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:17,390
stimulants before missions and the older pilots were tending to take the relaxant

153
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,989
after the mission so that they could get good sleep.

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,410
And so it's, it's interesting that, you know, these, these men,

155
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,269
because back then basically combat pilots were all men.

156
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,690
Uh, but the, the, the younger and the older ones had two very,

157
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,809
very different strategies that kind of fit with how

158
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,329
we think of young men and older men.

159
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:38,440
Right? Older men in theory are a little bit wiser and we value our sleep a bit more.

160
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,489
Well, no, no, I remember being young and, you know,

161
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,399
getting four hours of sleep and being like, oh, I'm gonna eat some bacon and eggs.

162
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,089
I'll be great.

163
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,880
And in hindsight I did,

164
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,010
I mean,

165
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,170
there was a lot of work I probably thought was good at the time.

166
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,049
But in hindsight,

167
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:56,130
if I had a nap probably would have taken half as long and been twice as good.

168
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,589
Oh,

169
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,730
without question. I remember those days. Well, it's,

170
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,940
-- I always think of the famous quote, youth is wasted on the young.
-- Yeah, absolutely.

171
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,450
And what that jerk did to my knees.

172
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,790
Seriously. What's up with that guy?

173
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:12,220
I, I understand this and I can also understand where it's coming from.

174
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,429
But I also think

175
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,079
there is,

176
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,450
I, I'm, I'm not saying either group is right or wrong.

177
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:22,730
I think it's easy to say, oh, the old people took the relaxing drugs.

178
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:23,769
They're much smarter

179
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,839
but it's, it's different. I mean, I know as, as being

180
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,489
an old, old person now will say

181
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,200
my mind isn't as quick or as sharp as it used to be.

182
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,979
I'm completely familiar with that and I will never say a,

183
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:40,448
that I possess some knowledge that no one else

184
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:42,698
does because of my age because you just,

185
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,679
you don't, I mean, I think it's,

186
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:45,809
it's just different.

187
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,838
-- Well, I think back in the olden days it was, it was simply survivor
-- bias.

188
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,799
-- Everything is survivor bias.
-- Yeah.

189
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,408
You know what? Yeah, I'll take that.

190
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,049
But what it, what it really gets me is because for example,

191
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,598
these recent ransomware incidents where,

192
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,409
you know,

193
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:01,229
they paid the ransomware but actually recovered the data faster than

194
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:04,489
they could with the ransomware keys being actually given to them.

195
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,570
Yeah, that was the pipeline, supposedly.

196
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,030
Well, from what I've read, I mean, part of this too is who freaking knows

197
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,219
because

198
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:14,479
in, in these sort of events

199
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:17,179
you get so much conflicting information,

200
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,539
it's very difficult to understand what's real and what's fake, you can hardly tell.

201
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:24,299
-- And I think well, or
-- misinterpreted or misread. Right.

202
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:24,500
And,

203
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,900
and I'm sure part of this is the people involved are extremely overworked and tired.

204
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,659
And they're doing their best,

205
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:36,270
but at times they might say the wrong thing or the wrong information might slip out.

206
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,880
You don't want out and then people start making crap up to

207
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,880
fill in the gaps and you end up with a mess.

208
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,900
What really frustrates me about this whole thing is there's

209
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,239
a ton of organizations that

210
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,840
constantly handle emergencies relatively gracefully.

211
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:48,090
What comes to mind is

212
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,919
the fire department, the police department and, you know, emergency health.

213
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,919
-- The
-- military is another good example

214
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,309
that the military doesn't handle

215
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,460
sort of day to day constant ongoing stuff at home.

216
00:09:58,469 --> 00:09:59,750
Like the fire department does.

217
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,080
No, but, but they're a better example,

218
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,190
I think in the context of security because security is,

219
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,150
you don't know what you're going to be like, I wake up in the morning and think,

220
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,820
what am I going to do today?

221
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,609
-- In most instances, you
-- might encounter a new type of problem,

222
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,890
but fundamentally you're going to triage vulnerabilities and see

223
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,010
if they need to get fixed or not.

224
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,369
I mean, to a degree, but this is, I think closer to military maybe than,

225
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,500
than police and fire.

226
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,909
And the point is all of these organizations heavily rely on training

227
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,390
because when you're scared or when you're tired

228
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,190
or when you don't exactly know what's going on

229
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,229
or when you don't have leadership barking the right thing at you at the right time,

230
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,030
you default back to your training

231
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:36,520
and it's one of those things.

232
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,059
That's really funny where I think about, like, I, my,

233
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,500
my neighbor is a firefighter and I'll talk to.

234
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,650
He'll, it was really wild.

235
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:43,520
He was showing me all, like,

236
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,390
their new systems for logging events and everything

237
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,549
and it's like you people have to,

238
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,390
like, log when you go pee.

239
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,200
It's amazing.

240
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:55,210
But anyway, the point is they train to death and the reason is because

241
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:57,619
they're going to be in a situation where they're not going to be able

242
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,909
to think and they just start doing whatever the training taught them to do.

243
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,030
And like in, in security and even in it to a degree,

244
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,229
-- we don't do anything like that
-- even worse.

245
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:10,270
We generally don't have any agreed upon doctrine or training.

246
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,130
We, and even places that do sort of have training or people who take certifications,

247
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,840
which is a form of training, there's no drills.

248
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,830
Right. Well, there's what the yearly tabletop exercise, right.

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,989
Which if you're lucky,

250
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,349
-- I've never seen one of those and I've worked at a couple of
-- big, we do them all the time.

251
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,710
They're, they're good, good fun. Actually, I have, I will put a link in the show

252
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:35,474
to, I, I ran a session at RS A some years back where I called it,

253
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:36,674
I think dungeons and data.

254
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:38,244
But it was basically like,

255
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:39,614
I ran a tabletop.

256
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,635
There were a lot of people in the room, I have a blog post about it, but it was,

257
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,335
it was all like dice and

258
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:46,474
it got really silly and it was super fun.

259
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:48,075
But, I mean, part of the problem I think with, like,

260
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:50,784
tabletop is they generally are extremely boring.

261
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:52,395
And so no one really cares.

262
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,320
It's well and carving out time. Right.

263
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,520
We could be doing some, you know, quote unquote actual useful work.

264
00:11:59,159 --> 00:11:59,859
Uh, ok.

265
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,059
I don't like that attitude and I think that's

266
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,349
something else that kind of falls in line.

267
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:07,059
Right. Right. Because you think like, oh, breakfast doesn't matter.

268
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,260
Oh, training doesn't matter.

269
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:10,099
Right. Right.

270
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:14,619
And I think, saying things like the tabletop exercise is a waste of time.

271
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,539
It, it might have been the way you did it, but it shouldn't be if it's done. Right.

272
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,650
And I mean, we've all been through training. That was a waste of our time.

273
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,270
I'm not going to, I'm not going to claim

274
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,539
that that all training is valuable. But the point is if you do this stuff, right. It

275
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,320
is not a waste of time.

276
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,640
I have been to training that I've walked out of thinking this is amazing.

277
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,489
And I've been to training that.

278
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
I walked up thinking I am never getting that part of my life back.

279
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,260
Well, speaking of training. So, because I remember we were just Kvetching. I,

280
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,010
so I finally sat down

281
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:47,780
and paid 88 Swiss Francs, which is like $98 for

282
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:48,400
ISO

283
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,090
IEC

284
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,679
3

285
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,719
111

286
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,630
which is one of their two sort of information security standards.

287
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:58,659
The other 129 to 147 which is now an old version of is freely available.

288
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:02,619
-- But basically
-- the 2014 version is free. The 2018 version is now.

289
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,409
-- So
-- the although although I want to interject one thing, it was just announced,

290
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,000
I think like two days before we're recording this, that Katie Miso

291
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,340
and I think Art Mannion convinced

292
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:13,744
is

293
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,885
so to make the 2018 version free.

294
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,104
-- So at some point that should
-- show, I was kind of wondering like, really

295
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:22,424
anyways, the point is the first one is security techniques,

296
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,984
vulnerability disclosure.

297
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:26,705
And the second one that I had to pay for is security techniques,

298
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:28,684
vulnerability handling processes.

299
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,955
And I'm thinking, you know, because I'm paying 100 bucks for this document,

300
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,440
you know, and I asked you, how long do you think it was? Right? And what did you say?

301
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,200
I thought it was a couple of 100 pages.

302
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,380
-- Yeah.
-- No, it's 13.

303
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:40,380
Vulnerability handling is really hard.

304
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,099
Well, but I mean, well, technically if you go high enough level on anything, it's,

305
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,200
you know, like when World War two there, I said it

306
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,119
and that,

307
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,460
that was my thinking. But yes, you said it's 15 pages long

308
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:52,979
or 13 pages long.

309
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,940
So you paid approximately what, like eight bucks a page.

310
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,239
But here's the reality is actually like

311
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,950
99% of the stuff you and I know cold, but we've been doing it for 20 years.

312
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,789
And honestly,

313
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,169
there's some stuff in here with how they portray it and how they say it out loud.

314
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:09,630
It's like,

315
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,140
oh, yeah, you really want to make sure you do that.

316
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,020
So even

317
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,940
I, I, I'm beginning to realize that,

318
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,760
you know, there, there's been training and documentation that I think, oh,

319
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,580
it's terrible because I already know some of it or I've already experienced it.

320
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,179
But that, that's kind of not who the training is for.

321
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,349
Right. The training is for the new people.

322
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,229
And that's, you know, we're constantly kvetching about how, oh, infosec, you know,

323
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,309
it has millions of job postings that we can't hire for and blah, blah, blah, why not?

324
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,799
It's like,

325
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,820
well, I mean, I, I suspect one of the big factors is because we don't train people and,

326
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,150
and bring them in and teach them how to do this. It's like some, I

327
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,570
mean, we have the classic, you know,

328
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,119
I want to hire an intern with 20 years experience,

329
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,190
you know, I, I've literally gotten jobs because, and I quote,

330
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,880
we don't have to train you, Kurt, you can just start working like on day one, you know,

331
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,039
and, well, that's not really sustainable or, or a long term solution

332
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,679
-- to having a pipeline for bringing people in.
-- Right. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

333
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,960
And so I, I think,

334
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:06,119
you know, with respect to breakfast, it speaks to that whole,

335
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,890
you got to feed people at the beginning of the day, you gotta,

336
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:10,650
you gotta make sure they're taken care of.

337
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,159
They're trained, they're, it's the whole thing.

338
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:14,739
Not just, oh,

339
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,729
we're gonna try and magically hire people who just step in and start working.

340
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:19,530
-- Right.
-- And

341
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,650
yes,

342
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,940
it, it, well, there's also, oh, man, there's so much,

343
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,229
there's so much to impact in this.

344
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:26,669
It's,

345
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,359
I, I do think the,

346
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:33,190
I guess sensibleness and quality of life is a huge aspect of this,

347
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,059
that people often they, they don't take it into account.

348
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,830
And I think it's just kind of human nature to be like here's a pile of money.

349
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,820
I'm going to work you to death. It's like there's so much wrong with that attitude.

350
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,599
I mean, this is one of the reasons I,

351
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:48,359
I chose a lifestyle a long time ago so that I could have time with my kids and

352
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,119
I absolutely

353
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,349
will not work myself to death anymore. Like I would have when I was in my twenties.

354
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,270
I, I remember those days.

355
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,960
I mean, I thought that it was the, the more you worked, the, the,

356
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:01,690
the more it would pay off and the more it would be

357
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,380
respected and, and right, I mean,

358
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:05,789
I, I'm not, look,

359
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:06,229
I,

360
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:11,429
look, your laugh is completely justified because in hindsight, like

361
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:13,924
it's all a waste of time. I got nothing for it.

362
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,405
I, I look at this whole,

363
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:18,924
every time it comes up on Twitter or on the Web or something where somebody's like,

364
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:21,864
oh, my God, there's all these open source projects that the world relies upon

365
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:23,424
and they make zero money.

366
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:24,364
I mean, that guy, he,

367
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:29,244
he did the can has IP which just echoes back like your public IP address super useful

368
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:30,059
and

369
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,169
you know, he's like, it serves like a billion requests a day on blah, blah, blah.

370
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:37,340
And in total, he got something like 70 odd dollars in donations.

371
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,909
I mean, so there's a couple sides to this topic and this is something,

372
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,190
maybe we could talk about more in depth at some point.

373
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,729
But, like,

374
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,770
there are people who do open source who would love to get paid to work on it.

375
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,570
There's people who do it and don't want to get paid because they,

376
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,890
they like doing it and it's a hobby and it's fun.

377
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,940
And, I mean, I, I'm, I'm gonna tell you now, there's always the people who are like,

378
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,820
oh, do what you love and you won't work a day in your life.

379
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,479
Like, no, that is a lie. That is a complete lie.

380
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,479
Once you get paid to do something,

381
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,479
it completely changes everything

382
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,319
and it's quite often that something that was fun for you

383
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:10,598
becomes not fun now that you're getting paid to do it

384
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,259
well, and I find usually with that stuff, it's not so much the actual activity, it's

385
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,009
all the stuff wrapped around it.

386
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:19,338
So I enjoy open source and I enjoy doing open source security,

387
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:22,938
but I don't think I'll ever kind of want to deal with the,

388
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:25,838
some of the process and some of the political stuff that I've had

389
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:28,529
to deal with in the past because that made it very not fun.

390
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,349
Of course. Right.

391
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,869
And, and to a degree that can just be any company you work at, like, obviously,

392
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,719
do you have to do that annual bribery training because you're American?

393
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,910
Yeah. Yeah, I still take that it's not as bad as it used to be way back in the day.

394
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,430
The stuff I take now is slightly more palatable. But, yeah. Yeah,

395
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,140
it was,

396
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,709
you need to be American and a publicly traded company

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,689
and then there's all these really boring,

398
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:52,989
horrible training things you need to take and

399
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,189
they're like the freaking same every year.

400
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,670
Well, it's, well, it's not like it changed.

401
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:01,040
Yeah.

402
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:04,420
You'd think you'd spice it up a little bit or something, you know. But,

403
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,609
or you just recycle the same content and charge for it.

404
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,689
Uh, that's probably what it is.

405
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,819
I guess my thought is companies should make sure that.

406
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:16,260
And I'm speaking more metaphorically than actually, you know,

407
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,969
ensuring your employees have breakfast.

408
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:18,380
Although,

409
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,619
like, I've,

410
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,770
I've worked at places where there's no food on site and we're

411
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,459
talking like hundreds of people on site and there's a vending machine.

412
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:28,390
That's terrible. You know what my standard is?

413
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,010
I will not work anywhere that doesn't have free coffee.

414
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:34,290
You know, I'll never forget the first job I had out of college.

415
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,560
It was a small company that was part of IBM.

416
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:41,089
And then the original owner bought it back from IBM after like a decade.

417
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,079
And

418
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,729
they'd,

419
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:45,339
they'd been their own company for like six months at

420
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:48,119
this point and they were obviously hiring some new folks.

421
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:48,810
And

422
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:52,270
I remember I was talking to, I think he was a vice president of,

423
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,449
of software development

424
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,589
and he's like,

425
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:56,530
and he wouldn't shut up about the free coffee.

426
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,619
And I'm like, why do you keep talking about free coffee?

427
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,520
He said they made us pay for coffee at IBM. I was like, what?

428
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,459
And he's like, yeah, seriously, you had to pay for coffee there.

429
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,780
And as soon as we became our own company, again,

430
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,060
the first thing we did was bought a bunch of coffee machines.

431
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,339
I remember at

432
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,459
the start of the pandemic,

433
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,030
Alberta Health Services apparently was making people bring their own Kleenex

434
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,699
and stuff in and it's kind of like what's next?

435
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:19,920
Like toilet paper?

436
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,849
No, seriously. Right.

437
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:25,119
Because at some point, the office just needs to supply stuff,

438
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,630
whether it's toilet paper or coffee or pencils or post it notes

439
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,949
and those are shockingly expensive, but I digress.

440
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,369
-- Um Well, ok,
-- look,

441
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,640
but I think part of that discussion and this can kind of fold into the,

442
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,400
the bigger it picture is

443
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,430
there are kind of certain basic needs you need as a human and if those aren't met,

444
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,520
you end up with that like hierarchy of needs kicking in.

445
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:52,469
And if you're worried about getting toilet paper and, and coffee

446
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,859
you're not worried about whatever the thing is,

447
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,920
they're actually paying you to worry about.

448
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,680
Right. And same thing in, in, in, like, computers and it, and security is

449
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,489
if you've got people worried about not clicking fishing links,

450
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,469
then they're not worrying about the thing you're paying them to worry about.

451
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,770
I think that's all that needs to be said.

452
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,219
I mean,

453
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,520
it, but here's,

454
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,449
here's what's funny is it seems so obvious when you say something like that

455
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,219
yet.

456
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:26,239
If you look across the planet, there are an uncountable number of instances where

457
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,140
the basic needs aren't being met.

458
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,479
And so people are doing their, their performance suffers because of it

459
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,050
and yet

460
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,369
-- no one sees what should be an obvious fix. A perfect
-- example. My partner

461
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:42,369
is rather excited because last week her laptop

462
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,209
is slated for replacement.

463
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:48,199
And isn't that thing from like 2005 or something?

464
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,599
-- You said once
-- it's like eight years old,

465
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,790
I actually bought her a new battery because her

466
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,989
battery would hold like a 2030 minute charge.

467
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:58,359
That's madness. And did you get to expense that on your taxes?

468
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,030
The battery was like $30.

469
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,900
Laptop batteries are not expensive.

470
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:07,020
Like, like it's not a brand name, laptop battery, but who cares? Right.

471
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,349
It's a $30 battery probably won't catch fire.

472
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,699
It's probably fine.

473
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,560
But um, like literally, it's just and I'm thinking about this and

474
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,530
to me it's, if you spend $1000 on a laptop every three years, right. Typical

475
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,459
amortization is three years in the business world.

476
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:24,300
Right.

477
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,619
That's a dollar a day.

478
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,390
That's it. That's it. That's all I'm gonna say.

479
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,650
It's a dollar a day to give a person $1000 laptop every three years.

480
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,000
You know, and,

481
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,180
and let's go whole hog and get a really nice laptop

482
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:39,369
with a really good service plan on site support and everything.

483
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,959
That's $2000 a day. That's $2 a day.

484
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,979
And it kills me.

485
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:46,810
How many companies nickel and dime and just

486
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:51,060
are insane about hardware for technical people even.

487
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:51,400
Right.

488
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,925
Like, sure the sales people kind of get maybe not the greatest laptop but, you know,

489
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,234
when you're talking to developer

490
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:57,125
or

491
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:59,935
up like some sort of technical use of it, you know,

492
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:03,895
I upgraded the CPU on my desktop computer here from uh I originally had a really,

493
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,104
you know,

494
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,964
terrible Ryzen 2 3400 G because it was basically the

495
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:09,375
cheapest CPU that would get my computer running acceptably fast.

496
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:11,074
And I plan to buy a new CPU and then

497
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:15,375
that plan kind of went out the window and took an extra eight months. But man

498
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:18,285
spending the money on the R 3 5600 X.

499
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:21,859
Whoa, like my computer is about three times as fast as it was.

500
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:24,569
And I'm, I'm actually getting a lot more work done a lot faster.

501
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:28,270
-- But
-- I mean, this is that like total cost of ownership discussion.

502
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,420
And I mean, this comes up constantly in every industry where someone will say, oh,

503
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,959
we're cheaper than so and so

504
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,650
and so and so will say yes, but look at the total cost of ownership and of course,

505
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,469
when you're dealing with marketing materials,

506
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:42,109
you can't trust any of it because it's marketing materials.

507
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:45,280
Well, but this is like return on investment. I mean, no offense.

508
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,630
But how much of a return on investment do you need to justify? $2 a day on somebody?

509
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,349
$2 a day is a laptop. $2 a day is toilet paper. Really nice. Toilet paper.

510
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,989
$2 a day would be coffee.

511
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,979
I think there's a lot of organizations that don't look at it in that perspective,

512
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:05,189
they look at the upfront cost of something, not necessarily what it's going to mean.

513
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:05,469
I mean,

514
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:07,550
one of my favorite examples of this

515
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,400
is when you look at

516
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:14,150
like security stuff, right? Where people will look at.

517
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,189
Ok, we need a, a SIM we need endpoint protection, we need whatever fill it in

518
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,319
and

519
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:26,069
it is not uncommon at all for them to under scope everything they do.

520
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,520
And then your people end up in a position where, ok,

521
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:31,650
we can only store two days of log files.

522
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:35,530
But if we throw away all of the windows, event logs, then we can store four days of of,

523
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:35,900
of

524
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,449
logs and, you know,

525
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,069
like these are ridiculous decisions that at the end

526
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,280
of the day is gonna probably end up costing

527
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,069
magnitudes more than it would to just buy the

528
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,660
freaking extra disk to put in the machine.

529
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,619
But I, I don't know, I guess maybe, I don't know what to say.

530
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,280
Like I just, because the reality is on the one hand, you have $2 a day for coffee,

531
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,530
toilet paper and a new laptop.

532
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,540
On the other hand, you have companies that just, it would,

533
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,459
you might as well try and pull somebody's teeth out.

534
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,040
I, I don't know what to say. Maybe

535
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:08,410
-- if I have people found strategies that work to get this stuff. I don't know.
-- I mean,

536
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:15,729
my favorite example is to just say, don't work at those companies

537
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,119
because I think the reality is when you see a

538
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,880
company or an organization nickel and diming to this point,

539
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,800
that's not a sign of a healthy organization, right?

540
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,449
That, that's a company that's in trouble

541
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,329
again. Talking about some studies.

542
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,060
But there's been a lot of studies in the

543
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,010
last few years that have shown that being poor,

544
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,930
shortens your life.

545
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,900
It stresses you out. It's, you know, people are constantly worrying. Yeah.

546
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,689
It literally changes your DNA.

547
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:42,089
You know, people are worried, like, do I pay the electric bill or do I buy food?

548
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,599
You know, and depending on where you live,

549
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:46,569
that's a hard choice because you either freeze to death or starve to death

550
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,939
-- and,
-- and, and

551
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,709
I'm sure this affects management when you're at a

552
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:54,260
company that will say is on the downward slope

553
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:56,780
to some of these companies aren't even on downward slopes. They're just

554
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:58,140
ridiculous.

555
00:24:58,619 --> 00:24:59,060
But

556
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,290
I,

557
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,699
I don't think it's, you can't just say it's only bad companies that do this.

558
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,449
There are quote unquote good companies that do this.

559
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,619
There are governments that do this. You know,

560
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:08,770
there's

561
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,750
governments are weird for their own reason.

562
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,160
They, they, they fall into their own special category

563
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,010
that I would not compare to a company.

564
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,599
Part of it is to maybe be more aware of this because

565
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,609
again,

566
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:24,790
this is one of the reasons I left the last company I work for is

567
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,250
just that there were a lot of little stressors that were adding up to be

568
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,540
really big stressors.

569
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,040
So I left,

570
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:34,219
I

571
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:38,250
get it because I've met a lot of people in the it industry who are really stressed out

572
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,250
and I don't think they need to be,

573
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,699
-- that's all the people in the it industry,
-- I guess,

574
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:48,239
I guess my advice maybe is take a personal sort of stress inventory and maybe, I mean,

575
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,020
money's nice but not being super stressed out all the time and being able to

576
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:56,560
-- sleep is I suspect it's nicer than having more money
-- probably to a degree.

577
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:59,859
-- I mean, that's easy to say obviously, but well
-- above what is that magic,

578
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:00,974
the number they found like above,

579
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:04,655
I think it's $80,000 us and pretty much the western world above that, the,

580
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:07,375
the return on happiness is minimal.

581
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,444
That's, that's my understanding.

582
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:12,824
So, and again, we're pretty privileged to be like, 0 $80,000

583
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:14,854
easy, you know, I get it.

584
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:18,775
It's, that's a, that is definitely I'm coming from a place of privilege to say that.

585
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,069
Yep. Yep. Absolutely.

586
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,130
-- So,
-- yeah, I don't know.

587
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,170
I, I feel like this one, we started on breakfast and we wandered around, but I,

588
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,589
I guess fundamentally

589
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,729
the purpose of all of this strange conversation is just that

590
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,680
I think there's this aspect of self care

591
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,410
that

592
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:43,569
we don't do a very good job of and it's easy to say, oh, take better care of yourself

593
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,849
and no one is really going to do it

594
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,880
-- well, or
-- sometimes they're not allowed to

595
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,910
how many places are like, oh, we want you to, you know,

596
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,449
take care of yourself. So take breaks if you need to.

597
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,969
But also if you don't get your work done, we're going to smack you one.

598
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:58,430
Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly.

599
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,260
Exactly. And, and that's

600
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,410
what percentage of people can ask their boss to

601
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,469
take a one hour nap right now in this moment

602
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,560
and

603
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,949
get a yes

604
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,420
man. A one hour nap sounds good. Getting up at 5 a.m. is right

605
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,849
when you're over 40 when you're,

606
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,420
that's true.

607
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:18,770
Although I would have been going to bed at 5 a.m. in the younger days. But,

608
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,739
-- and uh anyway, anyway,
-- but also I think with the self care,

609
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,079
there's also the piece of maybe if you are management or a boss allow, like,

610
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:27,880
encourage it and actually

611
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:30,099
do something to make their life a little bit better.

612
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:34,119
-- Maybe let them take a half hour break.
-- If you are a people manager

613
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,099
and you talk about self care,

614
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:39,780
you have to live the example because if you talk about self care,

615
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,520
but you're running yourself into the ground.

616
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,189
Your people look at that and think

617
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,949
I need to work like they do.

618
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,750
-- Yeah, the whole Japanese boss thing. Exactly.
-- Exactly. All right.

619
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,010
So I think we should call it here. This is a lovely place to stop.
