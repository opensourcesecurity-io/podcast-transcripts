0
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,029
Hit record.

1
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:04,650
I'm annoyed that like, I wish there was a way for the tab to signal like

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,130
the red dot signals that my microphone is active but not recording.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,270
Whereas my brain says red dot means recording,

4
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:11,529
you know,

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,710
December 20th,

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,029
-- December 20th,
-- we're so close.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:15,989
So the question is,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
is some two factor authentication or multi factor authentication better than

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,790
no two fa

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,530
M

11
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,750
fa or are there cases where the two of A and M FA is so bad?

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,459
-- You'd be better off not having it? I
-- and this is a very contentious topic actually.

13
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,598
And I go back and forth a lot and I think about this a lot.

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,639
I have a simple answer, please.

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,080
There's two kinds of attacks, there's targeted attacks and there's

16
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:41,490
the broad don't target, just credential stuffing attacks.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,130
And here's the thing, the two fa and M fa will help for the broad non targeted attacks.

18
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,000
Absolutely.

19
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:49,529
But for a targeted attack,

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,060
there are situations where your two fa or M fa can actually make things worse.

21
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:55,009
A great example being S MS, you know,

22
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,930
because you cannot protect yourself against a SIM swap, you cannot.

23
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,290
And we talked about this on a previous show,

24
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:04,849
but there's this guy who figured out a way to protect himself against a SIM swap

25
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,449
and it involved setting up his own bloody phone company

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:08,809
and you can have up to what is it,

27
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,150
11 layers of security to change your phone account details.

28
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:12,839
That

29
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,989
basically proves my point that you

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,760
cannot realistically protect yourself against a SIM

31
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,760
swap if the solution is you got to set up a phone company.

32
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,569
And, and now

33
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:24,830
I think for normal people,

34
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,309
-- the S MS is probably acceptable in many instances
-- until they're targeted.

35
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,779
And the problem is also sim swaps apparently are

36
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,680
becoming less targeted where they will just break into a

37
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,790
phone operator and sim swap a whole pile of accounts

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,790
and just randomly hit Facebook or Gmail or whatever,

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,839
using that phone number for the password recovery and reset

40
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:48,230
-- because
-- you can enter a phone number into those

41
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:48,690
because you

42
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:51,355
might have forgotten your email account because apparently people do.

43
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:55,004
And so for example, I entered my phone number and you know, of course, Google's like,

44
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:55,904
well, which account do you want?

45
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,944
Because there's a whole pile of them with that phone number attacked.

46
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,565
I'm like, oh, bloody heck. Right.

47
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:00,944
And so that's the thing, right?

48
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,764
If my phone number were to get compromised through a SIM swap,

49
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:06,074
all those accounts now can be compromised.

50
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:09,794
And that's part of the problem is the Attackers kind of don't care what they get

51
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,274
because if I attack 10 or 20 or 100 Facebook accounts and compromise them.

52
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:14,604
I'll get something useful in there.

53
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:15,919
Well, and my,

54
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:19,759
my argument here is always that a targeted attacker

55
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,059
cannot be stopped no matter what you do,

56
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,210
whether if you have two factor authentication, that's just going to slow them down.

57
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,369
It's not going to stop them.

58
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,410
If they have enough dedication and resources, you cannot win. Yeah.

59
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,139
-- But
-- that doesn't mean you shouldn't try

60
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:32,460
things

61
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:33,809
that are not agreed.

62
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:39,320
-- One
-- 100% agree. Like you should always use two factor off. I think having a

63
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,994
wider net being cast against S MS authentication is interesting

64
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:47,914
because this is one of those situations that I guess

65
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:53,785
this was not one of the concerns I ever ever had is I always assume that S MS you know,

66
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:57,574
Sim Jacking was going to end up under the targeted attack category.

67
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:59,115
And if it's not,

68
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:00,994
then that creates

69
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:02,664
a different problem, I

70
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,074
-- think
-- the thing is also, it's something I cannot

71
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,589
myself against. Right.

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,360
For example, if my bank, my bank,

73
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:13,389
one of my banks uses biometrics voiceprint and I'm like fantastic, except there's

74
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:17,089
good Lord at this point. How many hundreds of hours of recordings of my voice? Right?

75
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,949
You know, they don't even need to deep fake it. They can just cut and paste it.

76
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,339
I will try to dig up the episode. But there's a podcast called Cyber.

77
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,350
I like to listen to it.

78
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,429
They did that where they took the host's audio,

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,110
they extracted the words needed defeated into one of those, like,

80
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:36,184
like voice duplicating A I fake things and then they had the fake

81
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,005
host do a bunch of talking and the real host is like,

82
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:43,264
this is ridiculous and you knew it wasn't really him, but it was pretty good

83
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:47,544
-- and it was hilarious.
-- We can replace ourselves with pearl scripts. Finally,

84
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,904
I, seriously, if it wasn't so much work, I would totally do this to you.

85
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:53,785
But it's a lot of work.

86
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:55,225
Now, the question is what I notice,

87
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,785
what would the audience notice is the real question?

88
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,559
Well, as long as I don't listen to the episodes, I'm not gonna,

89
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,919
but,

90
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,009
and they have, they have interns that could do the work, right?

91
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,770
Like we need an intern, that's what we

92
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,479
-- need.
-- Yeah. So if you're willing to work for no money,

93
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,089
-- if
-- you pay us, we get,

94
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:13,800
go get

95
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,500
the most valuable resource of all.

96
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,920
-- I'm told you can use exposure at many fine restaurants for foods.
-- That's right.

97
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,100
-- You can totally eat exposure
-- to be clear.

98
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:27,100
I hate this whole intern working for free thing on so many levels. I agree.

99
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:30,940
It's awful. And I love the fact that it's actually illegal in most of the world,

100
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:36,339
-- like in the US, that interns can't do real work. They can. I
-- love how our topic is.

101
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,220
Multi factor authentication. We're talking about interns now. It's lovely.

102
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,119
But anyway, we're out of time. Multi factor authentication, I guess.

103
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,739
Use it is bad two factor oth better than no two factor oath. I

104
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,695
-- think,
-- I think the tipping point is we're getting there but we're not there yet.

105
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:53,665
It is a contentious discussion for sure.

106
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:56,765
And I dare not weigh in because I find myself

107
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,825
changing my mind in either direction on a regular basis,

108
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,575
-- which I think, I
-- think that's a good sign means you're thinking about

109
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:02,845
it.

110
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:06,765
It is. I agree. I agree. So, all right. 21st tomorrow. How exciting.
