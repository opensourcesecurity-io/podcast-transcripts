Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

1
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:13,680
-- Kurt Siefried and my partner in not crime. Josh Pressers.
-- Not crime.

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,739
-- Yeah. I don't wanna get
-- hacked. Do we

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,719
-- commit not crime? I don't
-- know.

4
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,440
Well, like you stop at stop signs,

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:19,879
uh,

6
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:24,280
generally stop at stop signs. I can't think of very many. I don't,

7
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:26,280
I'm a pretty boring person

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:26,770
to

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,010
be.

10
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,420
I'm, I'm not gonna pretend I'm like some outlaw.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,819
Yeah, that's, that's the thing. Like

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,409
when I was young it was like, oh, I want an exciting life and now that I'm old, I'm like,

13
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:37,029
the more boring things are the happier I am.

14
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:40,479
Yeah. Like I have the first night free to myself in two months.

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,279
And so, like I'm doing this and then I'm gonna go do some work

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
and I had a sandwich earlier. It was

17
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:46,180
very

18
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:46,349
good.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,020
Yeah.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,009
No, I haven't changed.

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,470
I completely understand 100%.

22
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,279
I, I wanna say, I wanna say something though. So

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,939
if, if, if you have time, you know, uh, games done quick was like a week ago. Right?

24
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,709
That's a speed run marathon. I love,

25
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:02,810
there is a game for the Nintendo Switch.

26
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,069
That is about rolling a, a like moving a roll of toilet paper around on the screen

27
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,400
and to control the toilet paper on the screen,

28
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,419
you know, you take a real roll of toilet paper,

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,260
you put the Joy Con inside the tube and then you roll

30
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,150
it back and forth to move the thing on the screen.

31
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,669
I'm like, give me toilet paper. I was like, this can't be real. It's totally real.

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,370
And I'm like, oh my goodness, this is the best thing ever.

33
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:29,470
Like,

34
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,940
this is what I love about things like the connect or like Joycons in that

35
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,970
you can use them in ways that they weren't meant to be,

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,010
you can do some really clever cool stuff,

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,410
which actually kind of leads to what we want to talk about today,

38
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:48,529
which is this new proposed Dutch National Security Law?

39
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:49,970
Ok. So

40
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,010
when I interpret your words, I think it's, it's toilet paper,

41
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,930
but I don't think that's what you meant with that comment.

42
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:01,510
-- No,
-- just using things the way they ways that are maybe not supposed to be.

43
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:02,480
Ok.

44
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,410
So let's lay this one out.

45
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:07,949
I'll let you explain it because I don't like it and I know you don't hate it.

46
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,619
So you'll be a little more objective than I will.

47
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,589
Uh I wouldn't say that.

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,660
So there's basically this new proposed Dutch security

49
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,289
law and the biggest change is that so traditionally

50
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,639
you have a bad actor organization, so you do boring things like get a warrant

51
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,440
hack into them. Look at their emails,

52
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,259
build a court case, try to convict them and send them to prison. Ok. Fair.

53
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:33,869
You know,

54
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,449
that's typical.

55
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,309
Well, for the Dutch it is.

56
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:39,240
Well, for most of the world,

57
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,279
well, to summarize the Dutch government wants to automatically,

58
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:45,860
and administratively gain permission to target victims of hackers.

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,600
So essentially if they get a warrant to hack a hacking group. Right.

60
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,149
Right.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,169
Then the victims of that hacking group,

62
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:56,119
the Dutch government would also be able to go into their stuff and look at it.

63
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:56,710
That's right.

64
00:02:56,899 --> 00:03:00,669
So it's, it's a broad expansion of powers, essentially,

65
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,179
that's a bit of an understatement.

66
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,899
-- But
-- yes, I think broad should be underlined and maybe circled or something. But

67
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:07,789
-- yeah,
-- because some of

68
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:11,134
these ransomware groups are in a lot of systems.

69
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:16,914
Right. That's right. And now also if you read further, it also talks about

70
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:20,714
giving them the ability to like sniff traffic and

71
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:23,195
access emails and all that kind of stuff.

72
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,134
Like I basically,

73
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:29,235
if they're targeting a hacking group and the hacking group has hacked you,

74
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:34,235
they can automatically just like start rooting through your stuff basically

75
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:35,044
in a nutshell.

76
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:35,214
Yeah.

77
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:37,384
Now, now I

78
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,940
don't wanna dwell too much on the specifics of the Dutch

79
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:43,699
law just because obviously I'm not an expert in Dutch law

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,440
-- and
-- this is also a draft and blah, blah,

81
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:52,710
-- it's
-- a draft and the like lengthy bill is in Dutch, which I can't read

82
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:56,429
and so I've read the English summaries, which

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,190
I will assume are correct.

84
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,429
But I think the, the higher level discussion and this is what I'm interested in is,

85
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,880
should law enforcement have the ability to do something?

86
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,470
Like, if they know an attacker has hacked into somebody,

87
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:18,570
should they be able to basically also break in for the purposes of law enforcement?

88
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,220
And this would,

89
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,869
I think in the physical world you could compare this to

90
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,329
like AAA criminal runs into someone's house.

91
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,410
Can the police officer follow them into the house? Right. Sort of thing.

92
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,200
Exigent circumstances uh, in almost every jurisdiction on the planet. Yeah.

93
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,179
Right. And, and exactly,

94
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,709
and that

95
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:39,390
I've been thinking about this a lot and I feel like you

96
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,989
can think about it in the context of the physical world.

97
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,940
Well, it's where we have existing case law.

98
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:47,269
Right. Right. But, but, but now

99
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,910
if, if I am

100
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,309
say a bank

101
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:54,070
and a criminal is banking with me.

102
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,950
If the police have a warrant against the criminal,

103
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,529
they can't just show up and be like, hey, we already have this warrant.

104
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,130
So we're gonna, uh, we can look at your stuff. Right.

105
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,450
The banks would be like, no, you need a new warrant to come talk to me.

106
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:05,029
Yeah,

107
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,600
I was gonna say you would have to be banking with a

108
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,980
lot of criminals before they start rooting for your stuff and,

109
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,160
-- and that has happened,
-- right?

110
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,489
Like,

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,410
like

112
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:11,820
Deutsche

113
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:12,079
bank,

114
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,109
for example, what apparently was

115
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,910
-- the world's criminal banker. Uh
-- Right. Right.

116
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,790
Anyway,

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,500
but,

118
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,140
and, and I think

119
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,709
this is

120
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:26,119
truly unique because we can't compare this to

121
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,839
any physical like real world situation directly.

122
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,160
Well, there is, there's for example, America, the American government demands

123
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,510
banking information

124
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,190
for bank accounts held by American citizens in foreign countries like Canada.

125
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,709
And the penalty for us not giving that information over freely is they will cut us off

126
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,670
from their banking system which

127
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,670
like we can't do that like we would,

128
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,250
we would collapse.

129
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,260
And so for example, in a lot of countries like China, for example,

130
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,519
when

131
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,000
this law passed, you know, as soon as you basically walked into your Chinese bank

132
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:02,059
and they're like, oh, you're an American customer, right?

133
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,890
Here's all your money, go away

134
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,679
like they would just close your account boo you

135
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,820
up because they don't want to deal with it.

136
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,299
And there's a lot of Canadian banks,

137
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,390
you know, that don't want really want to deal with this.

138
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,000
But there's so many Americans up here banking and

139
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,459
stuff that we can't really get rid of it.

140
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:14,809
So

141
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,679
there are sort of some parallels but not nothing quite this.

142
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,079
We don't know what the intent of this law is,

143
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,350
right? And,

144
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,220
and, and for example, if the intent was like,

145
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,750
why do firemen get to kick down your door?

146
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,290
Well, because if your house burns down,

147
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:32,320
your neighbor's house might catch fire and we all agree that that's a bad thing.

148
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,929
-- Also, there might be like people in the building.
-- Right.

149
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,799
No, no, I think the intent is to empower law enforcement

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,929
to better operate

151
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:42,730
in

152
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,179
cyberspace. I think that's the simple explanation.

153
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,170
Now, intent and reality, especially legally speaking

154
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:54,730
often are the, the, the Venn diagram is two separate circles.

155
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,190
And

156
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,429
let's again, I want to,

157
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,269
we know a law like this is going to be

158
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:05,709
abused eventually, maybe not at first, but guaranteed 100%.

159
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,450
And I don't even wanna talk about that.

160
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,959
I just wanna say, like, let's say,

161
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,239
here's a question for you should law enforcement be allowed to hack

162
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,190
into a system they know has been compromised by an adversary.

163
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,820
The adversary is already in the system. Let's say we 100% know this

164
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:28,269
-- should law enforcement break into it.
-- What's the intention of breaking into it?

165
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,670
If the, is the, for example,

166
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:33,149
is the intention of breaking into it to patch it and fix it and kick the bad guys out

167
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:34,640
or is it

168
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:37,299
to gather information that might then be used to build a

169
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:40,299
case against the owner of that system for something completely unrelated?

170
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:42,760
It's going to be to build a case.

171
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,480
I guarantee it because like,

172
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,820
how many times have you heard of law enforcement

173
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,100
-- patching up the door, they knocked out
-- that's not really allowed and they would get,

174
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:53,730
you know, the,

175
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,299
the legal liability like we've talked about this before where you know,

176
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,239
part of me is like, if somebody ever writes a virus that actually goes out and, like,

177
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,959
forcibly updates all the windows installs that it compromises, I'd be like, yeah,

178
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,750
I'm ok with that,

179
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,170
you know. But at the same time I remember,

180
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:08,380
well,

181
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,420
some of those old window systems are running MRI machines and if you patch them,

182
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:13,339
the MRI machine will break and then people will die.

183
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,470
And that's part of the problem. You, you can't just like

184
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:20,399
upgrade windows to be its current patch set safely,

185
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,399
especially with like old industrial control systems.

186
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,799
But there's a reason

187
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,920
they don't want on

188
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,209
Windows

189
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,720
XP.

190
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,239
I don't want to even talk about this.

191
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:28,750
What I'm

192
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,000
saying is

193
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:29,179
the

194
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:30,100
i

195
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,969
the idea of upgrading the system or patching the system

196
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,299
or fixing the system or changing a config file.

197
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,270
We don't know that it's only gonna be a benefit there.

198
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,030
It could just make things massively

199
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,989
a rat's nest

200
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,479
car. It doesn't matter.

201
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,109
The question is,

202
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:47,539
should law enforcement be able to break into these

203
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:50,859
-- systems
-- with a warrant specific to that system?

204
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,789
Yes, but

205
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:53,940
that, that's the problem here is this gross

206
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:54,950
uh

207
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,450
broadening,

208
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:02,419
right? Of like, oh, you know, we we broke into this ransomware gangs systems

209
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,640
and now we have access to everything this ransomware gang has access to which,

210
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,640
you know, for some of those like, like not pia

211
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:08,760
is a good example

212
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:09,950
that was

213
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,219
so widespread

214
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,719
or uh code red

215
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,789
or whatever, right?

216
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,020
Well, code red is a bad example because that was like password list SQL which,

217
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,549
-- who knew that could be
-- a problem

218
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,539
20 some years ago now.

219
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,909
And it's still,

220
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,190
we're just still finally sort of getting over the

221
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,880
default password thing with like the eu saying,

222
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,849
uh what the, whatever the directive number is that you just can't like,

223
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,820
you, you can't make a default password of admin 123.

224
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:38,640
I keep coming back to what is the intent of this law.

225
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,030
And also the intent doesn't matter because once you have the law written,

226
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,280
you might have a new government in five or 10 years.

227
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,039
That's true.

228
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:47,080
That's true.

229
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,119
Like,

230
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,679
but you, you still, you still haven't answered the question.

231
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,520
Should law enforcement be allowed to break into a system that

232
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,229
is secondary to the system they have the warrant for?

233
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,239
-- I think, no, I think the answer is absolutely not.
-- I think the answer is yes.

234
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,900
But with more guard rails and constraints

235
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,760
because I keep coming back to the, I don't want the fire to spread.

236
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,440
And so that, for example,

237
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,299
if law enforcement doesn't go into the system, how do they even know who to notify?

238
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:16,940
-- No,
-- no, no,

239
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,250
that's not the question

240
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:19,340
because

241
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,059
law enforcement

242
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,940
there, well, there's two, there's two parts of this.

243
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:27,539
I think law enforcement should be able to break into

244
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:29,859
a system if they have a warrant to do so

245
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:33,150
because I think it's no different than covertly installing a

246
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,179
bug in someone's house or their business or whatever,

247
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,080
with a warrant.

248
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:43,380
I think breaking into a second system should need a second warrant is what I think.

249
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:45,200
Well, and again,

250
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,989
the Real World analogs sort of fall apart because

251
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,390
if I get a warrant to go into your house

252
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,080
to look for a gun and I see like a pile of dead bodies on the coffee table.

253
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,849
Sorry, that's in play,

254
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:54,770
you know.

255
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,380
But on the other hand, yeah, I can't be like, oh,

256
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,799
I was searching for a gun and while we were like, excavating the foundation we found,

257
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,880
you know, a gold coin and you're not legally allowed to have gold or whatever,

258
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,580
like in a lot of countries you're not legally allowed to hold gold or whatever.

259
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:08,390
Um

260
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,090
Oh, really? I didn't know that actually

261
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,270
because they, they wanted the gold reserves to, you know,

262
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,739
have you read the terms of service on your safe deposit box?

263
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,489
You're actually not allowed to store money in it.

264
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,669
I, I know that

265
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:23,080
you can only store like money that has historical, like

266
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,650
historical value.

267
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:27,419
It can't be like modern money,

268
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,909
haven't you seen breaking bad? Like

269
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,159
they,

270
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,369
they use safe deposit boxes full of cash is their dead drop. Like

271
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,440
I get it.

272
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,150
But yeah, the list of stuff I'm not allowed to keep my safe deposit box.

273
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,869
I was like, wow, there's a lot of things like,

274
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,419
and basically it's all the things I would want to

275
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,559
keep in there because I want them to be safe.

276
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,520
Right. Anyway,

277
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,489
but back to this. So

278
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,359
I think the concern is we're entering an era where, ok, you have an IP address. Well,

279
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,869
great that like

280
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,099
20 years ago, given an IP address, you could figure out the ISP,

281
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:59,909
like in about a millisecond and then from the ISP and they could like,

282
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,150
figure out who owns that system.

283
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,210
Like, what's the billing contact for this IP.

284
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,030
It would be a computer with a person.

285
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,789
And now you have

286
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:09,669
like a bunch of stuff that's like

287
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,150
kind of on an IP address in the sense of it's

288
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,450
like behind that IP address from a net gateway and,

289
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,789
but like who's actually in charge of it or in control of it?

290
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:20,450
You know, you gotta kind of poke around the system maybe.

291
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,890
And some of it, like, I, I'm kind of wondering like, what,

292
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,679
like my Phillips Hugh light bulbs, like, for the sake of argument,

293
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,710
my Phillips hug light bulbs get hacked by a hacker.

294
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,059
The Dutch government goes into the hacker system and goes, hey,

295
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,390
they've compromised all these light bulbs.

296
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,580
Let's go into the light bulbs.

297
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,770
I guess they could pull the like, customer ID and then go to Phillips and be like,

298
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,049
you know, who's customer?

299
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,969
1234, like, let's go contact her or something.

300
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,739
We're stuck in a mindset of thinking of computers, but

301
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:45,880
everything's a computer. Now,

302
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,960
-- your oven, your toaster, your car.
-- I'm not saying they need to list Kurt as now.

303
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:53,280
II, I don't,

304
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,390
I'm not an expert in getting warrants,

305
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,539
but I believe today you have to actually like list a person or an address or

306
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,419
you don't.

307
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,440
-- Oh, well,
-- depending on the kind of warrant.

308
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,289
Well, because if you're looking for somebody, you don't know who it is. Like those

309
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,119
-- geofence warrants.
-- Ok. That's fair. That's a good point.

310
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,669
Like those

311
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,659
geofence warrants where we're like,

312
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:13,530
we just want every phone in this area at this time, the phone, this number

313
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,739
and, and look,

314
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:19,059
why can't, why can't you just get a warrant for an IP address then

315
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:25,380
be like this ransomware group infected this system. We want to go look at that.

316
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,750
-- You
-- might not know the IP

317
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,020
S

318
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:29,900
then what are you gonna attack?

319
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:30,770
Well, but for example,

320
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,500
what if it's under a tor network or something or it's

321
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,570
-- behind VPN even
-- then you still can't get to it,

322
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,000
right?

323
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,880
And I I,

324
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,690
you and your freaking, I hate your examples. Kurt.

325
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,549
Well, no, but for example,

326
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,020
you're forgetting things like I hack a hacking group

327
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,119
and I now control their command and control server.

328
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,359
So I can now tell all the hacked victims to like, tell me where they are,

329
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,770
-- send me an email and
-- I don't,

330
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:57,630
I don't know if that would apply. And, and so in my view,

331
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:03,940
I would not see that as breaking into a remote system. It's probably not.

332
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,450
Well, defined in any sense of the word.

333
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,690
Well, here's the problem.

334
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,940
Then by that definition, if I compromise Red Hat and compromise package updates,

335
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,809
then I'm not hacking you.

336
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,109
You're just installing malicious packages. Well, no, I'm absolutely hacking you.

337
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,799
Right.

338
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,929
And that's the thing. It's like part of the problem is this is all so poorly defined.

339
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:22,270
-- This is
-- very poorly defined

340
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,309
and

341
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:26,200
we're also stuck in this transition era of

342
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:27,909
everything's a computer

343
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:31,960
-- and we have in no way, shape or form come to terms with that.
-- It is true.

344
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,929
I did not think we would be arguing this particular detail

345
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,580
in this conversation.

346
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,609
Right. Well, but it's not a detail anymore.

347
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:42,739
It's people like, I know a guy that just bought a new stove and he's like,

348
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:47,340
it has an IP address and I'm like, you better make sure that you turn it on and like,

349
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,659
try to run it the day before Thanksgiving

350
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,280
so that when it wants to do a software update, you're not, you know,

351
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:54,340
up up the creek and not making dinner.

352
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:55,020
And he's like, oh,

353
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:55,859
it's true.

354
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:57,619
I hadn't thought of that. I'm like,

355
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,359
I love that. My car is just dumb. It's got a single color

356
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:06,099
screen thing that will let me pair to it with Bluetooth so I can play my music.

357
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:10,140
-- That's all I want. I don't want anything smarter than that.
-- I agree with you.

358
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,140
But my car has tons of computer.

359
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:15,799
I love the idea of Apple car play, like, I've used it in a rental car and it, oh,

360
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:16,590
it's nice.

361
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,330
But,

362
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:19,500
oh, man, like I've, hm.

363
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,219
So, but back to this,

364
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:25,789
I think problem is we're entering an era where everything is a computer and so it's,

365
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,570
and it's much more dangerous, like a,

366
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,299
like a desktop computer hooked up to an MRI machine. The MRI machine doesn't work.

367
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,200
Ok. That's sad. But like a Tesla,

368
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,830
uh, an oven, uh, a big industrial machine, uh a self driving forklift,

369
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,630
like forklifts are big and heavy.

370
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,799
I mean, ok,

371
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:45,679
so I wasn't thinking in this particular context and I have a suspicion that

372
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,349
the authors of that law were either they're probably thinking very system focused,

373
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,900
but you also raise another interesting point.

374
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,809
And I think this,

375
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,669
this is something that I think

376
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,950
or I, I rather, I feel

377
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,429
backs up my, my conclusion that we shouldn't just like Willy nilly do this stuff.

378
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,130
If some, if there is an MRI machine

379
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,179
and the authorities do break into it,

380
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:07,880
that's bad, right?

381
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,059
Like even if they know bad guys are in it,

382
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,539
having another person messing around with it probably isn't good.

383
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,229
Well,

384
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:16,780
I would say it's not ideal for sure.

385
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,835
But part of the problem is it also,

386
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,575
but it ignores the fact that there's already a bad guy in there.

387
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,145
Like we just had this happen with the

388
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:25,794
uh the Etr Certificate Authority.

389
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,094
Luckily a

390
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:29,484
good person took a poke at Etr

391
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,304
found them running some software

392
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:33,565
with the default admin credentials

393
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:34,554
in production.

394
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:38,085
And he went into the thing and was like, with default credentials and it was like, uh,

395
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:38,895
oh,

396
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:39,614
this is

397
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,085
a like, uh, and he like,

398
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,955
as far as we know, you know, he backed out and he posted publicly on the mailing list

399
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:46,739
and was like, you know,

400
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:48,380
blah, blah, blah, contacted them.

401
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,179
They said they fixed it, but I'm still a bit concerned

402
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,190
etr lied about it and said like, oh, it wasn't a big deal.

403
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,109
And the guy was like, uh, no,

404
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,000
actually I had access to like half a million records or some stupid number.

405
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,479
Oops. And

406
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,679
like, one of the things I pointed out to, it's like,

407
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,118
it's really nice that this guy who kind of went in through literally a

408
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,880
default administrative set of credentials was nice

409
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,959
enough to tell you and tell the community

410
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:13,069
that's not a high bar to hacking. Like, how do we know a bad

411
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,660
people weren't already in there

412
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:17,589
for real because that's such a low bar to hacking. But

413
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,630
I mean, it doesn't get much lower than that.

414
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,579
I mean, so actually,

415
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:24,670
so I was at a little conference literally yesterday,

416
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,949
which is, uh it was called Grassroots.

417
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,770
-- It's
-- ha I'm gonna bring up our listeners,

418
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,180
don't know when that was because this show comes out later.

419
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:34,219
-- Remember you say that every time to me? No,
-- I totally do.

420
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:37,050
But you also mentioned yesterday more than once and yesterday.

421
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:41,155
It is fine in this context because it's a meaningless ephemeral date. That is,

422
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:41,775
in fact,

423
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,545
this show isn't even gonna go out for probably

424
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,165
several weeks from the time we record it.

425
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:46,244
So I don't mind. But

426
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:49,564
so anyway, they had a panel on

427
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:53,964
cybersecurity insurance and they had a lawyer there who was talking about

428
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:58,834
kind of what, like what does it mean legally that you have to do in these situations?

429
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,675
And one of the things that was brought up,

430
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:04,645
how should you decide what was or wasn't leaked

431
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,890
during

432
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,300
an incident? Right?

433
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,849
And basically now like in in the context of what

434
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,510
you're talking about this registrar or not registrar C A,

435
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:12,910
right?

436
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,349
-- Yes,
-- certificate of authority, a root certificate of authority.

437
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:15,770
If,

438
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:22,089
if you can show compelling evidence that the data was not exfil traded in some way,

439
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:24,729
meaning like I have net flow logs,

440
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:25,875
this system,

441
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:29,905
I can show that no meaningful amount of data has exited this system.

442
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,915
We can say with confidence that the data

443
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:33,984
was not

444
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:37,005
exulted by the attacker, right? That totally makes sense.

445
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:40,265
Well, and a perfect example that's happened with revenue Canada in Hartley.

446
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:41,444
They actually said at one point it was

447
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,594
like 100 and 180 accounts were potentially compromised.

448
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,020
And it's like, wow, but here's the thing,

449
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,150
the kind of organization that has that technology

450
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:52,750
doesn't leave default user names and passwords in the software they deploy.

451
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Probably not. But, but,

452
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,349
but, but here here's my point

453
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,989
when you don't know,

454
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:03,910
you legally have to default to assume the worst. So in the context of that C A,

455
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,930
they need to assume

456
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:06,630
that

457
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:11,550
a malicious attacker has accessed all of that data

458
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,270
like full stop.

459
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,680
Well, they're also lying about other stuff. So

460
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,949
anyways, I am completely confident

461
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,959
that the level of dirt baggery that's going on there is unspeakable.

462
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:27,410
But anyway, anyway, put, bringing this all back, right. Bringing it all back.

463
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,250
I, I feel like we have this discussion. There's this, like

464
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,000
there's the, the legal aspects, there's the technical aspects

465
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,839
and

466
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:37,709
I,

467
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,239
I am concerned

468
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,930
that law enforcement is trying to paint with too broad

469
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:46,500
of a brush just in general when it comes to

470
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,020
computers and tech

471
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:49,550
and the courts

472
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:51,489
have no freaking clue.

473
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,619
The lawmakers have no freaking clue.

474
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,660
I want to say the law, the, the, the,

475
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,540
the law enforcement have no freaking clue.

476
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,369
I think some of them know what they're going to be able to do,

477
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,089
but in general they probably don't really know what's going on either.

478
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:06,430
Well,

479
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,329
this is assuming law enforcement was driving this

480
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,530
and I'm not sure that's clear here.

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,239
I don't know. Like I've seen situations where

482
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,319
some enforcement organization, not, not just law enforcement but has been like,

483
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,930
that's bad legislation. Please don't do that.

484
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,109
It has happened before. Yeah.

485
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,310
And the lawmakers are like, oh, no, we think this is a good idea and they're like,

486
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,589
you really don't understand what you're talking about.

487
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,949
Like please for the love of God don't mandate that we all paint our houses green.

488
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,790
So that's

489
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:34,030
true. You know, and so,

490
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,109
and that's the problem.

491
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,910
Everything is so complicated here and then,

492
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,569
and then you start speaking about intent but you don't a we don't

493
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:43,410
know their intent and b their intent will change like society change,

494
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,910
governments change for sure.

495
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,800
So uh yeah, I don't know,

496
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,640
but I keep coming back to

497
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,099
we're in an era

498
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:54,079
where the potential for harm is much higher than in past.

499
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:55,869
Yeah.

500
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,089
And we need to find some way to deal with that because

501
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,369
fundamentally,

502
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:04,579
oh, perfect example. Did you read the thing about the uh

503
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,410
the flipper zero kerfuffle last week?

504
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,449
No, I have no idea what you're talking about.

505
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,229
Electronic meters uh like wireless electronic meters for your power

506
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,880
supply or for your power VTRL, right? And they,

507
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:17,689
they

508
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,349
report how much electricity you use and they have like a shut off thing.

509
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,459
Well, but they're also controlled wirelessly.

510
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,530
Now, do you think that they have very good,

511
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,520
strong security on that wireless interface?

512
00:21:28,949 --> 00:21:30,060
Of course not.

513
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,459
Right. It's terrible.

514
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,380
So this guy basically had his flipper zero,

515
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,739
like basically tell the thing to like effectively

516
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,349
shut the power off and on a lot repeatedly

517
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,859
and guess, well, what do you think happens to a consumer level device

518
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,020
carrying 200 amps of power?

519
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:49,010
Uh 240 volts when you flick the switch off and on really fast for a while,

520
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,670
-- the magic smoke comes
-- out. There's many things that could happen. But yes, that's

521
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,060
-- it
-- died. It like,

522
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,060
did they only break the meter?

523
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:01,300
-- I would expect things in the house to also be broken after that.
-- But the point is

524
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,209
that they're,

525
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,829
they're sort of trying to put the blame on

526
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,380
flipper zero for being this dangerous device that enables this

527
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,890
attack to happen.

528
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,699
And of course, everybody on hacker news is like, no,

529
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,699
the phone

530
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:13,260
wise with this crappy

531
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,250
reader

532
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,339
and I'm like looking at my meter

533
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,520
thinking

534
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:20,500
it's probably just as insecure because like they're not gonna,

535
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:21,540
ok.

536
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:25,359
Actually, so there's a guy I had on the hacker History podcast some time ago,

537
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:28,040
he goes by hash, he has a youtube channel and I'll,

538
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,819
I'll post a link to one of his videos, the best one.

539
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,219
So he, he does a lot of smart meter hacking

540
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:35,109
and he found that there,

541
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,430
one of the security measures these smart meters

542
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,949
were using is they have like 256 channels.

543
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,400
I believe it is or maybe it's 100 and 28 it's a lot and they, they jump around, right.

544
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,829
And they have like predetermined.

545
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,219
Yeah, well, well, right, but no, the jumping around is part of their security

546
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,500
where the receiver and the sender know how to jump around.

547
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,020
And so anyway, he was trying to send a signal to this smart meter

548
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,810
and it was trying to jump around.

549
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,359
-- Yeah,
-- just send it on all 100 and 28 signals.

550
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:02,579
Well, that,

551
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,609
that's what he did is he used a AAA hack RF

552
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:08,890
and he just blasted the same thing over every single channel.

553
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,660
And so as it was jumping around listening, it was picking up exactly what it wanted.

554
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,089
I'm like,

555
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,010
that's so good because you figure, what,

556
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,680
10 years ago you couldn't have dreamed of that and now you could do it for like,

557
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:20,760
100 bucks.

558
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,530
Yeah, exactly. It's awesome.

559
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,280
I mean, so for example, I'm going to assume my,

560
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,959
like, even better when they were deploying these meters

561
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:30,349
app

562
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,819
Corp did so

563
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,859
not using electricians and all these electricians were like,

564
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,439
that's not good because that's a lot of electricity and angry electrons and

565
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:42,949
like, if everything goes smoothly and it's dry out and everything goes fine then,

566
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:46,699
yeah, you like, clip it, pop off the old one, pop in the new one, put the circuit, the,

567
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,530
the little ring on and put a little tag on it.

568
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,250
No problem.

569
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,170
But he's like, if anything is wrong,

570
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,829
are they gonna notice it? Like, are they competent enough to see that?

571
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,369
Like, oh, there's like a puddle in here or like a,

572
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,849
-- a raccoon or
-- how does this relate to our topic today?

573
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:01,689
So, the point is

574
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,290
that

575
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:04,540
again, like,

576
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,250
there's the real potential for harm with these things and these systems

577
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:09,000
are

578
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,969
always hackable and that's my other concern. Is that

579
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,540
there's no system that's basically un hackable outside of like

580
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,089
a few very limited number of crazy NSA whatever systems.

581
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:19,270
It,

582
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,290
it sounds to me like you're agreeing that

583
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,089
law enforcement shouldn't be allowed to do this.

584
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:24,250
No, quite the opposite.

585
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,520
Because the problem is though, like I said,

586
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,540
we've entered this era where everything is a computer, your electricity meter,

587
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:34,199
my water meter, they replace the water meter with this thing that

588
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,520
is like a Wi Fi and it's powered by the water going through.

589
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,280
It's got like a little turbine to power it. And I'm like, oh, that's clever.

590
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,579
Like that's cool that because I was like,

591
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:46,530
how does this get powered? And they're like little turbine. I'm like,

592
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,359
oh, well,

593
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:49,670
yeah,

594
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,630
that makes sense.

595
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,319
You know, it's got a little battery and a little

596
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:57,050
turbine thing or whatever magic. It, it apparently will,

597
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,810
the battery will never die. And I'm like,

598
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,010
that's not how batteries work.

599
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,349
And he's like, it is when they get recharged by the water. And I'm like, oh, ok, then,

600
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:04,239
you know,

601
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,069
and obviously your E meter is like, never gonna run out of juice.

602
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,069
And I'm

603
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:09,869
not,

604
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:13,250
I wonder when they're going to do the gas meter with wireless ones or did they

605
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:13,660
ever,

606
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,839
my gas meter has a battery in it because they put a wireless gas meter thing on.

607
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,660
I wonder if it has a turbine

608
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,390
for the floor, right? Because I don't know

609
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,719
-- you would. Well, you wouldn't need to, like, you don't
-- need to.

610
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,489
But gas is very low pressure.

611
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,869
Gas is only one or two P si, so it's gonna be tough to spin a turbine.

612
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,130
Well, or a little water wheel paddle thing anyways. The point is it doesn't matter.

613
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,810
II, I don't like this,

614
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,719
but here's the problem.

615
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,760
What's the alternative?

616
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,069
We just let hackers run rampant and when we compromise

617
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,869
or when you actually get into a hacker systems,

618
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,729
we're like, oh,

619
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,140
-- shoot, we can't go touch all those other systems.
-- That's not no, look,

620
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:52,660
there's always going to be bad people doing bad things like

621
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,560
that is not a question, right?

622
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,310
We're never going to get rid of crime.

623
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,050
I'm not saying law enforcement should just stand there and be like, well,

624
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,530
there's nothing we can do.

625
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:03,739
I'm saying

626
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,380
they need to operate in a, a, an environment that has checks and balances.

627
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,930
And I think telling them

628
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,650
if you get a warrant against this one group,

629
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,449
you can go whole hog on any system they have attacked.

630
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:20,119
Like, come on.

631
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:20,829
That's

632
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,760
so broad

633
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,089
and that sort of allows automation.

634
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,790
It allows them to just broadly collect everything and see

635
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,599
what's the problem and what's not

636
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,680
-- a problem.
-- I'm even comfortable with them collecting

637
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:37,119
1000 IP addresses and just going to a judge and being like this is, and look,

638
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,270
how often do you think judges deny warrants?

639
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,359
Probably never

640
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,119
under the FISA thing? I think that was three.

641
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:45,189
-- Like
-- never, but you know what I mean?

642
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,599
It's not even just the fact that they, they might get denied.

643
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,069
I'm comfortable with this. You just,

644
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,239
you need a process so that they can't, like, literally

645
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:57,503
just like, go straight down the hill as fast as they can.

646
00:26:57,512 --> 00:27:00,042
They need to stop occasionally and be like, hey, judge,

647
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,833
we're doing this and the judge is almost certainly gonna be like,

648
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:04,203
ok, good job.

649
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:09,522
But when they do truly go off the rails, then the judge can be like, hold on a minute.

650
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:10,483
-- What's the problem with
-- that?

651
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:11,633
I was wrong.

652
00:27:11,642 --> 00:27:15,022
It was four FISA warrants requests are rarely denied

653
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:17,682
during the 25 years from 1979 to 2004,

654
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:21,123
18,742 warrants were granted while only

655
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:25,645
were rejected and fewer than 200 requests had to be modified before being accepted.

656
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:27,816
Almost all of them in 2003, 2004.

657
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:28,645
So look,

658
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:30,066
I'm saying, basically

659
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:32,686
you're saying, let's add a check and balance. And I'm saying

660
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:33,566
it's just,

661
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:34,686
it's like

662
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:37,745
it's like those dialogue boxes in windows vista, they're just gonna hit.

663
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:41,066
-- Yes, they're just gonna hit. Yes.
-- FISA warrants are different.

664
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:41,395
Kurt

665
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:43,406
and these warrants are gonna be

666
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:48,005
-- always overseen.
-- I'm not saying they're gonna be drastically different. But

667
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,449
I think you get into situations where

668
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:55,099
if you're seeing abuse, obvious abuse,

669
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,599
you have an off ramp to start addressing that.

670
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:02,420
But if you get blanket permission past a certain point

671
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,420
that becomes a problem.

672
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:10,219
And that is the way I view this. I think as, as ridiculous as it sounds

673
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:14,189
having that extra step in there. Even if it's going to be rubber stamped.

674
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,510
99.9% of the time,

675
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,869
I think has value for the person who has to file the request

676
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,380
and for the person receiving the request. I think it changes the dynamic just enough

677
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:31,790
that it's going to help avoid like disgusting abuses of power.

678
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,390
So the one comment would be where I think that would actually

679
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,209
help with abuse of power is that it means there's now a

680
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:42,119
record with a different party of what was hacked and gotten into

681
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:42,810
that,

682
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,290
that I will grant you.

683
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,410
I would like to see as part of this law where they just,

684
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,219
if they are going to go into all these other systems,

685
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:53,099
they kind of maybe have to tell a third party some oversight that's external to them,

686
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:53,310
right?

687
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:53,609
Like

688
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:57,119
you don't have law like here in Alberta, we have uh what is it called? Um Aert,

689
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,670
what does it stand for?

690
00:28:59,189 --> 00:29:01,979
Um Alberta serious incident response team?

691
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:05,000
And essentially they investigate when

692
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,300
bad things happen with the police, either to the police or from the police

693
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:09,160
because

694
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,739
as we've learned,

695
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,300
having the police investigate themselves, even if they do a good job,

696
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,540
people sometimes have a hard time believing like that's the thing.

697
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:21,390
It's like, yes, you cannot investigate yourself. It's like the

698
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:26,239
it's like when you have those, like, what, what is it, uh, regulation?

699
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:28,829
That's just no regulation.

700
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,530
-- No, I agree. I agree. There has to be
-- that appearance of fairness.

701
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,069
And so, ok, maybe that's part of the answer here is there has to be

702
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,469
some external sort of third party oversight

703
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,130
and,

704
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,510
and, and the paper trail. Right.

705
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,660
I think the paper trail helps because you can say, oh,

706
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,270
you're supposed to update the warrant with the new IP addresses and yada yada yada.

707
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,510
But the reality is

708
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,300
there that will, that will not happen, right?

709
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,760
I mean, we've all been there where it's like, oh,

710
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,989
I'll do this later and then you never do.

711
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:56,805
You know what I mean?

712
00:29:57,204 --> 00:29:58,744
You start and mapping systems and you're like,

713
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,094
oh what's this weird IP address that leads

714
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:01,555
over here and then there's a VPN connection.

715
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:02,104
You're like bla bla bla

716
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,385
pretty soon you're somewhere in

717
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:05,895
Lord knows where West Germany

718
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:11,515
and, and I think the good guys need process and, and like

719
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:15,140
it takes time there. There's a person I love reading on Mastodon.

720
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,699
Her name is Terry Canfield and she's uh like a constitutional lawyer that,

721
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:19,939
that she teaches and she's been

722
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:22,500
analyzing just like literally everything happening

723
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,969
on the in the world for the last couple of years.

724
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:26,819
I'll put a link to her in the show notes.

725
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:29,619
But like one of the things she says is like, people are always like, oh,

726
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,219
this person needs to be in jail now.

727
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,739
And it's like, that's not how the law works.

728
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,170
-- Like, law takes time.
-- Yeah, that's one thing that always drives me nuts

729
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:42,040
when they're like, oh, this person allegedly did something bad.

730
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,810
They need to be fired or like, or whatever.

731
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:45,839
And it's like they're placed on administrative leave. That's not fair.

732
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:46,329
And it's like,

733
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,890
that's how justice works innocent until proven guilty.

734
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,079
Vigilante justice isn't justice. Right?

735
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:57,420
And, and I think that's one of the things, especially like in this context and again,

736
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,000
the lawmakers probably think, oh, this is great and,

737
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:00,959
but whatever,

738
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,319
all right, I think we need to land this plane.

739
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:06,949
It, it amuses me that we came to the same conclusion at the end. I love that.

740
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:07,640
I just,

741
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:13,170
I don't see any al alternative long term to dealing with this scale and level of stuff

742
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,699
other than to,

743
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,270
yeah,

744
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:16,939
I don't know,

745
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,869
but we do need some oversight. We do need to prevent abuse

746
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,170
a

747
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,150
100%.

748
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,479
-- And
-- so, yeah, but,

749
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,880
and we're clearly never gonna have secure systems. That's just not

750
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:28,589
a

751
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:29,949
-- reality.
-- That's right.

752
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,010
Right.

753
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,800
Like even Apple, like they pushed out that weird emergency, blah, blah dot B patch.

754
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,650
And I'm like, what on earth is this thing? Right.

755
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,229
-- Remember a few weeks ago,
-- did they ever, I, I haven't looked,

756
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:41,729
if they said what that was, we'll have to look that up at some point.

757
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,439
It was a security update. It was a really important security update.

758
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:45,209
That's why they,

759
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:48,709
no, I know that, but they said they were going to tell us what it was

760
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:50,694
later and I don't know if that's ever happened.

761
00:31:50,704 --> 00:31:54,244
But anyway, while Kurt looks it up, he's distracted. So I'm gonna end the podcast.

762
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:55,655
So, thank you, Kurt. Thank you all for listening.

763
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,415
Go to open source security podcast.com. Hit up the show notes.

764
00:31:58,425 --> 00:32:01,454
Suzie Pondo says podcast hashtag hit us up on social media.

765
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:04,895
-- Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day. You
-- too. Thanks everybody.

766
00:32:04,935 --> 00:32:05,905
Thanks everyone.

767
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:06,854
Bye bye.
