Hello and welcome to the Open source Security podcast episode 34 with myself,

1
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:11,170
Kurt Siegfried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,189
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,659
Have you recovered from RS A yet? Kurt?

4
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:19,579
-- I have and I don't think I even got sick from it.
-- I probably got sick.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,739
II, I felt better. I'm nearly recovered, I would say.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,780
But things,

7
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,459
whatever it is what it is.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,649
Yeah.

9
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,610
I ended up accidentally smuggling my giant

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,450
bottle of Purell back through airport security

11
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:34,560
because I forgot it was in my bag and apparently they didn't realize either.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:34,709
Oh,

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,119
wow.

14
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:39,869
I always find it funny when I go through my bags

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,990
and I realize I forgot something that shouldn't go through security.

16
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:43,830
And

17
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:45,189
let's just say,

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,240
I don't think they've ever found any of

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,389
the things I've accidentally smuggled through the airport.

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,549
Well, it's funny because my, my backpack has like this large flat component, uh,

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,709
like, uh, area for like a laptop which I almost never used.

22
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,090
And for some reason I had a wire coat hanger in there for like a, why

23
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:03,709
don't

24
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,069
I, I must have

25
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:08,709
put it in there for some reason.

26
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:09,300
I wonder

27
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:13,790
if a wire coat hanger is on the TS, a approved items list.

28
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,290
Uh, I don't know. But anyway, it was just one of those things where, you know? Yeah.

29
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,849
It's like, why?

30
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,750
Yeah, nobody's, I mean, because they always,

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,959
the funny thing is they almost always pull my bag over

32
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,730
for secondary inspection due to the number of batteries and wires.

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,400
Um, I made the mistake of that tablet you bought for me.

34
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,330
-- I packed it in my suitcase between two books.
-- Why did you do that?

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,690
I mean,

36
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:36,930
-- come on
-- because I didn't want to carry like six electronic devices in my carry on.

37
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,879
I was getting tired.

38
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,500
I had to,

39
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,319
I had to lug my bag all over San

40
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,180
Francisco for the afternoon because I was sightseeing.

41
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,400
You just bring it to the hotel and say, can you watch my bag for me, please?

42
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,239
And they say, yes sir, we would love to.

43
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,559
Oh, no, I did that. This was the anyways. But

44
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,669
so the TS a goons, I'm pretty sure because they put those little, you know,

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,120
the little slip in my bag that said it

46
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,080
was uh inspected or whatever for whatever reason.

47
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,239
And I'm pretty sure that when they repacked it,

48
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,400
that's when they crushed that poor little tablet.

49
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:03,970
That's sad. It was a fun little tablet.

50
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,720
I, yeah, I mean, all I got to do is turn it on and make sure it works and then,

51
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,479
-- then it was killed
-- and it did and you paid me for it.

52
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,639
And so now it's your problem.

53
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,399
-- I don't even feel
-- a little bad

54
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,750
but you know what I love is they destroy the tablet and this tablet is so cheap.

55
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,250
It's not even worth attempting to go through any process to get it.

56
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:21,429
Like,

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,690
reimbursed.

58
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,839
It was 50 bucks. Like it's just,

59
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,949
you know,

60
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,130
I'd be better off going out on the street and begging for money to replace it.

61
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:31,710
That would be a better return on my investment of time.

62
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:32,809
Seriously, man,

63
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,449
I mean, I know exactly what you mean.

64
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,850
There are,

65
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,809
there are numerous things in my life that just don't have enough value for me to care.

66
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,589
And so when it breaks or when I have a problem, I'm like, well,

67
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,990
whatever I want 20 bucks.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,619
That's the way it is.

69
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,110
Yeah. Speaking of which my trip mate doesn't want to talk to USB devices anymore.

70
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:49,750
Uh, trip mate.

71
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:51,699
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,699
Interesting.

73
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,100
So

74
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,869
you plug in a USB thing and it doesn't work.

75
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:58,630
-- It doesn't see
-- it

76
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,630
just buy a new one. They're like 30 bucks.

77
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,419
Exactly.

78
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,479
Well, actually what I want is I want, I want something a little more powerful. Right.

79
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,710
-- Because the wireless speeds through that thing are pretty pathetic.
-- Really?

80
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,580
I've had really good luck. I get, like,

81
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,779
I, I think

82
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,360
last time I checked it when I connect to my

83
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:16,389
home wireless I was pulling more than 20 megabits.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,389
Yeah, that's slow.

85
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,080
Whatever mate. Have you used? Hotel wi

86
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,630
fi

87
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,399
hotel wi

88
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:22,690
fi

89
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,729
in fact,

90
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,080
at

91
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,610
ra I couldn't even use the hotel wifi. It was so unusually bad.

92
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,729
So, thank goodness I had a Wi

93
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,660
Fi in my bag.

94
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,690
-- Yeah,
-- I found that like my connection,

95
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:33,080
you

96
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,690
know, like the VPN would drop every 2 to 3 minutes.

97
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,809
It's terrible. You gotta love it.

98
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,149
It's all part of the fun.

99
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:39,789
That's,

100
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:41,520
you know, I bet.

101
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,360
At a conference. Well, I guess it sort of happened.

102
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:46,059
I read a thing that there were a bunch of, you know,

103
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,240
kind of man in the middle access points at RS A

104
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,059
but I bet if you went to a hotel and, and, and had an A P of, you know,

105
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,320
SS ID of free Fast Wi Fi or something,

106
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,699
you'd probably have more people connecting to that

107
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,000
than you would know what to do with

108
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,770
the trick is you just use something that

109
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,470
people already have connected to like Starbucks,

110
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:02,929
wifi.

111
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,339
-- Yeah,
-- that

112
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,229
too, I suppose.

113
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,399
Yeah,

114
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,850
because most devices are too stupid to check the Mac address of the access point.

115
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,679
Yeah.

116
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,940
Well, and even if you did, you just spoof the Starbucks from down the street.

117
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,399
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

118
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:14,899
Right. You know, and then

119
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:15,070
Apple

120
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,980
and Windows and everything, a lot of log in,

121
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:17,899
you gotta love it.

122
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,798
This, this, although, I mean, this is kind of why

123
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,910
everything,

124
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,859
all of your traffic over the internet needs

125
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,959
to be encrypted because you shouldn't have to care

126
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,079
what kind of access point you're connecting to.

127
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,940
Well, you know,

128
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,380
it just speaks to Google's beyond court security

129
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,089
paper where they said even their internal network,

130
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,420
they, they pretend it's the internet.

131
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:36,619
And,

132
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,570
you know, I've started doing that because I've, I've had to. Right. Because

133
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,709
a great example, you know, my,

134
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,890
my home network has a real nice firewall and it's real nice and secure.

135
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,390
I only have three devices

136
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,470
on my network that generally don't

137
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:51,869
leave the house.

138
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:53,980
You know, and that's my, uh

139
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,209
Mac

140
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:54,510
minis

141
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,760
and my, uh

142
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,959
my Nintendo wii

143
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:01,070
right. Everything else has, tends to wander around the city.

144
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:02,350
Yeah, I know what you mean.

145
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,829
It's, it's terrifying to think about where, where this stuff's been. Right.

146
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,339
Yeah.

147
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,660
-- So,
-- I mean, there, there, you know,

148
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,170
that concept of like your devices live on a nice clean network is dead.

149
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,130
Oh, yeah, it's been, it's been dead for a long time.

150
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,269
Well, not only that you gotta think if, if you have a typical cell phone,

151
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,549
it is connected to the GSM network and your home network at the same time.

152
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,269
Right.

153
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,859
That's, and then again,

154
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,540
that goes because I was thinking of segmenting

155
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,760
my wireless network and having multiple networks and,

156
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:30,730
and I do have multiple networks.

157
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,429
I have like a two gigahertz and five gigahertz

158
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,989
and that's just for, you know,

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,630
just like to keep all the old crappy devices out of the way with the new devices,

160
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,700
-- the two,
-- 2.4 gigahertz doesn't work anymore.

161
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,350
Because there's so much crap on it.

162
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,339
Yeah.

163
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,049
I think basically it's just my smoke alarms and

164
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,190
my bathroom scale are on it at this point.

165
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,149
One of those things are really important and shouldn't lose Wi Fi ever.

166
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,929
Exactly. Well, that's the other reason. Yeah.

167
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,760
Um, but yeah, so, I mean, I know it's just, it's,

168
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,119
but I will say for the Rs A, like on the Expo show floor with, like,

169
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,600
God knows how many people

170
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:06,250
and, you know, vendors and exhibitors and all that other stuff.

171
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,609
Like the Wi Fi worked pretty decently.

172
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:12,140
You know, like you were able to check email, you were able to look at youtube videos.

173
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:13,170
It was, it worked.

174
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:16,730
It was pretty quick considering all the devices spamming the Wi Fi spectrum there.

175
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,390
It,

176
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,709
it was and I will admit that I was guilty to using the

177
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,070
conference Wi Fi at one point when I lost my GSM signal.

178
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:26,869
So

179
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,309
it was functional

180
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,519
again.

181
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:34,010
I just, I have that security posture of like, I'm bathing in a, you know, Ebola virus,

182
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,130
bathing in Ebola virus.

183
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,290
-- That's
-- awesome.

184
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:40,250
You know, if it doesn't kill me, it'll make me stronger or, you know,

185
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,209
my bank account will get cleaned out next week

186
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:47,600
-- or
-- it will slowly kill you. Right. And you'll be homeless and that might kill you. So,

187
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,200
yeah, winter is almost over. It'll be ok.

188
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:51,959
Right.

189
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,730
Yes. Just get on a train and, and hobo your way south. It'll be fine.

190
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,880
That's actually a topic we should do for a podcast. But, um,

191
00:06:59,559 --> 00:06:59,589
so,

192
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:00,880
yeah, yeah,

193
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,899
it's a new movement. But, uh, anyways going back to RS A and so.

194
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,859
-- No,
-- no, no, you can't. No, no, you can't do the, there's a hobo

195
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,959
movement where people are getting on trains and going places.

196
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,040
Yeah. Like, it's like a hipster thing now.

197
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,079
Right.

198
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:17,450
-- So, it's like there was a vice documentary on it. I mean, there's a documentary,
-- I

199
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,000
don't know what to think of that.

200
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,070
I, I have a feeling

201
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:22,959
that

202
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,440
being a hobo

203
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,600
is viewed with a certain amount of nostalgia, like on TV.

204
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:30,920
And in the movies and even in newspapers and what not. But

205
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,369
if I had to guess in reality it's terrible.

206
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,329
And I wonder how many of these people are, like,

207
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,209
beaten to death or robbed or something worse because there are, like,

208
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,910
there are real hobos

209
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,510
and then there's these, like,

210
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,850
spoiled Children who decided to, you know, jump on a train driving past one day and,

211
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,410
and they had no idea what that means.

212
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,609
Wow. Now, but at the same time, part of me wants to, like,

213
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,019
no, I'm not, I'm not investigating.

214
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:02,899
No, I'm not doing it. Goodness. No, I, I'd end up dead behind a train on day two.

215
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,809
I, I'm completely certain of that.

216
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:06,230
No. No, I'm more thinking of.

217
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,290
Ok. Anyway, let's move on because we don't need to get in this.

218
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,350
Yes. RSA, a security conference. I've heard of

219
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,489
So, you know, one, so there's a couple of interesting things I know.

220
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,790
See here, number one,

221
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:20,510
a big Chinese presence on the show floor, there was

222
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:20,720
a

223
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:22,649
not just like providers,

224
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,309
not just like traditional sort of network providers and stuff,

225
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,429
but sort of like these, these technology parks

226
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,190
with representing like 10 or 12 companies, you know.

227
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,349
Um

228
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,890
so yeah, there must have been a total of several dozen

229
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,380
-- Chinese firms represented there.
-- It was big and there was also Korea had an area

230
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:41,590
as

231
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,130
Pavilion

232
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,429
-- Germany always has their Pavilion
-- Germany does,

233
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,090
but I don't remember Korea or China from the past.

234
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,349
So that's very cool.

235
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,630
And um the other thing was, is a couple of the larger ones.

236
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,820
Uh So the way it works at RS A is you have some of these booths when I say booth,

237
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,049
like some of these are 40 by 40 ft with like two stories,

238
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:01,679
right?

239
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,309
So calling it a booth is kind of like calling, you know, a mcmansion like a dwelling.

240
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,190
Um It's factually correct, but nowhere near reality

241
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:11,320
anyway.

242
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,969
So some of these bigger ones actually

243
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,520
explicitly have like little Blockchain areas,

244
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:15,849
you know.

245
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:17,030
So Blockchain is a thing.

246
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:19,690
Um What was interesting to me also was like

247
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,549
the no talk of encrypted email,

248
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,059
barely any talk of like firewalls. Uh I don't, I mean, Arbor

249
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,190
was there and a couple others,

250
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,570
but there wasn't really that much of like sexy ideas or, you know,

251
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,369
intrusion detection or prevention or, you know, whatever.

252
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,929
It's just sort of a given now and now.

253
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,289
And the new hotness by far though, I think you'll agree. Machine learning.

254
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,409
Uh, machine learning was everywhere, man. It is.

255
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,770
It was crazy. And end points are huge.

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,390
That's, that's how things are now.

257
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:54,469
Yeah. No, I, I get it now. The thing, I wonder though quite often is

258
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,510
how many of these endpoint solutions actually work

259
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,229
and how many are selling you a fancy blinky box?

260
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,849
I, you know, that's tough. Right? Because

261
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,989
they, they all do such different things, right? Some of them are just sort of,

262
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,690
you know, basically glorified VPN clients,

263
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,619
really.

264
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,820
Some of them are antivirus. Some of them,

265
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:15,280
you know,

266
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,280
some of them are kind of clever in that they'll try and figure out

267
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,650
like what version of software you're running and if you're too out of date,

268
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,280
it won't let you on the network or through the VPN or whatever,

269
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:22,659
you know.

270
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,210
So that's part of the problem is this,

271
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,989
this whole Endpoint solution thing is such a huge space right now.

272
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,179
That's not well defined

273
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,190
and they all do machine learning.

274
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:30,650
Right.

275
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,570
-- Yes,
-- of course.

276
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh, man,

277
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,650
-- it was.
-- I

278
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:36,760
personally,

279
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,280
I don't think Endpoint security is going to work long term for two simple facts.

280
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:42,409
Number one, bring your own device.

281
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:45,020
People aren't gonna want to load this garbage on the device and let you remote,

282
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,530
wipe it.

283
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,059
And number two,

284
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,520
it doesn't protect against what is a lot of the real problems,

285
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,460
like things like fishing?

286
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:55,809
Right. Phishing will only be solved when there are no more people

287
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,289
actually.

288
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:58,289
Uh, I do know, uh,

289
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:01,619
there's a local government entity and they solve the phishing problem.

290
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,210
Generally.

291
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,320
Uh, you can't access your email or any of their services remotely.

292
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,609
You have to be physically in the office on a terminal.

293
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:08,690
That's not.

294
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,739
-- No,
-- they've gone old school.

295
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,119
That's crazy though. I mean, no organization can operate like that.

296
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,849
-- The government can, well,
-- maybe they even, they even, they can't,

297
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:19,309
let's face it even, they can't.

298
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,450
But even, even if you're internal,

299
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,010
you can still be fish.

300
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:26,109
Well, true. But it's, it's harder to exfiltrate data. Right?

301
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,049
Because you're not checking it from your phone or your laptop at home or whatever.

302
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,950
Maybe, I don't know, man. That, that sounds

303
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:31,570
if

304
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:31,869
you,

305
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:32,510
if you can,

306
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,229
you know, well, it, it's part of, you know, it's just, it simplifies everything,

307
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,700
right.

308
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,140
But

309
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:42,669
it might simplify things. But in a lot of organizations you will

310
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:43,869
decrease

311
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,109
productivity so much.

312
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:50,349
You might as well just fire those people and not refill the positions.

313
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,979
Well, I mean, that's one of the beauties of the government, right?

314
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,440
They, in many cases have a captive market for their services.

315
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,080
Well, I mean, that part is true.

316
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,679
They, they have a monopoly on whatever it is they do in most instances. But

317
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,849
-- I, I cannot agree with that. I,
-- I,

318
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,000
no, my personal take on it is I, I've just like with the cloud security lines, I,

319
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,539
I don't,

320
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,969
I don't even know or really to be honest

321
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:17,000
care what people have is their endpoint devices.

322
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,840
And that's the way the world is heading

323
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,960
and by adopting that security posture. Right.

324
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:26,119
It's just, it, it makes life harder but also easier in many ways.

325
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:29,159
Well, and that's exactly the right way to look at it. Right. Is

326
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,559
when you try to constrict what people can do

327
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,599
by saying you have to come into the office,

328
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,750
you can only check email from these machines.

329
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,520
You have to log in in this way.

330
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:43,330
What you're doing now is you're setting yourself up for failure because

331
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,090
you are expecting a certain use case and let's face it,

332
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,109
the bad guys,

333
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:49,840
they break all the rules

334
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,599
and so they're just,

335
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,530
they're gonna find a way around this and they're gonna

336
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,700
work within the confines of whatever you've set up.

337
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,520
And my guess

338
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,440
is these security people that put all these crazy rules in place,

339
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,299
they're sitting back thinking

340
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,940
everything's ok. You know, it's like that it's a dog commercial or, or the dog comic.

341
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,109
I mean, where it's, this is fine and everything's on fire and,

342
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,640
you know, that's the thing is if you expect hostility,

343
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,989
you're going to be in a better place than the person who

344
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,919
thinks they've solved some of these problems when they really haven't.

345
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,950
Well, it just makes me laugh because they've gone back to a 1999

346
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:25,099
network security. Like we have a strong perimeter, we have firewalls,

347
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,299
we

348
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:28,409
only trusted systems internally. And it's like, uh huh.

349
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:29,969
Right. Let's face it.

350
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,929
Unless you're essentially whitelisting outbound connections,

351
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:34,419
you're wasting your time.

352
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,239
Well, it gets worse than that because for example,

353
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,099
their policy on USB keys and stuff is that you're supposed to encrypt them

354
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:42,390
and if you don't know how to talk to your data protection officer,

355
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,309
-- right. That's totally legit. So
-- there's no actual technical control that

356
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,789
-- enforces that or ensures it.
-- God bless the government,

357
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,010
you know. So

358
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:56,010
yeah, so when I say data ex filtration is harder, it's not,

359
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,409
definitely not impossible.

360
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:57,729
But

361
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,479
yeah.

362
00:13:59,479 --> 00:13:59,969
So,

363
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,150
-- you
-- know, but

364
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,400
no,

365
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,640
it's really what always fascinates me too is like some of

366
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,580
these companies on the show floor like PK Ware was there.

367
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,380
Like I, I had no idea they were still around.

368
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,010
Yes, I, I think I got a pen from them last time I saw them at a show

369
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,239
and

370
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:18,880
who buys that stuff? Like who buys their product?

371
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,799
-- I mean,
-- I assume somebody does or they, I mean, ssh, is there too, right?

372
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:24,820
Like they, they clearly have a business.

373
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:26,619
I think it feeds into that, you know,

374
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,739
that article about FTP security and FTP needs to die is that, you know,

375
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,809
people are still using FTP and, well, I guess the answer is yes, you know,

376
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,400
mainframes and batch processing

377
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,299
-- because who else would be using FTP. Just
-- don't use FTP. Look

378
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,200
the, the answer. And this is for all of you out there.

379
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,210
If you're using FTP today, stop stop now because it sucks.

380
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,500
It's kind of what it comes down to.

381
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,179
Uh, the article you refer to talks about Java and Python

382
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,719
where they, they kind of have the, the firewall crossing FTP issues.

383
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:56,820
And

384
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,940
I mean, this has always been a problem with FTP is FTP.

385
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,869
Historically speaking, way back in the day, kind of used two ports

386
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:07,599
for transferring files and you connect to the server and you

387
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:10,659
give it instructions and then it would essentially connect back to you

388
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,190
and feed you the files,

389
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:14,340
which is crazy to think about

390
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:18,469
well, but it also had capabilities like you could connect to an FTP server

391
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,130
and then tell that server to connect to another

392
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,359
server and move or retrieve the files there,

393
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:23,549
right?

394
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,830
So what you have to remember is FTP was built back in a time where you know,

395
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,640
you were connecting to the server over like

396
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:30,979
300 bod dial up like so

397
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:33,150
300 bod dial up for those of you that don't know,

398
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,940
we're talking about 300 characters per second, not 300 kilobits per second,

399
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,469
not 300 megabits per second,

400
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:42,830
but 300 like A's or B's or C's or D's per second.

401
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,669
It was fantastic, man, you could watch the screen refresh line by line.

402
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,179
Yeah, those were the good old days. Right.

403
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,140
And so FDP was actually pretty clever in that you could use it

404
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:53,099
to

405
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,659
well transfer files, obviously,

406
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:57,599
file transfer protocol and they like over engineered it so that you could

407
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,609
use it to connect to a server and,

408
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,340
-- you know, send files to and from other servers.
-- Right.

409
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:02,739
Right.

410
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:03,489
And then

411
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:04,580
this whole,

412
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,299
because of the way it works,

413
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:10,260
all these firewall people basically built rules

414
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,940
that let FTP function in their environments.

415
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,580
And it's bonkers though how everything works together.

416
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,989
And these firewalls assume

417
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:22,320
that if there's incoming traffic in a certain way,

418
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,590
you're probably running FTP

419
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,989
or, or whatever, you know,

420
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,309
as it pays attention to the connections going in and out and, and it's kind of crazy.

421
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,750
And so,

422
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,599
I mean, I would say if you're a security minded individual, first of all,

423
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:36,289
disable all of the stupid FTP rules on your firewall.

424
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,229
That's like step one, right? Because

425
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,539
whatever you're doing with NAT or even not nat,

426
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,440
the firewall is probably too smart for its own good.

427
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,090
And then additionally, if you have FTP services in house, like just turn them off,

428
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,039
seriously, turn them off, you don't need them.

429
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,320
I was just checking and it's uh I don't know if you remember Dan

430
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,000
Kaminsky,

431
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,119
I'm familiar with Dan.

432
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:55,849
Yeah.

433
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:58,419
So I was just trying to remember cause I remember he did some work on this,

434
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,359
uh basically punching through firewalls using things like FTP.

435
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,910
Uh And his presentation is from 2001

436
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,260
Oh man, that's before he broke the internet. Right.

437
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,170
Yeah.

438
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:08,819
So,

439
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,858
-- no, I, cause I've known, I, you know, this FTP problem, it goes back a way.
-- It's,

440
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,689
it's always been there and it's not a secret.

441
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,229
I mean, the old school people who've been around forever. Yeah.

442
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:20,598
I mean, I remember setting this crap up. It was,

443
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:22,489
I've always hated FTP.

444
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,949
Oh, I remember having to, you know,

445
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,810
I remember the transition in Linux from a state or a stateless firewall to a state

446
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:32,150
full firewall and all of a sudden poof F TB clients worked and it was just,

447
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:32,619
I do

448
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:33,170
remember that.

449
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,790
I mean, that's one of the reasons I despised FTP was because

450
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,969
when you try to use it across firewalls it never worked. Right.

451
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,089
And,

452
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,489
yeah, whatever, I guess,

453
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,609
I guess it's a funny thing is if you're around long enough ago

454
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,109
you avoid FTP because you, you hated it because it never worked.

455
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,810
But, and then it started working and now it's like, oh, crap,

456
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:55,359
turn this stuff off just because you don't need it.

457
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,859
Well, that's what I've noticed in information securities.

458
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,630
We, we, we're doomed to keep

459
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:02,040
learning the lessons of the past

460
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,040
because

461
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,520
we basically had something painful that we made most of the pain go

462
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,829
away and then somebody found a new way to make it painful,

463
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:10,959
-- you know, is really what it boils down to.
-- I know

464
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,280
exactly what you mean.

465
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,260
It's, uh, but, yeah, so,

466
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:15,869
I, you know,

467
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:18,900
Yeah, I know, I agree with you, turn off FTP wherever you can but the reality is,

468
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,890
you know, people have mainframes and stuff and, uh,

469
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,569
they're probably not going to be supporting web devs

470
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,170
or whatever

471
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,760
is, if you have a mainframe and you have to somehow do FTP to it, that's fine.

472
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,069
But then set up like a special dedicated network

473
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,060
just for the mainframe and just for your FTP,

474
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:34,199
like,

475
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,530
people should not be coming in off the

476
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,939
internet connecting to your mainframe via FTP.

477
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,599
Funnily enough that

478
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,469
I know a lot of this

479
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,300
process

480
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:42,989
works, especially with credit card

481
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:43,569
and

482
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,939
don't know, don't, I don't need to know this. Just know

483
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,739
the answer is no. If FDP is your solution,

484
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,750
you clearly do not understand your problem.

485
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,030
-- Well,
-- you asked the wrong question, I

486
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,780
guess maybe I don't know, just

487
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:56,089
no, no more. FTP.

488
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,729
So and

489
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,300
oh, well,

490
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,140
I guess asking the wrong question leads to the

491
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,140
next thing that was really annoying to you.

492
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,880
Which thing, the cryptographer panel from R

493
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:04,209
A,

494
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,010
the cryptographer panel.

495
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:11,199
So I, I will post a link to the proper cryptographer panel session

496
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:12,459
in the show notes.

497
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:13,699
But

498
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,219
there, there's a couple of article here that, that,

499
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:19,180
that pick on two things they talk about and they're,

500
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,180
they're really interesting topics for very different reasons.

501
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,339
And so the first being

502
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,219
that the cryptographers scoff at the idea of law enforcement

503
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:33,489
overcoming encryption and overcome is in quotes in this case,

504
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,180
and so

505
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,219
that's such a loaded word

506
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,550
and it was a very loaded conversation.

507
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,060
And, but here's the problem is these guys basically came to the conclusion of

508
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,880
encryption

509
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,569
experts.

510
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:47,739
Well, well,

511
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,390
they are cryptography experts. All right.

512
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,430
I,

513
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,989
I will not disregard these people for their

514
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,589
contributions to humanity because they have potentially done more

515
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,699
to further progress on the internet than anyone else ever. OK.

516
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:03,699
But here's the deal is

517
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,109
they're saying, oh,

518
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,709
we don't have to worry about law enforcement because crypto is

519
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:11,310
coming from all over the world and these algorithms already exist.

520
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,229
And if, if the USA

521
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,550
tries to put in backdoors or whatever, then,

522
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,390
you know, they'll, they'll lose all their business and blah, blah, blah, blah,

523
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,589
blah.

524
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,010
You know, the thing is they're not wrong,

525
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,109
OK? These guys aren't wrong,

526
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,910
but the bigger problem I see is that many of

527
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,650
the people in a position to define this policy,

528
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:36,109
they don't know what they're talking about and nobody,

529
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,430
and I guess here, here's the issue is the people who understand,

530
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,569
aren't being heard by them.

531
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:46,719
-- Now,
-- when you say the people who understand, I see to me what it boils down to is we're,

532
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:49,599
we're actually looking at cryptography through two different realities.

533
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,020
One is a technical reality

534
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,439
and the other one is a government law making policy reality.

535
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:55,339
And so these

536
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,209
two things can be totally different.

537
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:58,290
Well, well, they are,

538
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,099
they are totally different and this is exactly where I was going with,

539
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,290
this is the fact that

540
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,859
the people who understand the problems don't use the words,

541
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,689
the policymakers understand.

542
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,650
And so

543
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,250
they're gonna listen to someone that makes sense.

544
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,410
And in most instances,

545
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,170
I think the people who make sense have some sort of alternative agenda.

546
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:19,560
And

547
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,670
so they talk about things like, oh, let's backdoor encryption.

548
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,560
But the reality is

549
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,439
that would be a massive problem

550
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:33,199
and, and let's face it if you know that a US firm is shipping backdoor encryption,

551
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,689
nobody outside the US is going to buy those products.

552
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:37,680
Right.

553
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,510
Well, that's,

554
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,420
that's assuming it isn't actually actively

555
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,449
made illegal in these foreign countries.

556
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,099
I mean,

557
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:44,729
no offense.

558
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,250
But if China was shipping back door cryptography, I'm pretty sure the FTC or the

559
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:49,599
man

560
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,410
-- would have something to say about that.
-- They flip out.

561
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:57,260
Well, not only that, here's, the other issue is the people who are,

562
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:59,130
will say being targeted

563
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,569
by law enforcement here,

564
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,939
they're gonna know how to get around this stuff because

565
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,420
you're not gonna use a backdoor product.

566
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,449
I mean, yeah, you're gonna catch a bunch of idiot criminals,

567
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:10,099
which is kind of how it always works.

568
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,180
But anyone with a clue is just going to, you know, like download

569
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,500
this, this pains me to say, but you know, like download P GP or GP G off the internet,

570
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,020
right?

571
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,439
As crappy as it is. It's not backdoor. Well, that we know of.

572
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:23,780
Yeah.

573
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,020
Well, and, and there was that famous quote, you know,

574
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,479
from that NSA slide basically saying that they love,

575
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:31,550
you know, people who use P GP because they stand out.

576
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:32,400
Right.

577
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:33,449
Right. I mean,

578
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:33,849
the,

579
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,800
you know, I mean, that's one of the things I like about signal is, you know,

580
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,719
lots of people are using signal, normal people are using signal,

581
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:43,880
normal people do not use GP G end of story,

582
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:44,839
you know, and,

583
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:47,760
and the reality is that metadata piece is far more

584
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,750
interesting in many cases than the actual content of the message

585
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:52,020
metadata

586
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,599
doesn't matter, didn't you hear?

587
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,640
Oh, right. Yeah. Ok.

588
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,880
So you'll just uh

589
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,119
so I'm sure every elected official will just be

590
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,079
sending us a copy of their cell phone billing

591
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,959
with the uh minute by minute, you know, who's making phone calls to and from them.

592
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:05,300
I'm sure

593
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,520
that'll happen.

594
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,750
Um I know, man,

595
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,689
you know, I'm, well, it's like that thing on Facebook, right?

596
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,989
Based on like what is it like 20 or 30 likes.

597
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,949
They can basically tell if you know what your sexual orientation is

598
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,650
statistically.

599
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,510
Well, I'm pretty sure, you know,

600
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,630
given somebody's monthly cell phone bill and location data, you could,

601
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,430
you could probably, well, I mean,

602
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:27,060
you could identify them personally without too much trouble based on, you know,

603
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:28,709
where their phone sleeps for eight hours a day.

604
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:29,030
But

605
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,310
even without that, you know, I'm pretty sure based on these things, you could,

606
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,219
you could probably,

607
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:34,319
you know,

608
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:37,410
bucket a person demographically without too much trouble.

609
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:40,469
Oh, without a doubt I have, I have no doubt of that.

610
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:43,000
So, so anyway, but back to the topic is

611
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:44,969
so, so the crypto people,

612
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:48,449
uh, they doubt law enforcement can overcome encryption

613
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,650
being

614
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,089
there.

615
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:50,369
They,

616
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,060
they don't think the concept of a back door will ever

617
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:56,150
become a reality because of the technical things they know.

618
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:58,599
And I think

619
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:02,810
the idea of a back door terrifies me because of the technical things.

620
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,880
The policymakers don't know

621
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,380
and I don't know how this can be bridged where you need

622
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,959
to get policymakers talking to the technical people who understand this.

623
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:14,140
But on the other side,

624
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,319
you need these technical people

625
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,869
not to get buried in the weeds.

626
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:23,260
See, the, I think part of the challenge is, is cryptography is such a fundamentally

627
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,510
different technology than previous security technologies like say,

628
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:28,760
uh well, because where,

629
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,709
where people keep going back to is comparing encryption to like locks and safes,

630
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,790
right?

631
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,849
And, and no, but that's fundamentally what they keep doing

632
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,010
and that is wrong.

633
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,060
Well, it is, but we're hairless monkeys and we need things we understand,

634
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,060
we understand

635
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:44,430
locks and

636
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:44,939
safes.

637
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,760
Exactly.

638
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,660
And like a lock in a safe, like no matter how good a lock or a safe you build, give me,

639
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:50,839
you know,

640
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,780
the right drilling equipment or cutting equipment and

641
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,459
I'll eventually get in right end of story.

642
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:58,130
Um, you know, no matter how many booby traps,

643
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,530
no matter how many crazy things you do with it.

644
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:02,119
Uh Well, that's not true.

645
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,300
Actually there was that case where that, remember that guy built a bomb,

646
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,069
put it in a casino, held them, you know, for ransom.

647
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,209
And then, uh, the FBI, you know, was like, well, we can't diffuse this thing.

648
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,069
So good luck,

649
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,540
you know, we're just going to evacuate the building. Right. And then the,

650
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,150
yeah, but, uh, fundamentally, you know, cryptography doesn't work that way,

651
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,270
especially when you start combining it with, you know, chip

652
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,589
uh hardware, like,

653
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,510
you know, like the apple chips with their trust store

654
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:29,609
where, you know, long term, I, I assume they're going to move to a model of like,

655
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:29,750
you know,

656
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,250
the the crypto key is buried in the

657
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,780
silicon that's really hard to physically extract.

658
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,910
And if you talk to it and get it wrong 10 times, you know, it commits suicide

659
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,739
basically, right? Digital suicide.

660
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,500
And it's not like you can easily copy this chip like you can a hard drive.

661
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,760
So we're,

662
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,479
we're actually now approaching the point where I can

663
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:50,280
build essentially a machine based on math and hardware

664
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:53,150
that you can't break into reasonably,

665
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:57,030
you know, short of some sort of magic chip cloning technology.

666
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,099
So you can brute force it

667
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:04,560
or, you know, something along like essentially the hand wavy magic lines of attack

668
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,150
and you know it, and that's something hard for people to understand.

669
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,640
It's like, literally, I can build

670
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:11,380
this thing and it,

671
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,319
if it's done correctly.

672
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,229
It cannot be compromised,

673
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,630
full stop.

674
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,719
I mean, fundamentally, yes,

675
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,439
that, that is correct.

676
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,109
I mean, we have an entire FS

677
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,599
140 certification based around this whole premise.

678
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,390
Right? Tamper evident, tamper resistant tamper proof,

679
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,439
you know, 1 40.12 and three, I think

680
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,959
so. And, and those standards are, what decades old at this point?

681
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:39,150
Well, they, they keep updating though.

682
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,589
Well, no, what I mean is that this is not a new idea,

683
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,739
this is something the US government itself came

684
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,449
out with and officially documented and made a standard

685
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,910
for the stuff they want to use. That is correct.

686
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:53,459
So that, that, that's what I mean is these policymakers, it's kind of like guys,

687
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:57,109
you know, a bunch of other policymakers made these laws like decades ago

688
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:01,140
that basically, you know, are shooting to do exactly what you want to do.

689
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,829
That's the thing is

690
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,310
these aren't really laws, they're,

691
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:09,390
they're standards that were arrived to by technical smart people.

692
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:10,369
Yeah.

693
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,579
But I mean, essentially that policy wasn't, you know, there,

694
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:16,920
there's this intended policy of building devices that can't be compromised.

695
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,719
Yes, that's fair. That's fair.

696
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,180
It's man.

697
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,489
And I guess the other part of it though too,

698
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,140
and the thing I always think of that isn't well

699
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,420
understood and may never be well understood is the fact that

700
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,540
in modern crypto

701
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,680
they never break the crypto,

702
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,550
they always find an alternative means to gain the data they need.

703
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,469
And this always, I mean,

704
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:41,900
I kind of always bring this back to World War Two when you think about,

705
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,939
you know, the, the good guys breaking the,

706
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:47,660
the secret code of the bad guys and then because of it, we won the war or whatever.

707
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:48,729
And

708
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,119
that made sense back then because

709
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:55,520
there wasn't good peer review of this crypto

710
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,280
crypto.

711
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,280
The enigma was based on, was, was fatally flawed,

712
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,520
-- flawed.
-- Exactly.

713
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:00,969
-- And,
-- and,

714
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,819
and what's funny is the US tidied up those flaws

715
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:04,550
and then used that crypto for 10 or 20 years,

716
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,229
right?

717
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,439
And this is the thing, right?

718
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:08,760
This is the beauty of most of the crypto we use

719
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,030
today is it's been peer reviewed in the public space.

720
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,339
So we understand what it's good at.

721
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:18,800
We understand what it's bad at and there's always research happening

722
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:19,560
to

723
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,430
decide if something is still good enough.

724
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:26,770
And additionally, to find the new things that are going to bring us to the next place

725
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:31,079
and that's really powerful. And additionally, I mean, adding a back door

726
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,160
man, back doors don't work. I mean, that's the reality of it.

727
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,579
The problem with backdoors is depending on how you do it.

728
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:40,520
Fundamentally, you either have like a universal key which is going to leak

729
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,810
or you have like

730
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:43,939
or you have like per device or per session keys,

731
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:45,099
which now means you're into the whole

732
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,739
whole mess of credential and authentication management,

733
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,500
which let's face it if we could do that.

734
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,770
Well, we could also do like identity management.

735
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,030
Well,

736
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,280
and everybody would have a correct identification and we would

737
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,040
know who everybody is and we're certainly not there.

738
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,630
No, not at all. Not at all.

739
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,579
I mean, the only way to do this is to essentially weaken the crypto

740
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,579
at which point it means the, the bad guys

741
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:09,140
gain the same benefits.

742
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,380
We would have

743
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:11,540
already

744
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:12,290
happened with

745
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:17,630
the tools I believe it was the, the tools of the technique the FBI used for that.

746
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,699
Um I want to say, was it San Bernardino shooter?

747
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:20,910
Uh Many

748
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,510
months

749
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:21,989
ago,

750
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,500
that was the,

751
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,439
what was the name of that company?

752
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:25,979
Uh

753
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,939
-- uh
-- Anyways, apparently those, those tools and stuff leaked.

754
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,010
-- They
-- did because they, well, it,

755
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,319
it got out who helped them and then obviously

756
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:35,869
that company got attacked and is it celebrate,

757
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,260
maybe

758
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:36,979
celebrate

759
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,030
tool

760
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,479
and then someone hacked them and release the tools.

761
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,819
And not only that, look at all the NSA dumps, I mean,

762
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,140
these are organizations that are supposedly the best of

763
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,569
the best and they can't keep their stuff secret.

764
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,400
So,

765
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,359
how on earth are you going to keep a secret? Key secret?

766
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,010
Right.

767
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,020
-- No way. Just it,
-- especially

768
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,739
-- when you intend to use it on a constant basis.
-- Exactly.

769
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:02,079
It's just, it is an impossible

770
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:05,400
problem. And this kind of also comes back to the idea of

771
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:10,359
law enforcement has other means to accomplish the things they need to do.

772
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:12,949
-- It's not just about, it's
-- actually easier than that.

773
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,650
It's, for example, the UK Rip Act.

774
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,959
If you don't give up your passwords, they just chuck you in jail.

775
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,040
Problem solved.

776
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,109
No, like, really? Right. Like if, you know,

777
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:25,709
if you're, if, if they think you're a bad guy and they have, you know, reasonable,

778
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,890
you know, assumption for that

779
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,709
in most jurisdictions now, if you're not willing to play ball with them,

780
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,670
they just chuck you in jail for hindering.

781
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,510
I'm not going to get into the, the politics of that decision.

782
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,579
Well, no,

783
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:38,250
but what I'm pointing out is that even if you

784
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,900
have good crypto and refuse to give up the password,

785
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,859
they can, you know that that's not going to prevent, you know,

786
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:45,010
it's all these people that are like, oh ha ha ha,

787
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,000
I will clean my device and walk across the border and if they try and search it,

788
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,760
they will find nothing ha ha ha I will outsmart them and it's like,

789
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,140
no, they can just bounce you out of the border for any reason. They feel

790
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:55,719
like that. You know what I mean? Like

791
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,239
that's

792
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:57,689
true.

793
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,459
Don't, but you can't mock those people because it's one thing to,

794
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,020
for example, go through airport security

795
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:09,619
with, with, we'll say normal gear. And it's another if you have like a switch for,

796
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,430
are we talking about airport security? Are we talking about,

797
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,609
I'm just using airport security as my example,

798
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,359
right? Like

799
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:20,670
you can make good decisions that will lower your odds of getting in trouble.

800
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,910
And I, I think that's, that's a difference. Right.

801
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,339
Is people need to understand that cleaning your gear

802
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:26,910
at a border crossing.

803
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:31,430
If you're up to no good, like, you're probably still gonna get in trouble. Right.

804
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:32,069
Whether you have the

805
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,349
right.

806
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,500
But if you,

807
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,869
it's another thing to also just, you know,

808
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,770
make sure you're not carrying that switchblade through security because if they

809
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,260
look for it and they find it now they're gonna be like,

810
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,300
what are you doing?

811
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,349
It's like, yeah, I use this to clean my toenails, you know, and like,

812
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,619
they're not gonna believe you.

813
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:49,839
Yeah. Well,

814
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,109
the analogy kind of breaks down because, you know, social media passwords,

815
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,760
for example, right?

816
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,680
You don't necessarily carry those with you, like,

817
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:57,189
you don't carry your Facebook account with

818
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,920
you because it's what's a Facebook account.

819
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:05,140
And that's another crazy political problem that I have no intention of addressing

820
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:10,069
my, my view on it is, uh, historically speaking, the majority of the world, you know,

821
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,109
when you go and try and enter their country,

822
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,630
they have the legal right to search you and your person

823
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,750
and your baggage and belongings.

824
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:19,719
And I, I can see definitely that, you know,

825
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:20,420
um,

826
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,050
for example, when I've entered the US, when I was younger, they would ask, you know,

827
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,650
they would want to make sure I had enough money

828
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:28,109
and I'd be like, well, I have a credit card and they're like, oh, ok.

829
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:28,869
You know?

830
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:29,369
Right.

831
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:29,569
But,

832
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,800
but they basically want to make sure I don't become like destitute

833
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,260
in a word of the state and cost the US taxpayer money.

834
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,130
And, you know,

835
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,449
that makes sense.

836
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:41,209
So, you know, at what point, where do we draw that line? Social media, do we? You know?

837
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,010
Um,

838
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,439
and that's, you know, and so historically, legally they've had,

839
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:48,010
the president has been said that they can search through all this stuff.

840
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,689
And so that's,

841
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:49,989
that's the reality of it.

842
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,290
And if you don't want to play ball with them, then you don't get to enter the country,

843
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,530
you know, it's, it's because it's a privilege, not a right.

844
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,849
So I think fundamentally what it comes down to is that

845
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,449
existing law

846
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:03,050
hasn't kept up with reality.

847
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,439
And so

848
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,329
you look at the people on the front lines,

849
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:10,489
people like your border patrol and your law enforcement and, and whoever else

850
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:13,849
they will use whatever tool they can

851
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,130
to do the best job they think they can do.

852
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:20,479
Right. But it's also up to policymakers

853
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:25,219
to rein them in a little bit and make sure they aren't doing things that are,

854
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,369
we'll say willfully dangerous to a free functional society.

855
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,430
-- And I think we're at a point
-- now,

856
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,339
news for you

857
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:35,400
go read Bill C 23.

858
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,380
But it essentially, it,

859
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,439
so in, in one of the nice things about Canada us, right?

860
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:42,739
Is we have a long standing cozy relationship.

861
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,020
So, for example, when I fly from Canada to the U si clear US customs in Canada. Right.

862
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,599
There's eight major airports that have this,

863
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:50,290
I've done that before.

864
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,199
And so it's, it's lovely. Right, because you clear customs here in Canada.

865
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,829
And that means you can fly like some tiny little regional

866
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,770
air jet or whatever to like anywhere in the US,

867
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,739
you know, so you can fly to airports that don't have customs and immigration,

868
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,359
which is awesome.

869
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:04,359
It's way more efficient,

870
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,149
but I don't have to worry about leaving like six hours between connections.

871
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,659
Exactly. Who knows what customs is like?

872
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,260
So anyways, they're, they're looking at passing a bill C 23. Um

873
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,780
that would essentially give us border,

874
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,659
immigration controls more rights in Canada, including, you know, for example,

875
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,020
they could um arrest

876
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,610
people in Canada

877
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:28,799
like you're physically in Canada, but you're not

878
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:31,878
legally jurisdictionally speaking in Canada,

879
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:33,559
when you're clearing us customs here,

880
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,739
it becomes one of those quasi

881
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:37,947
constitution free airport

882
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:38,947
wonky zones,

883
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:42,428
you know, where it's, it's just, it's not clear what's going on.

884
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:45,248
Um Traditionally we've had the right in Canada if

885
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:47,428
I don't like how things are going with the,

886
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:48,467
the, the immigrations,

887
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:49,947
I can leave

888
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,850
like, and, and just say like, you know what, this is not going well,

889
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,909
I don't want to answer your questions.

890
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:56,810
I would like to leave now. Interesting

891
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,209
and that right will potentially be going away with this new bill.

892
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:03,100
And it's also murky at what point does the US, for example,

893
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,530
what point do their questions become lawful orders?

894
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,709
Right? Like sir, please stay, please answer my question,

895
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:09,780
you know. And

896
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:14,429
so, you know, we, you want to talk about these things getting just messy and weird.

897
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:18,629
I mean, now we're talking about not just legalities but like cross jurisdiction,

898
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,229
legalities between countries.

899
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:22,350
That's crazy, man,

900
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,310
you know.

901
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,000
Um but fundamentally what I and I hate to say this but generally speaking, you know,

902
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,060
if you're a good guy, you probably won't get hassled that much.

903
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:33,689
The flip side being is what is the definition of a good guy?

904
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:34,889
I know.

905
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:40,800
And so let's actually let's tie that statement right there into the next thing

906
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:44,810
that gave me Harper from this cryptographer's panel is right is

907
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:46,439
they basically said they,

908
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:51,495
they disregarded the importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning

909
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:55,784
in terms of security. And that right there. I was like, holy cow guys. Like

910
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:56,475
what?

911
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:57,574
Just

912
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,625
stop talking, you know, don't,

913
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:02,885
don't talk anymore because now there's two sides to this.

914
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:04,235
All right. So number one is

915
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:08,905
there are organizations that are claiming A I and machine learning

916
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:10,264
will save the world

917
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,939
and they will solve any problem you have.

918
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,290
It's a bit like uh

919
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,219
the joke I heard at RS A was that there's machine learning washing

920
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,429
where it used to be cloud washing back in the day right now.

921
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:24,060
Everyone's oh, we're machine learning, you know, we run Grep or whatever in,

922
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,659
in my tool.

923
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,739
But the thing is, here's the thing,

924
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:31,590
if you look at kind of all of the A I research happening

925
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,709
on the edge on the fringe today,

926
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:37,290
it is crazy, amazing stuff.

927
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:40,330
And I think to disregard that

928
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:47,350
as not being a big deal, especially for security is very dangerous. And I think

929
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,600
this is one of those instances where these guys

930
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,419
should have been smart enough to either say,

931
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,610
you know, I don't know or

932
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,520
let's talk to someone who does,

933
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:56,179
you know,

934
00:36:56,189 --> 00:37:00,979
-- it
-- really reminds me of sort of the whole prior to the.com boom in the web taking off,

935
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:03,459
you know, that period 9598 where,

936
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,570
yeah, a lot of people didn't really think the web was going to amount to much.

937
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,229
And it was pretty clear to me that like, no, this is like, wow, this is amazing

938
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,550
and it was even,

939
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,129
it was even way more cool and important than I could have ever imagined.

940
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,750
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And you know.

941
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:20,770
Right. Well, I mean, look at, look at Microsoft. Right.

942
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,889
They did, I mean, so funny enough, uh Bill gates' book,

943
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,909
uh the Road ahead is it? I think

944
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,270
I have a first edition copy of it

945
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:29,239
and

946
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:30,199
they,

947
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:33,520
they actually got rid of most of the first editions because in it,

948
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,290
there's a whole chapter where Bill Gates basically

949
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,010
disregards the importance of the internet and talks about

950
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,719
like these private networks people are creating

951
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,570
and I, I loved reading it.

952
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,919
And I remember II, I bought it after,

953
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:45,750
uh,

954
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:48,439
kind of Windows 95 and everything went crazy.

955
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,010
And I remember reading this thinking, like this guy could not have got it more wrong.

956
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,310
I mean, just completely wrong. But that, that's part of the trick, right? Is

957
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,969
when you have someone who kind of got to where they are in a certain way,

958
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:03,590
they will oftentimes struggle to deal with the new.

959
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:05,689
-- So paradigm
-- shifts are tough.

960
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:08,010
I mean, it's not even that you don't understand the paradigm shift.

961
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,429
It's that this is a fundamentally new reality. Right. Exactly.

962
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,830
Like, when I talk to people, I'm like,

963
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,479
my concern is not that 50% of people will be unemployed in 30 years because of a, I's,

964
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,790
it's that 50% of people will be unemployable

965
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,270
and

966
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,110
a lot of them don't get it.

967
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:29,330
Well, and a lot of them don't understand. They're like, what do you mean? I'm like,

968
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,330
they will not be able to get a job like the, the value out of that human being

969
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,689
will be insufficient.

970
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,409
It, the, you know, unless they get, like,

971
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:41,709
you will have to have some very niche specialty or whatever,

972
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:42,229
you know,

973
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,189
something that machines are bad at or that we

974
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:47,070
don't allow machines to do for policy or whatever,

975
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:48,229
you know, that

976
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,270
humans can do. Right. And a

977
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:53,100
lot of these people don't think that's the case.

978
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,669
They think, you know, white collar, like selling houses.

979
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,679
Oh, you know, you need a real estate agent. Well, have you heard of com Free?

980
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,219
I hate dealing with real estate agents.

981
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:02,659
Yeah. You know,

982
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,979
like car sales, like, why, why is car sales the way it is?

983
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:09,090
-- Why am I not doing this on Amazon?
-- I agree with you 100%.

984
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,820
I just bought a car and it was just like, oh, this sucks.

985
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,340
I don't want to deal with these people.

986
00:39:13,649 --> 00:39:17,229
So, I mean, that's, that's what gets me is these paradigm shifts. You know, even I

987
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:19,790
acknowledge this paradigm shift, but fundamentally,

988
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,790
I don't understand what 50% unemployability means.

989
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,070
Well, none of us do. We have no idea. And,

990
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,649
and let's

991
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,510
even if we ignore that

992
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,360
and we just think about artificial intelligence in the context of security,

993
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,850
you think about how much security do we do today

994
00:39:36,129 --> 00:39:38,939
is the problem is really people are slow

995
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:40,399
more than anything.

996
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:44,280
And here's an example is aunt at defcon last year.

997
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:45,909
Uh DARPA,

998
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:51,340
they funded this program where they basically had a bunch of a is

999
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,739
fighting each other like playing big capture the flag where you had defenders,

1000
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,159
you had Attackers and, and they

1001
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:56,739
remember that

1002
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:57,770
and

1003
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:02,659
it was amazing to read about what these things were doing. I mean, you had

1004
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,379
like a defender would essentially new malware would come in.

1005
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:06,939
We do a quick analysis of the malware,

1006
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,320
understand what's going on and then block that attack

1007
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,050
like

1008
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,750
this, this would happen in like a second or less.

1009
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,840
And you think, how long would it take a human to do that months?

1010
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,050
Maybe, like if, if you're good, it might take you a month.

1011
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,250
I mean, you gotta think about stuff like that and,

1012
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,409
and no additionally on the other side, you have Attackers, obviously, you know,

1013
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:30,199
finding and creating new flaws faster than any human could possibly hope to do it.

1014
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,090
And

1015
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,560
like this is what's terrifying about this stuff is

1016
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,530
you could conceivably have machines.

1017
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,209
I mean, it's kind of like high frequency trading in the stock market, right,

1018
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:42,929
where you have machines, making more decisions in a second

1019
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,770
than a human could make in a lifetime.

1020
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,209
And it's the same deal with security is

1021
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:51,729
once these a is breach a certain point,

1022
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,090
we will be unable to deal with them because they

1023
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,899
will be so far past the realm of human understanding.

1024
00:40:58,909 --> 00:40:59,489
And it's,

1025
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:02,260
it's kind of terrifying to be quite honest with you.

1026
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,500
And I don't want to turn into like, you know, this is the future of our,

1027
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,010
our dystopian A I.

1028
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:11,610
But like this is something to think about in the context of security. And I think,

1029
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:12,270
you know,

1030
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,959
a bunch of old cryptographers trying to blow this off is not the right

1031
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:19,139
message to be sending the right message is we need to pay attention to this

1032
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:22,479
and we need to have a clue of what's going on here because if you don't,

1033
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,469
there's going to be trouble

1034
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,040
unquestionably

1035
00:41:26,379 --> 00:41:27,719
totally. I mean, it's like cloud, right?

1036
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:32,149
Cloud is economically more efficient than all the previous systems.

1037
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,760
Therefore, it will win

1038
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:35,370
because if you don't do cloud,

1039
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:37,169
somebody else will do cloud and be more

1040
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:38,939
efficient than you and they will eat your lunch

1041
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,580
and the same will happen with machine learning and

1042
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,120
A I and Blockchain and a bunch of other technologies

1043
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:46,780
whether or not you think these are good or bad or stupid,

1044
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:48,699
somebody else will find a way to make it work.

1045
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,689
Like, look at the social networks, right? I, I

1046
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:54,040
remember when I first saw Amazon and I was like, oh, so they sell books on

1047
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:55,554
and they lose money doing it. That's,

1048
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:59,774
and now I buy like all my dental floss and toothbrushes and like,

1049
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:04,044
what did I just buy um Children, you know, I basically buy everything.

1050
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:06,804
I actually have a policy now of Amazon first

1051
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:07,715
and I will

1052
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:07,864
go

1053
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:12,104
well for food and stuff, but like basically for,

1054
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,495
-- for anything that is not clothes or
-- food,

1055
00:42:16,264 --> 00:42:16,645
right?

1056
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:17,774
They do.

1057
00:42:17,784 --> 00:42:22,215
But like, it's way overpriced and you know, getting so like eggs and milk and bread,

1058
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:23,485
you know, I need to go to the store for that.

1059
00:42:23,495 --> 00:42:23,895
Still.

1060
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,330
Can I order eggs from Amazon? I should look into this. That could be fun to do.

1061
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:29,340
Yeah.

1062
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,300
Um but yeah, so I mean,

1063
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:32,100
you know, it's just

1064
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,040
that, yeah,

1065
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,459
the reality is people are going to figure out how to use machine learning or A I

1066
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,179
and the companies that don't are gonna get clobbered,

1067
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:41,060
especially in the security world. Right?

1068
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,030
Like Amazon buying Harvest dot IO to make security decisions about, you know,

1069
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,360
this person doing this is safe, this person doing this.

1070
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,510
Well, that's an attacker

1071
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,010
there.

1072
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,209
Yeah, humans are physically incapable of doing that,

1073
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:54,050
let alone doing it cost effectively.

1074
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,929
Yeah. Ok. That's, you know, I'll agree with that because

1075
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,050
there are people who read log files for a living

1076
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:02,949
and

1077
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,360
I can't imagine a worse job. I'm sorry.

1078
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,469
-- One event, a 2nd, 10 events a second,
-- not only after like five minutes,

1079
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:13,739
are you actually paying attention? Actually?

1080
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,270
You know what's really funny is I just saw a news story the other day

1081
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,169
where

1082
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:21,939
apparently Ford is skipping over the uh self driving car

1083
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:24,639
stage where you have an engineer sitting behind the wheel,

1084
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:28,159
like ready to take over because their engineers kept falling asleep because

1085
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:29,899
they were so bored.

1086
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,639
Well, see, and this is my concern is

1087
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,459
like we've,

1088
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:34,889
I watch a lot of airline disaster documentaries and this is one

1089
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:37,780
of the biggest problems with airline automation is they're not 100% automated.

1090
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,760
So you still have the, the cases where the people have to interact and do stuff

1091
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:43,780
and you end up with situations like those self

1092
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:47,550
green pilots flying their plane into San Francisco Airport,

1093
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,639
like into the,

1094
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,370
into the side of the um, the embankment

1095
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,439
because they just came in too low. Oops,

1096
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,360
you know,

1097
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,320
um, or like this other case where they just, um,

1098
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:03,949
they flew into the side of a hill and it's the cockpit voice recorder recorded.

1099
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,879
The first officer, like, basically saying, I think we're doing this wrong.

1100
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:10,709
I think we're pointed at the hill and the first or the pilots, like, no, we'll be fine,

1101
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:15,739
you know, and then, like, yeah, they, you know, like four survivors or whatever.

1102
00:44:15,959 --> 00:44:19,590
And, and so I think with self driving cars we have to,

1103
00:44:19,939 --> 00:44:22,570
it's either all or nothing because anything in the middle.

1104
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,590
Yeah, people are gonna zone out and read the paper.

1105
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:27,120
Yeah, I, I agree. I agree completely.

1106
00:44:27,129 --> 00:44:31,419
And I think the, the sooner we stop letting people do stuff like this the better.

1107
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,810
And, you know, that's one of the funny things too is people say to me, oh,

1108
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,600
do you trust a computer to fly the plane?

1109
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:43,209
I'm like, well, it already does. But yes, I do more than the human that does it today

1110
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:46,629
because, like, oh, we should put a link to that traffic court guy.

1111
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,449
The traffic court guy.

1112
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:48,560
Oh,

1113
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:48,699
you

1114
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,040
mean the

1115
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:49,989
people

1116
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,310
out of traffic tickets?

1117
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,689
No, no, no, no, no, no. The New Jersey judge.

1118
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,879
So this guy, uh, it's a New Jersey judge,

1119
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,439
um,

1120
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:04,209
and he does traffic court and it's like, um,

1121
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:05,709
he, you know, he's like, ok,

1122
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,949
so you're charged with running a red light and the guy's like, no, I didn't.

1123
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:12,250
And the judge is like, ok, can we please, you know, have evidence clip number? 27436.

1124
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,600
Can you play it? Thanks.

1125
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,669
And they play a clip from the red light camera of

1126
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,760
like this guy in a car driving through a red light

1127
00:45:17,909 --> 00:45:19,290
and the human is like, oh,

1128
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,250
I didn't see the red light

1129
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,939
or, you know, some, you know what I mean?

1130
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:25,080
Like,

1131
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:28,479
and it's like every time people bring up like self driving cars and trusting them,

1132
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:29,100
I'm, like,

1133
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,590
go check how many, like, red light tickets were issued, you know? I mean,

1134
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:33,290
yeah,

1135
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:37,590
and I've, I've actually seen it, like, I was driving once, uh, here on Stony and

1136
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:41,679
I saw the red light camera go off on 1/70 and then it was like, two blocks in front of me.

1137
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:44,750
And then by the time I got there there was a minivan on its side and another car,

1138
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,750
you know, off in the weeds,

1139
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:49,659
you know, like, it's like, oh, awesome. You know, like

1140
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:54,179
people run red lights and kill each other, you know, like,

1141
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:55,449
people

1142
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,689
somehow don't trust machines.

1143
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,510
I know

1144
00:45:58,689 --> 00:45:58,750
what

1145
00:45:58,979 --> 00:45:59,149
I mean. I know

1146
00:45:59,300 --> 00:45:59,979
exactly. Well,

1147
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:00,820
it's,

1148
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,729
people are afraid of new and interesting and the same thing with the A I,

1149
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:05,500
people are afraid of giving up control.

1150
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:07,179
That that's a big part of it.

1151
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:07,850
And,

1152
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:09,320
but all of this, you know,

1153
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,320
you're mentioning 50% of the population of the unemployable.

1154
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,830
And we're saying we need to pay attention to a I with security and

1155
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,060
there is the self driving vehicles now that are kind of becoming a thing.

1156
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:19,479
And

1157
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:22,699
the other thing that will be really interesting about all this is

1158
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:26,419
there are going to be unintended consequences to all of this technology.

1159
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:27,399
An example being

1160
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:31,760
they expect self driving cars will decimate the auto insurance industry.

1161
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,800
And how many municipalities make a significant

1162
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,899
amount of their income off of traffic violations

1163
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,350
or what about organ donation is another one, most organ donors were in

1164
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,790
auto fatalities.

1165
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,429
And so you think about there's all these things you can't imagine. No, no.

1166
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:49,989
Granted, I'm not saying that

1167
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,270
less people dying in car crashes is a bad thing, right? Because

1168
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,149
without question,

1169
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:59,429
less organ donors is a a fundamentally good thing for society because it was

1170
00:47:00,229 --> 00:47:00,250
on

1171
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,449
car crashes,

1172
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,949
right? And, and hopefully we keep someone alive who

1173
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,629
is going to figure out how to grow new livers or whatever in, in the lab.

1174
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:10,469
But you get the idea is

1175
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,909
there's gonna be all this crazy stuff that happens. We can't imagine.

1176
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,860
And, and this is,

1177
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,659
this is the thing I wonder is you

1178
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,739
think about the industrial revolution when you had all

1179
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,540
of these people moving from essentially rural farm

1180
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,610
work in two cities to work in factories.

1181
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:27,830
And

1182
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:31,439
people couldn't imagine what the future was going to be.

1183
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:35,489
And one of my favorite examples is there was some futurist at one point said,

1184
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:35,610
you know,

1185
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,469
New York City can't get any bigger because we don't

1186
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,290
know where to put the horse maneuver and it's like,

1187
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:41,290
right, good job buddy.

1188
00:47:41,649 --> 00:47:42,989
But, you know, that's the thing is there's these,

1189
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,179
all this stuff we can't imagine yet.

1190
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:47,409
And, but it makes me wonder,

1191
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:53,000
are, are the things that are going to happen? We don't understand nor can imagine.

1192
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,699
Are they going to be enough to deal with the disrupted

1193
00:47:56,709 --> 00:48:01,280
change from all of this kind of new A I future

1194
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,639
that is in store?

1195
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:03,510
I don't know.

1196
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:06,600
I, I think like, anything, you're gonna have some people who embrace it,

1197
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:11,239
some people who sort of deal with it and people who try and fundamentally ignore it

1198
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:14,959
or, you know, go back to a, a golden time

1199
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:18,310
and, and, you know, we're already seeing that with this sort of automation,

1200
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,270
you know, like, or like, uh, with coal, you know,

1201
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,600
the coal industry in a lot of the world has flat out accepted that they are

1202
00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:27,189
obsolete and they're gonna go away.

1203
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:30,510
Yes. A lot of the people dealing with them haven't,

1204
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:31,360
which

1205
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:35,360
I kind of get it because it's, it's difficult

1206
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:37,959
to say this my whole life is this

1207
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:38,709
and now

1208
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,110
it's the last 150 years of this town's history.

1209
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,429
Yeah, maybe more in some cases. Exactly.

1210
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:47,629
Like, I mean,

1211
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:51,179
we literally, you know, any, I, I see

1212
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,209
jobs and, you know, things where these are like, literally, that's,

1213
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:56,530
that's what keeps this town alive and then boom, you know,

1214
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,209
the whole factory gets moved to China or just gets automated.

1215
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,469
Right. And then people get mad

1216
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:02,429
and,

1217
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,679
well, and funny enough too.

1218
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:04,800
I mean, so one of the things,

1219
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:07,989
this is numerous economists in the United States have talked about this is

1220
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:12,030
even if they bring the factories back, like a lot of people talk about, you know,

1221
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,689
the robots are going to run them.

1222
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:14,949
It's not going to be people.

1223
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,790
-- So it doesn't really make a difference,
-- fundamental

1224
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:18,979
American wages.

1225
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:19,699
I mean,

1226
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:20,959
well, just at all.

1227
00:49:20,969 --> 00:49:22,290
Right, why, even,

1228
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,639
even in low cost areas now they're adding more and more automation because,

1229
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:30,229
you know, amazingly, computers do a better job than people who knew.

1230
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:30,669
Right.

1231
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:33,550
I mean, it doesn't matter how much you're paying them, people make mistakes,

1232
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,510
people get tired,

1233
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,250
whatever robots never get tired, robots never make mistakes.

1234
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,199
They do exactly the same thing. 365 days a year without stopping

1235
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:45,389
and they don't have to go to the bathroom. I mean,

1236
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:47,379
you can't beat that. Right.

1237
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:51,439
Well, it gets me to even what I find really fundamentally odd is this dichotomy,

1238
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:54,189
the whole premise of information technology is to, like,

1239
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,679
automate things to get a computer and software to do it.

1240
00:49:57,139 --> 00:50:00,120
And yet the it industry as a whole sort of is

1241
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:00,709
anti

1242
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,110
automation. You know,

1243
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:07,260
-- like I said, people who read log files or people who are massaging Excel tables.
-- But

1244
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:11,919
yes, there are people who do that but I don't think anyone wants to do it necessarily.

1245
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:13,639
I think it's the fact that

1246
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,280
depending upon what you need to do

1247
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:18,600
there has been a certain difficulty sometimes

1248
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,550
getting certain tools and this is actually

1249
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,669
where like a I is going to have a certain amount of advantage is

1250
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,850
you're gonna be able to describe your problem using words

1251
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,379
and it will figure it out.

1252
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,540
That's really cool.

1253
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,399
-- Yeah. Well, and that's the thing once we cross that bridge. Yeah, I mean,
-- wow.

1254
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,040
And then of course we start getting more philosophical and saying things like,

1255
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,020
well, then why does, why do you have to tell the A I,

1256
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:44,090
why doesn't one A I tell the other A I what it wants and then you know, whatever.

1257
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,840
Well, it's like you saw that uh that logo I made, right for myself, right? And it was,

1258
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,580
it was done through a website,

1259
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:50,689
right?

1260
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:51,300
So,

1261
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:54,300
so the deal is this one guy uh graphic designer

1262
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:57,209
built a website that using some very simple A I

1263
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:01,750
build you a logo for kind of whatever you want. Very simplistic logos, obviously.

1264
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:03,820
But essentially you pick kind of the colors you like,

1265
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,489
you pick a bunch of logos you like and then it kind of narrows it down

1266
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:07,560
and you know,

1267
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,770
offers you some suggestions based on what you like and it does some clever things to

1268
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,629
like kind of apply the logo to a business card in a picture with a hand,

1269
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,459
somebody handing it to somebody else, you know.

1270
00:51:17,689 --> 00:51:19,149
So you can sort of, actually

1271
00:51:19,919 --> 00:51:21,669
you don't have to visualize what it might look like.

1272
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,310
You can actually see a photo of like,

1273
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,709
what it would look like for you to hand this business card to somebody,

1274
00:51:26,189 --> 00:51:26,729
you know, which,

1275
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:29,290
and here's the beauty of it. It was like, what, 25 bucks?

1276
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,129
And you think this guy set up this infrastructure

1277
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:32,729
and

1278
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,969
it's a money tree now, right?

1279
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:38,649
Yeah, he said he was making something like 100 and 80 grand

1280
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,830
a year off of it and that's steadily increasing. That's awesome.

1281
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,959
You know, and, and, but he's providing this amazing service because like,

1282
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:49,280
for 25 bucks in 5, 10 minutes of poking at a website and saying which of these designs?

1283
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:49,969
I like more.

1284
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:51,949
I've got a logo that I'm ok with. And,

1285
00:51:52,169 --> 00:51:55,469
you know, I've tried working in past with designers, I'm willing to pay them and I,

1286
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:56,030
you know,

1287
00:51:56,229 --> 00:51:59,229
they ask me for some information and then they disappear off the face of the planet.

1288
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:02,149
Oh, yeah. Or they go off on some insane tangent.

1289
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,750
Come back here, please.

1290
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:05,770
And,

1291
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,389
and one of the things that gets me with A I

1292
00:52:07,399 --> 00:52:09,969
is in many cases we'll get a good enough solution,

1293
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,780
but we'll get it in like five minutes

1294
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:14,719
and, and

1295
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:15,000
I,

1296
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,340
I can start working with that solution rather than waiting six months

1297
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:21,070
-- for the human to come up with similar or maybe
-- better.

1298
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:23,040
I know exactly what you mean,

1299
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:24,629
and you know,

1300
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:28,350
that first mover advantage and that speed advantage is going to be huge.

1301
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,010
Right. And that's what really gets me about this. A I embracement is,

1302
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:31,750
you know,

1303
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,649
you start bringing processes down for months and

1304
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:37,750
weeks to maybe days or hours or minutes.

1305
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,229
You know, it's, that's a huge advantage.

1306
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,709
Let's just hope no one writes a podcasting. A I anytime soon.

1307
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:47,489
I hope they do because then we could just take it easy.

1308
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,649
I mean, as long as we own it, as long as we're like the, you know,

1309
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,320
what is it going back to Karl Marx and the owners of the Capitol, you know,

1310
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,929
we can just sit back and get rich,

1311
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,209
whatever. I'm, I'm voting you off the island, Curt.

1312
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:00,419
Oh,

1313
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,510
all right, man. It's been, it's been a while. I'm still tired.

1314
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,790
I should, I should go take a nap.

1315
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:08,070
-- So,
-- yeah, I gotta say Rs A this year was, you know,

1316
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,469
the best way to explain to somebody was

1317
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:09,840
Moscow.

1318
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:10,439
The

1319
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:10,699
Moscow

1320
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:14,530
-- Center has a certain finite size but the, the crowd keeps getting bigger,
-- man.

1321
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,050
It was, I don't know what it is,

1322
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,649
but this year it just felt exhausting and I can't explain it, but whatever,

1323
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:21,229
it doesn't matter, it was still fun.

1324
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:21,870
I'm glad I went.

1325
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:26,169
So, thank you folks for listening. I appreciate it.

1326
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:29,360
You can go to open source security podcast.com and get these

1327

Everyone, you have a fantastic day or week or month or whatever it may be in. Kurt.

1331
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:43,370
Take care, man.

1332
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:46,760
You too, everybody remember to use that Purell.

1333
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,540
You're smuggled American pure

1334
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,250
right now.
