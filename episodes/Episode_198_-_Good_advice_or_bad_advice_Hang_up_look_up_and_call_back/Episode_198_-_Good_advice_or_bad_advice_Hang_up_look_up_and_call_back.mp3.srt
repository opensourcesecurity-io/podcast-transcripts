Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,989
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,470
Josh Pressers. What's new? I'm sad because I ran out of cream. So I'm drinking

3
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:16,068
coffee with milk in it.

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,559
I made the decision a long time ago to just learn how to drink black coffee

5
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:25,420
because for one thing, obviously, the number of calories in it is so close to zero,

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:25,829
it's

7
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:27,120
effectively zero.

8
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,840
I think it's actually a negative calorie drink.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,750
Technically because the caffeine stimulates you.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,319
-- That could be
-- actually, I've never,

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,479
I think it's kind of like celery

12
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:36,865
interesting. But regardless,

13
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:38,904
obviously there's the calorie problem,

14
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:42,365
but then there's also just the issue of if I put cream and sugar in my coffee,

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,814
I have to find cream and sugar

16
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:46,284
and that's a hassle. So I went,

17
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:49,404
-- well,
-- see I went with the whole full fat keto.

18
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:50,084
Ok.

19
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:52,215
Well, to be clear, I'm not on a keto diet,

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,584
I just like to eat keto things because full fat is delicious, right?

21
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:56,674
And so like

22
00:00:56,784 --> 00:01:01,145
in fairness, my milk is 3.5% milk because that's the highest fat milk I can buy.

23
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:03,825
And then for cream. I buy the, you know, the 35%

24
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:05,690
which is again the highest fat.

25
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:09,949
And I mean, what I love is when my one son, he likes to drink it, he drinks the cream.

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,699
Yeah. So I only let him have a little bit.

27
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,769
Right, because it's, it's kind of rich, you know, just the look on his face of,

28
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:18,650
just because, you know, the mouth feel of cream is, I mean, it's just silky.

29
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,370
It's, oh, it's amazing. It's fat curt. You're drinking,

30
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,260
it's like drinking clarified butter,

31
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:27,730
-- which I may or may not have done.
-- I don't think I've ever done that.

32
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:28,175
No,

33
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:30,855
-- you
-- should
-- try just go get some ghee from the store and

34
00:01:30,864 --> 00:01:34,025
just warm it up a bit and don't eat dinner anyway.

35
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:34,074
Oh,

36
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:36,495
yeah. And coffee is technically zero calories.

37
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:39,955
So, yeah, it's a negative energy drink and that just swallowing it.

38
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:43,404
-- You're going to burn calories.
-- It can't technically be zero calories.

39
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:46,714
-- There's stuff in it.
-- Not that your body can process for energy.

40
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:47,815
-- So
-- that could be right.

41
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:49,735
Like you could eat a piece of wood and

42
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,504
you can't, you know, process.

43
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:55,309
Ok. That's fair, I suppose. Eating, yeah, eating a piece of wood

44
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,360
has no nutritional value to me in any way. Styrofoam.

45
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,160
It probably has bad nutritional value.

46
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,279
So, yeah, I mean,

47
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,650
there's lots of things you can eat that you're not

48
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,430
going to digest like a penny and to be clear,

49
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,639
-- we're not telling people to eat pennies or styrofoam or wood
-- if you do let us know.

50
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,020
-- Yeah, take video, put it on youtube.
-- That's right. Anyway,

51
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:19,524
so, yeah, so that's, that's my sadness but overall, you know, it's, I'm kind of glad.

52
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:22,604
So, Krebs on security who, I don't always agree with him,

53
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:26,725
but I would say one thing in general he does that very few other security people do,

54
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:27,044
which is,

55
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:32,085
he actually gives useful and actionable advice that normal people can use.

56
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,725
-- You know,
-- what my suspicion is on that.

57
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:36,804
-- Actually,
-- maybe he's a normal person and not actually a security person.

58
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:39,065
-- He kind
-- of is right because he actually,

59
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:39,710
I mean,

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,970
the beginnings of his career was in journalism and

61
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,990
then he ended up kind of sucked into security.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,789
He's got a really interesting story.

63
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,240
I'd encourage anyone to go read it because it's fascinating

64
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,139
what all happened to him and like the guy,

65
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:56,350
I think he learned Russian as part of his research because obviously

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,169
he was Impersonating bad guys on these forums and it's wild,

67
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:00,949
but I do agree.

68
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,309
I feel like he doesn't just write stories.

69
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,589
-- He also includes, maybe you should think about doing this
-- because

70
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:09,272
there was a recent article on the CBC

71
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,992
website talking about these sort of fake Kickstarter and

72
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:15,272
gofundme campaigns for various tragic events and that you

73
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,072
should do your research and check them out.

74
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:17,632
Cool.

75
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:20,472
And I'm scrolling through the article and I'm like, how,

76
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:22,722
and they talked a little bit about how go fund me or whatever.

77
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,072
And Kickstarter have slightly better fraud teams now

78
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:26,552
that loot these guys out if you complain,

79
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:28,772
but how do I find out if they're real or not?

80
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,391
So, I emailed the lady, you know, kind of very respectfully,

81
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:33,432
kind of quoting her article and I'm like, cool, I agree with this.

82
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:35,992
-- How do I do this and never heard back from her? No,
-- you,

83
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:37,343
-- they don't, they don't
-- know.

84
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:41,143
And I mean, somebody claims I'm raising money for this tragic event.

85
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,694
But, ok, like, and you're not

86
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:45,994
a, ok, like, step one. Are you a registered charity? Well, obviously not.

87
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:47,283
If they were a registered charity,

88
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,514
they probably wouldn't be on gofundme right away.

89
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:50,143
You know.

90
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,813
So, ok, you're not a registered charity. There's no, like, sort of legal framework.

91
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,494
Ok. Now, what? Right do I do?

92
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,994
I call Go Fund Me and be like, I want all the details on this campaign. Well,

93
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:02,774
-- no, they're not going to tell me. They
-- probably don't even know.

94
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:04,343
-- Yeah.
-- I mean, well, all they would know is whatever

95
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:07,035
typed in which maybe it's true. Maybe it's not true.

96
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,395
You know, like I'm going to raise money to go send it to this person.

97
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:12,126
Do I contact that person and say, do you know about this?

98
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:14,675
I guess if they didn't know about it, that might be a red flag,

99
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:17,846
but fundamentally to validate any of this stuff, you know,

100
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:21,755
you're going to need like P I or information that you're kind of not supposed to have.

101
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:22,885
I would agree with that.

102
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,436
The point being is that the majority of

103
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:25,816
the articles about the stuff where they're like,

104
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,626
oh, you should look both ways from crossing the street.

105
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:31,085
It's simple. It's clear we teach it to four year olds. Right.

106
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,786
You know, versus like, oh,

107
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:37,257
-- you should be safe when crossing the street.
-- Yes, I do like that comparison.

108
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:42,678
And my, my go to always, especially from the security perspective is people say,

109
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:44,398
check your links before you clip them.

110
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,838
What does, what does that mean?

111
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,437
Well, especially when they go through a link shorter.

112
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,358
I'm like, oh, it points to t.co something.

113
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:54,477
-- Even
-- if it doesn't curt you can, how many times do you hover over a link?

114
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:57,518
And it says I'm going to go to blah blah.com,

115
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:01,197
you click it and then you actually go to like Google's ridiculous

116
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:04,140
tracking service and then sends you to blah blah.com.

117
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,399
And like, what, where did that come from?

118
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,410
When you log into the provincial health link service?

119
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,200
Here you go to the, you know, main government website, Alberta dot C A.

120
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:14,600
So that's, that's pretty clearly Alberta's government

121
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,619
and you click to go to health link and it bumps you through,

122
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,730
it's like a SDFJQ dot C A or something.

123
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:24,119
It bounces you through there and then off to the health link site.

124
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,630
What does that even mean?

125
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:29,329
It's like some interstitial site that handles the login

126
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:34,272
right. So basically it goes from like Alberta dot C A good legitimate, easy Domain

127
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:36,451
and you eventually you end up at Alberta Health

128
00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:38,182
Services dot C which again,

129
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:42,351
but it bounces through this provider that does the authentication using some Won

130
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,861
Domain. And I literally tried to track it down. It's all private and everything.

131
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:48,171
And I'm like, did I just get hacked or is this like, set up?

132
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,802
Weird, I tweeted them and they're like, yeah, no, that's, that's correct.

133
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:54,101
Like, that's how the login system works. It goes through this weird domain.

134
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,321
I mean, you know, cloud security line says that we have a

135
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:58,002
zero dot Cloud security lines.org, which,

136
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:01,313
you know, we had to pay extra to get that custom domain so that, you know,

137
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:02,834
when you're logging in through off

138
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,503
zero to our stuff, we didn't want it to look weird.

139
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:09,394
So we paid extra for that and I get that. Well, I guess not all sites do that.

140
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,003
Well, just going back to your, make sure the link looks safe.

141
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:15,604
Well, I can't because like I googled this and there's

142
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:17,204
like, it's, it's a ghost.

143
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:22,503
Let's just face it when a security person says don't click on shady links.

144
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:24,694
That's basically just saying,

145
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:26,403
I have no idea what to

146
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,165
tell you.

147
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:31,476
-- Good luck
-- or the ever infamous, you know, only open email from people you trust.

148
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:36,485
My job is reading email from random people on the

149
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,485
-- internet
-- and also people get hacked and then you know,

150
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,555
their account sends out like, hey, I'm stuck in Romania.

151
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,765
-- I need a $200 Western Union transfer.
-- Yeah, that's true.

152
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:45,145
That does happen, you know,

153
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,265
that hasn't happened to me in a long time now that you

154
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,885
-- say
-- that it happened just recently to a relative of mine,

155
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:53,325
you know, he got an email from like, his son or whatever saying, blah, blah, blah.

156
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:54,795
And he's kind of like, nope.

157
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,359
Right. Right.

158
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,369
And I mean, I do remember a couple of years back, this was a huge problem with,

159
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,769
with my family because one of them got popped

160
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,730
and they were sending executables out

161
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,660
and you could see who was all getting popped

162
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,369
because I kept getting emails like every other day

163
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,230
from a different person who clearly opened the executable

164
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,989
and then was sending it out and I'm like,

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,170
oh my goodness.

166
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:19,070
And that was an unpleasant,

167
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,660
probably two months of my life because I had to fix a lot of computers.

168
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,380
So basically your family had email syphilis.

169
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,260
-- I mean, you know,
-- like that's what it sounds

170
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,359
like. That's a marvelous description.

171
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,899
-- I will never tell them. But yes.
-- Yeah. Yeah.

172
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,779
This is why I forced my parents on to Max and Chrome and Gmail.

173
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,209
That was my biggest piece of advice was quit running windows again though.

174
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,019
I mean, how do we get

175
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,190
people actionable advice?

176
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,109
And so what actually before we go on more, why don't you explain this Krebs story?

177
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:52,450
-- Because it's, it's quite good and impressive and frightening.
-- Yeah.

178
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:52,910
So,

179
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,489
so the premise is Attacker calls you and

180
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,410
give the title because the title's marvelous.

181
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,910
So, the title is, oh, I thought I said it already. Sorry.

182
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,529
The title is, I've forgotten it already if you did.

183
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,980
And it's the advice itself when in doubt, hang up, look up and call back.

184
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,040
I like it because it's short. It fits into a sentence. It makes sense. It's

185
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,170
consistent. It, you know what I mean? Like

186
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:16,399
you say it and you don't really need to explain it in depth.

187
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,279
It just is that it's like a gin and tonic. What's in a gin and tonic?

188
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, gin and tonic,

189
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:21,739
maybe an ice

190
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,200
and lime, you need lime. It's no good without lime,

191
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,890
depending on the tonic you use, right?

192
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,119
You got, have you been buying,

193
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,839
they have craft tonics now that are amazing anyways segue

194
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,419
back to this.

195
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,510
So, basically,

196
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,308
and I've actually had this happen where my bank called me and they're like,

197
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,479
can we speak to Mr Kurtz?

198
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,359
And I'm like, uh huh.

199
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,080
And I, you know,

200
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,030
I try to make my language as non committal as

201
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,270
possible because Attackers also do stuff where they like,

202
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,090
try and record your voice saying yes or hello or whatever to play back to, you know,

203
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:48,349
voice authentication systems.

204
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,710
Interesting.

205
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,250
Well, my one bank does voice authentication over the phone and they're like,

206
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,890
do you want to sign up for that?

207
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,909
And I'm like, no,

208
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,049
I, there's like hundreds of hours of

209
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,030
high quality recordings of me online.

210
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:01,919
So, anyways, like, one time my bank did call me and I'm like, cool,

211
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:03,020
how do I verify you from my bank?

212
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,369
And they're like, because you could be anybody. Right.

213
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,890
And they're like, well, I'll check the caller id and I'm like,

214
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,880
-- really
-- that fixes everything.

215
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,289
-- Right.
-- Like, I too have run a PBX. You don't even

216
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,140
need a PBX.

217
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,510
You could, there's like websites,

218
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,719
-- you could use services that spoof caller id
-- anyways.

219
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:19,090
And so, you know, the whole thing anyways back to this,

220
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,210
what Attackers are doing now is because

221
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,320
banks are doing like two factors authentication.

222
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,530
Like for example, we will email you or text you a,

223
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,030
like a six digit pin code that you then read to us on the phone so that we know you're,

224
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,799
you sure.

225
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:35,530
Well, the problem is Attackers can intercept that relatively easily.

226
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:39,520
It's a bit of work, but basically an attacker calls you says Josh, oh my God,

227
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,659
your bank account's been broken into and we want to get this sorted out and

228
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,159
I'm your bank and I'm not even going to ask you for personal information.

229
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,760
So in order to sort this out,

230
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,510
we're going to have send you a six digit pin that

231
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,309
I'm going to need you to read back to me.

232
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,349
So that I know you're you and not some person pretending to be Josh and you go, oh, Ok.

233
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,960
Right. It's, you said you've said you're my bank.

234
00:09:56,969 --> 00:10:00,590
The caller id is correct and you're not asking for personal information. Right.

235
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:02,260
Except they're asking for the pin number.

236
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,130
But regardless,

237
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,390
and then a second person with the attacker phones your bank and says, hi, I'm Josh.

238
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,570
I think my account's been hacked. I need to validate with you.

239
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,830
So, can you send me the pin to my phone? Right. Right.

240
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,109
So the bank of course, goes, certainly Mr Bresser sends the real Mr Bresser,

241
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,140
the pin on the phone.

242
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,419
You real Mr Bresser reads the pin off to the attacker,

243
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,140
the attacker, you know, turns to his friend next to him and says, you know, Josh,

244
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,979
just read the pin number.

245
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:29,590
It's 123457 and that person then repeats that number to the bank. Pretty

246
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,179
clever.

247
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,719
You think you're talking to your bank?

248
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,739
So you're not super worried because you've

249
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,969
checked your balance online and it's like,

250
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:37,510
all screwed up, you know, like somebody just withdrew 5000 bucks.

251
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,010
But, you know, you just spoke with the bank.

252
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,849
Well, like every time I get a refund from these companies, right.

253
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:42,520
Like when I pay them it's like, bam,

254
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,960
it's instantly out of my account from my credit card.

255
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,729
Yeah. Right. But, oh, a refund.

256
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:50,130
-- Yeah, those take like, 3 to 5 business days to protest.
-- You're lucky.

257
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,320
-- This is an interesting attack.
-- Well, they're adapting to what has changed.

258
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:55,679
Right.

259
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,890
And I have two thoughts on this. So on one hand, this is highly targeted

260
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:01,859
and

261
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,630
-- stopping motivated, targeted Attackers is,
-- well,

262
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,940
it doesn't have to be that targeted.

263
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,590
All I need is a list of phone numbers and names.

264
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:12,570
I mean, yes and a call center on CBC Market Watch.

265
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,750
They've been working with Indian police recently to

266
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,890
break up these call centers that target Canadians

267
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:22,309
and they're, they show them raiding these buildings and there are multiple stories

268
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:23,299
there.

269
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:26,710
Like they showed a truck full of P CS being guarded by the Indian army.

270
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,729
Like they literally had like a giant, you know,

271
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,594
2.5 ton truck jammed full of pcs that

272
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:33,594
they'd confiscated from one of these call centers.

273
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,554
There's a podcast.

274
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:39,794
It's, I think a two or three parter I will try to find and send a link to it.

275
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:41,715
I don't even remember who did it anymore, but basically,

276
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:44,705
there was a reporter got called by one of these scammers

277
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:49,984
and he ended up going to India to meet them. Like it's ridiculous.

278
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:53,085
But at the same time, yeah, this is like Crime Inc, I mean,

279
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:55,674
that's going on right here is what's happening.

280
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:56,184
So,

281
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,030
Cripps case, the guy almost got robbed of about over $10,000.

282
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,460
And so I'm thinking if I have a list of phone numbers and names of,

283
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,059
say Bank of America or whatever customers to pick on them because it's just a

284
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,679
Bank of America that I know the name of because it's Bank of America,

285
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,599
I guess also City Corp would be fair game.

286
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,239
But anyway, so given a list of customers and their phone numbers,

287
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,200
you just start working it.

288
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,549
Now, I'm guessing that the success rate for, like,

289
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,840
talking to a human and convincing them, even if it's only like, one or 2%

290
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:23,710
if you can rip

291
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:28,344
offer 10 grand, that's an average of 100 bucks for making a couple of phone calls.

292
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:31,645
Right? It's, it's the same deal as

293
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:36,364
the like Nigerian print scams that we're all familiar with

294
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:40,794
where they'll send out millions of emails and they might get 1000 replies

295
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:43,664
and they might only get two people that they can actually scam.

296
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:47,705
But hey, two people is two people and for these people running the scam,

297
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:48,864
it was totally worth it.

298
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,244
Well, and that's why I'm so hopeful of, I don't think this Shaken

299
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:53,070
Stir protocol stuff will help much,

300
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,599
but it should hopefully take out the bottom player.

301
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:56,619
So what shaken and stir are,

302
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,270
is an attempt essentially to prevent caller ID spoofing

303
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,549
on public telephone networks to put it bluntly.

304
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,929
So the idea basically being right now is you have

305
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,140
a void provider that's hooked into the phone system,

306
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,960
you know, the SS seven control layer

307
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,479
and they can basically do whatever they want. And again, back to the Voyager.

308
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,349
So this used to work because buying an SS seven capable

309
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:18,169
switch was like somewhere on the cost order of you know,

310
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:18,770
a building

311
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,455
and there wasn't VoIP.

312
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:25,695
So you had to like, literally plug into the network with a hugely expensive machine.

313
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:28,664
And so there's no authentication really or anything.

314
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:32,984
So, you know, now getting SS seven or SS nine capable equipment is, well,

315
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,354
there's free software that does it like asterisk, right?

316
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:38,275
Like, literally, I don't know if asterisk actually does the signaling.

317
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,015
But anyways, the point is, it's not hard.

318
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:45,484
I don't even think the telephone company does like old school signaling anymore.

319
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:46,294
I think it's all

320
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,979
-- IP basically on the back end
-- locally.

321
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:52,559
Tell us, went to an all IP back end, like, almost two decades ago.

322
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,020
And why wouldn't you? Right.

323
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,299
-- Because
-- they were basically like, oh,

324
00:13:55,309 --> 00:14:01,719
-- we just run a network through this
-- one wire that has six connections inside of it.

325
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,299
Oh, no, no, this was on their backbone.

326
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,719
On the front end, there's still like twisted pairs and pots and everything.

327
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:09,210
But the back end is all just one because what

328
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:11,549
happened is a lot of telephone companies ended up running

329
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,820
the circuit based network and an IP network.

330
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:16,164
Right. Right. Which is, I mean,

331
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:18,655
like, I'm not running two networks on my, like, when I moved in here,

332
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,765
the first thing I did was I physically ripped out every

333
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:24,054
single bit of cabling that wasn't electrical or the one Ethernet line

334
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,385
or my thermostat. I left that line.

335
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:27,385
Yeah, that's fair.

336
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:28,825
You know, I hear you though.

337
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:33,784
So, back to this I mean, these scams, exploit flaws in the security system,

338
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:38,244
but also they exploit flaws in the advice because the advice is don't give up your P I,

339
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:39,854
your bank will never ask for P I.

340
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,184
-- And so the Attackers are like
-- whatever

341
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,229
always asks for my P I.

342
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:46,270
The problem though is by asking you for the pin number,

343
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,669
you've been trained that that's ok to be asked for by your bank.

344
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,400
Like you have to be asked for your bank to verify who you are. At some point.

345
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:52,789
There has to be some exchange of, you know,

346
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,469
information or bodily fluids for you to prove that you're Josh price

347
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,190
to your bank.

348
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Now, ironically,

349
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,059
there's never a flow the other way which drives me

350
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,950
nuts because most of these entities I deal with,

351
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,530
I set a pin number with them that I then use to validate to them that I am Kurtz

352
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:08,809
Fried. You know, my pin number is 1234. Why can't I also set a pin number on my file?

353
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,940
So the bank's pin number is, you know, four and 321.

354
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:15,080
-- And they have to tell me that
-- I could think of a couple of problems with that.

355
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,320
Well, it's again, it's not perfect but you know what, it's better than nothing,

356
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,159
which is what we have today.

357
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,780
It's not that we don't have nothing today. We have insurance today.

358
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,659
And so this basically costs the bank nothing.

359
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:29,640
It's my problem and it's the bank's insurance company's problem if it happens.

360
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,630
I mean, functionally the bank has just moved all of the risk away from them.

361
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,080
And that's, I mean, that's functionally how most of these systems are set up.

362
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,260
Well, yeah, you externalize risk if you can.

363
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,710
The company, the risk is my problem. It's their insurance company's problem.

364
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,900
And this is why they never set a pin because let's say,

365
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:49,369
let's say I set a pin for the bank.

366
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,619
Am I going to remember that pin? There's a 0% chance. I'm going to remember that pin.

367
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,299
-- All this crap's
-- in my password manager.

368
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,239
Like, well, ok, you can actually, I should do that.

369
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,000
So like my favorite example, I have a safe deposit box at the bank.

370
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,780
I go in, they say, oh, you need to type in your safe deposit box pin on this keypad.

371
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:05,090
And I say, I don't remember it.

372
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:07,059
And they say, well, we'll just change it for you.

373
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,030
Then here, wait a second and then they change it

374
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,739
and then I type in the number I just gave them and then I forget it again.

375
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,390
-- But
-- they validate your ID or something.

376
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,809
-- Well, yeah,
-- I've

377
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,210
-- got
-- to, I bring in ids and well,

378
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:20,179
and they know who I am because I go in and do this on a regular basis. But

379
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,950
regardless the point is if I gave the bank a pin,

380
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,609
there's a 0% chance I'm going to remember it and I

381
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,820
actually didn't think of putting that in my last pass even.

382
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,969
-- That's what the notes field is for.
-- I'm going to do that now.

383
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,719
Well, next time I go in because I don't remember what the pin is anymore.

384
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,390
But next time I go in, I'm going to do that. But I mean, you get the idea right.

385
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,619
-- Is every time I go in it costs the bank money
-- I personally would

386
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,219
prefer not to have a PIN number and have them actually check my ID.

387
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:47,309
-- But yeah, that costs the bank money. They don't want to do that.
-- They

388
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,900
-- do
-- both

389
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,099
and whatever they check my ID, they ask for my pin

390
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,469
and then I don't know my pin. So they change my pin and then I type in.

391
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,219
It's like it's completely ridiculous.

392
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,659
But yeah, it is what it is.

393
00:16:57,669 --> 00:16:58,070
Well, I mean,

394
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,099
in theory for people who check their safety deposit box a lot and remember their pin,

395
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:03,010
-- it would be not a
-- safety deposit box.

396
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,780
-- It's a safe deposit box.
-- Right. You're correct.

397
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,358
I am technically correct. Yes.

398
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,089
Did we

399
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:09,208
talk about that on the show?

400
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:12,138
How some bank did the wrong safety deposit boxes

401
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:14,178
got rid of them and basically said tough.

402
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:14,798
And then

403
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:17,009
apparently that's what the law is. What do you mean

404
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:20,659
there was a documented case where a guy basically went to a safety deposit

405
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:23,468
box and the bank had drilled it out and gotten rid of the contents.

406
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,208
I'm sure it can happen. Yeah, here we go. We'll put this in the show notes.

407
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:29,359
This is from July of last year. But basically when Philip

408
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:32,348
pots opened box 105 at his local Wells Fargo and

409
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,848
the paywall just popped up and I can't read it.

410
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,279
Oh, good job. New York Times. Ok.

411
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,060
Well, anyways, the point being the bank drilled,

412
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:40,660
the wrong boxes got rid of the contents and that's too bad.

413
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,660
Like safety deposit boxes. Well, they're not safety deposit boxes, right?

414
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,030
They're safe deposit boxes,

415
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:47,739
but the bank actually doesn't,

416
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,300
apparently in most of the US have any actual sort of liability

417
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,540
or actual requirement to make sure that your stuff is safe,

418
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,219
like if they accidentally sell it off or get rid of it at auction, but that's ok.

419
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,410
So this guy is currently trying to sue his bank and I don't

420
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,619
remember how it turned out or if it has turned out yet,

421
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,160
I would hope that the bank is going to be on

422
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,439
the hook for whatever was taken from that box because look,

423
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:12,359
it's humans are involved and they make mistakes.

424
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:14,540
Well, part of the problem is what was taken from the box.

425
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,619
-- I mean, that's a reasonable problem because yes, my bank
-- doesn't. Right.

426
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,969
-- Like, dude, I had the Mona Lisa in there.
-- Right. Sure.

427
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:25,920
You actually, I have, I know someone who keeps precious metals in their box and it's,

428
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,400
I don't know what it's worth because obviously they won't tell me.

429
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,469
-- But I know they have a nontrivial amount of precious metals.
-- Here we go.

430
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,579
There's, there's no federal law that says the bank actually has to, like,

431
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:38,339
keep this stuff safe.

432
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:39,209
-- That's
-- interesting.

433
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:39,410
Well,

434
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,729
it makes sense in a way because I think it's probably one of those things where

435
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,020
nobody ever thought to make a law because

436
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,699
it was just so strongly implicitly implied.

437
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:51,339
-- It's a safe deposit box. Like it's in a vault in a bank.
-- I would argue

438
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,589
that this is not a common problem because part of the reason

439
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,780
people use these boxes is because they have a reputation for being

440
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,160
very secure.

441
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,520
Well, generally speaking, yeah,

442
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,310
I would assume when they get rid of a safe deposit box, like when they,

443
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,349
the owner dies and stops paying or whatever and you know,

444
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,329
and they drill the lock and get rid of the contents, but they like triple, triple,

445
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:11,729
triple check all that paperwork.

446
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,400
-- I
-- mean, one would hope so.

447
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,020
But people are people, man, right?

448
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,109
-- They make mistakes,
-- drill box 137 the accidentally drill box 136 nobody notices.

449
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,640
And now whoops. What did I just do? Wow, that's wild though.

450
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,979
-- Or
-- in this case in California,

451
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,589
a Wells Fargo customer said the bank accidentally re rented her boss.

452
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,630
No. You know what?

453
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,849
Actually, I don't, I don't buy that story because so here's the deal,

454
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:36,339
let's say the bank drills out my box they get rid of it.

455
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,979
No, no, because they would have the key.

456
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:41,439
But like, fundamentally, I have a key, they have a key.

457
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,339
They cannot get into my box without my key.

458
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,599
So the only way in is to drill it, but then once they drill it, obviously,

459
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:51,699
-- my key has no value, then, well,
-- the lock's dead.

460
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:53,319
It doesn't matter. That's why they charge you.

461
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:56,319
Like, that's why in fairness, a lot of banks charge you, you know,

462
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,609
an upfront fee to rent a safety Paul Paul's

463
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,849
-- box because basically they're the cost of that
-- lock.

464
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:02,599
It's really cheap. It's like 70 bucks.

465
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,180
-- I had to pay for it once because I accidentally
-- lost the key.

466
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:08,380
I mean, yeah, if you lose your key, I think they ding you for 50 or 100 bucks here.

467
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,829
It was 75 bucks. Which was, I'm like, that's really cheap actually.

468
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,599
That's actually cheaper than getting a locksmith because it

469
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:16,319
was funny because what happened was I emptied the box

470
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:19,560
and then I was like, oh, I've got to go get the other key. I'll come back later.

471
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,329
No idea where the keys went.

472
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,199
He disappeared

473
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,300
and I called the bank. I'm like, I lost the keys.

474
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,150
I'm really sorry, like everything's out of the box, but

475
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:31,400
I can't give you keys. Like, yeah, we'll just charge you 75 bucks. You'll be fine.

476
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,760
-- And I'm like, wow, that's
-- cool.

477
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,650
And it sounds like the bank actually has a process for dealing with

478
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,050
this case where they accidentally got rid of this person's safety deposit box.

479
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,469
Because, like, I,

480
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,189
I got a call from my bank branch one time.

481
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,290
They have different sizes of safety deposit boxes. Right.

482
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,979
And most of them are that sort of small, you know, it's like,

483
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:49,729
what about two or three inches high and about maybe seven inches wide.

484
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:52,410
And so I have one of the bigger ones where you can actually put legal

485
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,650
documents in it without having to fold them or mangle them or jam them in.

486
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:58,180
And, you know, and I'm, I'm not giving that up

487
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:02,579
and I've literally had them phone me once or twice saying, you know,

488
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,739
you don't access your safety deposit box a lot.

489
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,109
No, like I access it like once every five years, you know, it just holds paperwork.

490
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,180
Would you consider giving it up and renting a smaller one? And I'm like, nope,

491
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,130
I'm in the same boat actually. So when I, when I moved,

492
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,650
I had to get a little one and I said, I want you to put me on a list for the big one.

493
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,170
Like what size I'm like, I don't care bigger than this.

494
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,280
Like I would literally,

495
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:25,729
and I just kind of slowly worked my way up till I had the box I wanted.

496
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:26,229
And,

497
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,969
and even now if they called me and said we

498
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:30,609
have the bathtub size box on the bottom row open,

499
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,199
I would be like, yes sign me up.

500
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:36,329
I will take that in a second. I don't need it, but I don't care like I could like put

501
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:38,979
something in it. I don't care. I love having the space.

502
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:40,180
Yeah, I'm super greedy like that.

503
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:43,989
But anyway, anyway, we are rat holed again talking about safe deposit,

504
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:48,099
-- I think
-- fundamentally. So, I mean, it kind of boils down the same thing of

505
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,489
a safe deposit box is, is again, you know,

506
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,339
I have a bunch of paperwork that I would be such a pain in the

507
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,750
butt to replace if I lost it or it got damaged or you know,

508
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,459
destroyed.

509
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:59,420
So I keep it in a safe deposit box, right? That's supposed to

510
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,609
see how you do that

511
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:01,109
and it turns,

512
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:04,869
you know, that's like 99 point a bunch of nine safe but not 100%.

513
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,209
So the answer is ok,

514
00:22:06,219 --> 00:22:09,250
there can be problems with safe deposit boxes where like they re rent it

515
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,290
because they think I stopped paying or they drill the wrong one or?

516
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,569
Oh, I don't know the bank falls into a sinkhole point.

517
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:19,150
Is am I going to stop using my safe deposit box to store these documents? Good Lord.

518
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,550
No, of course, I'm going to keep using it because this is as good as it gets.

519
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,869
We're talking about actionable advice and

520
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,040
we'll say

521
00:22:27,189 --> 00:22:31,560
unique situations where an attacker is specifically targeting you.

522
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:33,030
Even if you're part of a big list,

523
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,459
you have a human actually interacting with you and they're determined to acquire

524
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:38,430
your money.

525
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,219
In this case,

526
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:41,819
I still bucket these things into two groups where

527
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:45,050
there's the kind of drive by accidental attack.

528
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,699
So I just mailed emailed a million people and then there's the,

529
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,829
I'm going after Kurt and be it a safe deposit box,

530
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,560
be it someone trying to hack into your bank?

531
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:57,170
There's a lot going on and think even with Krebs advice,

532
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,119
which I think is fantastic advice.

533
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,390
You should never interact with your bank when they call you.

534
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,540
Best case go into a branch. I mean, functionally if an attacker wants to get you

535
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:10,040
and they're calling you on the phone, if they want to,

536
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,699
they're going to beat you because they have more motivation than you

537
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:16,770
do because you don't even know what's going on in many cases.

538
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,199
I mean, I guess the good news here is that these are not super targeted attacks.

539
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:20,800
These are, you know,

540
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,079
here's a list of people and phone numbers keep calling until you get.

541
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,569
That's a sucker, right?

542
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,810
Because it's, I mean, my,

543
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,430
my favorite example of this is the big 2009 bank of

544
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,939
Ireland robbery where basically a bunch of guys with weapons,

545
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:35,180
took the bank manager and his family hostage

546
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,400
and basically told him you have a choice, right?

547
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,619
You can take us to the bank and open it up and we'll

548
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,420
take all the money or we can do terrible things to your family.

549
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,500
So he of course,

550
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,439
-- went to the bank and opened it up and
-- I'm sure the

551
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:49,339
bank would even tell any manager if this happens to you.

552
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:50,780
Give them all of the money.

553
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,000
Well,

554
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,699
you kind of have to do that because otherwise your

555
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,189
employees are not going to think highly of you.

556
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, insurance, you have insurance for crap like this.

557
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:02,119
I mean, that's the reality of it and this is even true of humans in their daily lives.

558
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,989
I have insurance for my car. I have insurance for my house.

559
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,520
I have insurance for my life.

560
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,930
Unfortunately, I don't know of insurance for things like fraud for normal people.

561
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:15,060
Sometimes homeowners or contents insurance covers that.

562
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:16,839
I wonder actually because in fact,

563
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,680
I know my homeowners actually now that you say

564
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:22,119
that my homeowners covers my safe deposit box contents.

565
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,780
Now that you say that I remember that because

566
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,410
that came up because my insurance man said,

567
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,660
you know, do you have a safe deposit box?

568
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,359
I was like, yeah, I do.

569
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,500
He's like, ok, fine, you know how much coverage you need on that?

570
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,300
I'm like like, I don't know, 50 bucks

571
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,069
like

572
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:37,300
nothing in there is technically valuable from a monetary perspective.

573
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,670
But yeah, yeah, I mean that's fair, but maybe that's the key, right?

574
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,540
-- Is maybe things like homeowners and renters insurance need to start covering
-- well,

575
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,959
the problem then is you enter a situation where

576
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:48,959
people are less wary about fraud because hey,

577
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:50,819
I don't need to worry about being ripped off because

578
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:54,739
-- covers it. Yeah,
-- but if you keep getting ripped off, then your premium goes up.

579
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,959
It's the same thing like I could say,

580
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,920
I don't care if my house burns down insurance will pay for it, but if it does,

581
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,040
holy crap, my insurance is going to get expensive.

582
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,520
Yeah.

583
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,640
So the problem with that is that like look at car insurance,

584
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,560
there's people out there,

585
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:09,459
like my favorite was Canada's worst driver because it's real and to be on the show

586
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:13,319
you need to have a valid driver's license and you have to have valid car insurance.

587
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:16,670
And some of these people were like, oh, you know, I've had 30 or 40 whoopsies and,

588
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,660
you know, Andrew Youngblood is like, excuse me, what now?

589
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,959
You know, she's like, yeah, I've 30 or 40 accidents in the last five years. Right. Or,

590
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:23,739
you know,

591
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,319
just these people where their car insurance is like one or $2000 a month on a

592
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:33,000
car that costs like 4000 bucks because they just keep getting in so many accidents.

593
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,560
And I think part of the problem is that some of them are from jurisdictions where,

594
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:35,680
you know,

595
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:37,739
the insurance is government provided so they can't

596
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,099
be priced out of the market really,

597
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,459
or, you know, refuse service.

598
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:42,839
But basically the problem is, you know,

599
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:46,699
you will have this small minority of people who honestly they should never be

600
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:49,140
allowed to drive and they should be forced to take public transit because they have

601
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,750
so many accidents or collisions. Rather these aren't accidents.

602
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,160
This isn't like their carfield. They're like, like the one lady drove into a store.

603
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:55,810
He's like, what?

604
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,359
And she's like, oh, I got confused, you know,

605
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,239
or my favorite was the little old lady who's like, well,

606
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,920
I only drunk drive on the way home from Bingo

607
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,979
and it's not a very long drive and he's like,

608
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,359
you know, or the best is they go to this testing, they go to this place to do it.

609
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,520
It's like usually an abandoned aircraft base or something, you know,

610
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,280
with lots of room to drive around and not hit stuff

611
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,060
and they make them have like a dash cam in their

612
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:18,199
car while they're driving from like Toronto to this place.

613
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:22,390
It's like 100 miles and then they have a former police officer review

614
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,459
the footage and kind of clock how many moving violations they made,

615
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:28,010
you know, and, and I'm not talking like little things like lane changes.

616
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,849
I'm talking like, driving on the wrong side of the road, blowing red lights,

617
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:31,540
you know, things like that.

618
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,339
And like some of these people make over 100 you know, the guys, like,

619
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:36,689
basically based on this footage, I would revoke your license.

620
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:37,680
I don't, what I'm saying is,

621
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:39,050
I don't think insurance will work because there's

622
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,300
a subset of people who will be like,

623
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,540
cool.

624
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,619
I don't have to worry about getting ripped off

625
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,130
now and they will cost us a disproportionate amount

626
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,829
of money because they keep getting ripped off and

627
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,119
I don't want to blame the victim again.

628
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,219
But

629
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:47,989
at some point,

630
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,319
people who leave their car running in winter with the keys in the car unlocked,

631
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:52,229
it's like, again,

632
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,310
people shouldn't steal cars but you also maybe shouldn't leave

633
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,599
your car running with the keys in it unlocked.

634
00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:01,560
Yeah. But at the same time, if I do that enough,

635
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,640
-- I'm just not going to get insurance
-- again in some,

636
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,489
in some jurisdictions you can't get priced out of

637
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,969
the market because of the way it's set up.

638
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:12,439
-- I feel like that's a failure of Canada.
-- Well, that's not a Canadian thing.

639
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:16,239
It's done provincially. So, like BC next door to me is government provided in

640
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,260
based on how long you've been driving and here's the best part they didn't

641
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,020
charge you for your insurance based on how much your car was worth.

642
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,579
So, these people with super cars got in accidents and like,

643
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:27,030
kind of came close to not bankrupting the insurance system, but like,

644
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,739
they cost it a lot of money.

645
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,770
That's idiotic. I mean, I'm sorry? Like, that's, that's just stupid.

646
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,910
Have you met the government?

647
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,170
-- Well, yeah,
-- and that's their problem then for being dumb.

648
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:43,300
I mean, this is like, anybody, if I do something that costs more money than I have,

649
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,209
I don't have any more money then.

650
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:45,910
Like,

651
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:46,719
well,

652
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:48,569
but what I'm getting to is the problem is like

653
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,180
you can do this with the best of intentions.

654
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:50,709
Like in Alberta,

655
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,939
they put caps on insurance rates for soft tissue

656
00:27:52,949 --> 00:27:54,459
damage and a bunch of other stuff trying to,

657
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:55,910
you know, prevent insurance rates from going up.

658
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,439
And of course, lawyers found ways around that and now, you know,

659
00:27:58,449 --> 00:28:01,839
insurance rates went up in some cases, 2030 40%.

660
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:05,890
-- All right.
-- Why are we arguing about insurance? Let's ignore the insurance problem.

661
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,209
Insurance isn't the answer here.

662
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,540
-- I don't
-- think maybe it's not and I'm not saying it is,

663
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,239
I think it might actually make it worse.

664
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,260
I don't know. Maybe it maybe,

665
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,439
I mean, but here's the problem. So what's the answer?

666
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:20,319
There's literally nothing we can do. We cannot stop these attacks full stop.

667
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,760
There's no way to stop them. So what does that mean?

668
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,439
For example, we train people when in doubt, hang up, look up, call back.

669
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:29,479
So for example, why can't my bank call me and be like Mr Siefried?

670
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:30,439
We think there's a problem with your account.

671
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:33,719
Please call us back with the number on the back of your card. Thank you. Bye. Click.

672
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:36,839
-- Well, sure they can do that but the Attackers
-- won't.

673
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,640
-- No, but we can train people to do that.
-- Just no, we can't, we cannot train people

674
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:43,807
saying we can train people is una actionable advice.

675
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,927
The reality is people are dumb and they make

676
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:49,167
stupid choices and that's never going to change.

677
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:51,008
As long as we have people someday,

678
00:28:51,017 --> 00:28:53,287
the machines might take over and solve that problem for us.

679
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:57,498
But until that day, we have to accept the fact that if you cannot solve something,

680
00:28:57,508 --> 00:29:01,767
using some sort of technical or policy control, there's nothing you can do.

681
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,468
I would say the problem with that though is that

682
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:05,927
we're currently training people to do the insecure thing.

683
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:06,728
We're currently training,

684
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:09,416
-- run across the road without looking. Are we
-- training them?

685
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:11,666
We're not doing anything in most cases.

686
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:12,056
Well,

687
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:14,375
my bank has literally called me up and started asking me

688
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,115
for P I to prove who I am to them.

689
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,645
Sure. And it's not their problem.

690
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,755
They are training their customers to get ripped off.

691
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:21,855
-- And
-- I'm telling you that if the bank cares,

692
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:24,296
training you to not do that isn't the solution,

693
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,276
the correct solution is to somehow implement a

694
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:28,495
technical control that will do it for them,

695
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:28,855
right?

696
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:31,855
But my concern is my bank is actively teaching people, hey,

697
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:32,975
when you pick up the phone, so

698
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,104
start asking you for P

699
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:35,764
I it's ok to answer them and give it to

700
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,894
-- them
-- and they don't care because it's not their problem,

701
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:38,343
right?

702
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:41,543
-- But that's not great for the rest of us.
-- Well, it sucks for you.

703
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:45,654
I mean, like for real, that's the thing. We can't fix people.

704
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,864
I mean, that's just the way it is no amount of training,

705
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:49,823
-- but we
-- can stop making it worse is what I'm trying to say.

706
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:53,984
Maybe. I mean, ok, but why does your bank care? Right. They need an incentive.

707
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:54,984
What's their incentive?

708
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,413
They have no incentive,

709
00:29:56,723 --> 00:29:59,134
you know, ideally to do the right thing or to, you know,

710
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:02,991
what, what bank has ever said? Oh, let's do the right thing. Like, screw that.

711
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,141
We're going to make money.

712
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:08,491
Number one, make money. Number two, make money. Number 30, make money.

713
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:09,751
Yeah. No, I get it.

714
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:12,732
Like every, every vendor that asks me, you know, oh, you're using your credit card.

715
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:14,322
We want to see ID. And I'm like, no, they're like, what?

716
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:14,572
And I'm like,

717
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:17,741
you can make a code 10 called to Visa to validate my identification or my,

718
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:18,582
my account rather.

719
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:21,121
And they're like, yeah, but that takes time and I'm like, well then too bad.

720
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:24,001
And I've literally walked out of a store that wanted my driver's license.

721
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:25,312
They wanted to photocopy my drive.

722
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,229
-- I would not let someone do that better
-- yet. You know what?

723
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:31,380
I was buying a computer mouse now, granted, it was a mighty mouse and they're like,

724
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,250
you know, they're not cheap.

725
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,599
They're like 70 bucks us or whatever they are. But I'm like, you want to photocopy my

726
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,920
driver's license so I can pay for a computer mouse with a credit card.

727
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,439
And they're like, yeah, and I'm like, I hate them all. I'm going to the Apple store.

728
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:44,810
Goodbye. But like, clearly they're, they're still in business.

729
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,479
So they that policy, you know, now I would call the privacy commissioner and be like,

730
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:51,510
hey, a lot of people don't know or care and again,

731
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:56,319
what's the negative consequence for most people in that situation,

732
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:57,660
-- their identity
-- gets stolen?

733
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,459
But does it,

734
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:01,400
how do I know that that person working the front desk isn't just running some scam,

735
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,209
photocopying people's driver's licenses?

736
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:04,550
-- I
-- mean, you don't know, how do you know,

737
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,619
I'm not in some long con to steal your ID by hosting a podcast with you, right?

738
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,660
Like you don't know. And in most cases, people just don't care.

739
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,949
That's the reality of it.

740
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:14,660
I mean,

741
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,699
ok, so we're out of time.

742
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:17,459
I

743
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:22,260
-- love the twisty universe. We've weaved
-- here, Krebs on security.

744
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,969
He is trying to make the world less worse

745
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:28,300
in ways that are simple and reasonably effective.

746
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,949
I will agree with that. Let's be blunt.

747
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:33,300
If 100% of people did the, when in doubt, hang up, look up and call back,

748
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,300
then Attackers would not be able to randomly cold, call people and rip them off.

749
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,060
-- But 100 percent of people aren't going to
-- do it.

750
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:41,819
And you know what 100% of people aren't going to look both ways in across the street.

751
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,829
No, absolutely not.

752
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:48,420
And I also think that's a dangerous goal because it's unrealistic here is the way

753
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:52,219
I always look at this and this is even true of this podcast we have.

754
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:56,050
If I can take actions that help even one person

755
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,420
and I make their life better in some way.

756
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,569
That is a success. And that's really the measure.

757
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,530
-- It
-- has to be cost effective though we can't spend $10

758
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,930
-- million preventing one burglary
-- cost effectiveness kicks in at scale.

759
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:11,550
But I mean, fundamentally like this is my advice,

760
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,780
this is my actionable advice to the people listening to us right now is

761
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:19,859
if you can give out advice to one person that makes their life better,

762
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,329
that's ok.

763
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,699
That's good enough.

764
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:26,349
Whereas saying I have to give out advice that will affect everybody

765
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,140
that will never happen. Don't try to do that.

766
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,619
Oh, yeah. No, I would agree with that.

767
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,479
And at the same time though, that advice has to be, you know, helpful, useful,

768
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,339
-- real,
-- I will agree with that saying, don't click links is not actionable.

769
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:43,329
Well, it is actionable advice. It's just not useful, actionable advice.

770
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,900
Well, I mean, before the show, we're talking about this and there's every,

771
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,060
every link I hover in Twitter goes to t.co slash something like

772
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,699
whatever. I don't, I don't even look half the time. I'm like whatever.

773
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,540
I trust my browser, I run Linux. No one hacks Linux

774
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,989
that pretty much, yeah. For now, I can't wait to be targeted.

775
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,599
-- Hey,
-- it's the year of the Linux desktop.

776
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,550
-- You're saying
-- it's always the year of the Linux

777
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,150
desktop. It will always be the year of the Linux desktop. That is my prediction.

778
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:09,699
All right,

779
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,160
