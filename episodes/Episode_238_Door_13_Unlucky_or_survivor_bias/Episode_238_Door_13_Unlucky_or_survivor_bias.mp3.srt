00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,549
-- Security podcast with myself, started talking
-- too late.

1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,989
Which is ironic actually because it's unlucky 13th, December 13th.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,229
I do love how that's such a strong thing in, in our culture that, like,

3
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:13,590
I don't think I've ever seen a building with 1/13 floor

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,440
-- outside.
-- I saw one once actually and I forget where I was.

5
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:19,739
It may have been Europe. Yeah, I,

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:21,579
I do recall

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,170
pointing it out and being like,

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,790
I have never seen a button 13 on an elevator before and then I of course,

9
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:27,489
did not go there

10
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,149
anyway. So, what are we talking

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:31,340
about?

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,159
There was this thing about the, the world's most,

13
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:35,819
like, unluckiest man.

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,659
And he's been, uh, in a train crash, a plane crash in a car crash, just a whole pile of,

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,389
you know, bizarre, terrible thing.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
-- I mean,
-- is that unlucky or is

17
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,020
-- I
-- was kind of thinking about that,

18
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:48,819
you know,

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,849
car crashes? Ok. That happens plane accidents. Well, they're,

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,715
but not, you know, the, the miracle over the Hudson. Right.

21
00:00:55,726 --> 00:00:58,546
There's a, you know, these things do happen and people survive them.

22
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:02,636
Right. But it just got me thinking of all the people.

23
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:02,866
Well,

24
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,596
the only reason we know he's the unluckiest man in

25
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,545
the world is because so far he survived everything.

26
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:07,585
He's not dead.

27
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:10,155
And it just got me thinking about, you know, how many people,

28
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,456
like fell out of a tree and just whack their head the wrong way.

29
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,295
And that's it.

30
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:15,875
I, I know someone that happened.

31
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:20,391
He was an elderly gentleman, trimming a tree and fell out of the tree

32
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,662
-- and that was all you're
-- supposed to use a ladder or hire

33
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,711
an arborist if it's more than 20 ft off the ground.

34
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:28,991
-- Look,
-- I'm old enough. I'm not climbing in a tree to cut it like,

35
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:29,351
yeah,

36
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:33,351
just honestly just don't because the professionals have safety equipment

37
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:34,632
and they're not going to fall out of the tree,

38
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:35,671
-- like
-- for real.

39
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:36,732
And if they follow the tree,

40
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:38,772
it's them falling out of the tree and they usually wear a helmet.

41
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,000
No, seriously, that's what always got me right. They're tied to the tree.

42
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,190
But also like, what, what always gets me is, you know, as a child,

43
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,150
we never wore helmets, skiing and snowboarding.

44
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:51,360
Only the ski race team wore helmets, you know,

45
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,660
and nowadays it's under 18 is required to wear a helmet at the ski hill.

46
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:58,940
But under 18 is required, adults are not required to wear a helmet at the ski hill. So,

47
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,879
well,

48
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,610
it's like you see people riding bikes with their

49
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,019
kids and they make their kids wear a helmet,

50
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:04,300
but the adults aren't wearing a helmet

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,230
All right. Let's, let's warp this into a

52
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,889
survivorship bias conversation because I think that's what it is.

53
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,369
Tell us what survivorship bias is. Yeah.

54
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,580
-- So
-- survivor, survivorship bias is the simple fact that,

55
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,160
well, the people who survive, get to tell their story

56
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,270
by a,

57
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,940
-- I,
-- I didn't wear a helmet when I was a kid and I was just fine

58
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,220
except for all those kids who aren't just fine because they got run over by a car.

59
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,979
And that's what I mean. It's interesting to me. I,

60
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,699
I had a broken bone as a kid. Pretty much everybody I knew as a kid had a broken bone

61
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,889
and now that's super rare.

62
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,020
Like my kids have never broken a bone and I, I never broke a bone.

63
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,460
But you probably knew somebody who did.

64
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:49,029
-- I knew many people who broke bones.
-- It was just, it was normal, right?

65
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,130
It was part of being a child. You broke a bone somewhere

66
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,649
and now it's, I'm trying to think like I,

67
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,289
I literally haven't met a kid with a broken arm or leg and

68
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,720
ages.

69
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,039
That's true. Actually, I haven't seen one

70
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,350
and, and signing cast was like the big thing

71
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,190
that was,

72
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,210
and I remember when I was a kid, I was like,

73
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,880
I wish I had a broken leg so I could get my cast signed,

74
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,360
which in hindsight is an idiotic thing to think.

75
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,759
-- But at the time,
-- well,

76
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,559
but if you don't know how much it hurts and how itchy it gets in there.

77
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,259
-- Like,
-- and that's the thing, right?

78
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,139
Like, I'm certain it was an unpleasant experience in every way.

79
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:29,436
Honestly, it wasn't that bad because I broke my, I chipped my thumb, I broke wrist.

80
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:34,186
And so, like, honestly, the thumb thing was just, it was a cast. It was a little itchy.

81
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:37,276
No big deal. And that's the other thing too. As a young kid, you heal fast.

82
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,996
You know, my kids get the sniffles and if I get the sniffles from them,

83
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:41,675
I'm out for like, two or three days.

84
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:45,796
-- Whereas they're just like snotty for two or three days. Yeah,
-- I know how that goes.

85
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:46,266
All right.

86
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:50,666
So, I guess the other half of it though is something else I always think about when I,

87
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:54,852
when I hear about lucky or unlucky is I often feel like I am not a lucky

88
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,611
person where I know people who seem like

89
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,632
they're always winning contests and things like that.

90
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:04,061
And I feel like that is not me. Now, granted I'm not dead.

91
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:05,311
So, I've got that going for me.

92
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:09,561
I would say you're well fed, you have food and shelter and heat. You have a nice house.

93
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:13,792
-- You're doing a lot better than most
-- well fed is just a nice way to call me fat, isn't

94
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:14,011
it?

95
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,540
Yeah, we're both pretty well fed, I think.

96
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,010
Well, I mean, and that's, that's part of the privilege I have is like,

97
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,480
I'm trying to eat less food.

98
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:23,989
I know. Right. Exactly.

99
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,359
For most people over the history of humanity,

100
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:28,519
that statement would have got me punched in the face.

101
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:28,630
Yeah.

102
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:29,079
Yeah.

103
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,119
So, I mean,

104
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,559
my suspicion is most people listening to this podcast aren't actually unlucky.

105
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:34,565
So,

106
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,605
I mean, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what the moral of the story is here.

107
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:40,765
I guess survivorship bias is a real thing and we see it in security.

108
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:42,804
Right where it's like, 00, absolutely.

109
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:46,484
I didn't have to care about that problem. It's like, uh, not yet. We give it time.

110
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:47,445
They'll come get you.

111
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:49,524
So, anyway,

112
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,274
stay safe, everybody and try not to fall out of a tree.

113
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:57,994
Just don't climb trees. It's December. All right. See you on December 14th.
