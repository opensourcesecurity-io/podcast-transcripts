Hello and welcome to episode 104 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,159
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,949
So I heard Gen two got popped.

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,930
Yeah.

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,600
Yeah. Well, part of their github, uh,

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,290
their

6
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:19,979
github infrastructure, I guess

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,469
their

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,000
github

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,100
organization. Sorry. That's the correct.

10
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,540
-- Yes.
-- Their github

11
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:26,299
organization got popped. Yes.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,829
So that's neat.

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,569
Well, what's funny to me is this reads like a classic airline disaster of, like

14
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,400
this guy forgot to put the screw back in the engine and was like, eh, whatever.

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,860
And then the next guy, like, forgot to check the engine and was like, man, whatever,

16
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,020
put some tape over that hole.

17
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:44,040
And then the pilot was like, oh, we're losing fuel, let's, you know,

18
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,599
pump fuel from the good tank to the other tank because why not?

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,659
And so the whole thing is just like this series

20
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:53,509
of sort of incremental mistakes that results in an attacker

21
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,680
taking over the organization. And luckily the attacker was apparently an idiot.

22
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,189
I'm comfortable with that statement.

23
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:04,970
Well, considering what they accomplished and then what they did with it, it's like,

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,510
what?

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,309
Right.

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,959
You know what this really makes me think of when I look

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,540
at the timeline of events and everything that happened on both sides is

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,779
in order for a disaster to happen, a

29
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:17,489
bunch of things,

30
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,559
I'll get to that.

31
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,040
So in order for the mistake to happen, it will say disaster.

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,900
In this case, a number of mistakes need to be incident, right? Like

33
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,849
the incident,

34
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:29,220
a number of mistakes need to be made.

35
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:32,470
But on the other side of the coin, when you're the attacker,

36
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:37,580
you can't make mistakes, right? You have to basically play the game. Perfect.

37
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:42,519
Well, he did make a mistake and that's what made it real obvious that they got.

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,180
Right. Well, that's my point, right.

39
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,559
So if, if you think about a situation like this where you're talking about like

40
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,540
uh essentially the events leading up to a compromise,

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,019
you need like the perfect storm of mistakes.

42
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:58,989
And then after compromise,

43
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,220
you need to play the perfect game of no mistakes because when you make mistakes,

44
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,379
you get discovered and on the other side,

45
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,649
if you only make mistakes, then you end up, but they compromise.

46
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,639
And so it, it's kind of interesting to think about the, the two aspects of this, of,

47
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:15,000
of making a bunch of mistakes.

48
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,139
But then also when you're the attacker not making a

49
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:21,020
bunch of mistakes because you get found out right away.

50
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:21,880
Yeah.

51
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,759
Well, and, and the other thing too is looking at this

52
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,039
monetizing this attacker or essentially how do you gain benefit?

53
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,190
Like let's assume the attacker got in and was quiet,

54
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,570
how do you actually benefit from this attack?

55
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,580
And so one obvious answer is crypto mining, right? That is actually like

56
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:41,220
uh like those things with the hostile Docker images or not,

57
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,929
let me rephrase because Docker images with crypto

58
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,509
miners are actually a legit thing.

59
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:48,089
Um And so basically what, what it turns out is, you know,

60
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,649
people deploy stuff like kubernetes with no

61
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,369
authentication enabled.

62
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,139
Uh and, and publicly on the internet and of course, Attackers find it

63
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:57,610
connect to it and they're like, who, you know,

64
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,660
free resources to run virtual machines.

65
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,970
Well, again, how can I monetize that in a way that

66
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:05,300
doesn't attract a lot of attention like while spamming and denial service

67
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,949
attracts a lot of attention. Well, you know, crypto mining, right?

68
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,979
-- People are
-- like ransomware. I

69
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,139
mean, ransomware is in your face,

70
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:13,039
crypto

71
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:13,649
mining

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,460
so

73
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,740
much.

74
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,570
Um So, yeah, how do you monetize an attack like this?

75
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,699
And it's reasonably difficult, like if it was part of a targeted attack? Sure,

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,210
you know, then it would have just been a stepping stone like, oh,

77
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,009
we have an organization that we know uses Gen two's github.

78
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,179
OK. Let's attack them via that. Now, that would be super clever, but

79
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,309
clearly, that's not what happened here.

80
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,419
-- Now, this was clearly malicious.
-- Yeah.

81
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:38,800
Well, and that's what I mean then, then sort of the next thing is, well,

82
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:39,690
if you can't monetize it.

83
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,380
That typically means it's like vandalism.

84
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,410
Right?

85
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,320
Like a great example was there was a porta potty or a playground

86
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,729
that we go to and somebody went full van Gogh mode inside,

87
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:49,490
you know.

88
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,860
And like, yeah, exactly. It's exactly what you think

89
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,929
-- the medium was.
-- Yeah, exactly.

90
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,070
It was, I was like, my son wanted to go and I, I, like, popped it up because I check,

91
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,410
you know, because these things happen.

92
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,809
And I was like, no, he's like, I want to look, I want to look, I'm like, you don't.

93
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,759
And so I, I open it and he's like,

94
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:07,929
uh and he runs away

95
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,440
and then of course his brothers, like I want to see what it is. I'm like,

96
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,259
don't. But whatever

97
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,619
lesson learned, everyone line up

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,410
-- pretty
-- much,

99
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,140
let's all go wash our hands. Now,

100
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,640
the thing that gets me is like most vandalism isn't that

101
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:22,660
clever.

102
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,049
And by definition, the attack on this was actually,

103
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:28,559
I don't want to say super clever but reasonably clever,

104
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,059
-- you
-- know. Yeah, but you could still argue it wasn't clever enough.

105
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,600
No, no.

106
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,279
But I mean, the, the attack itself wasn't like, you know, they,

107
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,940
they had some known vulnerability that they didn't patch, right?

108
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,170
That that's always the classic one, right where an organization literally

109
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,760
gets popped because

110
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,170
they like literally

111
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:46,600
were, you know, running Java struts or,

112
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,959
you know, running a uh like a database just open to the public.

113
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,660
Alright. Well, let's do this, then let's gen to, to their credit.

114
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,019
I'm,

115
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,299
I'm going to praise these guys immensely as

116
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,880
they've been remarkably open about the incident.

117
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,709
And if you go to the show notes,

118
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,679
there's a link to a wiki page where they have documented

119
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:08,359
kind of everything. Why don't, why don't we walk through some of this?

120
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,959
Because there's, there's actually some really interesting stuff.

121
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,190
On one note, I would say even more importantly, again, like an air incident,

122
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,399
they've also documented what they're going to do to fix and prevent this.

123
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,070
And it looks like they're actually executing on that.

124
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,480
And that's, that's the biggest thing for me is like, did OK.

125
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,670
Have we learned anything from this and, and

126
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:27,390
have we applied those lessons? Right?

127
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,829
Because I see lots of organizations learn lessons and then just keep doing things

128
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:33,329
the way they've always done it. So,

129
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,230
yeah. Um I do have to say this is a beautiful write up. So do you want to start us off?

130
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,390
Cool to kind of start at the top. They, they note from

131
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,130
April 8th to June 27th, there was somebody probing github

132
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:49,970
accounts,

133
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:51,670
which

134
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,190
I mean, I don't know, man,

135
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,350
I feel like every github organization probably has a gazillion probes every day of,

136
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,600
of users, right?

137
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,279
I've actually never bothered to look at them

138
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,179
mostly because we generally almost everybody has two fa

139
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,279
enabled and actually we will be forcing it shortly

140
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,959
and, and we'll get to that.

141
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:17,480
Yeah. OK. So, so we'll kind of start out then. So it sounds like June 28th

142
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,440
is kind of the day

143
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:20,880
everything happened

144
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,290
right where

145
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,970
it seems like it sounds like an attacker got in with a bad password.

146
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,100
And obviously when we say bad password, we just mean

147
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,660
it's either reused or a really crappy password.

148
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,049
What it sounded like is that this person was

149
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:39,000
using sort of a password formula to generate passwords.

150
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,420
And so I've seen people, you know, where they're, like, pick a, you know, like,

151
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:46,489
pick a name and a number and then you, like, append the name of the site to the password

152
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,790
is,

153
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,929
uh, not a, not so terrible if the password is hashed.

154
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:52,850
Right.

155
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,910
But if the attacker gets that clear text password and see, like, you know,

156
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,559
Jon Snow 1989

157
00:06:57,989 --> 00:06:58,059
or,

158
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:58,390
um,

159
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,769
you know, then they, then they maybe guess that if they replace Facebook with github

160
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,880
and try to log in at github,

161
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,269
-- then it might work.
-- Right.

162
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,769
No, we're going to say every password that isn't a password manager.

163
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,000
-- Password is terrible.
-- I

164
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:11,440
agree.

165
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:11,959
100%.

166
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,369
Ok.

167
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:12,850
Good.

168
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,130
Just so we're clear.

169
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:14,579
No.

170
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,079
But, and, you know,

171
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,769
this is an example of people trying to be

172
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,209
clever in ways that are actually not that clever.

173
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,869
Right. Exactly. Exactly. So, anyway, it sounds like then the attacker gets in

174
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,109
and they gain administrative access

175
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:28,489
because

176
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:28,910
the

177
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,089
administrative,

178
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:34,829
that's, that's my assumption. And they don't, they don't say that but

179
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,510
they sort of strongly implied because they

180
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,510
talk about cleaning up old debt accounts.

181
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:40,950
So, you know,

182
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:44,730
so anyway, and then they, they create

183
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,570
new accounts, which obviously is exactly the right way to do it because when you're,

184
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:53,279
when you're mounting some sort of an attack and you're using an existing account,

185
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,329
you,

186
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,809
you run the risk of the individual you're after

187
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,190
or rather the individual you just attack noticing some shenanigans. Right.

188
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,839
So like get in, create a new account. Get out.

189
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:09,359
Right. I mean, yeah,

190
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,829
actually essentially it's exactly what it is, right? It's a back door, fair enough.

191
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,570
Ok.

192
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,399
So anyway, so m accounts get added and, and the thing,

193
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,320
I think that's the most interesting is it says

194
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,100
they, they add a malicious commit

195
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,890
and this malicious commit is literally 20 minutes

196
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,190
after they first get access where they,

197
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,980
they looks like they, they tell

198
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:37,460
the, the gen two repository to RM dash RF slash star,

199
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,190
which is

200
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,450
as everyone knows that delete all of the files on your desk in theory. Right.

201
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,080
And

202
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,950
I mean,

203
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,119
I feel like if you do this in 20 minutes, you knew what you wanted to do. Right.

204
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:55,710
Well, what's interesting to me is that like, there's,

205
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:59,109
there's way more subtle and annoying ways to mess up a system

206
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,309
than just an RM hyphen RF. Right.

207
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,869
I, I feel like it is the,

208
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:07,179
the unlearned man's solution,

209
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:09,729
right? Because everyone knows

210
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:12,359
you DD garbage to the disk.

211
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,690
-- That's how
-- you do it,

212
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,859
you put that in one of the start up scripts.

213
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,159
So the next time they reboot they're like, oh,

214
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:21,400
this seems to be taking a while but whatever weird stuff happens and then, you know,

215
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,200
five minutes later they realize they have a brick,

216
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:24,890
well, not a brick system but

217
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,719
they better have backups. Right.

218
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:33,150
Did you know, the, the last time I needed to kill a drive, I booted it

219
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,409
and then ID D to the desk while it was running just to see.

220
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:42,479
-- And it finished. I was
-- shocked because everything is in memory.

221
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,479
-- So as long as you don't
-- write, right?

222
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:49,640
I, I expected something to blow up though before it finished.

223
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,030
Well, that's part of the beauty, right? If it's running and it's in memory, it should

224
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,320
keep running.

225
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,359
But, uh, yeah, it's, well,

226
00:09:56,369 --> 00:10:00,400
and the other thing is to an RM I hyphen RF is like very obviously hostile.

227
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:01,369
Like there's no,

228
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,659
right. It's not like

229
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,219
it's

230
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:03,489
not,

231
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,679
yeah, it's, I mean, well, the, my favorite example being,

232
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,250
what was it like some driver or game that like

233
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,900
did an RM hyphen RF slash user slash something coming,

234
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:12,580
coming something

235
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,710
and they like stuck a space in there somewhere.

236
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:18,109
So it like nuked slash user or whatever. Remember

237
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:22,859
-- it was like steam or something?
-- That wasn't a game, it was,

238
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:27,200
didn't that just happen with it? Wasn't that MP M's problem or something?

239
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,840
-- Yeah. But basically, I mean,
-- we talked about this in

240
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:31,369
the past.

241
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:34,109
I mean, you know, then it becomes more of a whoop.

242
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:37,359
Somebody, like, made a really bad fat finger. Not like, ok, somebody added RM

243
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,559
hyphen

244
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,940
RF. That's slash

245
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:39,460
-- star.
-- Yeah.

246
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,159
Right.

247
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:41,109
Right. Right. So,

248
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:48,440
and, and now the, the other thing, I don't know how gen two does this but I know

249
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:56,159
that on many systems. RM dash RF stuff doesn't always do what you think it does

250
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,989
and, and in many

251
00:10:58,539 --> 00:10:59,859
and many modern unixes,

252
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,989
they assume you just did something really dumb and they don't let you.

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,510
And, and there's, there have been many arguments whether this is good or bad.

254
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,229
But,

255
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:12,330
but from what I've heard that command does not work by default on a GEN two system.

256
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,150
So even

257
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:19,219
even the people who happened to pull down this bad commit and tried to run a build,

258
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,869
it didn't do anything to them,

259
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,030
which is, which is cool. And, and then in

260
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,349
this timeline, literally half an hour after this event started,

261
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,679
the, the gen two people contacted github

262
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:35,710
basically to say something fishy is going on.

263
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:36,619
Well, and,

264
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,109
and that's actually something where this is kind of an example

265
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:41,669
of where the industry fails is they had private contacts with github

266
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,289
because they knew people there, right?

267
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:46,559
If they had to come in through the front door, like some random schmuck,

268
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,950
this would have taken days or weeks if anything happened,

269
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:51,059
it, it probably would have

270
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,429
like I for example, I know

271
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:56,369
somebody who actually uh their

272
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,059
Gmail account,

273
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:58,369
uh

274
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:01,229
essentially a pile of data within it got deleted by accident

275
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:03,159
and they knew somebody high up enough at

276
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,270
Google that they actually got their data back.

277
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,229
That's like you, that's like that's unicorn levels of knowledge of people.

278
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,940
And that's kind of where I fear this thing with github

279
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:11,750
comes in is that

280
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:15,590
it kind of sounds because they were able to get github to respond,

281
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,059
you know, so quickly and, you know, with details,

282
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,210
what I'm saying is, don't, don't kind of expect that to be the normal case.

283
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,140
You are correct.

284
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,289
But here's the other side of that I like to think about is

285
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:34,090
I, if you're a project like, like GEN two or you're,

286
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,950
you're an organization of some sort,

287
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:42,280
part of the value in hiring good people is you, you're hiring their role

288
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,289
attacks as well.

289
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:44,590
And

290
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,690
I mean, I, I, I've done this more times than I can count for, for, you know,

291
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,030
my last couple jobs without question,

292
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,000
if something happens and it's like I know this person, let me just go

293
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,349
and in 10 minutes, I get more done than you get done in two weeks.

294
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,450
And,

295
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:06,020
and I, I do agree that companies need a nice front door.

296
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,530
You know, the front door shouldn't be hostile if it's hostile,

297
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,340
you have other problems.

298
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:14,940
The problem is when you have a bunch of crazy people throwing poop at your front door

299
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:17,049
and, and Yes. And I imagine

300
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:20,500
Github's front door has an enormous pile of poop.

301
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:23,729
I, I have no doubt because you, I mean, I mean,

302
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:25,559
I see this all the time where people just,

303
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,289
you end up with,

304
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,210
with, like I'm not saying they're bad people but they,

305
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,729
they come in with requests that are,

306
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,359
are clearly not properly researched.

307
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:37,880
And when you, you suggest, you know,

308
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,489
maybe you should go and look over here and because

309
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,309
you didn't tell them exactly how to solve their problem,

310
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:45,280
they start yelling at you and it's like

311
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,419
this isn't a

312
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,159
good response.

313
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't want to talk to you anymore person.

314
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,500
And, and when you're paying someone money, it's

315
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,479
impossible to do that

316
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,080
in many instances. However, I'm going to say

317
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,400
if you're an organization hiring security people,

318
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,359
the rolodex is part of what you're hiring and, and I truly believe that

319
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:11,799
when, when you're in, if you have senior leadership and they don't have a rolodex,

320
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,530
you don't have senior leadership, that's kind of the way I view that.

321
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,169
Right. And someone like Gen Two

322
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,200
almost certainly has contacts up the one

323
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:18,919
zoo

324
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,840
community

325
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:22,625
driven organization. Right. Because they're open source

326
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:25,414
who and what they are.

327
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:30,684
Exactly. Exactly. And so I, I don't think that's unexpected or unreasonable.

328
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:37,054
In fact, if they didn't have a backdoor into github, I would be sad for, for Gen Two.

329
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,155
Right.

330
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,135
And that's one of those things. It's like

331
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:42,525
if you don't just call,

332
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:46,234
ok, I will help you out open source project.

333
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:47,565
But anyway, anyway,

334
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,609
and, and like this is,

335
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,750
I'm impressed,

336
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,190
I'm impressed by how fast this went because I've seen many incidents take

337
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,570
much longer than half.

338
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,979
But in fairness, this was a pretty simple

339
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,400
incident. I mean,

340
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,599
let's, let's ok. Now, here's the point where we, I get a little me,

341
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:06,109
all right. Bring it.

342
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,830
G

343
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,820
two made some really painfully like rookie level

344
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,109
mistakes. So

345
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:13,130
number one,

346
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,380
somebody had

347
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,539
bad passwords

348
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,320
because no offense.

349
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:18,559
If everyone has bad

350
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:18,969
password,

351
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,830
if somebody can guess if somebody can see one of your passwords

352
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,710
and then guess another password for a different site based on that,

353
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,530
you have bad passwords,

354
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,260
right? They should be random.

355
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,580
I guarantee

356
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,960
in, in any organization that is more than 30% of the pass.

357
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,330
-- So
-- basically there, it boils down to use a password manager. Uh Number two github

358
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:43,090
supports two fa they support phones, they support the, um,

359
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:44,190
what is it?

360
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,320
Otphotp, whatever the heck the app is, you know,

361
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,169
the QR code and you get the time based rolling code,

362
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,849
they support

363
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,929
printed recovery codes, they support UBI

364
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:54,929
keys.

365
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,729
I think there might be one other option. I can't remember it off hand.

366
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,039
But the point is they support like all the normal ration.

367
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,599
-- Well, and when I say phones,
-- did you know that I got my first U two F tokens from github

368
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:12,770
because when they first started supporting U two F, they had a special with UB key

369
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:16,195
for $5. I bought, I think three of them for $5.

370
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,914
And it's got, I've got the hash cat logo on the back of it even.

371
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:21,775
And I don't use it anymore because now that I have UB

372
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:23,914
four it does U two F but yeah,

373
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:25,775
I still have it and I carry it with me

374
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,715
because funny enough I keep thinking maybe there's some site,

375
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:31,614
I forgot I plugged this into and I better keep it just

376
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,635
in case and I haven't used it in like a year.

377
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:38,744
Yeah, it's like back in the day ebay used to do Rs a tokens for five bucks.

378
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:40,229
And, uh,

379
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:40,940
you know,

380
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,030
but yeah, so, like rookie mistake number two is not

381
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,309
at least encouraging or required

382
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:50,849
to fa across the org, especially for admin users.

383
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:51,900
That's,

384
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:54,349
that needs to be

385
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:54,830
II,

386
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,119
I feel like if you're any sort of reasonable sign

387
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,190
and actually look if you're anybody to FA on github,

388
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,440
I think it's like,

389
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:03,700
so,

390
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:03,859
and

391
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,030
it's just, it's part of how the world is now. If,

392
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,589
if the site supports

393
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:10,709
two fa

394
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,689
second two factor authentication,

395
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:15,358
assuming it's not some really stupid form of two fa,

396
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,829
like my bank has two fa it's two passwords, right?

397
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,589
It's a password and then a secret question.

398
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,368
That's not two fa,

399
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:25,178
well, it's, it's two factors but they're identical and

400
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:25,608
the same

401
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:25,898
failure.

402
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:26,398
That's

403
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:28,098
no, that's one factor.

404
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:28,639
That's one

405
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:32,788
factor. Two questions. One factor. No, Kurt, it's what's in your head.

406
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,068
Both of them are what's in your head.

407
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,719
So. Exactly. Right.

408
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:40,369
So, if, if they support anything reasonable now and the other,

409
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,819
my other concern too is like, I think Facebook or I think it was Facebook.

410
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,540
I had to share my phone number with them and of course,

411
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,800
then I started kind of getting spams and I had to figure out how to set my,

412
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,569
don't contact my phone settings in my Facebook account. Right.

413
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,390
But in general, you know, most of these companies aren't that crazy abusive.

414
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,810
So, yeah, I would say number two, if the site supports two fa

415
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:00,869
you,

416
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,349
you forcibly enable it and if it doesn't support two

417
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,729
fa you might want to look at a different site.

418
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,310
I, I agree with that. I think there's no excuse to not use

419
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,079
to fa like, make it, make it happen.

420
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:14,829
-- And
-- then the third really massive mistake and this is

421
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,989
one open ssh made that resulted in like key disclosures,

422
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,599
not removing dead stuff.

423
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,689
That's so

424
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,290
hard. I

425
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,910
know. But so, you know, it's, but it's one of those things where it's actually,

426
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:29,319
it's like flossing. It's actually not that hard.

427
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,000
The problem is you have to do it every day.

428
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,160
I, I do floss every day.

429
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,400
You're the first person I've met outside of my dentist's office staff

430
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:37,260
that

431
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,619
-- I believe.
-- Yeah, they, they, my dentist is shocked.

432
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,290
It's funny because I tell them they said,

433
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,359
do you floss I say every day and you can tell

434
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,520
they don't really believe me until they look at my,

435
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,280
until they look at my teeth like, oh you do floss every day said I told you I do.

436
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,430
Yeah.

437
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:54,280
And, and that's part of it like I just, you know,

438
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,510
recently went through account cleanups, you know, with the CS A and

439
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:59,199
there was one or two old ones that,

440
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:00,599
you know, needed to be nuked off.

441
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:03,550
I mean, we'd already suspended them but we just hadn't removed them, removed them.

442
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:03,739
But,

443
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,959
you know, that's one thing like I am super fascist

444
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,489
about, for example, looking through, uh, the, you know,

445
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,349
the logins because most of these services support that.

446
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,400
Now they'll tell you when the last time a user logged in is

447
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:18,560
so, you know, sort by age and, you know, anything over six months old,

448
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,880
you, you have to give me a reason not to nuke this.

449
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,329
I was just working with,

450
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,119
with something the other day and I can't remember what this was to save my life.

451
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,189
But it had an option to say that if someone

452
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,849
hasn't logged in after a certain amount of time,

453
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,410
just like lock the account.

454
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:34,650
That's awesome.

455
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,189
Yeah.

456
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,949
Well, and by definition, if the user isn't using that account, you know,

457
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,469
I also want to close it because it saves us a few bucks every month.

458
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,300
So it's, it's basically, it's, it's like flossing.

459
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,689
It's actually not a lot of work to go nuke an account out of a system typically.

460
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:49,400
But it is one of those things where, yeah, you have to stay on top of it.

461
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,670
-- But
-- no, it, it, it is a lot of work and, and I think flossing is a great example.

462
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,339
You have to do something about that. And not only that Kurt, I could have,

463
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,319
I could have, I mean, I have a github

464
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:04,920
account. I use my github account all the time.

465
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:08,310
And if I was a member of, of GEN two,

466
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,390
does it tell me the last time I used a gen two resource or just the last time?

467
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,040
-- I
-- actually

468
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,829
looking to see if

469
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:16,000
github

470
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:20,199
-- hints me that you don't
-- know. So don't, don't be all high and mighty on here.

471
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:21,869
All right. That's, this is my point.

472
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:22,910
And, and

473
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,310
I'm going to compare this to flossing.

474
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:30,410
I floss every day and every day, I think I don't want to floss today every single day.

475
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:34,130
I don't know why I just think it every day

476
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,010
and this is even worse where it's like, oh, I should look at that. I'll do it tomorrow.

477
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,839
It's

478
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,810
very easy to put this up. This is an example of

479
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,979
this has to be fixed with tools,

480
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:48,699
expecting people to do this on a regular basis is failure is the only option.

481
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:50,060
It has to be tools.

482
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,050
Well, the problem is, it's a, it's a much more subtle process even it's, you know,

483
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,219
it's part of the exit process.

484
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:57,180
And also how, especially with something like gen two,

485
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,959
how do you define what constitutes leaving the organization?

486
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:01,579
Like, what if somebody goes silent for three months?

487
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,229
You know, it's obviously with companies, it's a bit easier, you know,

488
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,939
when we stop paying them, we boot them out.

489
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:08,670
But I do agree that, like, I would like to see every

490
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,260
sort of website service thing that I use,

491
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,969
be able to give me a list of all the users I have allowed in.

492
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:14,550
And like,

493
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,510
when is the last time they actually touched it

494
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,349
or used it or logged in or did something?

495
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,130
So that, yeah, I can flush everybody

496
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,390
more than three months old and ideally make it like

497
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,839
a flag somewhere where I just set it and forget

498
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,420
it just automated.

499
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:26,910
Yeah.

500
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,640
Well, that's what I mean, like, ideally, right, maybe that's, you know,

501
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,540
something we need to add to the cwe list, lack of, you know,

502
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,079
automated account lockout slash removal due to an activity.

503
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,229
I, I think it's necessary. Right.

504
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:44,300
I, I think without it, your failure is the only way it's going to end. So,

505
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,500
-- so anyway,
-- anyway, sort of, um,

506
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,140
those were the three main failures I would say that they made.

507
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,459
And I mean,

508
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,689
the good news is that also the way the attacker made the get commit was super noisy.

509
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:58,579
Right. There's ways they could have added the get commit. There were much,

510
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,319
well, it's not much that would have been super quiet

511
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,170
but the way they did, I think they did a forced merge or something.

512
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,109
So like every single person, you know, would have seen that like noisy get message,

513
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,150
I forget what it says

514
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,630
and they probably like me would have ignored it and be like whatever,

515
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,459
whatever force merge.

516
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:13,900
Great. Like just work. Damn it.

517
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,109
Um

518
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,040
And uh yeah, I mean, the good news is with get, you know, it's

519
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:25,589
git is really easy to roll back to a previous state.

520
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,300
So all you got to do is figure out like what's

521
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,560
my last known good state and just roll back to that

522
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,959
end of story.

523
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:36,829
Well, not only that, the other beautiful thing Git does and other

524
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,939
source code management systems don't do.

525
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:42,339
This is, let's say I go back in time and change a git commit.

526
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:44,479
I've now ruined

527
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,329
-- all future git commits
-- or you broke Shaw,

528
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,640
which probably didn't happen.

529
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,719
-- Yes,
-- I could totally do that.

530
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,069
But you know what I mean? It, it's comparable to the Blockchain

531
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,469
in terms of everything has to happen in the right order.

532
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,189
It has very strong internal state

533
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,810
kind of control and reporting

534
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,390
and it's,

535
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,939
and here's the best part, it's really easy to use.

536
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,979
That's the real trick I think.

537
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,329
And it, it has to be, I mean,

538
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,800
I'll, I'll go back to your list.

539
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,449
You pointed out three things, one of which I think you can blame on, on Gen,

540
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,239
which is

541
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,410
able to factor off which they've done.

542
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,000
But like strong passwords, you can't enforce that. And

543
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,859
watching for old accounts again, that has to be tooling. That's, that's github's

544
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:28,689
fault.

545
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:31,530
Actually strong passwords you can,

546
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,540
the provider can enforce now because for example, they could use that.

547
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,520
What is it? 500 billion broken passwords?

548
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,589
That's, you know, public now. Right. Remember the thing?

549
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,890
The guy built a cloud flare worker. So you can check

550
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,560
the, have I been pwned? Try

551
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,219
hunts website? Yes.

552
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:48,420
Exactly.

553
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,229
Yeah.

554
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,160
And well, more to the point,

555
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,640
the guy built like a cloud flare worker with an API so

556
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,910
that you can in tens of milliseconds when somebody enters a password,

557
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,589
say

558
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:58,189
like, yeah,

559
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:00,829
we've seen that password somewhere in this list of 500 billion passwords.

560
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,069
So, no, you're not allowed to use it.

561
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,869
And again, I would say that is probably something everybody should be doing now,

562
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,250
if they do passwords,

563
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:12,170
you know, and not like o

564
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,699
author Sam or something,

565
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,099
maybe,

566
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,579
I mean, it, it's more complicated than that.

567
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,410
Well, ok, let me, let me point out too. Something to remember is github

568
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,660
is also an identity provider. So these accounts kind of matter.

569
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:30,670
Yes. In their case, I think you could argue that have I been po passwords? But I mean,

570
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,699
the solution is still password managers?

571
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,869
Oh, I agree.

572
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,469
But I mean,

573
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:38,880
this kind of forces people into using a password manager because literally

574
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:41,829
pretty much any terrible password a person

575
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,869
will pick has already been picked and used

576
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:44,319
and ped

577
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:47,030
and in all the good passwords, people picks

578
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:50,920
picked are in, have I been pwned? I mean, that's part of the problem is,

579
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:56,239
and basically at this point, any human generated password is probably in the,

580
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,880
have I been pwned database?

581
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,280
I mean, for real? Right. And, and you know what's going to happen

582
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,239
is

583
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,670
if I

584
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,020
have my password and it shows up and says, oh, you're on this list,

585
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,869
you know what I'm gonna do?

586
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,010
I'm gonna add a one and all of a sudden, pow,

587
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,069
it's not on the list.

588
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,489
Right.

589
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,790
So, like, even that doesn't necessarily fix the problem two factor off,

590
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,189
fixes the problem,

591
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,969
-- well,
-- enforce two factor off.

592
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:20,819
Right.

593
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,579
Right.

594
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,939
So, so anyway,

595
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:28,329
and then you continue reading in the list and it's actually

596
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,959
kind of funny because it sounds like on the weekend github

597
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,550
wasn't very responsive,

598
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:36,489
which happens. I get it. I'm not going to blame him for that.

599
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,300
And then it looks like on July 3rd

600
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,640
gen two basically put all the pieces back together.

601
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,560
So it,

602
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,760
it really wasn't a very long outage.

603
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,280
It was definitely embarrassing for them, but they were very transparent.

604
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,959
My understand, like that's not the true source of their code.

605
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,130
It's like a mirror but just

606
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,280
available via

607
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,229
because it's really easy to do that.

608
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,609
Right. Right.

609
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,880
Exactly. Where it wasn't, it wasn't the one true source.

610
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,689
So that, that, that also helped. I'm sure with with a lot of this. But

611
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,180
I mean, fundamentally

612
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,959
I give them tons of credit. It was embarrassing. They were super open about it and,

613
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:11,900
and

614
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,310
they, they made the changes that I think they needed to make.

615
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:18,300
Right. They, they, they've been able to factor off,

616
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,530
well, force to factor off it's enabled by default.

617
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:23,709
But here, let me ask you a question

618
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,640
of all the organizations reading this

619
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,349
uh gen two wiki page describing the incident and what they're going to do.

620
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,150
What percentage of those that haven't already done this?

621
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,469
Do you think now will like what percentage of people reading this will go? Oh,

622
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,349
I can, you know, I should go enable because I,

623
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,229
I honestly didn't think you could force two factor off on github.

624
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,410
And I remember I tweeted that a while ago and then somebody pointed out that yes,

625
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,790
you can.

626
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,650
And I'm like, oh whoops,

627
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:51,849
because to put it bluntly like Google has this amazing web page.

628
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,704
It's a two factor off landing page where it's like, why should do this?

629
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,484
Why does it matter?

630
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:58,244
And then at the very bottom it says let's get started and it walks you through

631
00:26:58,255 --> 00:27:01,385
and it just makes it so easy and pain like my mom could do it.

632
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:03,984
That's, that's the gold standard, right? Can your parents do it?

633
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:05,064
And

634
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:07,464
github, I was like,

635
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:10,714
I didn't even know that was an option and I dug around the settings and I'm like,

636
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:11,385
oh yeah, look at that.

637
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:14,425
There, it is. The annoying part being is I can't enable it by user.

638
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,984
I can only turn it off or on for the whole organization.

639
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,119
90% of me agrees is actually the correct solution.

640
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,800
-- The 10% of you that has to deal with the real world is like, man, that's
-- annoying.

641
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,380
I know.

642
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:23,810
You know what,

643
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:27,969
I don't think there's a real excuse anymore to not be using two factor off.

644
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,560
So while it definitely gives a little bit of pain

645
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,339
automated accounts with read only access. Yeah, I know.

646
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:35,890
And, and there's like the API stuff you're supposed to be doing.

647
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,400
-- Can you?
-- Yeah, I was gonna say, can you just set those up to use API keys?

648
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:39,810
Yeah.

649
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:43,560
But I mean, it's just, you know, managing them and stuff becomes a bit more of a chore.

650
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:45,920
Somebody has to have the two of a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right.

651
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,150
Um But like I said,

652
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,109
the 90% of me actually agrees that just make it a switch for the organization

653
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,430
is the correct thing to do.

654
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:56,780
The 10% of me that is, is annoyed by that because that means I don't,

655
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,010
-- I can't be a lazy
-- barger.

656
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,160
Now, you asked what percentage of people are going to do something about this

657
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,750
-- that
-- have read this wiki page.

658
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,250
I would guess the number is 10% or less.

659
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,089
-- I wouldn't have gone that high
-- because

660
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,260
it's,

661
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:12,599
I said or less

662
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
I learned the answer.

663
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,540
I mean, here is the thing is

664
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,270
there are, first of all this, this page just describes what gen two did.

665
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,010
It doesn't give like real world advice, not like,

666
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,189
not like a high quality security podcast such as

667
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:27,589
this.

668
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,000
But, and, and we've already told people to do it.

669
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,829
And my guess is we might get 20% of our listeners just because I,

670
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,589
I suspect there's a certain,

671
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:41,430
we'll say interest in security that is lacking from the general public.

672
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,270
But

673
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,550
it's, it's, again, it's like flossing,

674
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,209
it's too easy to do it tomorrow.

675
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:47,969
Right.

676
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:48,920
And,

677
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,630
and I almost feel like this is one of

678
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,569
those things that at some point someone like github

679
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,040
is just going to have to pull the trigger and say everyone's using two factor

680
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,489
off. Now if you don't like it, go find someone else to work. Yeah.

681
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,430
Well, and the thing is, I mean, it's not like,

682
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:05,540
you know, they nuked your account but you just have to go enable two factor off.

683
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,920
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

684
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,040
Log in, enable to factor off. You don't want to factor off too bad.

685
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:12,589
Yeah.

686
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,430
And I would say that they provide the options that

687
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,290
don't require you to give them your phone number,

688
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,189
for example, which is,

689
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,989
that's, that's my only concern is places that support two factor off and,

690
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:24,310
and only support like the phone number. S MS stuff

691
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:27,099
-- drives me nuts and that's
-- not two factor

692
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,280
off.

693
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,979
It is.

694
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:32,040
Well, it's even worse now. Freaking Google. Which, which I won't lie.

695
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,469
It's a great feature but with,

696
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:37,189
with android messages now you can bring it up in your web browser.

697
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,760
And so

698
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:43,219
the, the irony is someone, was someone, a nonsecurity person I know was saying, oh,

699
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:46,170
look, now, I can just get my two factor off codes to my web browser.

700
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,380
I'm like that completely defeats the purpose

701
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,010
of two factor on.

702
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,800
Well, no, but it is a separate, it is a separate

703
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,560
-- pan until
-- it pops up in their web browser. Right?

704
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,310
Well, I don't know what CSO R,

705
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,500
what

706
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,500
S and CSO

707
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,369
-- rrf and whatnot protections they have.
-- It doesn't matter.

708
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,199
The point is when you, when you're using something like two factor S MS,

709
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:11,239
you need like a separate thing,

710
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:15,319
right? If it's all going to the same machine that doesn't count requiring.

711
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:16,400
So I just went in github

712
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,729
to enable this on the distributed weakness filing,

713
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:22,550
requiring two factor authentication will remove all users in the

714
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,030
distributed weakness filing organization who have not enabled it or

715
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:27,430
on their personal accounts,

716
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:30,709
one user will be removed from this organization and it is

717
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,089
like I said, it's an internal account or it's like a,

718
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:37,680
an internal account with read only access for um C I or whatever.

719
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,550
So I guess

720
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:41,310
-- they're gonna have to go fix that
-- sweet.

721
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,790
So, yeah, I,

722
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,650
I don't like that because I wish it would actually just

723
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,550
lock them out until they enable two fa on their account.

724
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,260
Kind of like what Google does, right?

725
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,140
Google is like, ok,

726
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,790
you have to go enable two fa and once you enable two fa I'll let you see your email.

727
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:57,760
Right. You know, it's got a gun to the, your email inbox.

728
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,170
But yeah, so that's not the, that's a little bit painful because, you know,

729
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,589
you can't enable it until you're willing to nuke a bunch of people's accounts,

730
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,930
which is kind of annoying but whatever.

731
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:09,719
Yeah, that's fair.

732
00:31:09,729 --> 00:31:13,329
-- But, but
-- yeah, I, I, I'm getting to the point now where I agree, we essentially,

733
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:14,609
yeah.

734
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,989
Well, it's like your car,

735
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,459
it has a light that goes on and I think most cars ding or bing now, if you don't put the,

736
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:22,390
if the driver doesn't put their seatbelt on.

737
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,890
Right. And it will, like, annoy you to death until you do it.

738
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,239
Yeah, exactly.

739
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:30,150
You know, and, and same thing with the airbags and whatnot

740
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,869
and, and I, I think it just, it has to be like that. I'm sorry,

741
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,859
I agree. I agree completely.

742
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:40,869
And, and I see no better way to end it than, than just to say that is like,

743
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,780
II, I could tell you all to enable, to factor off many of you won't.

744
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:49,500
And, and I hope the day comes soon when just, there's no choice it,

745
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,380
it's going to be like that and, and that's the way it is.

746
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,729
It's happening with us selling TLS. Right. Chrome. Is moving ahead with in what

747
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,010
is it this? Oh, it's this month that they will mark all http websites as insecure and

748
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:04,060
same deal. Exactly.

749
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,489
I, I approve.

750
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,369
I just hope it doesn't take 10 years.

751
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,839
It, it might,

752
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:12,410
but I think two factor off is the,

753
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,079
it's the next great battle where we're going to see very similar things and

754
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,689
I think it's getting close, man, but at the same time, the day it happens,

755
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:21,810
it's going to be huge.

756
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,180
I think at a minimum, it has to happen for these ident

757
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,630
identity providers

758
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:27,380
because

759
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,010
like my linkedin account and my Facebook account,

760
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,650
but you know, those accounts,

761
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,160
they are just too important to people that that's who they are online

762
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:39,260
and it's how they log into other systems. So like, yeah, I think at this point we,

763
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:42,060
you know, they have to bite the bullet and do it.

764
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:46,959
Yep. Yep. Yep. I, I agree 100%. All right, sweet. Well, thank you, Kurt.
