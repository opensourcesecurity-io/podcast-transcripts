Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 143 with myself,

1
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,970
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,220
-- Josh Pressers.
-- I'm excited for this one.

3
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:18,239
Kurt has something special and he won't tell me what it is, which is as, as

4
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,059
two huge advantages, I must say first is number one,

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,190
I had nothing to prepare. So I've done nothing.

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,950
And number two is just the,

7
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,120
the ultimate excitement of not knowing what's going to happen.

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,129
I'll give you a hint.

9
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,259
What was that was that? Did you hit something?

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,799
Well, something hit.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,200
That was me dropping a phone book.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,009
You dropped a phone book. You have a phone book.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,229
Yeah, they delivered a

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,520
yellow pages to my house the other day and I was pretty sure.

15
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:46,500
So the way it works locally,

16
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:49,610
if the I don't even know if the white pages exist anymore.

17
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,779
But the last I knew was that you had to sign

18
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,959
up for the white pages like you had to ask for one

19
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,169
and the yellow pages you opted out of right.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,470
You got it by default and you could opt out

21
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,200
and II I thought I opted out but they delivered one

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,439
and it's really interesting

23
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,569
because have you actually ever read a phone book?

24
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,800
I

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,849
did when I was young.

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,970
I mean, I, I guess I used it, I wouldn't call it reading material necessarily.

27
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,120
I actually read it because

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,550
-- this is the, basically, this is the weirdest
-- thing you have so little to do

29
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,209
it.

30
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,819
I didn't read the whole thing. Well, ok.

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,334
Number one, this yellow pages is only four, it's not even 400 pages of content.

32
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:30,855
Ok. And I live in a metro area with a million people.

33
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:31,694
Right.

34
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:33,985
What's, but what's really interesting for a couple of things?

35
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:35,694
Normally this phone book is trying to be a website

36
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:39,694
on the front of it is 200 plus smart tips, high energy eating your dental health,

37
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:42,205
hiring a contractor and cut home utility costs.

38
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:44,855
Plus out and about Edmonton's diverse food scene.

39
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:46,665
It's missing like you'll never,

40
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:48,574
you'll never believe number seven.

41
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:49,464
Exactly.

42
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:50,095
And then,

43
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:53,764
and, and then like inside of it, it's great because you'll, you'll look up a topic

44
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:57,550
and it will be like, uh, go see whatever the topic is like here.

45
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:00,720
Hot water heater and tanks, see water heaters,

46
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,180
which is like at the opposite end of the phone book.

47
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:04,019
Ok.

48
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,179
So number one, like this is clearly a dying industry because of the 400 pages,

49
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,050
30 of the pages are plumbers

50
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,860
-- that doesn't shock me.
-- 10 pages of restaurants and eight pages of

51
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:14,660
dentures.

52
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:14,679
Uh,

53
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,330
I'm surprised there's only eight of dentures since their

54
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:21,179
target demographic probably also needs dentures or sorry.

55
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,580
-- Denture, its denture is, I've never seen that word before.
-- Denture.

56
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,089
Iss, is that like the people who make dentures? I, I don't know.

57
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,589
And they, I mean, they're splurging on half page ads.

58
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,179
The funny thing is the dentists

59
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,690
are not buying ads.

60
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,880
Oh, no, there's a couple of dentists with ads. But the dentures,

61
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:41,380
man, they're, they're buying ads like you would not believe.

62
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,029
And

63
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,179
about the demographic here. I mean, let's face it.

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,699
So I get a phone book every year and you know what I do?

65
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,869
I pick it up off my porch and I dump it in the recycling bin.

66
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,520
I don't, I couldn't tell you what's in it. I don't look at it.

67
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:57,139
I don't care because why would I want that?

68
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,149
Well, so here's what's most interesting is there's the, the 400 pages of content

69
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:02,110
and

70
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,630
at the back there's like this helpful stuff of

71
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,509
like how to dial a long distance number,

72
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,509
which is funny because we have just default 10 digit dialing now.

73
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,830
But there's actually some really interesting stuff at the back. So,

74
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,830
uh, my favorite part is number one

75
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,710
obscene or harassing calls.

76
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,160
The best way to deal with these calls is to hang up.

77
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,520
So even the phone company knows, don't feed the trolls

78
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:27,440
and number two. Have you actually ever,

79
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,720
did you know if you have a landline? You

80
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,600
there is actually a call trace function.

81
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,080
Uh What do you mean call trace like? Is that the what star 69 where you dial back or?

82
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,679
No? That's the, um,

83
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,330
well, that's the, the, the callback thing.

84
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,440
Um,

85
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,860
so number one, if you have a landline, well, when I say landline it's a voice,

86
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:47,330
like everything's a voice line here locally.

87
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:50,080
But if you have a voice line through the phone company, uh, first of all,

88
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:52,949
they have a call screen list and you dial star 60,

89
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,350
there's voice prompts and then you, um, and this is the worst to activate,

90
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,880
call screen, dial one or three to deactivate call screen, dial zero or three.

91
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,429
Like who designed that?

92
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,610
Ok.

93
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,720
And so you can basically call screen, you can,

94
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:09,000
you can set your phone like the phone company at their end to, to screen your calls.

95
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:11,119
You're maybe thinking of the uh the,

96
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,759
the callback thing where you dial star or whatever.

97
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,880
But no, they actually have a call trace thing where

98
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,410
hang up for several seconds, then pick up and listen for a dial tone, dial star 57,

99
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,000
a recording will guide you through the steps,

100
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,589
write down the date and time of the calls plus anything that was heard.

101
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,839
A recording will instruct you where to report successful traces.

102
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,459
So they basically made it so tracing the call because you know,

103
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,820
caller id is worthless now, right?

104
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:33,019
Like I get,

105
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,660
I get Chinese uh the Chinese kidnapping phone calls constantly from, from my phone,

106
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,059
you know, area code, which is obviously spooked.

107
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:43,500
I've sadly never gotten one. I want to troll them so bad

108
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:47,204
-- and it just, it never happens to me.
-- It's a, it's a recorded message.

109
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:47,255
Oh,

110
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:48,964
that's less exciting then.

111
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:49,924
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

112
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,825
They also have the rules about the

113
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,885
unwanted telephone or fax telemarketing calls and,

114
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,994
and what made me laugh there was, there's that article last week about the FCC,

115
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,204
right?

116
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,024
They've issued, what was it? $208 million of fines

117
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:02,325
to telemarketers. And guess how much they've collected

118
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:07,239
-- like $7 I assume
-- actually. Yeah. No, $7000.

119
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:07,809
You going

120
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,079
on?

121
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,970
-- And it's pretty close.
-- Yeah,

122
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,799
you had the first number, right? So,

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,359
and then there's a, there's, where was it? They, they actually have this like online

124
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,359
safety program

125
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,369
and they talk about it in the phone book for about half a page of very fine print

126
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,799
and then they don't give the URL.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,850
That's great. Good job everybody.

128
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,970
So I googled it.

129
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,089
And again, it's pretty fascinating because also in the phone book,

130
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,470
keep your personal email account.

131
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,609
Personal. Don't use your personal email account.

132
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,179
The one you use to connect with family,

133
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,119
friends and manage your business matters for social media, the activities,

134
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,500
eg Facebook online contest.

135
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,390
See now to me, I think for a lot of people, Facebook is

136
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,450
how they connect with their friends and family

137
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,470
seriously and, and just use the same password for them both. And you'll be fine.

138
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:55,070
Ok. Anyways, instead create a separate email account. Like Google Mail.

139
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:56,670
I like that. They, that's it.

140
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,429
Everybody's given up. Like, even in print it's like there's,

141
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,779
you know. Yeah, you go to Google for that.

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,799
Right. It's, it's on the internet.

143
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,630
If this email account is compromised,

144
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,500
your personal email account will still be intact.

145
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,859
So, not the worst piece of advice ever. But,

146
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,519
no, that's terrible advice.

147
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:16,399
-- I'm, I'm just gonna say it's terrible advice because the reality
-- is, well, no,

148
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,720
there's worse advice in here.

149
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,290
You're already using a service like gmail.

150
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:21,959
You're,

151
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,790
you're getting reasonable protections for the most part and

152
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,649
they're going to block most of the garbage.

153
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,890
So it doesn't matter. Except now you have two email addresses.

154
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:32,559
You have to probably remember two terrible passwords and

155
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,329
they're 99% of the time going to be the same

156
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,720
if you're the kind of person reading the phone book.

157
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,209
Yeah, a good, hey, a good password is

158
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,690
eight characters long and includes numbers, letters and symbols, eg star

159
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,399
and don't forget to change your passwords frequently.

160
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,339
Oh, yes. That's great advice.

161
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,399
Like, every couple of days I recommend, like,

162
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,695
if a password is more than three hours old, too old, you should totally change that.

163
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:55,494
Well, see, and they,

164
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:57,024
they get that don't use the same password

165
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:59,054
for your computer smartphone email and other accounts,

166
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,364
this is a jackpot for hackers

167
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,174
if you can't remember your passwords.

168
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:05,024
No, if you can't remember your passwords,

169
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:07,875
write them down and put them into a folder with an unrelated name.

170
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,734
Like vacations in your filing cabinet.

171
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:13,454
Never leave them out in the open or by your computer where everyone can see them.

172
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:14,774
Now, wait a second. Who,

173
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:18,239
like, my computer at home is like,

174
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,950
my kids and my partner can see it and I guess

175
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,529
the cleaner, if she was here and I left the room, which that would,

176
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,070
yeah,

177
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:29,190
I've never understood that whole concept of, don't put a, like a post it on your,

178
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,750
on your computer or whatever at home

179
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,010
because everyone will see it.

180
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,510
Well, no, your family can see and your family can hack you because they'll just,

181
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,290
you know,

182
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,329
they have physical access to all your stuff on an ongoing basis.

183
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,630
Now I get it an office, like,

184
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,670
in an open plan office probably don't write your user name and password down.

185
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,660
Put it on a post it note on your computer. Right.

186
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,519
But II, I just love that whole, you know,

187
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,660
like now we know to look in people's vacation folders

188
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,940
when we break into their house to get it,

189
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,700
-- their written down passwords
-- and, and that's why I keep mine in a file called,

190
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:55,809
not passwords.

191
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,980
-- So it's obvious what it is
-- but what's in the passwords file? Like a mouse trap.

192
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,119
That's a good idea.

193
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,959
It works in the movies.

194
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,630
I, I think you're right

195
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:10,149
where if you can't trust the people in your house. You have huge problems.

196
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,579
But my suspicion is this is one of those old, well, it's like they also said,

197
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:15,799
change your password often, right?

198
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:17,910
This is one of those old attitudes that

199
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,739
may never die because humans think it makes sense even though it doesn't.

200
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,220
-- Well, it's because
-- we wrote it down

201
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,779
and we'd have to change it if we wanted to change it. But, but it's written

202
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:27,929
down.

203
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,700
No, no, like Nist changed their guidance

204
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:31,320
and

205
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,419
I give them a ton of credit because it's hard to do.

206
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,880
Well, but Nist actually is in the, is in the, is in the business of, of, well,

207
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,859
science of,

208
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:42,158
oh, you know, this thing that we thought was right, was wrong. So

209
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:45,958
we, we actually do need to change what we're saying about this because, you know,

210
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:48,369
standards and technology, like, it's in the name,

211
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,799
what I really love is that it actually gets even kind of

212
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:55,818
worse and weirder on, on their online thing.

213
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:59,518
So I don't know what the acronym stands for. It's wise,

214
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,940
it's like the wise digital pledge and there, there are, uh,

215
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,820
the logos like a little owl.

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,919
Yeah, there's just some strange things.

217
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,460
Like they talk about setting up a Google alert for your name,

218
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,619
which is fantastic if you have a somewhat unique name,

219
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,229
right? But like, what if you're John Smith?

220
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,070
Good luck. And then they also talk about where was it,

221
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,450
uh, the whole cyberbullying thing.

222
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:26,489
And I'm not really clear because, I mean, ok, they have one good message which is,

223
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,849
-- like, don't, don't
-- cyberbully people or

224
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:31,450
kind of like, don't, don't,

225
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,260
don't be a bully.

226
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,729
Which? Ok. Yeah. No, I agree. Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,969
Like, is that, how, wait, so that's what we,

228
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:40,909
we just have to tell people to stop being a hoes on the internet and they will.

229
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:41,809
That seems

230
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:42,719
easy.

231
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,789
Well, yeah.

232
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,070
Yeah. So,

233
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,479
there we go. Problem solved also while you're at it. Stop being insecure. How about?

234
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,549
And then security solved also?

235
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,900
Yeah. Oh, I thought you meant insecure, like, in my emotional state.

236
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:59,830
Well, no, I mean, that's your own problem. That, that's another issue. But. Right.

237
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,979
Right. And, and maybe stop driving like a jerk.

238
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,090
I mean, while we're at it, why not?

239
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,549
Well, and they do, they do say intervene if you see it happening, intervene,

240
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,239
which I agree with.

241
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,700
Right. Like, I 100% agree with that.

242
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:12,380
Sure. But beyond that, I mean,

243
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:16,500
I, I, here's my, here's, I guess what really kind of annoys me

244
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:20,525
is I suspect is that actually the best we can do because I think that might be it.

245
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:26,244
I think given the current state of affairs the answer is yes. And I will.

246
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:29,684
So actually this is very topical given you bring this up.

247
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,804
So there's a guy I follow on Twitter named Chad Loder

248
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:39,905
and I forget off the top of my head, what his role is. He's the CEO of, of some company

249
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:43,604
and basically he's put together like a Twitter moment

250
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:50,450
of people who are giving death threats to a Muslim Senator in the United States

251
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:54,159
-- and comments on
-- whatever. Right.

252
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,049
And, and I looked at this and it is

253
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:00,450
horrifying what these people are saying and Twitter

254
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,729
doesn't do anything unless you report them.

255
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,489
And he's basically saying people please pick some out,

256
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,859
report them to Twitter because obviously I assume the more

257
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:10,690
people who report something as violating the terms of service,

258
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,940
the more weight it would have.

259
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,580
But at the same time, you look at these comments and like, holy crap.

260
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,190
If Twitter can't like automatically pick these out

261
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,349
-- what the heck guys were.
-- They don't want to.

262
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,700
-- Well, and yes, I think that's, and, and
-- again, and I, and I,

263
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,979
and I don't mean they don't want like, and

264
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,099
I know I shouldn't talk to the mental state of a corporation and say like, oh, well,

265
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,979
here's how they feel but clearly based on the fact they haven't done it,

266
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:36,809
they don't want to because for example,

267
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
remember that whole thing last week with tweeting out, what is it?

268
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,369
IC U 0.996

269
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:41,719
and,

270
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:43,840
and the Twitter client returns an error

271
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,599
because it's been, it's been blacklisted

272
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,989
like you can't tweet that term

273
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,950
and, and that also suggests

274
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,750
-- that they have the ability to do
-- these

275
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,510
-- things.
-- It doesn't suggest that it proves it.

276
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:57,190
Ok.

277
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,729
Yes.

278
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,460
Come on.

279
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,409
It doesn't suggest that's like,

280
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,940
that's like the guy that was setting cars on fire on white Aven,

281
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,039
there's video of him doing it and then being tackled to the ground and arrested

282
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,549
and, and I get that innocent until proven guilty and all that. But,

283
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,710
you know, I love that the papers are respectful enough to say, you know,

284
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,309
the alleged blah, blah, blah.

285
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,229
And it's like I get that we do that because we are, you know,

286
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,590
we are society and we are better than these people,

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,789
you know. But, but like when a company does this stuff, it's like,

288
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,020
uh let's see what happens if I try to tweet it.

289
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,880
Oh, it tweeted it now. They've unblocked it.

290
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,450
Oh, man. Interesting.

291
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,190
Yeah. Oh, but it doesn't make it a hot link.

292
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,530
Interesting. Yeah, I tweeted http sf

293
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:39,989
slash

294
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:43,469
is it 996 dot IC U or IC U 0.996.

295
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,340
Got

296
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,599
back.

297
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,200
Maybe you did it wrong.

298
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:46,469
Oh,

299
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,320
that's embarrassing.

300
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,059
Ok. Here we go. This, yeah, it's dot IC U tweet.

301
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,710
They've unblocked it. It works again.

302
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,479
I guess, I guess the people losing their minds online works once in a while.

303
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,549
But yeah, so speaking of Twitter, like, obviously they can block stuff,

304
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,900
they have the technology to block it.

305
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:04,270
They at a minimum to do like a blacklist

306
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,770
of like you can't say these words or URL S

307
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,270
and let's face it.

308
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,760
Like you don't need sophisticated machine learning to spot these death threats.

309
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,239
Because most of them are pretty,

310
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,469
pretty.

311
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,989
Yeah, they're out there,

312
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:18,739
I guess, reporting the stuff beyond that. What

313
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,590
I guess really? Is there anything we can do?

314
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,739
Especially assuming if these major platforms decide to do nothing?

315
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,070
No,

316
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,549
there, there really isn't.

317
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,250
And this is a frustrating aspect of society right now and this

318
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,369
is something actually you and I talk about a lot and I,

319
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,679
I'll, I'll open the window a bit into our, I

320
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,940
guess, ridiculous personal views on things is

321
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,270
you, you look at the way people used to act and for example,

322
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,510
if there were places that would be,

323
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,010
say outright racist or against certain groups or, or whatever,

324
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,520
and

325
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,859
you look at now where, you know,

326
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:58,539
everyone has the racist uncle that we only deal with at Thanksgiving.

327
00:13:58,789 --> 00:13:59,869
And historically,

328
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,020
a lot of these people didn't have platforms before and now

329
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,099
they have the internet where they can all come together.

330
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:05,640
And this is,

331
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,090
this is one of those things that you and

332
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:08,619
I always disagree on where you're talking about.

333
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,630
How do we help these people?

334
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,979
And I'm just like, I, I think they're a lost cause and I don't think we can save them.

335
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:17,469
And II, I really don't know the answer. I wish the answer wasn't give up.

336
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:21,945
There's nothing you can do. But I, I have a strong suspicion. It is and I think

337
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:24,844
it is up to us, I think as a society

338
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:28,364
to decide what to do about some of this and let's face it if we're

339
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:33,724
counting on the likes of Google and Facebook and Twitter to define how we handle,

340
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:36,945
I guess some of the negative aspects of society,

341
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:42,135
we have way bigger problems than those aspects. And that's kind of where we're at.

342
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:44,224
So we can't necessarily rely on society or

343
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,684
humans to kind of choose what's good because

344
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:50,349
historically and even today, there's still a lot of places that, you know,

345
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,619
are reasonably enlightened, like, say, Canada and the US

346
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,809
and yet we still have, you know,

347
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,049
states or jurisdictions with some really backward laws or, you know,

348
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,849
really backwards things being pushed.

349
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:01,359
And

350
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:02,929
I think just be, you know,

351
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,219
part of my concern with democracy is just because 51% of people want

352
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:08,409
to drink apple juice for breakfast doesn't mean we should do it.

353
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,590
-- I, yeah, I mean, Brexit, right. Yeah. Yes.
-- Brexit.

354
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:15,369
Fantastic, perfect example of 50 plus one.

355
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,489
Maybe, you know,

356
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,690
there should be somewhat of a legislative or some bureaucracy involved

357
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,500
to maybe slow it down a bit or make a,

358
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,619
you know, look at the 2nd and 3rd order effects and say,

359
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,489
have we really thought this through because

360
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,960
uh we don't have enough shipping, pallets or,

361
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,729
you know, warehouses to store medicine if we do decide to leave.

362
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:34,369
Right.

363
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,549
That's the sort of decision I feel like should have like a,

364
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:43,770
a two third super majority style vote, not a 50% plus one.

365
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,010
Yeah, I I would say at a minimum. And

366
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,679
it's funny to me that we have these arbitrary, like 50 plus, you know,

367
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,039
I remember the Quebec referendum,

368
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,960
like 20 years ago when Quebec was voting about whether or not to leave Canada.

369
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:57,039
And, you know, of course, Quebec was like 50% plus one. That's good enough for us.

370
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:57,510
And of course, the rest

371
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,169
was like, no,

372
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:00,929
that's not how that's going to work

373
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,650
and they got like, high forties percent.

374
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,489
It was, I remember we were all watching the TV,

375
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,960
with the numbers creeping up and it was like,

376
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:06,210
uh,

377
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,010
you know, because it was really a question of like, ok, so if they do vote,

378
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,049
if they vote themselves off the island, like then what?

379
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,950
You know, because that's, again, I don't, I'm not sure they had a plan for this,

380
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,419
but back to this sort of human nature thing, it's,

381
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:22,690
you know, even if, again, like 51 or

382
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,849
I'm guessing 90% of people would agree with, like, we should eliminate poverty,

383
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:28,460
right?

384
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,270
And so we hold a vote and we decide to eliminate poverty. Fantastic.

385
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,820
But like, how do we go about this? You know?

386
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,809
And that's, that's part of my concern is how do we, how do we go about?

387
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,150
We've agreed that this is a problem. We've agreed that it should be solved. Ok.

388
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,169
But how do we solve it?

389
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:44,760
And Dan Kaminsky was tweeting about some stuff about how, you know, people

390
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,530
kind of when you work for a place and you

391
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,539
don't like a decision they made just at some point,

392
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,039
be an adult.

393
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,010
Stop fighting it and do your job and implement it. And I was like,

394
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,119
I agree. But, and that's a part of adulting is there are, there are problems

395
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,039
where it's not that there's a solution that's not desirable.

396
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:02,799
There are problems where there is no solution that is even palatable

397
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,079
to a large group of people.

398
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:05,550
Right.

399
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,800
There are just issues out there where at least

400
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,660
one or 10 or 20% of everybody involved in it

401
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,439
will hate this.

402
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,290
-- Any solution you pick
-- and, and that's, that's true of everything, right?

403
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,750
I mean, like, like you talk about, we should vote on getting rid of poverty

404
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:24,880
and there's probably 10 to 20% of people who would vote against that.

405
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:28,828
I mean, as crazy as that might sound to us it, I guarantee they're there.

406
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:33,838
Yeah, this, this whole phone book, like I said, II, I read the bit at the back.

407
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:37,448
There's a couple, like there's about two dozen pages of this, of this weird content,

408
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,119
including their user agreement.

409
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:40,808
Like there's a long distance

410
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:44,879
dude, there's a long distance terms of, there's the general terms of service

411
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,029
and the long distance terms of service.

412
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,140
Uh Sorry, the general terms of service is two pages.

413
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,890
Do they have

414
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,689
the longest

415
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,130
button you can push with your finger or?

416
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,420
Yeah, I, I don't know, like by opening this phone book. Did I accept this? Because it,

417
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,969
wait, oh, I threw the wrapper away. Damn. It.

418
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:05,790
Did the rapper have a shrink wrap? Ya.

419
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,030
I hope

420
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,400
it

421
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,739
never occurred to me to look.

422
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,859
I hope it did.

423
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:13,109
And then they do have a, a thing on how to recycle this thing.

424
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,390
Well, that's good

425
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,869
since it's what I do

426
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,630
-- with all. And then
-- here's the weirdest thing.

427
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,760
There's a second phone book at the back of it,

428
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,680
the business listings for Edmonton and it's like

429
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,550
the white pages style with like 40 some pages

430
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:30,949
of just

431
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,849
-- like business name, phone number type thing. Yeah.
-- Yeah.

432
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:36,189
And, and the address in super fine print

433
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,449
and of course, it's not all the businesses because there's, there's more than this,

434
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:44,079
-- you know, it's, it's
-- probably the businesses that were willing to pay them.

435
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,489
Yeah, because I looked through for some businesses.

436
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,890
I know and I can't find any of them.

437
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,410
Like, not a one.

438
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,680
So,

439
00:18:51,939 --> 00:18:54,410
you know what my thought is here is I,

440
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,170
I have a feeling this is your typical dying industry style model

441
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,130
where

442
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,260
even even the yellow pages people have to know

443
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,410
that their future is limited because let's face it.

444
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,500
The people who would use a phone book are

445
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,689
of a certain age will say

446
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,839
they're dying out. We can say it.

447
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,420
Ok, they're right,

448
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,939
they're going to die out and the young new

449
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,709
people coming up just are willing to use phone books

450
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:25,260
or the internet or anything else that is better than a phone book.

451
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,859
I can still think of one use for a phone book which is,

452
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,329
uh, but it doesn't work now because there's not enough stuff in here.

453
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:33,339
But it was, um, my mom used to keep a phone book in the car

454
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,489
for the list of gas stations

455
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,479
and I could still, that kind of almost makes sense like if your phone,

456
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:43,359
so you can find a gas station if it's late at night, you don't know where you are,

457
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,660
like kind of neighborhood wise.

458
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,439
-- You know, what,
-- how is that going to work? Phone books aren't, don't work like that.

459
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:52,449
You don't have like a map that shows you where the gas stations are.

460
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,640
Well, no, but you can look through it and look for a nearby address.

461
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,060
I, I live in a city with a grid system so it's real easy.

462
00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:01,150
-- Or
-- you can just see your eyes and look for a sign that says gas station.

463
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,449
Well, and that's why I said it doesn't really work that well, but like it's,

464
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:07,910
it's like the one limited corner case I can sort of see for a phone book.

465
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,989
-- So,
-- no, you don't worry.

466
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,270
I thought you were going with this,

467
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,329
which would be the one corner case I would agree with is what?

468
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,630
Roll it up and hit people.

469
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,750
No, you could leave it in your car so you could have someone sit on it who is short

470
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:19,050
and they

471
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:19,219
could

472
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:19,400
see

473
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,380
out the window.

474
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:21,949
Yeah.

475
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:26,310
II, I don't know. I, it's, it's one of those things that

476
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:29,949
I think it has a value to the people who need it

477
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,270
but to the vast majority of other people it does not.

478
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:34,280
And

479
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,209
in, in my, I guess, typical tradition here,

480
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,310
I think we can look at this with our security glasses on

481
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:44,469
where there are many things we do in security

482
00:20:44,689 --> 00:20:48,949
that don't really have any value to most people, but we still do them

483
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,540
-- and like, crappy password advice is a great example.
-- Just exciting news.

484
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:55,469
My partner works for the provincial government and

485
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:57,199
they change the password change requirements from,

486
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,530
I think it's quarterly to yearly.

487
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:02,489
-- So even the government is learning that's
-- better. I mean,

488
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,050
I could see once a year,

489
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,040
I could see once a year is not totally unreasonable

490
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,150
part of it too is that if, if you're not using your account, then, you know,

491
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,050
to flush the account,

492
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,530
like,

493
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,949
because they have part of the challenge is

494
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,890
they have logins on like 10 million systems.

495
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,369
Right. Right. Right.

496
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:20,229
So, and I admit, you know, I do similar things like when I'm trying to, you know, I,

497
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,030
I look at account activity and call it

498
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,530
or suspend them and see if anybody complains, you know, the classic screen test.

499
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:26,949
Right. Right.

500
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,689
And I'm, I'm ok with that.

501
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,569
-- But no,
-- I agree. Like, there's, there's so many things we do in security. Why do.

502
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:33,250
We do them well, because we do them

503
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,069
-- right.
-- I take the facts to the engineers, you know, to quote office space.

504
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,800
Yes. That's right.

505
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,380
That's right. And I mean, every industry is like this. I, I have no doubt

506
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:46,189
and

507
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,239
it's just, it, it's one of those things, you know, what the story I,

508
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,459
I always think of is,

509
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,310
is there was a, a doctor

510
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:54,310
long ago

511
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:59,349
who he was, he, he dealt with, I believe he delivered babies primarily.

512
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,069
And he basically got the great idea. Let's wash our hands between seeing people

513
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,719
and his peers actually ridiculed him and yelled at him like it wasn't enough to just,

514
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:09,630
oh yeah, they drove him.

515
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,939
Yeah, they drove him insane. Essentially. He ended up dying in an insane asylum.

516
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:14,660
Yeah. They, well, they put him in an asylum and,

517
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,369
yeah. Right.

518
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,520
And,

519
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,109
and it's one of those things like I see that all

520
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,619
the time where someone suggests something instead of just being like,

521
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,930
eh, whatever I don't care,

522
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,469
we actively fight against them.

523
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,869
And I mean, I'm sure this even happened.

524
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,839
-- I bet there was a time in the yellow pages were like,
-- oh, it's still happening,

525
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,489
Cesarean sections the way they cut,

526
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,800
they used to cut across and they're discovering now that it might be better to cut

527
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,810
up like, at 90 degrees.

528
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:38,640
Ok? Because it does less damage and it's a bit less invasive.

529
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:41,290
So even to this day, we're still like, why do you do it that way.

530
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,709
Well, because that's how we do c sections.

531
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:43,239
Like,

532
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,239
it's not like we've done a study to actually confirm this is the best way to do it.

533
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,079
-- It's just,
-- well,

534
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:52,800
I would hope somebody does do a study though and then they can make a determination.

535
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,880
Well, it's kind of hard to get pregnant women willing to do,

536
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,500
undergo experimental procedures for some weird reason.

537
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,040
Well, that is fair. I think

538
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:04,880
I, I won't disagree with you because I would not sign up for that.

539
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,510
Well, no, you, you're a man so you probably wouldn't.

540
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:13,869
I'm, I'm comfortable saying that when my wife was pregnant, if someone had said,

541
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,430
would you like to undergo this experimental procedure?

542
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:19,060
Her and I would have both given a

543
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,530
-- extremely energetic. No,
-- I was going to go with Death Claire.

544
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,300
It's conceivable.

545
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:31,729
She would have murdered somebody asking a question like that. But it is. Yeah.

546
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:33,270
Anyway.

547
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,530
And, and this actually is something that,

548
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,209
that came up for me recently as well is so I

549
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,579
was uh I was just at a conference called Cipher Con.

550
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,390
It's a hacker conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

551
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,500
It was,

552
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,750
it was a lot of fun and there were certain things that came up

553
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,010
during just talking to people and attending some of the talks and whatnot.

554
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,579
It's just like

555
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,989
the, the gross lack of rigor in science behind what we do

556
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,709
is fascinating where there's just so much hearsay in

557
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,310
a we even lack

558
00:23:58,489 --> 00:23:58,829
the,

559
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,510
that the scientific knowledge that the scientific method can be applied to this.

560
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,089
Right. Right.

561
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,390
And you ask people questions like that even,

562
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,660
and a lot of them don't even understand what you're asking.

563
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:12,229
-- Oh,
-- I got really angry responses. Like,

564
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,869
I mean, what we're currently doing with, with the CV E stuff, you know,

565
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,280
we're doing some surveys

566
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,189
and

567
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
a

568
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,150
great, this is actually a really good example of scientific rigor.

569
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,229
So we're doing some surveys to find out how people feel about some of the CV stuff.

570
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,829
And I've had something like an average of one response a day for three weeks.

571
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,060
So actually the answer is nobody cares about this particular topic regarding CV.

572
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:34,170
It's good enough and that's a fair answer.

573
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:37,900
Yeah, it's good enough. It works. Don't, what, what do we care?

574
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,369
You know, and, but some people are kind of like, well, but,

575
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,449
you know, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like a sample size of 21.

576
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:46,699
Number one isn't big enough to base a conclusion off of, especially since it's,

577
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:47,939
you know, self selecting,

578
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,119
like it literally is self selecting.

579
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:53,489
And number two, it's, it's also, it is a good indication of like,

580
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,030
nobody really cares which that's an answer.

581
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:56,760
It is.

582
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,920
And I think this is,

583
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,239
this is a realization that I've been struggling with for a long time.

584
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,800
And I know you, you've helped kick me down the road quite a lot.

585
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,040
But there are certain things that

586
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:12,040
and, and part of CV E is in this boat where the vast majority of people don't care.

587
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,349
Do I wish every security issue had a CV ID.

588
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:17,390
I do because it would make my life a lot easier. But the reality is

589
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,959
most people fundamentally don't care.

590
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,949
And so the issue becomes,

591
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,510
why don't they care

592
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:28,520
and the reason people care about things is because it gives them some sort of value.

593
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,439
Right. Let's face it. People do things because it helps them in some meaningful way.

594
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:35,680
And I think for a lot of organizations that don't use

595
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,834
-- CV E I DS see the value
-- or they use CV.

596
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:40,704
And it's good enough because let's face it.

597
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:43,864
All the major vendors like Microsoft, they actually do a really good job of it and,

598
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,135
and they do, but now here's, let's, I want to put my little little project hat on.

599
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:50,224
And so here's the thing and this is where

600
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:53,224
I struggle and I don't know the answer to this yet. But do they,

601
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,560
do they not use CV, E

602
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,380
because

603
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,770
they don't care

604
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,209
or do they not use CV E because it's too hard?

605
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,410
And it's one of those two, I don't know which or maybe both

606
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:04,979
I would say. Yes. No.

607
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:07,410
And it depends because part of using CV is, first of all,

608
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,579
you have to say what you mean by that.

609
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:09,130
Like, do they actually

610
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:11,594
assume the CV, data feed or do they buy a product?

611
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,714
No, I mean, I mean, publishing, publishing CV E ID

612
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:18,395
-- where I'm, I'm a project,
-- I would say part of it is,

613
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:19,635
it's not that they don't care,

614
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,625
-- it's that they don't even know about it and
-- that could be

615
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:21,895
part

616
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:24,895
of it like you and I pretend like CV E is well known.

617
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,314
It's not

618
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:27,810
even in the industry,

619
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,189
I still encounter people who don't know what that acronym means.

620
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,979
And I mean, people in the security industry,

621
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:34,209
not just like in the it industry in general

622
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,079
and, and that's probably fair. People in the it industry in general have no clue.

623
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:40,810
But again, and it's fair because there's lots of standards we don't know about.

624
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:41,469
Like, I know

625
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,250
a guy who works on medical

626
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,290
billing and coding.

627
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,959
Uh, and he actually works on the standard for medical coding and billing.

628
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,040
-- Yeah, that's a fascinating field
-- actually.

629
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,959
Yeah, I mean, the, apparently there's a lot of stuff around turtle bites.

630
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:54,930
I have no doubt.

631
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:57,770
I, I heard they added a new code a couple of years ago for, like,

632
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,510
getting crushed by a whale.

633
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:00,280
Which

634
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,020
is that, does that happen enough that you need a code for that? I don't know.

635
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,739
Well, yeah, maybe, I mean,

636
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,180
-- the Japanese and Norwegian are still whaling but I assume,
-- I don't know.

637
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:11,770
-- Oh,
-- there's one for walked into lamp posts that seems reasonable

638
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:11,890
that

639
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,439
I've done that more than once.

640
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:16,719
Oh, you know what?

641
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:17,250
Yeah, you're,

642
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,390
you're thinking of struck by orca initial encounter and I hate to say this,

643
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,170
but Seaworld.

644
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,189
Uh

645
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:25,349
oh, that's fair. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. Struck by orca. There you go.

646
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,729
-- Hurts at the opera. It,
-- it happens. I'm sure people slip and fall or, or whatever.

647
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:31,369
I mean,

648
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:32,380
I, I get it

649
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:35,530
-- and
-- then, oh, here's a good one, prolonged stay in weightless environment,

650
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:36,900
which it's real.

651
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,319
But I feel like it's rare enough that you can

652
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:40,915
-- just put a note on the guy's file
-- that affects

653
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:42,354
astronauts.

654
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:44,685
I feel like that's not one of those things where it's like house where it's like,

655
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,005
why didn't you mention you ate a tuna

656
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:48,395
sandwich and got some weird parasite or something?

657
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:50,155
It's like, how did you forget to mention this?

658
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:50,714
Right.

659
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:53,055
I, I wondered, is there a medical questionnaire that's like,

660
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:55,265
have you spent one year or more in space?

661
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:55,655
Right.

662
00:27:56,405 --> 00:27:57,194
No.

663
00:27:57,484 --> 00:27:57,645
Yeah.

664
00:27:57,655 --> 00:28:00,275
Just put it under other, the, the, this lack of,

665
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:03,635
and it's not even that we have a lack of scientific rigor, but we have a lack of just

666
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,474
even being concerned

667
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:06,614
that it's a thing.

668
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,069
And what really blows me away is because tech is

669
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,969
one of the few places where you can actually do

670
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:16,369
sort of proper, like control blind, double blind experiments. A B testing,

671
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:16,910
you know,

672
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,630
and the funny thing is the marketing and

673
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,069
sales side are really quite rigorous about this,

674
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:24,219
-- you know, A B testing to see what drives up sales.
-- Uh huh.

675
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:25,680
Now, here's the reason for that though.

676
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:30,119
I think is when you're in marketing, if the sales graph isn't going up into the right,

677
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:32,449
uh, they fire you and you don't have a job

678
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,910
in security.

679
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:36,819
What, how do we measure if we're doing our jobs?

680
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:40,000
How do we measure if we're not doing our jobs? And let's face it. A breach happens.

681
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,300
They're going to fire the co hire a new co,

682
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,290
and the reality is what the co fault. Well, no, not really.

683
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,750
But they needed to fire somebody. So they fired that guy

684
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,020
and, and can the co show it was or wasn't their fault? No, no, they can't.

685
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,270
Can the new co make changes to make something not happen again? Probably not.

686
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:57,800
And

687
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,599
I have a feeling that that's part of our, our problem here is we,

688
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,439
and, and let's face it, you can get fired as ac O and have a new job by the end of the day.

689
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:05,880
Right.

690
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,280
It's,

691
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,650
there's so much work for us right now that we have

692
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,589
an industry and at the same time we fight fires constantly.

693
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,250
I actually,

694
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,119
I, I had this chat just the other day with somebody is,

695
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,260
there's all this work I want to do

696
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,060
to make certain things better.

697
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,819
But I spend so much time just like keeping the lights on that I

698
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:26,260
don't have time to do these other things and it's super frustrating to me because

699
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,579
if I had the time to do this other work

700
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,719
it would alleviate.

701
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,660
So many of the other emergencies I'm dealing with on a constant basis.

702
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,569
But if I can't ignore the, you know what I mean? It's so chicken and egg.

703
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,689
So, you,

704
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:38,560
well,

705
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,719
the problem is you can't do forest management

706
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:42,260
if you're constantly putting out forest fires.

707
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,310
Yes.

708
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,180
-- Exactly. That's exactly
-- right. Like, resource wise. Like, I'm lucky in that,

709
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:50,300
you know, the CS A, we don't ship software. Thank

710
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:53,709
-- goodness. Although that's going to change at some point,
-- I

711
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,069
say,

712
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,609
aren't you working to fix that?

713
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,290
Exactly. And so,

714
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:02,989
so operationally, I've outsourced as much as I can to really solid cloud players,

715
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,050
you know, like we use github,

716
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:08,569
like I am absolutely not running our own source code repo. Uh You know, just no.

717
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,099
Right. I'm gonna use github.

718
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:11,619
Nobody shouldn't. But,

719
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,910
but the thing is once you reach a certain size, even just running github,

720
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:16,800
you've got people checking secrets in,

721
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,050
you've got people making commits in places they shouldn't,

722
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,989
you've got commit messages that shouldn't exist.

723
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,359
You have references the internal things and it's like,

724
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,359
oh, my goodness, it never ends.

725
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,140
No, I agree.

726
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,369
And I think I'm beginning to suspect a lot of

727
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,599
this boils down to the law of large numbers,

728
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,229
but there is a fundamental difference in security where you have,

729
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:35,760
say less than 10 developers.

730
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,280
And let's say you have 1000 or more developers.

731
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,550
I, I think the tipping point is even smaller than that.

732
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,050
-- I think it's a couple of 100
-- Oh, absolutely.

733
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,800
And I think this is true for a lot of businesses though.

734
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,280
Like, I see a lot of the way small businesses operate versus large businesses

735
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,520
or my classic favorite, the,

736
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,949
the government bureaucracy which can survive like massive political shifts.

737
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,140
You know, you,

738
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,050
you can literally go from like a right wing government to a left

739
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,339
wing government to a right wing government in the space of like,

740
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:04,849
months or years in some countries.

741
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,180
And the bureaucracy just keeps kind of chugging along,

742
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,609
you know, and, and the

743
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:12,489
country keeps plodding along and things mostly work. It's not great but it works.

744
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,260
Uh, and, you know, and then you look at like a small business where, like,

745
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,020
the owner goes away for a week and like, the place burns down basically.

746
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,979
Right.

747
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,060
You know,

748
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,979
and so I'm beginning to suspect, but part of the problem is

749
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,790
how do you learn that stuff? How do you, how do you implement that stuff?

750
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:28,339
And

751
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,069
the other problem is a lot of that doesn't work at a small scale.

752
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:31,959
Yeah.

753
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:35,530
Or it becomes horribly inefficient at the small scale, like, well, a great example.

754
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,599
Code reviews. But what if you only have like, two devs?

755
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:41,089
Yeah, you can't do that. And, and you don't, you only have two depths so nobody cares.

756
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:43,750
No, no, you're, you're dead on. And

757
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:45,880
I don't know. And maybe that's part of the challenge.

758
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,469
It's just security is an industry is reaching some sort of

759
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,329
tipping point and we kind of don't know where to go.

760
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:50,869
Next.

761
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,479
One thing I decided really early on with the product I'm working

762
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:56,280
on is we're not going to have one size fits all security.

763
00:31:56,459 --> 00:32:00,369
What we're going to do is we're going to have a safest possible defaults so that

764
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:02,239
you can cut yourself with this product.

765
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,160
But you have to take, you know,

766
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,420
you have to take the knife out of the sheath to cut yourself.

767
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,660
And we're going to allow people to dial up

768
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,729
and down their security as they see fit because,

769
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:12,130
you know, some people might not want full privacy,

770
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,239
they might want to make some of their data public, you know,

771
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,199
that I have this certification or whatever

772
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:17,550
and

773
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:18,910
that's up to the user

774
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,170
and in some cases it's not, in some cases,

775
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,229
it's up to whatever their legal jurisdiction says.

776
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,550
And that's the other thing I'm realizing

777
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,510
is we want to operate globally.

778
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,540
So that means how many jurisdictions I, I don't know,

779
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,939
I was trying to Google how many different

780
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,459
jurisdictions that means we're operating in infinity.

781
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,280
And I couldn't even figure out like in the US, how many jurisdictions there are?

782
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,520
Like, I kind of thought it would be so

783
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,469
simple, like how many states are there? Plus federal? No, it's actually different.

784
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,750
It's a much different number than that.

785
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:44,415
Right.

786
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:47,795
You got with federal states, counties, local levels,

787
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:52,515
-- you probably have even special areas
-- even within states.

788
00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:53,795
You've got different.

789
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:55,104
National Parks?

790
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,125
-- Oh, that's true. That's true. National Parks are
-- special.

791
00:32:58,135 --> 00:33:01,425
You know, the White House lawn apparently is its own weird thing because it's

792
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:04,104
actually security is provided by the US park service.

793
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:05,410
From, no,

794
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,670
but from the fence on the grass to the building

795
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,369
and then the building is something different and it's just,

796
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,329
but there's all sorts of these weird corner cases.

797
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:11,359
I

798
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:11,500
have

799
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:11,680
no

800
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:13,290
doubt the US Capitol police,

801
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:15,099
you know, that's its whole little thing.

802
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,010
So, like I said, I was trying to figure out how many jurisdictions are in America.

803
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,770
And the answer is we're not really sure,

804
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,250
but it's a lot. Just assume it

805
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:21,579
pretty

806
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,839
much.

807
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:25,369
And this, of course, ignores the combinatorial problem, right?

808
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,369
Because the combinatorial problem, its ugly head. And then,

809
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,839
you know, it's like GDPR, a British national

810
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,329
dealing with a company in France,

811
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,380
but he lives in Spain and is currently traveling to America.

812
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,329
Like, no, no, I'm not thinking about it.

813
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:40,790
-- You just
-- made my head hurt and I think we need to call it like, so closing thoughts,

814
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,180
what are you going to do with your phone book, Kurt?

815
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:46,510
Uh Well, I'm not gonna burn it because that will result in a lot of ash.

816
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,069
-- So I have to go chuck it in the recycle.
-- I guess you're gonna recycle your phone book.

817
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,479
-- There you go.
-- Well, what else

818
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,969
would you do with it? I, that's what I do. I don't know.

819
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:57,619
I, I can't imagine you can tear him in half. I guess you could do that first.

820
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,000
I love that. It's incomplete. Like it's grossly incomplete.

821
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:01,650
That's the other thing. Right.

822
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,469
As a, as a source of information, it's grossly incomplete. So I don't trust

823
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,520
it. Right. Google Maps or whatever. On the other hand is,

824
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,590
that's a good point.

825
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:10,909
That is a good point.

826
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:16,139
-- Anyway, I don't trust it but people do
-- so you don't have to and ok. All right, man.

827
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:19,228
I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening. You can go to open
