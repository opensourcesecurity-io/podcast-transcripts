00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,679
-- A recording, recording,
-- recording. It's December 22nd. Hooray.

1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,909
Yeah, we're getting there. So how to report a singular security flaw.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,619
-- I guess you just do it right.
-- Pretty much.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,199
Um,

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:12,939
yeah.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,879
No, it's, it's like Nike says, just do it start by looking for how to report the flaw

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,389
to the project because some projects have a bug bounty,

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,639
some have an email address.

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:24,613
Some have, you know, they just want you shoved in their bug tracker

9
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:28,413
and then following that you give them as much information as you can.

10
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:32,772
I would, I would say you missed a crucial step, which is, have a security flaw

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,652
-- step one.
-- Well, that was sort of assumed, but you're right.

12
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:36,772
Not necessarily.

13
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:40,553
No, no, but you are correct. You are technically correct, which is the best kind.

14
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:46,402
I've gotten enough security reports to know that that is an often misunderstood or

15
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,555
-- next step.
-- I'm actually going to disagree with you because

16
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:53,506
sometimes you have something that you're not sure about and as a vendor,

17
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:55,925
I would much rather get those, not sure reports.

18
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:58,265
I do agree with that. However,

19
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:01,526
-- if I get a, not
-- because those are typically the worst ones,

20
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:02,206
but but

21
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:05,224
I've never gotten a not sure report.

22
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:09,505
I generally get a, I have found a critical security issue in your product

23
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,386
and it's like,

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,800
-- no, you didn't. This is literally documented functionality.
-- Yeah. Well,

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,480
and again, there, the thing I've seen is the way they want to use the product.

26
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,629
It does become a critical flaw for them because how do I put it nicely?

27
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:27,300
They kind of want to use the product wrongly or in a way that makes their life easier.

28
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:31,529
Sometimes, sometimes then you educate the customer and hopefully they take to that

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:31,949
a

30
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:32,930
sometimes,

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,529
-- I mean, so
-- I didn't say it works.

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,040
We

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,639
have a security vulnerability now we need to tell somebody.

34
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,669
And I think what you hinted at at the beginning is really important

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,510
where every project in every company is a little bit different here.

36
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:50,120
And now going back to the topic of bug bounties, we talked about what,

37
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:52,650
a couple of days ago, if you have a bug bounty,

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,830
-- it becomes much easier for researchers to contact you.
-- It's a very strong signal.

39
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:01,169
-- This is how we want our security books,
-- report ignoring the signal.

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,010
You have a standard application

41
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:08,899
to do this, right? Whereas if I, if I email security at

42
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,960
cried.org,

43
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:11,554
-- what, what happens
-- next

44
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:15,205
-- to my
-- inbox? Well, I know that, but I'm saying, you know what I mean? Like

45
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:16,955
I have emailed companies.

46
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:19,604
Well, first of all, I've tried to contact them and you can't even find them.

47
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:22,134
But you end up on Twitter like, hey, does so and so.

48
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:25,255
Well, look at Tavis Ormandy half the time. Oh, my goodness.

49
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:27,375
And it's always Friday night, which is the best.

50
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,809
But so let's say I contact a company right now.

51
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,460
What kind of information should I be including

52
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,369
-- in my report to this
-- company? Definitely at an absolute minimum.

53
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,070
-- The product and version.
-- Yeah, that's huge.

54
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,910
Well,

55
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,880
and I've seen people not include the version quite

56
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,399
often or they say it's the latest one.

57
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,910
And I'm like, no, I want a number.

58
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:50,990
I, I, you know, I, I need this explicitly because I've seen situations where

59
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,259
they report something in a product that's no longer supported

60
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,410
or end of life or about to end of life.

61
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:57,429
It, it does happen

62
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,089
and in which case it's, you know,

63
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,869
unless it's truly terrible and there's enough customers demanding it.

64
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,250
Well, it's gonna die next.

65
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:06,850
Like I literally remember we had a pretty bad flaw coming in on a product that was,

66
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,169
you know, end of life in a week.

67
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:11,690
And I was like, I'm just gonna put this one over here till Monday and then, oh,

68
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:12,490
look at that

69
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,669
right.

70
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,949
I actually replied to them and said, you know,

71
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,789
this thing EOL is in a week and more to the point, please.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,190
For the love of Peter upgrade to

73
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,789
-- the newer version of the software, it's much better.
-- Ok.

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,970
So we have a version, we have an application,

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,169
we have to include you need details though to say this is what I did

76
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:36,690
and the more details, the better because I can always,

77
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,509
ok, there is the potential for chasing down false rabbit holes,

78
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,070
but without information, there's no rabbit holes.

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,600
Yeah. Right. I mean, I've had that before where someone sent a report.

80
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:46,492
It was like, I can't figure that, you know,

81
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,692
you need to give me more and often they never reply again.

82
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:51,231
It crashed. I made a crash.

83
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,072
Ok.

84
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:54,361
You know what this really comes down to honestly,

85
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,951
at the end of the day is there is a vast corpus

86
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:01,352
of information on the internet about how to report good bugs.

87
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:06,091
It's just a bug, right? How do you report a bug? Like what, what did you do?

88
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:08,102
What happened? What should have happened?

89
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,621
The one potential difference being is that you might want

90
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:13,052
to be able to report the bug secretly and again,

91
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:15,514
having a bug bounty or specific security

92
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:17,813
or a whatever accomplishes that.

93
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,993
So we can basically ignore that part of the argument.

94
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:27,194
-- But
-- now I will say there is nothing wrong with reporting a bug in a public bug tracker.

95
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:31,313
If there is no other way you can find to contact a project,

96
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:36,674
I would go even one further to say while I prefer and I'm making

97
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:39,704
big air quotes here responsible disclosure and trying to work with a vendor.

98
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,593
At the same time, the vendor shipped a product with a flaw why

99
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:44,816
I found the flaw.

100
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:48,816
-- Am I now supposed to do a bunch of work to make the vendor's life easier?
-- Yeah, I agree.

101
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,716
I think from a researcher perspective you have to set a ceiling

102
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,295
for the pain you're willing to suffer and don't let them,

103
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:56,665
don't let them take advantage of you.

104
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:59,165
I think that's the single biggest takeaway I would,

105
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,626
I would give for this particular bit of advice.

106
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,976
-- And
-- I've also seen situations where people who are not at all,

107
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,335
security researchers stumble across horrific things.

108
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,265
Yeah, it happens and they just don't want to deal with it.

109
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:13,575
-- And that's
-- fair. It is. We will see you on December 23rd.
