Hello and welcome to episode 89 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,890
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime and definitely not financial crime.

2
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:13,729
Josh Bresser,

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,629
you say that like we're in some sort of collusion

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,459
def

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,350
definitely not financial crime. My financial crime is the best, right? Like

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,010
so,

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,569
although these days, it's probably not as funny to joke about

8
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:27,559
just because

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,649
man, this whole A MD debacle has been.

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,290
It is a story to say the least.

11
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:35,409
-- I like
-- it.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,939
I'm amused.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,200
I like it because like most stories, there's

14
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:41,619
all these kernels of truth that

15
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:45,290
you can look at and it either is a giant mess or you can look at it.

16
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,049
And personally I'm going to take devil's advocate.

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,610
I think this is actually a really good thing.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,450
I think the good guys won.

19
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,849
That's the way I'm looking at this, right?

20
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,130
The bad guys lost the good guys won.

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not sure I would agree.

22
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:00,380
Uh No, I, well, so let me, let me

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,959
may maybe, you know, something I don't.

24
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,620
And so fundamentally what happened was there was a research group

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,620
-- that published some flaws in a MD processors and and there can I
-- interrupt you?

26
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:13,449
I'm not sure I would call them a research group because number one,

27
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:14,830
they only existed for a few months.

28
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,180
And number two, they,

29
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:20,730
they really do look and smell and quack like a, a financial, like

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:22,830
we'll get

31
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:23,500
to,

32
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:26,540
let's call them a research group for the moment.

33
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:31,620
They published some, a MD flaws that we say are bad but not terrible.

34
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,669
And at

35
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:33,269
the,

36
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,050
and at the same time, coincidentally,

37
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,220
someone had done some major shorting of a MD stock.

38
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,379
And the beautiful part is the flaws that were released

39
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:49,309
did nothing to the share price of a MD stock.

40
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:54,699
So the, the attempt to short this was we'll say an abject failure

41
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,370
and,

42
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,029
and I guess it's also worth noting that this

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,190
was done to what Saint Jude maybe a year ago

44
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,169
and, but it was successful then because it was medical device shorting

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,970
and, and that one did work

46
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,309
and

47
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:06,849
the flaw

48
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,589
-- it could
-- kill people

49
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:10,710
well and more to the point though,

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,669
not so much that the flaws are more serious than they could kill people.

51
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:16,660
And heaven forbid that that actually happens.

52
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,949
And please forgive me for saying this,

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,520
but more to the point that those flaws would have a

54
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,949
financial impact on Saint Jude in the form of lawsuits.

55
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:27,440
That's really what mattered there. That's why their stock price tanked.

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,100
Right.

57
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:29,020
Let's face it.

58
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:33,220
The majority of these hardware flaws that we're dealing with in the computer world,

59
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:35,169
you have a very hard time suing these large

60
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:37,009
companies and proving damages and actually getting in the

61
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:37,580
car with them,

62
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,419
right? With medical devices,

63
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,690
those lawsuits become very expensive, very rapidly. So even if you don't lose them,

64
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:48,960
you just still lose because trying to get FDA approval on devices when they're,

65
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,750
you know, involved in a lawsuit and stuff that, that can basically kill a company.

66
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,449
-- Right.
-- So, so

67
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:52,779
anyway,

68
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,520
do you think the good guys lost?

69
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:58,149
I view this as the, the bad guys tried to short the stock, it failed

70
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,479
and I have a suspicion they just lost a bunch of money.

71
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,940
That, that, that makes me happy.

72
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,419
That would be the case. Um

73
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,630
So I

74
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,539
was doing some research because at first I thought these guys were bad guys too.

75
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,779
But you know what,

76
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,970
I

77
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,520
think they're not great guys. But if you put it in the lens of activist investors,

78
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,589
which is a well known, well established thing,

79
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,270
so much so that there's a nice link on the SEC page.

80
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,389
Um

81
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,000
uh

82
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,639
So essentially the concept is here is how

83
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,789
do we hold large companies accountable nowadays?

84
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,960
-- I'm asking you, how do we hold large companies accountable now
-- in my PC,

85
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,130
like,

86
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,130
fundamentally we don't,

87
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,929
I mean, that's just the reality of it.

88
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,509
Yeah. And, and in past we had

89
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,750
journalism and investigative reporting,

90
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,529
which is very expensive.

91
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,740
I mean, you know, the cost to do one article can be hundreds of thousands of dollars,

92
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,610
if you're paying a staff of a few people to work on it for six months, you know,

93
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,289
and all you get out of it is like 5000 words of dense

94
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:00,649
text that, you know,

95
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,929
10 people care about.

96
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,690
Right?

97
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,210
And,

98
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,850
and then someone's gonna point out and scream fake

99
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,199
news and then your story was for nothing.

100
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,429
Yeah.

101
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,229
Yeah.

102
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,130
So one thing that's happened

103
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,690
and, and this has been going on for decades is that

104
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,019
it seems that the e takes the position, but

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,459
we want to keep the market honest,

106
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:23,459
right? Because if the market's not honest, if the market's not fair,

107
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,190
uh the market won't work,

108
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,220
right? And that, that would be a significant problem.

109
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,859
So how do we keep the market honest and well, you know,

110
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:33,690
we could have investigative journalism and whistleblower laws

111
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,959
and things like that and that's good.

112
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:36,739
But more fundamentally

113
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,049
how do we economically

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,809
compensate or reward people for doing all this work?

115
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,640
And sort of one, an one answer is, is to essentially have activist investors,

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,100
which, you know, they invest in a company

117
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,380
and then they,

118
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
they take activity.

119
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,959
So in some cases, um activist investors have taken, you know,

120
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,220
large positions in a company

121
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,540
and then, you know, encouraged or even forced the company to go green, for example,

122
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:03,730
or to, you know, pull out of

123
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,089
really uh unsavory labor markets in like Southeast Asia, you know,

124
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,220
where you have like little Children making clothes or whatever.

125
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,260
Um,

126
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,570
and the flip side of this is too. Well, for example, if you

127
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,329
have caught a company doing something naughty,

128
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,410
how essentially do you make money from that knowledge legally?

129
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,829
Right. So not insider trading, let's be clear.

130
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,510
And one of the things you can do and that has

131
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,440
been done in the past is this short selling of a company

132
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,630
and then releasing the news. That is

133
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,100
hopefully true.

134
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:37,869
I mean, if it's not true, then we're into a whole other legal pile of worms.

135
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,579
-- And actually,
-- if it's not true, it's illegal.

136
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,619
And I, I did some research because when, when this happened, I was like,

137
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,649
this can't be legal.

138
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,339
This has got to count as insider trading and it doesn't,

139
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,630
right. It's totally legal what these guys did with a MD. And

140
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,910
I understand what you're saying.

141
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,269
And I think,

142
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,859
-- well, and
-- here's what I would say, I would say the market reacted correctly

143
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,510
because

144
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,309
although let me put it this way, if they had come to me,

145
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,000
if these guys had come to me in advance.

146
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,040
Uh And this is assuming my, my scope of CV coverage were to include a MD,

147
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,760
which it does not, I would send them to Miter.

148
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,160
But for the sake of argument,

149
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,519
let's say I was able to assign them or I was in the position to assign CV S yes or no.

150
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:15,920
For this,

151
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:17,850
my response would be,

152
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:19,910
these are kind of stupid flaws,

153
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,809
but they are technically security vulnerabilities, right?

154
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,329
These are trust boundary issues. Now, granted, you

155
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,230
already have to have a high level of trust and access to the system.

156
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,730
But fundamentally what they described are actually

157
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,579
valid security vulnerabilities with the proviso,

158
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,970
you need a really high level of access you need like, you know,

159
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,380
there's a whole bunch of, of pre existing conditions to exploit this

160
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,730
and essentially,

161
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,790
um it's not something that allows you to like gain access and to, you know, like

162
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:49,609
remotely take over a system.

163
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:53,290
It's more something that once you're in, you can then hide very effectively,

164
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,220
you know, which we don't want, right.

165
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:55,950
So

166
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,929
I would have basically what I'm

167
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,559
saying is these were legitimate security vulnerabilities

168
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,750
for the purposes of CV E counting.

169
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,609
They should get CV S unless there's some details missing where, you know,

170
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,029
this is just not exploitable.

171
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,450
And in that respect, I would say the market reacted correctly and that yes,

172
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:12,880
these are vulnerabilities and

173
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,890
no, they're really not going to impact am D's bottom line,

174
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,290
right? Nobody's going to really be able to sue

175
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:19,470
nobody.

176
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:23,980
I mean, will, will people be affected by this flaw potentially? Yes,

177
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:27,970
but it would only be part of a really specific targeted attack.

178
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:28,570
You know,

179
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,010
this is not some widespread like flash zero day drive

180
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,670
-- by web attack that takes over 10 million
-- PC.

181
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,769
And the thing is you need to be route essentially to exploit these and

182
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,329
let's face it if your system has an attacker running around his route.

183
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:42,959
You've

184
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,230
got,

185
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:44,640
you've got some other problem.

186
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,549
The challenge is how do you get that hardware back to a known good state?

187
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,589
And with these attacks you may not be able to

188
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,130
see that. That's where these become a problem.

189
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,190
I agree. I agree.

190
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,279
Like, every time somebody gets rude on the system,

191
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,660
I don't have to throw the hardware away.

192
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,489
That would get

193
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,459
expensive

194
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,579
and troublesome.

195
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,660
That's why you just use the cloud.

196
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,790
Not my problem.

197
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,339
Yeah. Well, yeah, and

198
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,170
that's one of the reasons I do is it's someone else's problem. Right. You know.

199
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,529
But, uh, so in this case, I wouldn't say that the good guys won or lost.

200
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,299
I would say that,

201
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:14,929
um,

202
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,410
I, I would definitely say to some degree this is sort of, how do I put it?

203
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,049
I don't want to say unsavory because that's sort of a moral judgment almost.

204
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:24,720
This is not something I'm a huge fan of because I wish we had better ways

205
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,609
to express this information and to, you know, reward people for this information,

206
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:30,850
but the reality is we don't.

207
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:33,489
Right. I mean, let's face it. Journalism is dying.

208
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm, I'm comfortable calling this unsavory.

209
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,520
I, I think

210
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:41,888
trying to short someone's stock

211
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:42,828
-- for
-- stupid

212
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:46,848
question. Why didn't A MD document these flaws somewhere?

213
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,448
-- Saying, oh, by the way,
-- if,

214
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,448
what do you mean, why didn't they document them

215
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:51,749
-- in their
-- documentation?

216
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:54,039
They could have said, oh, by the way, if somebody gets rude, they can, like,

217
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:54,848
go monkey with the bio

218
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:56,278
-- in this way that makes it very hard
-- to

219
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:57,218
know

220
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:57,718
about

221
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:58,419
prior

222
00:08:58,729 --> 00:08:59,729
to this report.

223
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,039
-- I would say they should,
-- I mean,

224
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,309
the

225
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,020
argument that yes, if, if an attacker breaks in, they can potentially

226
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,580
modify the bios or something like that.

227
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,979
I mean, in theory they shouldn't be able to, I, I have a suspicion.

228
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:18,000
A MD didn't know this was a plausible attack.

229
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,950
I mean, outside of the realm of crazy research. Right.

230
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,229
Um, I, you know,

231
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:27,000
part of me would say that's kind of as we're learning from specter and meltdown.

232
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,020
I,

233
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,809
I think it is maybe time for hardware vendors to do a

234
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,640
little bit more security than they have been doing in the past.

235
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,929
Um, I don't know if you saw,

236
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,580
but Microsoft has just offered a rather significant set of bounties for meltdown

237
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,619
or was it specter or both type related flaws in their, in their products?

238
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:45,989
Uh, like if you,

239
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,200
yeah, if you can show valid side channel attacks, I think the,

240
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,500
the maximum reward was like a quarter million or something.

241
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:51,960
Like it's,

242
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,640
it's a decent amount of money.

243
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:54,960
Well, I mean, they're,

244
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,719
they're already there for hyper V flaws also where

245
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,150
if you can break out of hyper V guests,

246
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,200
you can make a ton of cash.

247
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,080
But at the same time, like, let's face it, these are the kind of bugs

248
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,750
that are,

249
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:13,090
they're very, I mean, I I think even calling them very difficult is,

250
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:16,570
is drastically downplaying what's going on here.

251
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,270
I mean, the work that has to be done and the knowledge required

252
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:21,630
to figure this stuff out is crazy.

253
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:24,510
Well, it's not just that they're hard to exploit.

254
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,440
It's that

255
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,859
the, even if you do achieve exploitation,

256
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:29,580
the,

257
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,289
the information you're getting may or may not be terribly useful,

258
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:33,619
you know,

259
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,640
it's one thing to get remote code execution in a remote

260
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,219
server that's clearly easy to then leverage for something else.

261
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:39,530
But

262
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:42,739
yeah, some of these side channel attacks, you know, you have to,

263
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,090
you have to be on a system that's also processing

264
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,140
someone else's sensitive data and you have to know,

265
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,549
have some context for that data.

266
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:48,919
Like,

267
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,340
you know, if somebody gave me a pile of patient records,

268
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:53,700
it's not like I'm a bad guy and I don't know how to monetize that,

269
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:59,289
you know, I don't know what to do with somebody's uh cancer report or whatever,

270
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,530
like how to make money off that.

271
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:01,960
Um

272
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,260
So, yeah, no, I would say in this case,

273
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,369
I'm not sure the bad guys won or lost necessarily.

274
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,140
I think this was a valid

275
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,710
uh sort of investor activist activity.

276
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,739
Uh Again, not super awesome.

277
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,219
No, man. No, I'm gonna call no.

278
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,500
And here's my reasoning behind it is in the security world, there's kind of a, a set of

279
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,880
acceptable behavior we'll say,

280
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,659
can we qualify that as the information

281
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,510
security world because there's that overlap here.

282
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,380
Right.

283
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:36,280
Yes. Yes. We'll say kind of in the world of CV S. How does that sound?

284
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,479
There are certain,

285
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:43,169
I guess, expectations and behaviors that have become the norm

286
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:49,750
and telling a company giving them 24 hours to respond and then shorting their stock

287
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,140
that is in no way

288
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,219
or they shorted the stock in advance.

289
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,479
Well, ok. Right. But you, you, you get the point.

290
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:59,299
Well, ok, They were probably hoping to sell quickly, right. Like

291
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:05,880
that is not acceptable behavior. If someone did that to us, we would be livid

292
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,210
and we would probably go on our podcast

293
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,369
and complain incessantly about what they did.

294
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,219
Let me play devil's advocate.

295
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:15,929
Why is this behavior unacceptable?

296
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,789
Because let me just further playing devil's advocate.

297
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,989
If you'd given a MD 90 days to deal with it.

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,469
-- Could they have,
-- I don't know the answer to that.

299
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,619
-- What
-- about a year?

300
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:28,020
What about a week?

301
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:28,880
Look? Look?

302
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,929
I mean, we, well, we can agree that being that it's CPU hardware,

303
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,190
-- it's not like they can pivot on a diamond and release a patch
-- to.

304
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,469
No, it's not about the patch.

305
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:38,919
Even though it's about just understanding what the heck is going on.

306
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,070
As a MD.

307
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,919
I would have simply replied that, yeah, these are technically true,

308
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,659
but here's why you don't need to worry about it.

309
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:45,440
But no,

310
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:46,840
-- you and
-- we may or may not

311
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:50,840
make that determination in 24 hours though.

312
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,520
This is incredibly complicated stuff going on here

313
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:58,090
and, and I think it took even some of the smartest people,

314
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:01,510
I've paid attention to more than 24 hours to come up with

315
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,700
their stances on this, of not a huge deal.

316
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,989
And so I look, I,

317
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,460
if, if they would have told a MD

318
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,219
and said, we'll give you say 30 days even

319
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,130
and if a MD had done nothing

320
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,849
then great, right. Make a big deal

321
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,159
and, and do your thing.

322
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:23,250
But if you report something to an organization, I think there's a certain amount of

323
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,890
just reasonable time you need to give them

324
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,080
and if they're co-operative and they're interested in working with you,

325
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,840
that's the right way to do it.

326
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:35,679
What, what these people did I don't think is ok.

327
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,500
Well, see, part of the problem is

328
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,559
we're looking at this from the lens of information security.

329
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,520
But if you look at this from the lens of, you know, investment,

330
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:45,039
right?

331
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,479
I, I, I'm sorry, but as I understand the rules of investing,

332
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:51,140
if it's not blatantly illegal, you and you can make money doing it, you do it.

333
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,210
And that's the accepted norm over there.

334
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,750
And realistically, if you look at the, um,

335
00:13:57,109 --> 00:14:01,080
what was interesting to me over the CTS? Was it, is there called CTS Labs?

336
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,289
Right. I think that was the name of the, uh,

337
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,760
of the company that did this,

338
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,169
the, um, the CFO is, uh, this guy who, you know,

339
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:14,159
clearly has a background in finance and apparently, you know,

340
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,690
related to this kind of activity.

341
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:15,960
I mean,

342
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,309
so he's coming from, I'm, I'm assuming he's coming from a finance background where,

343
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:23,419
yeah, like if it's not blatantly illegal then cool. You know, and

344
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:28,309
from his perspective he's saying, ok, so we have some legitimate flaw. Ok.

345
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,570
Granted, it's very hard to exploit and not super impactful but,

346
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,580
you know, maybe the market decides it is a problem. Maybe they don't.

347
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,469
In this case, the market decided. Yeah, it's not really a problem. And,

348
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,729
well, so it didn't work out for them this time.

349
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:42,250
My question is, do you think they're going to do this again?

350
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,409
These guys might not just because they probably got burnt pretty good here.

351
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,809
My guess is they had investors and they were,

352
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,380
they were playing up how much money they were

353
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,340
going to make and they probably made zero dollars.

354
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:55,349
Well, they lost money because it costs money to short

355
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:58,429
stocks. Right. You, you have to pay to borrow the stock from somebody.

356
00:14:58,539 --> 00:14:59,929
The longer you borrow it, the more you pay

357
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:04,039
-- it's complicated. I know we'll say, ok, we'll say they lost money
-- probably

358
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:06,000
when you consider also their time and effort.

359
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,070
Yeah. All right. Right. They, they paid people no doubt.

360
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:12,210
But here's the thing I keep coming up with is

361
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:13,919
it is not illegal,

362
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,099
but just because something isn't illegal

363
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,859
doesn't mean it's ok to do.

364
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:18,039
I mean,

365
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,580
could you imagine what the security world would look like if

366
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,099
everybody was just like popping zero days and shorting stock,

367
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:26,229
it would be insane.

368
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:27,119
I'm in the open

369
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,280
source world where that's not really a problem

370
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:30,049
because

371
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,429
the majority of the open source code we have,

372
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:37,140
you know what I mean? Like, yeah, so to be brutally honest,

373
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,580
I'm not so sure this would be a terrible thing,

374
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,229
especially for some of those commercial vendors

375
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,979
that are very hard to hold accountable.

376
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,340
But more to the point like a Nintendo is a

377
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:48,049
great example because remember Nintendo had their forums and their whole

378
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,250
systems hacked like what was it like four or five times

379
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,369
in a row over a period of like 23 years,

380
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:56,140
they got denial of service. They, you remember that whole saga a few years ago?

381
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:01,789
And like as far as I remember, it did nothing to their stock price of meaning,

382
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:03,619
you know.

383
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:07,140
-- No,
-- no, because it, it didn't affect their what they do.

384
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,460
And so I suspect

385
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,820
like this one is interesting because this is kind of to the best of my knowledge.

386
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,260
This is the first time this has happened

387
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,830
now. It happened a year ago.

388
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,210
Well, no, no, no, I'm talking about a pure where it was.

389
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:23,989
It's um ST Jude is a medical company and I would say again,

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,539
the rules for medical devices

391
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:29,020
are different, but especially the legal landscape for medical devices

392
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:30,950
because here's the thing as a medical company.

393
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,890
Like if you get tied up in lawsuits and you can get your products approved,

394
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,679
then you're, you're

395
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,200
like, you're basically being held hostage in a very effective way.

396
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,320
Right.

397
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:39,969
-- I
-- mean,

398
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,989
but that doesn't apply to

399
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,280
argument

400
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:42,539
with any, I

401
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:43,010
mean,

402
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,789
a MD.

403
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,010
Well, ok, let me put it this way.

404
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,289
There's like, what, 30 some odd lawsuits up against Intel. Currently,

405
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,489
Intel is still shipping fresh silicon.

406
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,090
Right. There's no,

407
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,770
-- there's no like FDA approval. They have to go through
-- to see

408
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,109
what

409
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,890
I see what you're saying. They can still sell even if they have a lawsuit.

410
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:03,640
Yeah.

411
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,310
Or many lawsuits.

412
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,180
See, and, and with a medical company that becomes much more of a problem. So

413
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,219
I would say,

414
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:13,910
uh I'm going to ignore the medical industry and devices for now because a,

415
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,660
they're a flaming train wreck and b

416
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,739
there's that whole other set of considerations legally, right?

417
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,489
So I'm just going to go with like the pure, like the,

418
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:23,770
you know, the AM DS Intels, the, the traditional software,

419
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,749
I think what's interesting to me is this is as

420
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,538
far as I know the first time that this has happened

421
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,938
in sort of the normal software world, hardware world.

422
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,729
And apparently the market,

423
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:35,899
I don't know if the market necessarily reacted

424
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,818
correctly or simply didn't react at all.

425
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,729
Right, because that's the other option, right?

426
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:42,219
Most people read this like, I don't get it, whatever, who cares?

427
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,310
A and BS fundamentals are great, you know,

428
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,290
Bitcoin is making their GP us fly off the shelf.

429
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,650
So like like straight up, right? Who cares?

430
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,060
So, my thinking is,

431
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:54,050
are we going to see more of this and how are the markets going to react?

432
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,930
And I suspect

433
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
uh

434
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,130
if you can make money doing this, people will definitely try

435
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,119
that. That's just a fundamental thing, right?

436
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,530
If people see a new scam, somebody will try.

437
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:04,959
That is probably true.

438
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,150
-- Now,
-- the question is, will that actually work? And

439
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,489
I'm guessing

440
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,400
probably not because we have this huge history of

441
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,630
just for a whole pile of reasons.

442
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,010
It's basically impossible to actually sue a software company for damages.

443
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,199
It, it is. And, and I also want to clarify one thing at this point is

444
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:27,410
I don't think either of us believe this behavior should be illegal.

445
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:32,689
I do think it is unethical, but I think it needs to be legal and before we die, I,

446
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:36,530
I think that that's a really important point we should, we should discuss as well is

447
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,420
here's the thing.

448
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:38,849
If, if,

449
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,170
if behavior like this was considered insider

450
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,290
trading and you couldn't trade in securities

451
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,310
that would put people like security researchers at a

452
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,670
major disadvantage just in terms of living their life

453
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:50,949
because all of a sudden,

454
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,150
you would have tons of insider knowledge

455
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,790
about any product or company you were investigating

456
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:59,020
-- and that would be awful.
-- Well, and this is the whole point, right?

457
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,310
People are supposed to be allowed to use expert knowledge and expert,

458
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:08,969
you know, methodology to divine the future performance and price of a company.

459
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,349
That's the whole point of the stock market.

460
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:11,880
Right.

461
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,589
You know, is we have all these different actors

462
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,439
pricing the market and, you know, coming to a consensus

463
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,260
and, and

464
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,849
to be clear, it doesn't always work.

465
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,229
Uh, there's been some epic failures

466
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,339
but by and large, I mean, it's the least worst system we've found so far.

467
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,859
Right. Kind of like democracy.

468
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:33,839
Um, well, it's certainly better than a command and control economy,

469
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,579
like a variety of, sort of communist states tried,

470
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,069
you know, the, the,

471
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:40,829
the quality of life index over in those places wasn't so awesome.

472
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:41,810
Um,

473
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:44,750
what's so, and see what's interesting to me is

474
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,140
because I was also poking on the SEC website.

475
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,329
So there's definitely ways to file complaints and report fraud.

476
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:53,420
Well, security flaws don't fall under that.

477
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:57,010
Right. This isn't fraud. This isn't, you know,

478
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,719
so the question becomes, like I said, how do we,

479
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,030
if a vendor doesn't behave in a way, like, say Microsoft where they, like,

480
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,390
run a big bug bounty with like real cash, like real cash amounts.

481
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,449
I'm not talking like five grand because let's face it. Right. For a skilled hacker

482
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:14,439
to spend a month working on something or two months,

483
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:17,660
working on something and have a possibility, not the guarantee,

484
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,780
but the possibility of maybe only earning upwards of

485
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,290
like one or two grand or five grand.

486
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,339
It's just not worth it.

487
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,680
Right.

488
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:24,920
You know,

489
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,650
uh, to put it bluntly, you can sell something like that to the bad guys for more money.

490
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,650
Right. And

491
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,250
that's what I really am impressed with a lot of these, you know,

492
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,550
new bug boundaries is the amount of money involved is enough

493
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,849
that you can actually make a living doing this and,

494
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:38,810
you know,

495
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:42,020
do the right thing but not all vendors

496
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,810
do these bug bounties and we, and I don't think we can or should expect them to

497
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:49,089
because I would say there's also that, like you said, that ethical component of,

498
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,140
you know, like

499
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:51,939
if I spot a flaw

500
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,130
in a crane,

501
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:55,550
you know, I'm going to report it because I don't want the crane to fall down.

502
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,369
I'm not going to report it because I want to make some money

503
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:00,170
on the flip side. If I'm a crane inspector, you know,

504
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,729
then I'm incentivized

505
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,560
to make a living at this.

506
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:06,699
So I, I think really what it boils down to is, yeah, this is,

507
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,060
I don't know that I would call this behavior unethical.

508
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,459
-- It would, I would, like I said, it's
-- no, II, I think it's unethical.

509
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,060
It's distasteful in a way.

510
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,780
But I don't know that there's a better way. I don't know that there's a better way.

511
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,959
There is a better way. Look.

512
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:23,540
So here's the thing, if you're a security research company,

513
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,000
which they're clearly not because they spun themselves

514
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,079
up just for the sake of doing this.

515
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:28,619
Ok?

516
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,089
When you create yourself

517
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,410
just for the purpose of shorting someone else's stock

518
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:36,250
that is unethical,

519
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,569
right? Because

520
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:41,569
their goal was to make a mess for a MD, right?

521
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,530
Their goal wasn't to make the world a better place.

522
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,280
Their goal was to make a mess for a MD and profit off of it.

523
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,209
Arguing devil's advocate from an investor perception.

524
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,890
Their goal was to get the market to price the

525
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,410
stock correctly and in doing so make money from it.

526
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,849
Look, I'm, if,

527
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:59,930
if, if I have to argue that investors are ethical,

528
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,089
we're in trouble.

529
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,689
Ok? Because they're not.

530
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:06,170
So I just,

531
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:09,630
I, I definitely don't like it because it's very messy. But here's the problem.

532
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,489
Fundamentally,

533
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,530
people need

534
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,500
to pay the rent and their bills.

535
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,959
How do we

536
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:18,770
allow them to monetize this information?

537
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,550
Right?

538
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,170
So a great example is we've got companies that make like network appliances that

539
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,579
block attacks and they buy zero days so they can block those attacks.

540
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:30,750
And then at some point, another vendor can, you know, maybe actually fix the flaw,

541
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,609
-- you know,
-- let, let's, let's pick on specter and meltdown.

542
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:35,839
Where did they come from? Right.

543
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:36,829
Was it, did,

544
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,540
did someone attempt to shorten heck you could

545
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,189
have shorted intel stock after that one,

546
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:40,729
couldn't you?

547
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,510
But,

548
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,170
but here's the thing like

549
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,010
how, how are those paid for?

550
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,849
And, and

551
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:46,949
I'm asking you,

552
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,459
I don't know who uh I don't know if

553
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,449
the original researchers were recompensed in any meaningful way.

554
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,530
Well, they, they were because they, they had jobs. Right.

555
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,270
It was essentially Google Project Zero. And then there were some, some other,

556
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,770
well, there was a university involved, I think if I remember.

557
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,479
But anyway, the point is these people had jobs.

558
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,560
So, what's the incentive for project zero?

559
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:10,319
Well, they're essentially trying to reduce their costs, I assume, by, you know,

560
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,760
having less incidents and less problems to deal with,

561
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,459
by proactively dealing with it.

562
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:16,119
Well, and, and

563
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:18,310
they have a name for themselves. Right.

564
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,400
There's a certain amount of credibility they've gained by being good,

565
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,790
honest researchers that act in an ethical manner.

566
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:26,760
Right.

567
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,800
And now this company, this is what CTS, you said

568
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,140
they will never be able to interact with anyone

569
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,660
in the context of information security again,

570
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,359
because their reputation is now completely worthless.

571
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:42,579
It's worth what their shorted stock is. Right. I mean,

572
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,260
in all seriousness

573
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,300
and, and I think that's the thing is there are what, what Kac

574
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,300
has done? A bunch of cool work, didn't they do? Uh,

575
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:51,250
well,

576
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:52,359
Kac has, they did

577
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:53,040
stack

578
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,130
-- was last year.
-- Right. Right.

579
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:58,530
Right. And, and again, why did they do that?

580
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,510
Did they do it so they could short a bunch of stock?

581
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,510
No, they did it because it gave them brand recognition that is worth far more than

582
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,449
anything else they could have done.

583
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,219
They have a business model that allows them to leverage this information

584
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,619
and that's part of the problem is you have to have a

585
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,500
business model that allows you to leverage this information and monetize it.

586
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:20,540
And that takes a lot of time and effort short selling a stock is, you know,

587
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,010
if you're in the financial world and know how to do it, it's quick,

588
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,239
you know, you need a brokerage account and some cash

589
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:30,800
-- and you're ready to go
-- except when your plan backfires and you lose all your money.

590
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:31,900
Yeah.

591
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:32,699
Well,

592
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:35,400
and how many security firms have, you know, cratered out?

593
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,380
Right. I mean, nothing is risk free.

594
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,449
You know, I, I just, like I said, I'm not,

595
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,300
I cannot,

596
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,040
I, you know, 20 year old me would be horrified by this.

597
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,680
I cannot bring myself to condemn this.

598
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,109
I do not like it. Let me be clear. I am not a big fan of this because I wish we had

599
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:55,910
more efficient and effective ways

600
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,859
of incentivizing people

601
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,439
to do things that I think are ultimately good. Like reporting security flaws,

602
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,260
at least somewhat responsibility, giving the company, you know,

603
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,020
some amount of time to digest it or deal with it

604
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,849
more than 24 hours.

605
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,530
Yeah. But at the flip side, I'm not sure I have

606
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:17,400
any be good answers.

607
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:21,489
You know, like what I've done in the CV world is, I've, I've tried to reduce the cost.

608
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:21,930
So,

609
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,130
you know, we still,

610
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,650
it's still a cost to get a CV E but hopefully

611
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,510
now it's only a few minutes versus like hours of effort,

612
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:29,880
you know,

613
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,079
so I can at least bring the cost down.

614
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:34,829
And, and ideally also improve the benefit by making, you know,

615
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,150
the data is now machine readable.

616
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,589
So more people can consume it and

617
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:38,880
you know, leverage it.

618
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:39,839
But

619
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:41,359
fundamentally, as I said,

620
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,170
OK,

621
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,250
we've got people who do the right thing for the sake

622
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,400
of doing the right thing because they're good people and that,

623
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,089
you know, that will always be some percentage.

624
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:49,550
We've got people who do the right thing

625
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,020
because it aligns with their company's interest.

626
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,969
A great example being, you know, project zero, right? They want,

627
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,479
for example, Tavis, Tavis

628
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:57,579
Rindy is looking at

629
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,030
um update or software for stuff that's used on hundreds of millions of computers,

630
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,760
like, you know, uh what is it, um uh

631
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,780
Starcraft with the Starcraft updater, right?

632
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:06,520
You know,

633
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,390
somebody pops that thing that's like 100 million gaming computers taken all,

634
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,449
you know, taken over.

635
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,300
Then we've got companies with a direct business model of, you know, we,

636
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,609
we use the security vulnerability information

637
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,239
to, for example,

638
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,290
uh create

639
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,849
filtering rules for our product that you then

640
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,829
subscribe to so that this attack is blocked

641
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,849
and it's blocked.

642
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:26,069
Well,

643
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,089
in advance of the vendor being able to actually update

644
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:29,640
it and ship an update and more to the point,

645
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,670
maybe you don't have to spend money applying that update as much, right?

646
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,290
So that's cool.

647
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:34,630
Um

648
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:39,219
So we've got those sort of three models with the bug bounties.

649
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:40,760
I wouldn't say the bug bounties are

650
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:41,790
they,

651
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,719
they essentially the bug bounties are an expression of

652
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,109
companies that want to do the right thing.

653
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:45,619
Or

654
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:48,189
the bug bounty is cheaper than, like,

655
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,780
dealing with these catastrophes going public all the time.

656
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,150
Right.

657
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,989
Like,

658
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,420
if a MD offered a bug bounty of half a

659
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,689
million dollars and they'd gone to a MD privately,

660
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,910
I'm guessing that that would have been even just

661
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,689
for all the amount of stress and hair pulling.

662
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:01,369
A MD went through would probably be cheaper.

663
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,229
This would not have gotten half a million dollars.

664
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,510
No, but I, that's, that's my point too with this. Right, is that,

665
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:08,729
you know, again,

666
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:12,609
the good flaws aren't even guaranteed to be monetized through a bug bounty.

667
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:13,829
So bug bounties are very,

668
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,250
they're, they're good and I think they should exist, but I don't think they're the,

669
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,140
the, the be all end, all answer.

670
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,489
And so then the question becomes apart from those kind of four models I've gone over.

671
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:26,010
Well, how else do we get people to incentivize these flaws?

672
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,569
And I mean,

673
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,839
one thing I'm running into a lot right now with CV and CV numbering

674
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,170
authorities is a lot of researchers who want to become a CV numbering authority.

675
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,989
I'm assuming either A to put that directly on their resume or B to

676
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,589
just pad their resume out with a pile of BS CV ES because,

677
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:43,939
you know, I've had some people who, their rejection rate for CV request is like,

678
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:45,319
basically 90 some percent, like,

679
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,900
they've had like one or two good ones and the rest are garbage.

680
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:48,800
Right.

681
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,260
Right. And this is actually where some of the bug bounty

682
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,859
companies get it. Right. Because they, they give you a score and if you have too many,

683
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,520
uh, false, false negatives or false positives, I guess it would be

684
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:02,160
you,

685
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,660
you get docked.

686
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,689
And so obviously researchers have an incentive.

687
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:07,260
Of course, there's,

688
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,099
there's some hilarious Gamification that happens around that and

689
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:11,520
we should talk about that some other day.

690
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,060
But

691
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:13,250
fundamentally,

692
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:17,739
it does make researchers more careful to not just like send garbage,

693
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:18,459
which

694
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,130
I appreciate as being someone on the other end to that fire hose.

695
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:25,770
Yes. Oh, I know.

696
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,079
Yeah, I mean, I'll be blunt, that's why I went to the, the, the web form,

697
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,520
but I want to see you that asked a whole bunch of

698
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,349
questions and you better fill all of it out correctly or I'm

699
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,079
going to send you an email saying I need more details and

700
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,619
then I'm going to it until you reply with more details because

701
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,650
I don't have time to track all this crap down.

702
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,969
And even when they fill out all the details correctly,

703
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:47,250
I'm still finding like about a 25% to 40% rejection rate overall.

704
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,790
-- That's a lot.
-- Right. Right. But again,

705
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,900
why are people doing this

706
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,500
in, in the case if I want a CV E for free

707
00:28:56,709 --> 00:29:00,339
because the way, the way you're talking about everything needs an incentive.

708
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:03,229
Uh, the resume padding is a clear incentive for a lot of them,

709
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,609
for the vendors requesting CV S, they want the CV because, you know, it just,

710
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,319
it actually does make their life a bit simpler.

711
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,199
Well, and not only that, I mean, one of the things I tell people all the time is look,

712
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:16,550
if, if you're working with a vendor who has zero CV E I DS in their product like that,

713
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,000
someone who doesn't care or isn't paying attention, right?

714
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,839
That, that you need to be careful with them.

715
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,449
CV E is one of those things that's like

716
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:28,790
-- I wash my hands after I use the toilet,
-- right? What's an indicator?

717
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,550
How do I know that?

718
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,180
-- Because I publish CV.
-- Si mean, yeah, somebody with or sorry, a vendor

719
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,729
or a project with no CV. Si would wonder. Yeah.

720
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:38,780
Do they have any security response going on?

721
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:42,050
So, yeah. No, like I said, overall, I'm not

722
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:45,119
a big fan of what happened, but at the same time, I think

723
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:45,770
this,

724
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:47,469
I don't know, II

725
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:49,829
I am curious to see if this happens again.

726
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,930
I assume it will happen again because it does

727
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:53,469
have the potential to make a ton of money.

728
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,969
I mean, if you can move a share price one or 2%

729
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:58,790
you can potentially make a lot of money if you know what you're doing.

730
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,390
With short selling or put, uh,

731
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,569
you know, with options.

732
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:05,449
And here's, here's my point is I still don't like this because if,

733
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:08,709
if someone did this to me, I would be livid with them

734
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:11,989
24 hours is not an acceptable amount of time.

735
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,489
Now, now, I will say

736
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,810
if you report a flaw to a vendor

737
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,239
and the vendor ignores you for some predetermined amount of time

738
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,640
game on.

739
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,359
Right.

740
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,670
That's when full disclosure is totally reasonable.

741
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,479
In my opinion,

742
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:27,550
if the vendor isn't playing nice and they're

743
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,719
trying to strong arm you or they're ignoring you

744
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:35,000
go public because that is the easiest way to just make it all happen.

745
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:36,770
And in fact, funny enough, I mean,

746
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,920
that's how people used to have to deal with some of the large vendors back in the day.

747
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,630
I mean, it was very common.

748
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:43,739
Yeah. Oh,

749
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,569
I remember those, those bugs being released with timelines in the years.

750
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,780
Yeah. Right. It was, it was terrible.

751
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,849
And this is where, like, some people harp on project zero for 90 days. I get it

752
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:58,540
90 days for some, some people is not a long time, but at the end of the day

753
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,619
it, it matters and you don't want this stuff dragging on forever.

754
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:06,930
And so I'm, I'm ok with 90 days, I'm not ok with 24 hours

755
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,729
whether you want to short the stock or not,

756
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,660
I guess let's put it that way.

757
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,739
I can ignore the shorting aspect of this.

758
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,630
I don't like the 24 hour aspect of this. Right.

759
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:23,079
If you give a vendor 90 days and then short their stock. Great. I'm on board.

760
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,000
Good for you.

761
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,170
But if you give them 24 hours, whether you short the stock or not,

762
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,079
-- I'm going to say not
-- cool.

763
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,589
What's most interesting to me is I suspect they picked

764
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,880
the wrong target because when you think about the security,

765
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,079
the information security world,

766
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,910
there's sort of three kind of large groups. There's like the hardware vendors,

767
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,880
you know, which is actually a relatively small group, like there's Intel,

768
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,520
there's a MD

769
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:46,030
and arm,

770
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,770
then there's the software vendors which is a

771
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,780
larger group and then there's the service providers.

772
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,560
And I suspect actually

773
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,780
the kind of company that would be most

774
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,449
impacted by this would be the service providers,

775
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:01,780
especially with things like GDPR coming in.

776
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,510
I mean, imagine if you found a major something as a service

777
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,500
and you found a way to disclose like people's names and email addresses,

778
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:10,989
well, under GDPR,

779
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:14,150
that has the potential for some really huge fines

780
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,859
and that is a clear and immediate consequence that the market does understand,

781
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:20,589
you know.

782
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,359
So

783
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm curious, I, if I had to guess I would say that the next target,

784
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:27,250
um

785
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:32,550
because let's face it intel and a MD of whether the, you know, quite a bit and clearly,

786
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,069
you know, investors aren't going to panic.

787
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,380
I suspect the next target is either going to be software vendors, which again,

788
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,660
I suspect won't really work because

789
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,800
-- like, how many CV S a year does Microsoft Fix or like Red Hat or you guys like a lot?
-- Oh,

790
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,150
yeah, it's, it's quite a bit and, and I know that actually this is something that

791
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,209
more than one person

792
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,209
I've assisted

793
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:58,390
in doing some research to do CV ES affect share price.

794
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:03,530
And we have never been able to correlate that ever even for terrible things.

795
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:07,520
So I suspect it'll be the services will be the next target for

796
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,829
this because also the services don't really have a good track record of like

797
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:13,319
saying, oh, we have this flaw that we fixed, right?

798
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:15,420
Most of that stuff just happens behind closed doors.

799
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,709
No, it, it does. I know. Uh

800
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:18,630
I don't know, man.

801
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,709
May maybe, maybe, why don't we, why don't we end it there and just say

802
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,609
when, when it happens,

803
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,510
we'll be here, right?

804
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,819
And we'll be happy to talk about it and, and maybe

805
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,869
we, we, that we will of all the things in the world that that is more true than any.

806
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:38,260
All right, sweet. So, thanks, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
