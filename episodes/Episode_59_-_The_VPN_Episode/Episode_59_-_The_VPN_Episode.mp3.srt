Hello and welcome to episode 59 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,100
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:11,840
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,399
-- What's new Kurt? Not a lot. It's been a quiet week. It has
-- been a really quiet week.

4
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:17,290
I was thinking that too.

5
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:21,090
There, there's not a ton of news which, which actually makes me happy

6
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:22,430
because as,

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,909
as you brilliantly suggested is this gives us an opportunity to

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,469
kind of talk about an idea instead of necessarily current events.

9
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:31,500
So

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,990
thanks to, thanks to Kurt, everybody we are going to spend,

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,709
I guess,

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,459
as much time as we can bear

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,509
talking about VPN S, which is actually a really interesting and fun topic.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,700
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's, I mean,

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,500
well, for a whole pile of reasons, you know, people might want to have

16
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,860
a VPN either the traditional corporate, you know,

17
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:55,159
where they dial into their home network or their corporate network

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,500
or,

19
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:57,020
I mean,

20
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,340
or you dial into your home network so you can, like, check on the cat or whatever.

21
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:02,279
I basically do the same thing

22
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,389
in my house.

23
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:04,019
Right.

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,889
It's an easy way to get in

25
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:10,540
and of course, you know, for people surfing the web, they might want to, um,

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,040
not necessarily hide what they mean,

27
00:01:13,169 --> 00:01:16,519
but at least, you know, not have it logged at their ISP or, you know?

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,769
Well, and there's a lot of countries now and I used to, well,

29
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,540
we would have joked about these countries but now they countries like the UK,

30
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,449
you know, where the stuff is logged.

31
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,900
Um, I believe they have to hold it for, like, 12 months or something ridiculous.

32
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,739
Why is it that long? That's crazy.

33
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,019
Yeah.

34
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:32,220
Well, I remember when it came out, there was a real concern about like,

35
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,110
seriously how much is this data storage going to cost?

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,900
Because

37
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,250
uh

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,989
yeah,

39
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:39,970
so anyway, so there's a whole bunch of good reasons for VPN S.

40
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,230
Um

41
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,480
And we're gonna discuss basically some of the technology behind VPN S and what you

42
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:48,370
might want to look for and then I think we'll kind of briefly go over

43
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,269
VPN services uh that are kind of more for home users.

44
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:56,730
You know, obviously, if you're running a corporate mothership, there's like,

45
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:01,800
really like what four or five major choices of VPN provider like Cisco and

46
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,199
I'm sure there's others

47
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:06,239
and you just go buy one of them,

48
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:06,879
right?

49
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,880
Yeah, nobody, nobody really sets this stuff up.

50
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,800
Um

51
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:15,759
But yeah, so, so speaking about VPN S and the sort of the technology behind it and, um

52
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,130
I mean, obviously one of the first big things,

53
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,699
uh but behind a virtual private network is,

54
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,690
you probably want to actually be private.

55
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:27,210
I suppose that's a reasonable assumption.

56
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,750
Yeah. I mean, but there are VPN technologies still out there and use that are, like,

57
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:35,559
really easily cracked or hacked, you know, ones that use like

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,910
really weak encryption, like, say DES or three des.

59
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,309
Yeah. Yeah. No, there are plenty. Well, not only that, I think

60
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,570
this is where I like to think about

61
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,929
Tor as well,

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
is Tor

63
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,110
is meant to be a very private system.

64
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,350
And, and the reality is that

65
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:57,520
if you're trying to escape the eyes of, let's say a nation state,

66
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,190
you're not going to do it with Tor

67
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,259
because these are adversaries that have the ability to

68
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,699
watch most of the traffic going in and coming out

69
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,520
and you can actually discern a lot of really

70
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:12,809
interesting data just by paying attention to what is coming

71
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,139
-- in and what is going out
-- or you simply run

72
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:18,100
an exit node block all the encrypted outgoing connections.

73
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,570
So like, you know, port 443 from secure web and stuff,

74
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,500
uh you know, only allow like port 8025 that kind of stuff and then just

75
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,500
uh well, log all the traffic,

76
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:33,169
you know, it literally can be that simple. I remember. I don't, I don't think

77
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,990
that is quite as effective now because there's, you know, a lot of,

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,789
a lot more websites are using HTTP S now.

79
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,389
Well, well, even with http si mean, if you're visiting,

80
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,809
you know, like, like buy guns

81
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,509
online.com, which they're gonna know

82
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,619
it, it's pretty obvious what you're doing. Right.

83
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,699
-- And, and
-- there's, there's been, uh,

84
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:59,270
studies and work done on actually analyzing the HTTP s like just the traffic flows

85
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,179
to see,

86
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,960
you can tell basically which web pages they're specifically visiting at

87
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,779
certain websites based on their sizes and their responses and,

88
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,020
you know, the calls to other domains, the calls to other,

89
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:10,149
you know, web,

90
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:10,820
um,

91
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,429
-- resources and whatnot.
-- Right.

92
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,250
Yeah, it's crazy, man. So, so anyway, we, uh we, we won't spend a ton of time on Tor

93
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,309
because

94
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:21,548
it's sort of a VPN. It's sort of not and it does some other stuff.

95
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:23,390
But, but anyway, on to the VPN.

96
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,170
Yeah.

97
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,130
So I guess, well, I mean, that would be one of the biggest things is, first of all,

98
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,459
you want to make sure it's using

99
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,000
a VPN technology that doesn't suck.

100
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,070
Like PPTP point to point tunneling protocol, which is the old windows based stuff.

101
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,239
I hope nobody uses it anymore.

102
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,910
Well, it comes by default in windows on both the server kind of side and client side.

103
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,299
So

104
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,700
I'm guessing a lot of people still use it because, you know, it's,

105
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:50,559
it's free and it's just built in and set up is pretty simple.

106
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,079
Uh But yeah, it's completely just broken.

107
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,850
-- There's no nice way to put it.
-- Right.

108
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,369
So, so let me ask you this, what is, what is your VPN client? Of choice.

109
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,529
Uh I typically, if it's a Linux

110
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:04,750
machine or UNIX

111
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,200
machine, I use open VPN.

112
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,950
-- Open VPN is pretty solid man. I like
-- it

113
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,260
well and it comes by default.

114
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:14,279
It does, it generally works, it supports modern protocols.

115
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,190
It's nice

116
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,279
and the majority of the VPN providers provide open VPN. Config

117
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,320
Yes.

118
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:26,279
In fact, all of the ones I have used in recent years, I have Open VPN has been

119
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,329
my client of choice,

120
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,089
which is, which is nice.

121
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,100
And in fact, my, my router,

122
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,290
I have an ASIS router. I think, I don't even remember now.

123
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,730
But it uh yeah, it, it, it,

124
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:39,109
it has a, a

125
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,850
button I can press to enable an open VPN server or I can set it up.

126
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:49,459
So my router becomes an open VPN client and VPN S me somewhere else,

127
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,940
which is really cool actually.

128
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:51,709
Well,

129
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,100
because then you can shove all your devices through easily and not have to set it up.

130
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:57,779
I mean, because quite honestly, you know, just even just

131
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,869
uh typing stuff into your phone, right?

132
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,040
I mean, I know you can import the config but yeah,

133
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,910
it's just sometimes it's easier to like

134
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,910
force the whole network through a VPN.

135
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,559
And I did that. Actually, I took a Hutu Nano. I think it is

136
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,750
and I put uh what is it open?

137
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,029
W

138
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:13,690
not open

139
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:13,890
W

140
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,480
RT

141
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:15,570
D

142
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,040
RT.

143
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,399
No, no, not that one.

144
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,820
Something on it,

145
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,109
maybe, maybe tomato. Um Anyway, I I forget off the top of my head.

146
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:25,260
But I, I basically put Linux on the thing.

147
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,480
I installed O

148
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,380
VPN

149
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,739
and it has a little switch on it and the switch is meant to be

150
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,500
used for when, when you have the, the

151
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:37,980
factory firmware to switch between wireless mode and the wired mode

152
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:42,700
and I, I set the switch up. So when I flip the switch, it turns the VPN on.

153
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,459
So that way I can like, turn it off.

154
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,630
Obviously, no VPN connect to the hotel wifi or whatever,

155
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,179
flip the switch and all of a sudden, pow, everything connected

156
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,869
to the, the hoochie Nano is now VPN, which is awesome.

157
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,640
Well,

158
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,730
that's a great example because my kids aren't kind of really using the internet yet.

159
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:57,910
You know,

160
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,079
they have ipads and they're locked down and they can basically

161
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,540
use like kids youtube and some apps and games and stuff.

162
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,489
But once they sort of start,

163
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,100
like, once they start surfing the web, for example, or, you know,

164
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:08,559
uh,

165
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,570
sending and receiving email, you know,

166
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,920
chances are I'm going to put them on their own wireless network

167
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,440
forced over a VPN so that if they do dumb crap,

168
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,119
it doesn't come back to me because, you know, kids are idiots and like,

169
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,540
that's not

170
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,220
a bad idea actually.

171
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,010
Well, I mean, I, I don't think they're stupid enough to, for example,

172
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,510
send in a bomb threat to their school, but kids do stuff like that.

173
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:29,500
You know,

174
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,739
um, or they get malware.

175
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,529
Right. Because they'll click anything.

176
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,920
Well, well, malware is going to happen with if you have a VPN or not. Right.

177
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:40,170
But at least this way it's like, away from all my stuff.

178
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,359
Yeah. All right. Anyway, let's do this.

179
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,959
You, you have a link to a site here. It's called VPN report.org.

180
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,279
We'll put it in the show notes

181
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:54,160
and it lists some, uh, important, nice to have and forbidden options.

182
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:57,799
I think it would be amusing. Yeah. Yeah. Let's, let's go through it.

183
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:01,160
Well, let's start with the forbidden because there's only two of them.

184
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,079
So PPTP based clearly. Yeah, if you, if you do a search for that in the CV database,

185
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,190
um, just know

186
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,910
like the protocol is broken, it's not the implement, well,

187
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,040
the implementations are also broken in some cases,

188
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:13,950
but

189
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,059
the protocol itself is just horrendously broken. And, um,

190
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,609
-- yeah, you just don't use it.
-- It's easy

191
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:22,440
to hack.

192
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:22,959
Right.

193
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:23,600
Yes.

194
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:23,970
Yeah.

195
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,600
And, and they also list data throttling is forbidden. But I,

196
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,640
I don't know, I, I can sort of like, you don't want somebody, you know,

197
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,320
paying $10 a month to a VPN provider and then

198
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,000
using like 10 gigabits per second of traffic consistently,

199
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:37,409
it would

200
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,109
probably

201
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:38,330
be a

202
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,729
situation, I think.

203
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,320
Right.

204
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,239
So, but, uh,

205
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,469
I mean, in general,

206
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,609
I wouldn't want to deal with a VPN

207
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:48,030
that does data throttling unless I'm being like abusive

208
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,719
and, and I mean, the reality is,

209
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:53,559
most of these VPN providers nowadays are 10 bucks a month or less.

210
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,280
-- I don't even know what I pay. It's not a lot though. I think
-- mine is eight or nine,

211
00:08:58,469 --> 00:08:59,289
something like that.

212
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:01,710
Look into this at some point. I mean,

213
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:05,599
I just, just pay the bill every year and I don't, I don't think about it. So,

214
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:05,820
yeah.

215
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,580
And then, so the important things, uh,

216
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,460
the first one they list is DN le protection

217
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,969
and that's actually really critical because for example,

218
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,200
uh

219
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,690
you know, you're surfing the web, you make a link, uh you make a um

220
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:21,559
uh a request for a web page on Wikipedia talking about, say fascism or whatever.

221
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,919
Uh you know, you don't want your browser making DNS lookups outside of the VPN,

222
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,719
like not over the VPN but to the public.

223
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:30,559
And this is

224
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,669
a huge problem because what happens in many instances

225
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,349
and this is actually a huge problem with Tor

226
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:36,280
as well

227
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,130
is

228
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,960
you might have a secure link

229
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,594
to wherever you're going.

230
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:41,765
But your

231
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:46,234
computer is still set up to resolve to say your I SPS DNS servers.

232
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:50,244
So it'll basically send out your DNS traffic over the VPN

233
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:52,265
to the I SPS DNS.

234
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:55,825
And so now in their logs, they basically have your exit node

235
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:58,575
-- as well as what you're doing, right?
-- Like,

236
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:02,804
like I said back to the web pages based on DNS queries in the order of them. You can,

237
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,609
you can really quite easily tell what, uh, what web pages people are looking at.

238
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,520
Um,

239
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,219
and, and so one of the things I do with this is I have, um,

240
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,919
a system that's on a VPN

241
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,119
and it's firewalled so it can only talk to the VPN server

242
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,580
and that's it.

243
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,039
-- And
-- that's the right way to do it because not only that,

244
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:26,679
the thing that always scares me is how many times have you been doing something?

245
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,280
And the VPN drops

246
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,840
and obviously just given the way TCP works,

247
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,640
it naturally keeps going

248
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,250
and it's just not using the VPN anymore. Right?

249
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,159
And it's like, oh, crap, what have I done?

250
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,309
So, and then sort of the second one they talk about is the same thing IP address,

251
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,030
leak protection.

252
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,340
So,

253
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:46,669
um again, you know, if you're, well, if your computer is on the, the quote unquote,

254
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,559
like, you know,

255
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,270
real internet with like a real IP and you're

256
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,640
not behind like a net network address translation machine,

257
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,109
you know, you,

258
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:59,320
you could potentially leak your real IP address, which would be bad because, well,

259
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,890
yeah, then they know exactly who you are.

260
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,559
-- Uh And so again, what I do with my machines ideally is uh well,
-- but even,

261
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,429
even when you're inside of a net, this can be an issue.

262
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,330
And so the, the what what happens here is

263
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,239
you might connect somewhere through the VPN

264
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,880
and then you might say,

265
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,190
visit a malicious website that then has your web browser for example,

266
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,250
start like pinging internal hosts or non IP S for example, right?

267
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,539
And,

268
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,059
and in fact, this was there was an attack some years ago using javascript.

269
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:27,770
You

270
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,190
could,

271
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,760
you could essentially, right, like like scan a network

272
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:34,330
using javascript, like over the VPN,

273
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,119
essentially because it was still allowing internal access.

274
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,320
And so really the right way to do this is to make sure that once you connect to the VPN,

275
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,989
you cannot connect to any local hosts inside of

276
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,030
your network for the duration of that session.

277
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,539
Yeah.

278
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:48,950
-- Well, basically, depending on what you're doing.
-- Well. Right.

279
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,440
Yeah, I mean, we're, we're putting the tinfoil hat on here, right?

280
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,320
Like not that I take mine off. But

281
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,289
yeah.

282
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,969
Right. Right.

283
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,869
How they get you?

284
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:57,219
-- That's
-- right.

285
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:01,299
Every time I shower, man, like I, I know they're there.

286
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:02,039
Yeah.

287
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:02,599
Yeah.

288
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,570
So, and then the next one is the web RT C league product. And again, that's the same.

289
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,130
Like here's the horrible reality web browsers have

290
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,090
gone from being web browsers to being essentially application

291
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,119
operating systems, man. Come

292
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,539
on.

293
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:14,210
Yeah.

294
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,489
And so there's all sorts of things like web

295
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,299
sockets and just there's a whole plethora of technologies that

296
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,099
essentially your browser

297
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,340
can do all sorts of cool, crazy things,

298
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:24,840
but

299
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,590
maybe somebody doesn't know what web RT C is

300
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,570
and, and we should explain it.

301
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,549
-- So
-- web RT C is

302
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,099
the real

303
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,530
time

304
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:36,619
-- communication
-- stuff. Yeah. Here we go,

305
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,190
real time communication.

306
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,549
And I mean,

307
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:41,070
I

308
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,330
-- think we used to call it Ajax back in our Yeah,
-- basically.

309
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,489
Like, so the idea is that so javascript, not java, but javascript,

310
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,460
uh which has,

311
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:52,289
if I remember. Right. Nothing in common at all,

312
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:52,950
at

313
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,619
all.

314
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,919
Yeah. I, I've never understood that, but regardless.

315
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,979
Um Yeah, so, I mean, you can build really cool apps in

316
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,859
javascript.

317
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:05,659
-- I mean, well, like Google Docs is a great example,
-- like the whole internet now, man,

318
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,500
I mean, everything is all that like real time.

319
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,320
A magic things to websites, click things,

320
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,989
type things and it's not like the good old days where you

321
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,409
were like literally visiting a new page every time you did something.

322
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:21,849
Yeah. And so, I mean, you know, there's a million ways for this stuff to leak.

323
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,179
Um So, you know, ideally you want the client.

324
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,010
So ideally what happens is these clients are kind of smart

325
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,609
enough or configured to kind of prevent that leakage of traffic.

326
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,859
-- Um Right.
-- Well, then web RT C has the extra special bonus of

327
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,580
it.

328
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,119
You can do clever things with it when using the word clever

329
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,640
loosely where it can discover things that maybe shouldn't be able to.

330
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,179
But I think the other trick

331
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,619
that you need to be careful for is when you're using a VPN

332
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,859
is if you do some things

333
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:52,820
and then you connect to the VPN,

334
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,799
you've already left like a footprint in your web browser.

335
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:56,260
Uh

336
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,650
If we can find that link eff fingerprint,

337
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,849
browser fingerprint, I think it was.

338
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,520
And it's just things like based on your screen

339
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,020
size and your offering system and your plugins.

340
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,190
Exactly. Uh, pen

341
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:09,580
to click. We'll put a link in the show notes.

342
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:13,739
Um, but, yeah, like here we go. Test me. I am leaking.

343
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,979
I'm gonna guess probably about 20 bits of information

344
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,010
uh We'll see in one second. Oh, wow. It's taking a while.

345
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:23,590
They gotta,

346
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,479
they gotta test it all man.

347
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,099
Yeah. Well, and,

348
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,270
and there's also all sorts of new tracking

349
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,710
technologies like using the html canvas or using

350
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:38,020
um you can use HSTS headers. So the, the whole security transport security headers

351
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,700
because basically you can set these headers on a browser. And then the next time

352
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,590
if you want to test

353
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,020
you, you have them, you know, make a connection to this website and you'll see

354
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:50,309
uh

355
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,010
like basically you tell them to make a connection to port 80 on the website.

356
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,460
And if they've already got the HSTS header, they'll, they won't,

357
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,299
they'll just go straight to port 443.

358
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,900
And so you could quite easily just set a

359
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:04,590
unique serial number for like every web request with,

360
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,739
you know, a unique host name

361
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,369
and fingerprint.

362
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,190
Like, well, every single request to your website,

363
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,700
you can send out a fingerprint to that web client.

364
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:17,830
-- So
-- I, I think the lesson here is that you probably need a dedicated VM or something

365
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,409
you

366
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:18,599
need

367
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:18,849
something

368
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,020
you

369
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:20,239
do

370
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:20,679
like

371
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,119
proper tinfoil

372
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,960
hat. VPN.

373
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,820
Right.

374
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,609
Yeah. And so, yeah, I mean, there's, uh, there's a million ways for this to go wrong.

375
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,359
Um,

376
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:34,099
then they mentioned speed. Obviously you want speed, right? You don't want a VPN.

377
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:34,320
That's like

378
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:36,760
-- 10-K per second.
-- That's like the whole point, right?

379
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,340
Some things are ok.

380
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,570
You know, some applications that run in the background,

381
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,159
downloading stuff or whatever, right?

382
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,099
Doesn't have to be super fast,

383
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:46,799
but speed is always better than not speed.

384
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,510
You need it fast.

385
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:51,140
And, and one thing to remember too, again, back to the fingerprinting,

386
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,510
if you're up against a nation state, right?

387
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,650
They can just simply throttle your network traffic and look at other things.

388
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,159
You know,

389
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,500
that's true. It's, you're not going to escape a nation state.

390
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,130
I mean, let's just, let's just start there if that's your threat model like

391
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,590
this is the wrong podcast for you.

392
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:08,570
Yeah. You know what I mean?

393
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,659
And then they talk about using open VPN or uh IV two I PE

394
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:17,650
based. So internet key exchange version two or, you know IP security based.

395
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:19,799
I would generally agree.

396
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:24,369
There's, there's a bunch of other VPN technologies or implementations.

397
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:31,469
Ok? No, I'm gonna say that open VPN is basically the only reasonable decision.

398
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:36,400
Ike and IP SEC are a freaking nightmare to deal with.

399
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:37,570
Yeah.

400
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,869
Well, I mean, you really have to be, well, you have

401
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,780
your provider better send you a config

402
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,190
-- file. That's all I'm gonna say.
-- It's it's even worse than that, man.

403
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,390
It's just, it's such a nightmare to deal with them.

404
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,429
-- It don't, don't,
-- please.

405
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:50,719
I know I

406
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:51,440
was

407
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,039
supposed to make this easier, but I don't think it has.

408
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:54,489
I

409
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,700
PV six has its own set of problems.

410
00:16:58,849 --> 00:16:59,390
Anyway.

411
00:16:59,780 --> 00:16:59,929
Don't

412
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:00,390
they talk

413
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:00,640
about

414
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,890
no logging or tracking? Which is sort of self evident. Right.

415
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,329
You don't ideally want a VPN that logs or track stuff because, you know,

416
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,229
10 years from now those records could be

417
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,589
requested. And

418
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:11,189
well,

419
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:13,989
even though not even 10 years from now, didn't one of the,

420
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,739
the VPN S just get in trouble for selling user data to an advertiser.

421
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,339
That's awesome.

422
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,150
I, I gotta monetize those, uh, things

423
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,469
cost recovery.

424
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,098
Uh, the next criteria they put,

425
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,750
I'm not so sure it's three plus simultaneous devices,

426
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:34,260
I guess. I mean, if you have a mobile phone, a laptop and your tablet,

427
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:40,380
maybe I, I only have a service that allows one which is fine for my purposes.

428
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,380
I assume I get it for cheaper. I mean, whatever that's up to each person.

429
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,810
If, if you've got a lot of VPN

430
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,900
to do good for you.

431
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,969
Well, I think part of it is, I mean, here's the reality

432
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:52,229
operation security. So

433
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:52,959
OPSEC,

434
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,229
the real problem with

435
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,839
OPSEC is you basically have to do it right all the time everywhere.

436
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,819
End of story.

437
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,260
Yes,

438
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,910
that really, that's the problem with security in general, right?

439
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,339
Is, is the good guys need to get it right,

440
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:10,329
100% of the time and the bad guys only need to get it right once.

441
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,219
So the odds are not in our favor.

442
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,560
And then the next two things they list,

443
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:20,959
I would have just assumed for any company they say honest billing practices

444
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:25,109
and honest marketing and actually the honest marketing I get because

445
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,239
it was actually funny, there's this one VPN,

446
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,270
actually a VPN rating site that keeps spamming me asking

447
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,750
me to put a link on my website to that.

448
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,689
So I'm not even going to give them

449
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,160
uh

450
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,760
you could get some free VPN service here, man.

451
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,989
No, because they are a VPN rating site.

452
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,109
-- Just a
-- rating.

453
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:44,060
So terrible.

454
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,859
Yeah. So anyways and like,

455
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,040
I think they also have a service because they were talking about how they use like,

456
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,939
oh no, sorry, this was the, the, the VPN service we'll discuss next.

457
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:55,890
But they, they keep talking about how they use cutting edge crypto and it's like a

458
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,369
-- and all the other normal everybody else uses it
-- like military grade.

459
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,859
It's like we make our sandwiches with bread

460
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,050
-- like, yes,
-- that's tell me

461
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:08,500
you had me at bread.

462
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,939
-- We cut our bread
-- gone.

463
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,780
We use sliced bread.

464
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,250
I, I prefer potato bread myself but

465
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,599
it's fair

466
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:18,729
but still a bread.

467
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:19,479
It is.

468
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:19,920
Yes.

469
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,280
And what's interesting is the nice to have category they have on this rating site.

470
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,760
I would actually say this first one

471
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:26,979
outside of the US.

472
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:30,560
And UK servers is actually pretty damn important because

473
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,520
-- it
-- was the number one criteria for me.

474
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,790
I'm not gonna lie.

475
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:38,670
Now, the downside is I struggle to watch Netflix

476
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,750
VPN,

477
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:42,650
but definitely

478
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,420
they mentioned a free trial. Um,

479
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:46,180
sure

480
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:51,260
we can't, you can't just skip over outside of us and UK like that. Come on.

481
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:55,660
-- It's,
-- I mean, it's so, you know, it is really quite tragic. I mean, that we've,

482
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:58,739
what used to be these jurisdictions where, you know,

483
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,949
we made jokes about other countries lacking the freedoms that we have.

484
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,150
You know, now when you actually read the laws, like the UK Rip Act or,

485
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:13,709
uh, well, like us national security letters and they're like, oh, but it's ok, like

486
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,040
a judge resides over these and approves or disapproves them and it's like, well,

487
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,380
how many has the judge disapproved?

488
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,680
And it was like, three

489
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,030
or something?

490
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,619
You know, like, it, it basically never happened.

491
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,489
Here's the thing and, and let's not get, we won't get too much into the politics of it,

492
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:27,829
but

493
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,270
kind of the entire purpose of having a VPN service is

494
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,599
that you're not going to be tracked.

495
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,800
And, and even when, even though, like, let's face it,

496
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,989
I'm not doing anything even remotely illegal in my VPN.

497
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,239
It's just, I, when I'm on the road

498
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,510
and I'm connected to airport wi fi,

499
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:48,010
I'm turning on the VPN. Right. And in all seriousness,

500
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,400
that is what I use my VPN.

501
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:50,750
The

502
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:50,969
number

503
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:54,239
one reason Google's pushing HTTP S everywhere. It's,

504
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:54,849
it's

505
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,550
revenue.

506
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,199
Exactly.

507
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,599
Well, and so here's the thing,

508
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,364
my VPN gets used when I'm at the gym because

509
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,444
their networks screwed up and I can't connect to Google.

510
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:02,464
I

511
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:03,234
was,

512
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:08,694
I'm afraid to tell them what they've done wrong for fear.

513
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:10,255
They'll accuse me of hacking them.

514
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,035
So, I just, I just VPN, I'm like, whatever the song.

515
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:14,974
Right. I don't want to get involved

516
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:19,974
and then I also use it at the airport and that's literally all I use a VPN service for

517
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:21,775
and, but at the same time, like,

518
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:23,839
I'm not comfortable

519
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,290
using a service that can be easily subpoenaed by their, that's

520
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,979
fundamentally a technology like a VPN.

521
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,750
It's not completely hack proof.

522
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,959
Like if a nation state attacker wants to, they can put enough effort into

523
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,500
manipulating your traffic flows and monitoring everywhere to see, you know,

524
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,800
where you're going and what you're doing.

525
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:44,800
But it does significantly raise the bar.

526
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,660
And another thing to significantly raise the

527
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,760
bar is to involve other jurisdictions.

528
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,790
Like if they have to go to Sweden to get a subpoena,

529
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,949
that's a lot more work than like getting a federal judge in,

530
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:57,290
you know, Delaware or whatever

531
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,589
to sign off on something.

532
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:02,349
Well, well, right. And kind of my view of it is I would rather support

533
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:04,400
a VPN in one of these,

534
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,709
we'll say friendly countries in that

535
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:10,630
respect versus necessarily supporting an organization,

536
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,060
you know, in, in the US or the UK where I know that

537
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,469
they have to legally do certain things and I'm, I'm not bashing these VPN providers.

538
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:21,660
Like they, they certainly have purpose and, and they're good at what they do and,

539
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:25,020
yeah, go ahead. Get, get a US service.

540
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,420
If you're gonna, you know, be surfing from Starbucks or whatever.

541
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,050
That, that's totally up to you.

542
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,010
But from my perspective I just see value in making sure my money

543
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,339
is going to one of these other companies because I'm sure they,

544
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,719
they probably need it.

545
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:36,660
Yeah.

546
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,640
Well, I mean, the good news is now is if you look at the actual cost

547
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,859
of either colo a physical server or even VPs hosting,

548
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,400
it is crazy cheap. It's really cheap. I know.

549
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,020
And that's the thing about a VPN server too is like, it basically uses like,

550
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,099
almost,

551
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,699
no. Well, in theory, it really shouldn't be using any hard drive at all.

552
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,739
Just the operating system.

553
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,579
They should have disabled logging.

554
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,869
I've heard stories of VPN providers where their VPN hosts or their end points,

555
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,449
I guess,

556
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,680
literally don't have hard drives

557
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:10,030
where they use like a CD ROM.

558
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,959
That way, there's literally, there just is,

559
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:15,619
there's nowhere to store data even if the machines get hacked into.

560
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,630
And, uh, and I mean, bandwidth has gotten pretty cheap.

561
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,719
Like you go to some of these companies now and like a gigabit per second,

562
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,199
sustained traffic is like

563
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,219
tens of dollars.

564
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,579
And here's the other thing is in many instances.

565
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,189
Yeah, you can just go to, you know,

566
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:34,890
essentially a network provider and you can buy a port.

567
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:38,829
It's not like where you and I are buying, you know, maybe certain,

568
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:41,969
how many gigabytes in a month or whatever, up and down.

569
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:45,880
Like, no, no, you just, you buy a port and you can do whatever you want with it then.

570
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,650
Yeah, I remember looking, even back in the day, like years ago,

571
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,089
I think it was Hurricane Electric was what, 5000 bucks for a gigabit.

572
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,319
-- But I mean, this is like a decade ago now. It's no doubt, much
-- more

573
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:59,130
like two packs of gum and a sticker.

574
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,170
Yeah.

575
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:03,910
Right. No, it's, it's super cheap, man. It's crazy.

576
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:07,189
In fact, that's one of the things I think about all the time is

577
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,550
I don't need it,

578
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,030
but I'm like I could, I should host my Amazon data in, in Europe because I can,

579
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:14,660
you know,

580
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,290
that way if something happens in the United States.

581
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,869
-- No,
-- I mean, in both places, right?

582
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,099
That way, just,

583
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:26,739
just in case like for whatever reason society crumbles in the US then, then I,

584
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:30,055
you can easily just migrate to Europe and recover my data.

585
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:30,724
Right.

586
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:33,844
I'm pretty sure if you can't get your data in the US,

587
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:36,484
that Europe is probably not going to be taking a whole.

588
00:24:36,614 --> 00:24:36,875
-- Yeah,
-- that's,

589
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:38,775
that's assuming I can get there.

590
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:41,354
Uh And that's, that's basically my assumption.

591
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:45,574
Uh Yeah, I could, I, I wonder if anyone's done that. Probably,

592
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:48,369
I believe the shortest,

593
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,630
I know the record for the shortest boat to make the Atlantic Crossing is, uh,

594
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,609
I think it's 4 ft or slightly less.

595
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:55,079
What? That's,

596
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:55,920
yeah,

597
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,050
some guy tried to set the record in a 3 ft boat and he had to turn around pretty quick

598
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,099
that it's

599
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,579
basically like a little,

600
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,410
like, think of a dishwasher with like a 3 ft

601
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,790
mast

602
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,530
-- on it.
-- Like, what is a 3 ft boat? I don't even know if I could kneel in a 3 ft boat.

603
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,489
Well, no, he had like the special bubble canopy so he could, like,

604
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,660
crouch in it basically

605
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:16,020
in

606
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:16,719
a

607
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,530
barrel at that point. Right.

608
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,489
She's getting a wooden barrel with a paddle

609
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,219
and that's what you're dealing with there.

610
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:24,689
Oh, my

611
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,420
goodness. People are crazy.

612
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,020
Well, you know, you got to set those, setting records is hard nowadays,

613
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,160
the

614
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:31,989
ones have been set.

615
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:35,810
-- No,
-- I know, I think about that sometimes is, is you think about, I remember like,

616
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:37,060
back in when I was a kid,

617
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,060
there were all these world records and things

618
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,880
and it was always a huge deal to see who is

619
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,089
going to break the next world record for whatever thing.

620
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:44,699
And now it's like, yeah, there's,

621
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,459
-- now you're basically gonna die if you try to break a record. Yeah. Right.
-- Right.

622
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:49,760
Don't, don't, don't do that

623
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,459
anyway. Anyway.

624
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,760
So next on the nice to have list is anonymous payment, which definitely,

625
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,569
if you are doing things that you're worried about getting in trouble about,

626
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
I mean, let's face it. Right.

627
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,239
One of the biggest things to deal with crime that most

628
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,010
-- law enforcement has learned is learn to trace
-- the money.

629
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,189
The money is a huge one.

630
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:13,420
And if you're, let's say, in, in a country that isn't very free in terms of speech,

631
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:14,900
this one's huge.

632
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,290
Well, more of the point too,

633
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,689
you got to remember a lot of the world

634
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:20,449
doesn't really have easy access to like credit cards.

635
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:20,900
Uh

636
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,020
So how are you going to pay them? Right. And that's

637
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:24,400
so

638
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,719
I think to some degree,

639
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:27,459
it's less about anonymous payment and more about

640
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,780
supporting forms of payment that are like nontraditional.

641
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,930
Like I know in Africa, um

642
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,050
uh you can recharge your cell phone like minutes,

643
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,930
like you can basically send credits to your friends and family

644
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,849
and those systems have become de facto currencies.

645
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,800
-- I can see that. Right?
-- Because it's way more convenient than carrying cash.

646
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,010
No bank is involved

647
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,400
and it's instant,

648
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,270
you know.

649
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,449
Um,

650
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,069
so, well,

651
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,469
Bitcoin is kind of a terrible example of an anonymous currency because a it's

652
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:58,609
not really anonymous and b it's just kind of a pain in the,

653
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:01,650
well, you can tell our listeners about your experience.

654
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,979
-- It's worth
-- a ton of money now though.

655
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,949
Well, show me the money.

656
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:10,560
I I Bitcoin Rich man. Right. That's what it's all about.

657
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,439
Send me a picture once you've converted it into Benjamin's and I'll believe you.

658
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:15,199
I,

659
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,079
yeah, I know. Anyway,

660
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,640
so I think the anonymous payment is sort of valid but even more valid for, like,

661
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:21,760
you know,

662
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,560
people just in weird parts of the world where you can't easily get a visa or an A E

663
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:26,704
or a mastercard.

664
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:27,925
Yeah, I think that's

665
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:29,925
a lot of these companies, you know,

666
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:33,895
use payment processors that look very suspiciously on, like, visas from

667
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:36,385
-- strange countries.
-- Uh, yes.

668
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:36,854
In fact,

669
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:40,655
I have this problem every time I pay my VPN bill because

670
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:44,775
it shows up as a foreign transaction taking place in their country.

671
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:47,614
And then my, my credit card fraud detection

672
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:49,594
goes crazy every time.

673
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:51,265
And I'm like, what? No, it's cool.

674
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:54,824
It's still, still me guys, like every year, same, same, same thing,

675
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,420
which is fine. I, I get it. It's, it's tough.

676
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:02,060
-- Well, it's definitely outside that statistical norm of behavior
-- and,

677
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:04,660
and it's actually funny too because when, when I pay them,

678
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,819
they always warn me that my payment is easily tracked.

679
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:12,739
And I'm like, yes, I'm, I'm ok with that guys. It's, it's cool like we're good

680
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,479
anyway. Anyway,

681
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,020
so the next one is uh P to P and torrenting, which, well,

682
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,550
obviously if you want to use peer to peer or torrenting you,

683
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:22,810
you better find a VPN that supports that.

684
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,550
I don't really know what else to say to that.

685
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:28,130
Yes, I don't know if

686
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,420
do VPN S not allow it. I mean,

687
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,650
some don't

688
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,010
or they don't,

689
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:37,020
well, they may not allow it or they don't support it properly.

690
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:37,670
Um,

691
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,300
and that's kind of back to that whole incoming connection thing because

692
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,540
the thing to remember about a lot of VPN S is they'll,

693
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,540
some of the cheaper ones, right.

694
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,729
They'll only have a single IP address with like 10 million people coming out of it.

695
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,540
That would be silly.

696
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:51,280
Well, yes and no, on the other hand,

697
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,000
it makes tracking the traffic very difficult because it's, you know,

698
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,209
it's very much aggregated.

699
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:57,260
You know what? No, I bet you

700
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,209
that

701
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,560
it would be trivial to take an added system like, like where you have,

702
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:05,130
let's say 100 users on one IP.

703
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,979
And I bet it would be

704
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,849
very simple to put those, that puzzle back together.

705
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:11,989
I,

706
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,310
I think it would depend because for example,

707
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,900
if those 100 users were all accessing Facebook

708
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,569
or

709
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,540
even then

710
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,140
even then I bet you it would not be hard to do.

711
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,959
And that would be a fascinating research project.

712
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:27,030
So someone smarter and less lazy than us, uh please go do this

713
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,270
or IV two or IP

714
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,739
A I know that they don't natively sort

715
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,180
of support traffic generation and padding to like,

716
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,670
you know, make it less kind of to normalize the traffic flows.

717
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:39,599
But do any VPN providers do that,

718
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:42,920
not where they have the client or they have the server sending

719
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,140
out traffic to kind of pad out the traffic to make it,

720
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:46,589
you know, harder to analyze.

721
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,540
I'd be amazed if any of them do.

722
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:51,859
I would assume they don't because I've never seen or heard of it happening.

723
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,500
-- Yeah,
-- that's there.

724
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:58,020
I remember research being done around this at some university some, some time ago.

725
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,459
And

726
00:29:58,819 --> 00:29:59,880
it, it works though.

727
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:05,520
If you add random garbage to your encrypted streams, it can make a big difference.

728
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,319
Although on the, on the same side though, if you're a VPN provider,

729
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:11,109
you're burning cash,

730
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:16,349
right? You're wasting capacity if you're sending garbage packets back and forth.

731
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,430
Yeah.

732
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,760
Well, and that's the problem with here.

733
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,280
Well, this goes back to the whole NSA thing of,

734
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:26,760
you know, they don't really need to break the encryption because the metadata alone

735
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,760
is more than enough in most cases, like we know

736
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,280
Alice is talking to Bob at three in the morning

737
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,199
consistently and then banks are being robbed an hour later,

738
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,459
right? It's that kind of, you know,

739
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,989
that kind of metadata who's talking to who, how like,

740
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,140
you know, they phoned this person seven times hung up after 30 seconds and then,

741
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,329
you know, finally got a hold of them and talked for an hour,

742
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,010
you know, things like that.

743
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,400
You can, you can very strongly infer relationships and, you know,

744
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,390
kind of what's going on.

745
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,449
Um And I don't have enough data and traffic which, you know, if you're a nation state,

746
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,099
you do because let's face it right?

747
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,579
As we learned from my back of the envelope, Santa Claus exercise.

748
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:05,229
I mean,

749
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:06,900
you don't even have to like,

750
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,400
spend the money upfront.

751
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,579
You can just pay Amazon monthly to track everybody on the planet. Now.

752
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,359
That, that is true.

753
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:15,810
God bless the cloud.

754
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,910
Yeah. So,

755
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,640
yeah. No, I don't think any of them do traffic padding.

756
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,079
And of course,

757
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,439
the other thing is you can't really

758
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,770
do traffic subtraction without like breaking things.

759
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,219
Uh Yeah.

760
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:33,099
Well, not only that, if, if a VPN provider is preventing, say, like, uh, Bittorrent,

761
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:37,439
that means they're, they're messing with the traffic. Right? You don't want that.

762
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:38,339
Yeah.

763
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:41,709
Well, or they're possibly not allowing any incoming connections, for example,

764
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,300
you know, actually that's another good point.

765
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,229
And that's something people have to be really mindful of

766
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,290
here is when you connect to some VPN providers,

767
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,790
your computer suddenly has a public IP address

768
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,430
and if your firewall isn't configured to, like, keep things out,

769
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:58,300
you can find yourself in trouble.

770
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,079
If you're running some services you shouldn't be in your firewall,

771
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:02,989
lets them in because now you're essentially

772
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,109
a computer just sitting on the internet.

773
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,750
Well, like your classic Windows client with the SMB reporting the computer name

774
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,359
-- and the computer name is like Lisa's PC or whatever.
-- Right. Right.

775
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:18,750
Exactly. Or, or maybe you're running SMBV one on the internet.

776
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:19,290
Right.

777
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,310
Oh, wow. Nobody does that though.

778
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,089
So,

779
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,859
and then they finally list as a nice to have

780
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:25,930
and I love that this isn't an important requirement,

781
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:26,670
is I PV six?

782
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:26,900
Oh, my

783
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,319
goodness.

784
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:30,979
We could argue for hours about I PV six and, like,

785
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,130
yeah, it's neat. But

786
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,709
talk to me in two years and I've been saying that forever

787
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,739
and I wish

788
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:40,699
it wasn't true because I PV six in theory is a great,

789
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,209
-- one
-- of my I

790
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:45,670
SPS actually supports I PV six. Now. Tech savvy.

791
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,349
They're like one of those little scrappy upstarts that,

792
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,160
you know, buys access on the actual hardware lines.

793
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,089
Like they don't, like, tell us and Shaw

794
00:32:53,189 --> 00:32:53,859
own like,

795
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,310
you know, the last mile.

796
00:32:55,569 --> 00:33:00,050
But thank, thankfully in Canada they have to resell wholesale access to other I SPS.

797
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,699
-- Yeah,
-- I've been, I actually have one of the big ones.

798
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:05,079
It used to be Time Warner and I think Charter bought

799
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:08,910
them now or something like I've had I PV six for years

800
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:15,150
and I haven't enabled and it works and I connect to things with I PV six and whatever.

801
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,630
Like,

802
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:16,869
what's the difference?

803
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,910
You know what I mean?

804
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,709
It's not changing the world and, and in fact, there have been a handful of,

805
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,209
uh, uh, hosting providers. I've used that just didn't even support it.

806
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,040
So it's like this is

807
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,770
nuts.

808
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,890
You know what I mean?

809
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:30,400
Well,

810
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,930
I know cloud flare is making some inroads there because something like 30% of

811
00:33:33,939 --> 00:33:37,290
the world's kind of internet traffic and web traffic goes through cloud flare now

812
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,849
and you can just turn I PV six on with them and then it'll talk IP

813
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,130
-- physics or I PV four to the actual
-- back end

814
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,910
they do magic kind of cloud fronting sort of thing

815
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,640
where if you don't have an I PV six server,

816
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,489
you can still connect to their I PV six service.

817
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,739
Yeah, just like with the HTTP S right.

818
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,160
The actual back end server can be HTTP,

819
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,459
it can be HTTP S with a cell sign certificate or it can be like strict where

820
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:02,020
actually has to be correctly set off.

821
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,319
See,

822
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:05,170
and like this is actually an instance where I PV six is gonna

823
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,580
be hugely awesome because I assume cloud flare just gives literally every single

824
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,820
host or whatever. It's, it's very own I PV six address. Right?

825
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:18,268
-- If they don't,
-- they're freaking small.

826
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:23,309
Well, everybody has like enormous blocks of I PV six addresses.

827
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,579
Like, it's just, you get them, that's how it works crazy.

828
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:30,739
They don't, I know they list their I PV four

829
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:31,809
blocks.

830
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,489
I don't see their I PV, hang on that cloud

831
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:39,879
last,

832
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,409
ah IP Rangers. Here we go.

833
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,188
Um,

834
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:53,320
I PV six they got slash 32 slash 32 slash ok. 123456 slash 32. So

835
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,000
that's basically six times the modern internet

836
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,370
and slash 29.

837
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,080
Good measure.

838
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,669
So I'm not even gonna bother to. Well,

839
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,899
it's a lot,

840
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,820
it's enormous, man.

841
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,879
-- That's, I think it's a
-- slash 29 again in I PV six. It's

842
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:13,340
what is it? Yeah. So it would be two to the 99th.

843
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,620
Is that correct?

844
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,270
I have no idea. That sounds

845
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:17,090
right.

846
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,580
Uh, it's a big number.

847
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:21,899
Yes.

848
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:27,320
You know what I think about sometimes with I PV six though is

849
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,469
I wonder if someday we're going to be like, oh, crap,

850
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,979
we're running out of I PV six addresses quick.

851
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:34,189
Everyone, you know,

852
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,770
we need, we need to get some back. Let's, let's renumber things.

853
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,899
I don't think we'll run out of addresses. I think we might run out of network blocks.

854
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:46,520
Uh Yeah. Ok. That's fair. That could be because

855
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,520
they're handing them out pretty, pretty willy nilly today.

856
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,699
Well, if you look at even I PV four, it's not like we've actually run out of I PV four.

857
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,860
It's just, we've run out of network blocks and a lot of them are not

858
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,790
well used. I mean, what was it like

859
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,129
mit had their own class? A

860
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,399
I

861
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,760
-- had a couple, I think back in the day,
-- you know. So like,

862
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:07,610
yeah, I mean, there's,

863
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,429
there's been a whole pile of classes that

864
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:13,330
are clearly not like remotely actually used.

865
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,330
Um,

866
00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:18,110
I, to me the most exciting things are like,

867
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,689
if in theory we got things like mobile I PV six, that would be neat.

868
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,070
But more to the point it doesn't matter anymore because everything is web based.

869
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,120
Like who cares what your IP is and what it changes when you reconnect with the server,

870
00:36:29,129 --> 00:36:30,290
I'll be like, I don't know who you are.

871
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,030
Reate. Oh, you're Bob. Cool. Yeah, I

872
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,770
was sending you video. Here you go. Here's your video,

873
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:37,080
right? Like who, who cares?

874
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,810
Well, really the only thing that cares is Google.

875
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,469
It gets touchy every time my IP address changes and it's like you have to log in again.

876
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:45,050
-- I'm like, uh, interesting,
-- you know, Google's pretty,

877
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,489
pretty kind to me about that when my IP address changes as I travel.

878
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,010
Although it knows I travel also. So maybe that's part of

879
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:57,179
I'm, I'm probably in some high risk pool of, of people not to care.

880
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,040
I know it varies because when I travel I'll kind

881
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,580
of get that initial one or two authentication logins.

882
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,719
But then I think it's smart enough to know, for example.

883
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:05,719
Oh, he's in like San Francisco. Cool.

884
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:07,199
That could be,

885
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:07,419
you

886
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:07,580
know,

887
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:08,370
I mean,

888
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:09,090
Google is not dumb.

889
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,250
I mean, this is not,

890
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:12,409
and this isn't exactly rocket science, right?

891
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,159
This is like your credit card company where you

892
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:16,129
warn them that I'm going to South America.

893
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:18,229
So please don't block my credit card.

894
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,239
You know,

895
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,639
because like I got a new credit card and then I

896
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:25,000
went to the cabin and it's like I can't spend any money

897
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,800
because I'm like a four hour drive from home,

898
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,320
which is kind of exactly what somebody who stole my credit card would be,

899
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:33,810
is try to gas up and hit the liquor store, which is

900
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,120
exactly what I do when I go to the cabin.

901
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,209
So you just have to stop exhibiting deviant behavior.

902
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:43,320
That's all I did. Anyways. I, yeah, it was just such a pain because, uh,

903
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:44,419
yeah,

904
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,739
-- so,
-- anyway,

905
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:50,500
as well as well, we, we've rattled again, which we tend to do,

906
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:54,169
uh, what about alternatives to, to VPN S?

907
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,270
I'm, I'm gonna tell you now that, you know what my favorite one is.

908
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,560
SSH.

909
00:37:59,389 --> 00:37:59,810
Yeah.

910
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,780
And you know,

911
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:05,399
that's the SSH team has done some real good stuff around setting up SSH for VPN.

912
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:05,610
And

913
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,649
see this is my biggest annoyance with VPN.

914
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:10,219
And on the other hand, I get it that it's necessary.

915
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:12,969
It's like you have to have sort of administrative control of the machine.

916
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,939
Um But more to the point, like quite often, I don't want all of my machine to be VPN.

917
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:21,520
I just want like one or two high risk apps to be VPN

918
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,669
and that could be sometimes.

919
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:27,310
And so like a great example of that is when I'm traveling, right?

920
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,770
Like I wanna use my web browser

921
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,110
um

922
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,040
to surf the web, but I don't want, yeah, like the hotel network shenanigans

923
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,020
to go on or whatever, you know, somebody to inject malware or,

924
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,449
you know, put an ad server in with malware or whatever, right?

925
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:44,590
So what I'll quite often do is just set up a local SSH port, you know,

926
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,500
redirect like local port 80 to a remote server

927
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,050
and then, you know, point my web browser at that port 80 as the proxy.

928
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,010
Well, you know, you can ssh has,

929
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,929
it's like dash capital D or something that turns it into a sox proxy.

930
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,050
Yeah, that's the one I use, which is amazing.

931
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,169
Yeah.

932
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:02,669
Yeah.

933
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:06,010
No, it's, and it's because, well, I'm not going to say everything has a socks proxy.

934
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,229
Everything used to have a socks proxy, like 50

935
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:08,570
years ago.

936
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:08,979
It was

937
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:09,419
huge.

938
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,879
-- But Socks is basically, I think outside of web browsers, it's pretty
-- dead.

939
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:16,320
I can't think of anything outside of a web browser

940
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:19,520
that, that I would even use it with, to be honest with you.

941
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,270
Uh email client,

942
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:26,010
email client, my email clients, my web browser,

943
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:27,580
-- let's face
-- it.

944
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:29,760
Everything, web browser is everything.

945
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah, that's all it is. Everything else supports my web browser.

946
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,479
That's, that's life.

947
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:36,229
So

948
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:39,429
I mean part of me ascribes to that whole uh what is the Google

949
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,889
Man for all the times I mentioned this, you think I'm on

950
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,169
the

951
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:42,790
Corp

952
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,370
beyond Corp where, where,

953
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:45,820
where the assumption is essentially even your

954
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,439
internal network is like the public internet,

955
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:49,830
you have to just encrypt and authenticate everything.

956
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:51,080
You know.

957
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,229
Funny enough is I now have that kind of view of my home network

958
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:57,810
where I used to like have segments and stuff and I'm like screwed.

959
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,709
It's all flat now

960
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:01,409
because I view my Children as adversaries.

961
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,260
So I I cannot trust them,

962
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:07,379
not in the context of them like hacking me, but rather

963
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,090
I'm sure the devices they use will certainly have malware on them.

964
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,060
And so

965
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,969
I have to assume they're compromised in some way.

966
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,800
Yeah, that's, that's my problem. Exactly. Right.

967
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,179
My kids are getting old enough that they're going to

968
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:20,790
want to start browsing the web and it's like,

969
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,830
you know what?

970
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,139
At first I was like, oh, be careful doing this and this and this and now I'm like,

971
00:40:25,149 --> 00:40:25,899
you know, what?

972
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:29,659
Screw it. I'm just going to wipe this computer probably a couple of times a year.

973
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:31,110
And that's, that's life. Now,

974
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,090
that's one of the reasons I like being with an Apple device is you can

975
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:39,219
-- wipe the device and reset it except
-- you probably have time machine backing it up.

976
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,419
-- So you've got all your malware safe and sound.
-- Not

977
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:41,899
the

978
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,169
ipad.

979
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:44,310
Those are all whatever.

980
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,169
Ok.

981
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:46,449
You know.

982
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,030
Uh, yeah, tablets. Well, and this other nice thing about tablets too, right?

983
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,679
Is it's really difficult to store files locally. Like you can't

984
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,879
kind of locally from your web browser easily. Save a file.

985
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:57,360
I mean, you can, like, save a, you know,

986
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,239
you can kind of send it to another app but you

987
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,800
can't just like locally dump stuff onto the file system.

988
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:02,800
Yeah.

989
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,290
Yeah.

990
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,020
Or if you do it's kind of more contained like

991
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:10,790
VLC media player, you can download files but it lives within the VLC app.

992
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,540
So if you blow that app away, it's gone.

993
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,250
It's,

994
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:14,040
I love that

995
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,280
I absolutely love that.

996
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,379
-- You know,
-- because,

997
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:17,860
you know,

998
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,479
it's something I just realized wasn't on this list

999
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:22,879
for VPN S but probably should have been,

1000
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:27,840
is this guy didn't make any reference in any way to,

1001
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,939
you could maybe claim open source.

1002
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,820
But, but having, you know,

1003
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:35,659
I guess verifiable clients

1004
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,139
-- that you can be using to connect into a VPN service,
-- well, all of them,

1005
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:42,189
if they're open VPN or IP

1006
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:42,350
A

1007
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:44,300
V two, they all have open source clients.

1008
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,909
And that's true actually, because if you're using open

1009
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,139
VP, I mean, open VPN by its nature, I guess, start as an open

1010
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,340
source project, didn't it?

1011
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:54,719
Yeah. Well, and for example, on my Macs, I use viscosity,

1012
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:57,129
right? Which is a pretty nice client.

1013
00:41:57,149 --> 00:42:01,389
I am familiar with that because actually getting a VPN client on a Mac was a pain.

1014
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:03,909
Basically, you use viscosity. That's how,

1015
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,060
that's what I anything else is, doesn't

1016
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:06,750
really

1017
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:06,889
work.

1018
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:09,070
I read some things and then I paid money for it,

1019
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,949
which really bothered me because I haven't actually paid for software in like,

1020
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:12,790
years

1021
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,469
and I'm thinking what, who pays for stuff anymore.

1022
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:18,669
But in this particular instance, it had to be done.

1023
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,580
It could have been,

1024
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,929
well, the reality is my Mac runs a whole pile of random stuff that, like,

1025
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:27,969
I hope the guy is not a bad guy because I, you know, it, these things,

1026
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,129
auto update once every month or two and like,

1027
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,969
uh, how could I possibly know if they're evil or not like, well, Handbrake. Right.

1028
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:35,489
It got

1029
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,429
a mirror site got fiddled

1030
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:37,620
with

1031
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:39,770
-- and it didn't get caught with
-- that

1032
00:42:39,899 --> 00:42:42,449
Google chrome extension that got hacked.

1033
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:45,439
-- We talked about that
-- last, last week, I think.

1034
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,530
Just madness, man.

1035
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:48,699
Yeah.

1036
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:52,399
So, yeah, I definitely try to minimize what's on my computer.

1037
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:56,300
I want to make one more plug as well in the VPN category.

1038
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,419
Is there something, I mean, give me an eye on that.

1039
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:00,840
That's kind of, I will call it an up and comer perhaps,

1040
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,840
but it's something called wire guard

1041
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,520
and I'll, I'll put a link in the show. No, it's,

1042
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,469
I'm intrigued by it and I hope it does work out.

1043
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,340
Yeah, it's super crazy.

1044
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:16,479
And so so generally speaking, the we'll say historical VPN S had a very

1045
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:17,350
right.

1046
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,760
They're written by developers for people who know how to use

1047
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,860
them and if you don't know how to use them,

1048
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,469
that's too bad.

1049
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:28,500
That's part of it. But it also has that kind of Ivory tower mindset of

1050
00:43:28,879 --> 00:43:30,580
you. You kind of have the

1051
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:34,620
somebody is speaking truth out to the universe and you,

1052
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:38,379
you have your trusted certificates and all of your credentials, trusted.

1053
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:38,620
And

1054
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,540
you know what I mean? You need some level of trust up front

1055
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:45,100
before you can even really join that ecosystem. Uh with,

1056
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,179
with like open VPN is a great example in, in IP SEC is a huge example of, of this.

1057
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,939
Well, and the other ugly truth is the majority of current VPN S don't

1058
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,810
like they work in a container, but they weren't like built with containers and mine,

1059
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,399
they do.

1060
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:00,060
And so

1061
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,570
that's one thing that Wireguard really gets me is that

1062
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:06,679
uh here it is Wireguard sends and receives encrypted packets using the

1063
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:10,439
network name space in which the wireguard interface was originally created,

1064
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:13,320
which basically means it understands containers

1065
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:18,709
-- and will behave sanely and rationally inside of container,
-- which is super cool.

1066
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:21,399
But then also importantly, on this point is

1067
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,610
it's designed to be easy,

1068
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,729
kind of like how SSH works when you connect to

1069
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:28,540
a new host instead of having to find the certificates and

1070
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:30,820
certificates and blah, blah, blah,

1071
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,909
-- it's just
-- I set up a five node, fully interconnected IPs E

1072
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:37,409
thing once and adding that sixth node meant, you know,

1073
00:44:37,419 --> 00:44:39,479
I had to update all the other five nodes.

1074
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:41,100
You shouldn't, you screwed something up,

1075
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,439
-- you shouldn't have to do that. But
-- no, this was like 20 years ago.

1076
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,179
That could be,

1077
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:46,199
-- but it
-- was

1078
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:46,389
like,

1079
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:50,320
and I wasn't using certificates was basically even more impossible.

1080
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,810
So I was using like shared keys.

1081
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,600
Terrible. I know

1082
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,780
I wanted a full mesh so that, you know, it was more efficient and oh my God,

1083
00:44:58,149 --> 00:45:00,459
it, it was just like once I got it working,

1084
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:03,209
it worked and they let it run for like three years, we never patched it,

1085
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:05,760
we never touched it because, you know, if you touch it or look at it funny, it'll,

1086
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:06,179
it'll,

1087
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,709
you know, and that's actually a really good point is,

1088
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,919
is a lot of these BPN providers in, in,

1089
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:17,040
they don't touch it once it works and that's super destructive. Let's face it.

1090
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:17,780
Right.

1091
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:18,979
-- Like
-- you with your,

1092
00:45:19,189 --> 00:45:21,780
-- how long did your server stay up before a power outage hit
-- it.

1093
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,219
It might have been, I think, like, 700 days or something

1094
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,340
right

1095
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:27,250
now.

1096
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,080
In my defense, I did, uh,

1097
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:33,830
I did yum update it on a regular basis but it was obviously running a multi

1098
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:34,899
year old kernel.

1099
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:35,370
Well,

1100
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,699
-- Angie lipsy and
-- minor details. Yes.

1101
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,600
-- Right.
-- Anyway,

1102
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:41,000
see

1103
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:41,419
here. Uh,

1104
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:44,610
no, it was fine. It was running in my trusted home network.

1105
00:45:45,229 --> 00:45:46,810
Everything was ok.

1106
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:47,629
Yeah.

1107
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:50,459
No, I know. I know. That's something I thought about a lot.

1108
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:52,419
It's, uh, but, but ironically, so here's,

1109
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:55,250
here's the thing though and I'm sure people can relate to this is

1110
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,929
I didn't want to shut it down because I knew

1111
00:45:57,939 --> 00:46:01,179
the disc probably went fsck cleanly on start up.

1112
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:01,770
Right.

1113
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:02,219
And so

1114
00:46:02,419 --> 00:46:04,969
you hit the, uh, the date count limit, which I've,

1115
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,169
you know, you reboot once a year and it's just like, what?

1116
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:10,459
Right.

1117
00:46:10,649 --> 00:46:10,820
And

1118
00:46:11,399 --> 00:46:13,129
it takes like, four hours to reboot.

1119
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:15,020
I mean, it's totally like being sick,

1120
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,689
not going to the doctor because you're afraid you're gonna tell you're dying.

1121
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,340
That's exactly what it is. Stage

1122
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:20,620
four

1123
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:24,090
Melanoma. Right. Right. Exactly. Like I'm just, I'm happy you're not knowing.

1124
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,810
And that's kind of the security model of many people

1125
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,810
and, and it used to be mine.

1126
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,610
We'll, we'll say I won't say I'm perfect, but I'm certainly better.

1127
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:33,580
Uh, anyway, we're,

1128
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,219
we're nearly out of time and there's one more thing I'd like to bring up is

1129
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,260
we,

1130
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,179
we will almost certainly not be recording an episode

1131
00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:42,219
next week because I'm going to see an eclipse

1132
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:43,510
and

1133
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:46,830
I am going to see the eclipse. But here's the crazy thing.

1134
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,629
I'm going to a middle of nowhere city in Kentucky

1135
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:52,149
and, and the population,

1136
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,629
I guess is like 20,000 people or something and they're

1137
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,270
expecting it to swell to 100 and 20,000 people.

1138
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,139
I can't even imagine

1139
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:00,600
you

1140
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,100
up,

1141
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:05,590
I'm going to get gas and toilet paper and I figure everything else is fine. Yep. Yep.

1142
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,820
No, no, for real though. Are you taking your kids or just

1143
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:11,360
the whole family's gone? We're, we're super excited to go see it. It's gonna be fun.

1144
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:11,739
But yeah.

1145
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,649
No, don't lie.

1146
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:15,000
Don't laugh is we're,

1147
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,290
we're making sure we have plenty of gas and we're bringing a

1148
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,909
bunch of food and water with us just in case we're like,

1149
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:21,209
-- you know, like stuck on
-- some,

1150
00:47:21,419 --> 00:47:23,370
there was an article on,

1151
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,090
yeah, like the expected, like there were traffic jams in the one in the 19 seventies.

1152
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:32,199
And honestly, this is interesting because this is one of those things where like,

1153
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:33,439
how do you deal with the

1154
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,780
sort of security slash safety side of this event when like, say

1155
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:40,169
10% of the population all decides to stick a fork in their ear.

1156
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,489
And like, what do you, what do you do?

1157
00:47:42,919 --> 00:47:45,300
Well, ignoring the safety aspect of it,

1158
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,489
I just keep thinking from a security angle if I was like an evil doer or,

1159
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,290
or a pickpocket or whatever.

1160
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,949
Like this is, this is prime pickens here, man. Right?

1161
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:59,340
-- Like 100,000 people descending on like some middle of nowhere city in Kentucky.
-- How

1162
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,310
easy it is to fence a stolen telescope.

1163
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:04,379
I, those things are not cheap to buy.

1164
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:05,699
Not that I'm

1165
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:06,840
to be

1166
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:09,189
-- clear,
-- but I don't, I'm not bringing one with me.

1167
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,479
Maybe I'll see there, there might be a guy behind the building selling telescopes,

1168
00:48:13,939 --> 00:48:16,810
I'll keep an eye out for that and I'll certainly take a picture if it happens.

1169
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:19,570
But no, I mean, like this is something

1170
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,479
I think many people don't consider,

1171
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:24,929
but there are enormous security implications of,

1172
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:28,209
of a population increasing by a factor of 10.

1173
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:29,419
-- Yeah,
-- it's crazy.

1174
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:30,770
Even a factor of two.

1175
00:48:30,939 --> 00:48:34,969
Like, I mean, even if law enforcement basically calls everybody out on duty,

1176
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,179
you know, they only have like

1177
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,280
most, maybe three or four times total capacity at a

1178
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:40,639
single,

1179
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,429
like this probably has what? Legitimately? 10 officers at best?

1180
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,590
I mean, come on, 10 officers for 100,000 people.

1181
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:51,129
No, I mean, it just, that's the thing, the traffic alone

1182
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,300
I mean, not even considering traffic.

1183
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:54,530
Right,

1184
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,760
because that's one of the other things we're going

1185
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,780
to get up really early and drive there,

1186
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,719
hopefully before traffic gets too bad.

1187
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,050
But it, and part of it too is my drive is in the path of the totality.

1188
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,689
So worst case scenario, like park the car, look up, you know, that,

1189
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:09,189
that's plan B

1190
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:10,000
but

1191
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:13,840
no, it's just, I, I keep thinking about this and, and yeah, there's

1192
00:49:14,689 --> 00:49:16,199
my brain can't handle

1193
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,449
what

1194
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,310
-- is going to happen.
-- The

1195
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:21,500
sad thing, there was a person who specifically was going to travel to the US to

1196
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:24,030
talk to all these small towns about kind of what

1197
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,840
to expect with the eclipse and how to handle it.

1198
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,159
Public safety, food toilets, the whole nine yards

1199
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,840
and she couldn't get a work visa.

1200
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:34,399
And so she only ended up visiting like 10 cities out of like 200 planned ones

1201
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,909
or something ridiculous.

1202
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,080
And so the majority of these cities are not really all that well prepared for this.

1203
00:49:40,129 --> 00:49:42,320
I don't see how a small town could even

1204
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:44,209
remotely prepare for this because here's the thing,

1205
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,129
this is like a one shot deal, right?

1206
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:46,570
Like

1207
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,120
it's coming once

1208
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,320
and it's never coming back like you're never going to see this kind of traffic again.

1209
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:56,175
And part of me also feels bad because I imagine there's going to be just

1210
00:49:56,185 --> 00:50:00,665
like a path of destruction behind all of the people who descend on this,

1211
00:50:00,675 --> 00:50:01,935
this like 70 mile wide.

1212
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:03,875
Seriously.

1213
00:50:03,885 --> 00:50:07,385
That's what I feel like is you're going to be able to look at a map, you know,

1214
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:09,304
like an aerial shot of the United States

1215
00:50:09,514 --> 00:50:15,304
and just see like the trample marks from all the people in this path. And it's just,

1216
00:50:15,455 --> 00:50:17,054
yeah, my, my brain is,

1217
00:50:17,254 --> 00:50:19,534
and part of me is super excited. I get to see it.

1218
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:20,179
Well,

1219
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:25,360
I imagine Google traffic is just a solid swath of red through the path of totality.

1220
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:25,929
I guess

1221
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:29,370
that's assuming any of the cell phones even work. Right.

1222
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,300
Well, and there's a good example, right?

1223
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:31,449
Like,

1224
00:50:31,459 --> 00:50:35,899
I know a lot of stadiums and stuff are set up for a sudden influx of 1020 50,000 people.

1225
00:50:36,229 --> 00:50:39,360
But I'm guessing most small towns aren't prepared for

1226
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,360
like four times as many cell phone users.

1227
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:42,439
Right? And, and

1228
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,860
much less 10 times as many. Right.

1229
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:49,020
I'm totally expecting to have zero cell coverage the entire time.

1230
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,899
I'm, I'm down there.

1231
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,739
Yeah, it's going to be crazy, man.

1232
00:50:55,149 --> 00:50:57,870
-- Well, I hope you stay safe and have fun. I hope
-- I have fun

1233
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:01,030
and, and I guess mostly stay safe. It, it, I don't know.

1234
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,340
It, it'll be fun to talk about that.

1235
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,739
I'm sure I'll have many crazy stories to tell and, and nothing else.

1236
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:06,800
I get to see a total eclipse.

1237
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,260
I've never seen a total eclipse before, so I'm very excited

1238
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:10,090
I've seen.

1239
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:13,919
Well, I was in Germany for the total eclipse but I wasn't in the path of totality.

1240
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:15,090
You weren't in totality.

1241
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:18,209
No, we, well, because, um, we were pretty close,

1242
00:51:18,219 --> 00:51:19,989
I think it was about 90 something percent.

1243
00:51:20,129 --> 00:51:21,689
It was low nineties or whatever.

1244
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:22,250
Um,

1245
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:22,860
and it was

1246
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:25,465
weird, I'm not gonna lie. It was just like, because,

1247
00:51:25,635 --> 00:51:28,024
like, you're not supposed to turn the lights off outside.

1248
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:30,655
Right. Right. That's not how that works.

1249
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:32,824
Like, my brain is like, no,

1250
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:35,715
this isn't really happening and the rest of me is kind of like, yep, it is.

1251
00:51:35,915 --> 00:51:38,864
And the birds just got real wonky and confusing.

1252
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,135
I heard that, that, that birds do crazy things.

1253
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:43,344
-- All the animals apparently do crazy things
-- all of

1254
00:51:43,354 --> 00:51:45,104
a sudden it's nighttime except it's not nighttime.

1255
00:51:45,225 --> 00:51:48,195
And you know, this is actually a really, this is something we should spend some time.

1256
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,635
Maybe we, we have two weeks to do it, we can do some reading. But uh

1257
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,540
this is one of those great examples of just human nature

1258
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:55,419
where as a human,

1259
00:51:55,689 --> 00:51:58,679
I am not programmed to accept the sun disappearing in the middle

1260
00:51:58,689 --> 00:52:01,219
of the day for two minutes and then coming back and,

1261
00:52:01,229 --> 00:52:03,659
and it, it's like fishing is a great, you know,

1262
00:52:03,879 --> 00:52:04,080
never

1263
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:04,330
mind

1264
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:05,560
-- is
-- the um

1265
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:06,979
the tsunami,

1266
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:11,629
the Southeast Asian tsunami where they show the video of the water drawing out to sea

1267
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,139
and how many people know what that meant. Well, now

1268
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:14,909
everybody

1269
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:15,959
knows now.

1270
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:19,979
Yeah, but back in the day, like I quite honestly, if I was you know,

1271
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:23,310
standing next to the ocean and the water started receding suddenly I would be like,

1272
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,389
what the, you know, I wouldn't

1273
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,260
probably followed. It been, like, I wonder where it's going. Right.

1274
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,110
Yeah. So, I mean, you know, that's the thing. Right.

1275
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,570
We're just, yeah, there's, there's these freak events

1276
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,820
but just, yeah, the, the physical world like earthquakes,

1277
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,050
that's just not supposed to happen.

1278
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:39,610
Right.

1279
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:40,409
Right.

1280
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:43,810
Well, but, and here's the thing, right? Is, is some of these events,

1281
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,250
it, it doesn't matter

1282
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:48,979
because as humans, we don't know what to do. It amuses us. Ha ha.

1283
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:51,040
That's like roller coasters, right? Good example.

1284
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,290
But, but there are other things,

1285
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,360
especially around security where obviously the bad

1286
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,370
guys take advantage of human nature.

1287
00:52:57,659 --> 00:52:58,260
And so

1288
00:52:58,899 --> 00:52:59,850
I don't know, it, it,

1289
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:03,570
uh, you gotta love it. You know, it reminds me of it.

1290
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,429
Well, I remember reading a story once that the, the astronauts on the moon,

1291
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:08,290
the,

1292
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,729
the horizon of the moon is obviously much different than the horizon of the earth

1293
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:14,510
and it bothered them

1294
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,550
when they looked at it. Right. Like they, they couldn't explain it

1295
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,149
but they knew it wasn't. Right.

1296
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:20,979
Which is just, yeah.

1297
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:25,600
-- No,
-- I can definitely imagine that because, yeah, like we're just, well, it's like,

1298
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,800
well, it's like being surrounded by air. We're just used to that.

1299
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,689
Well, no, we kind of need that to live. Right? That

1300
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:34,800
it's a different thing I think.

1301
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:35,739
Yeah.

1302
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,860
So, well, when you, when I see those deep sea things and it's just like, uh,

1303
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,020
that doesn't seem right

1304
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:40,979
under all that,

1305
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:44,760
-- those
-- people. Yeah. I've, I've never going to space kind of.

1306
00:53:44,899 --> 00:53:48,239
I'm in the same boat. Like I, I don't, I don't want to do that.

1307
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,780
I don't really like roller coasters. I can't imagine enjoying myself on a rocket.

1308
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:53,669
No.

1309
00:53:54,479 --> 00:53:54,909
Yeah.

1310
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:56,050
Yep.

1311
00:53:56,659 --> 00:53:57,429
So, anyway,

1312
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:57,850
I

1313
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,870
-- think that's it, folks, if we don't hear from Josh in two weeks, I guess it's
-- true.

1314
00:54:02,879 --> 00:54:05,050
This, you might be getting a new partner for the open

1315

source security podcast.

1316
00:54:06,419 --> 00:54:09,530
I, I may be living although, although I must say I'm very upset

1317
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:13,870
we planned our trip to go to Kentucky because we are like, what,

1318
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:16,580
whatever they call it, like the length of totality.

1319
00:54:16,729 --> 00:54:18,479
I'm basically about as,

1320
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,870
as close as you can get because I'll get like two extra

1321
00:54:20,879 --> 00:54:23,389
seconds of totality than the rest of the country or something.

1322
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:24,949
Which right then, why not?

1323
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:26,949
Which I'm sure was also a brilliant decision because

1324
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:28,229
I'm sure no one else thought of that.

1325
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,219
So, anyway,

1326
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,229
so anyway,

1327
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:34,939
I, I was reading and apparently, I think it's in South Carolina.

1328
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:36,060
They have, uh,

1329
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,899
many yeti and giant lizard man sightings and

1330
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:42,340
they expect them to peak during the eclipse.

1331
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:47,090
So I'm like, I could have seen a yeti or a giant lizard man and I, I totally did.

1332
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,540
-- They have both. I
-- know totally

1333
00:54:50,649 --> 00:54:52,209
different, like ecosystems.

1334
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:55,949
I'm not making this up. This is some other quack on the internet.

1335
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,389
And I'm upset that I would have had an opportunity

1336
00:54:58,399 --> 00:55:00,810
to potentially see a yeti or giant lizard man.

1337
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,100
-- Well, you better
-- photograph it.

1338
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:05,010
I mean, because like I'm tired of everybody now carries phones

1339
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,159
and we still don't have good footage of these things.

1340
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,389
Like get your phones out of people and

1341
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,959
for the love of God don't use portrait mode

1342
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:14,489
or I

1343
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:14,709
was

1344
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:15,909
gonna

1345
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,120
say mode. Sorry, that's what I meant to say. Not

1346
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:20,750
uh Yes.

1347
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,469
No, I know what you mean or, or even better

1348
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:23,949
-- use
-- land,

1349
00:55:24,129 --> 00:55:25,520
not portrait. That's what I meant to say.

1350
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,659
It's time to go.

1351
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,169
Landscape is the

1352
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,850
time to

1353
00:55:27,959 --> 00:55:28,219
use that.

1354
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:29,459
-- It's
-- time to go.

1355
00:55:30,169 --> 00:55:34,389
Yeah. Thank. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for putting up with this.

1356
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,909
Like it was fun. No, it was good. It was good. It was fun to talk about the VPN stuff.
