Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself.

1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,060
Kurt Siefried and my partner joining me in

2
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:13,119
four minutes of hate towards selected software.

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,949
Josh Bresser.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,459
-- Wait,
-- we get a four minutes hate. I thought it was, was it two minutes? Hate?

5
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:20,600
-- No, it was four minutes of hate in 19. Was it four minutes?
-- I don't remember

6
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,899
-- too long. I thought it
-- was four minutes. Two minutes of hate? Oh, I stand corrected.

7
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:26,770
-- Ok. It was
-- two minutes. I thought so. All right.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,350
-- So, for anyone who's never read it, go read the book 1984 or
-- watch the movie,

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,369
it is actually pretty.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,099
Yeah, I've never seen the movie.

11
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:36,439
It's depressing. I'm

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:36,939
-- not gonna lie.
-- It

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,529
is

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,950
really quite depressing. I think it's just called, like modern documentaries now.

15
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,060
I think so. It's fine.

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,290
Thanks, man.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,770
-- Yeah. Anyway, what are we hating on? Exactly. I, I thought this was about
-- apps.

18
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:55,729
The Canadian government is hating on wechat and Kaspersky on government devices.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,159
They also banned tiktok, like six months ago or so. I think

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,909
it's, it's in the article, the,

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,839
yeah, the article you sent me

22
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:09,139
from Reuters. It just search for tiktok. It's tumbled down by the bottom.

23
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:11,239
Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot about that.

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,569
Yeah, the Treasury board president, they announced on Monday that,

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,639
that back in February.

26
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,019
Oh, so, uh, to explain

27
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:19,879
in Canada for the federal government, the Treasury board don't ask

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,569
is the one that basically sets it policy

29
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,680
and strategy for the whole federal government.

30
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,629
I'm assuming it's probably because they were like

31
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,550
the first department to have a computer.

32
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,559
-- No. Seriously.
-- Right. Like, straight off

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,120
we probably not.

34
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,360
And then, so they do the policy side and then the um the,

35
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,610
the Canadian signals establishment CS E it's our

36
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,279
version of the NSA with the offensive thing.

37
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:45,050
Not so much the deep. Well, the

38
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,269
sort anyway, basically the NSA light,

39
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,849
they do the offensive side of cybersecurity and

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,000
the treasury board does the defensive side.

41
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:54,680
Ok. So that's why if I'm talking about the Treasury board,

42
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,000
everybody's going to be like, why

43
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:58,300
talking about like the Department of Treasury in Canada, like,

44
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,400
what have they got to do with this?

45
00:01:59,410 --> 00:01:59,510
And

46
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:01,269
they said it policy,

47
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,029
nothing in government makes sense ever. So that's fine.

48
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,610
So, yeah,

49
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,260
so they basically looked at the risks involved with like wechat

50
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:10,389
and tiktok and Kaspersky and banned it on government devices,

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,789
which leads me to think and wonder,

52
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,779
well,

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,149
I mean, if my government is that worried from a national security point of view,

54
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:18,789
like,

55
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,589
shouldn't the rest of us probably not use it?

56
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,759
Ok. I spent

57
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,800
a lot of time thinking about this.

58
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:30,279
And I think here is the answer I will give,

59
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,970
I don't think the Chinese government is using these apps

60
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,050
to directly

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,610
spy on

62
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:38,529
or

63
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,050
we'll say infiltrate organizations because Persky may be different.

64
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,729
Hold on, hold on. I have an answer for that.

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,279
And this is where that fitness tracking app story comes into play, which was back in,

66
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:51,009
what is it 22,007 or something like that?

67
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:52,625
Ok.

68
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:56,145
There was a fitness tracking app that would show all of

69
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,854
the other users of the fitness tracking app on a map

70
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:02,714
and there was a place out in the middle of the desert,

71
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:04,255
-- it would show
-- your running routes and stuff.

72
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,544
Right. Right. Right. Would show where people were running or doing whatever.

73
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:12,044
And there was a location out in the desert in like Iraq or somewhere, one of the

74
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:12,274
Middle

75
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:12,434
East

76
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:13,154
Af

77
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,485
Afghanistan. Ok.

78
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:19,554
That had all these people going around in a circle and it's like, hm,

79
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:20,994
I wonder what that is

80
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,179
and

81
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,410
I think the,

82
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,669
the, the danger posed for governments and to a degree for the citizens.

83
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,710
But I think it's certainly less of a concern,

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
but the danger is the metadata these organizations

85
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:37,020
will collect that will inevitably fall into the hands

86
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,729
of the Chinese government or the Russian government.

87
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:41,220
And let's face it.

88
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,759
They're just the United States and Canada are

89
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,419
not friends with Russia and China right now.

90
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,259
And that's just the truth.

91
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,410
Well, and the other thing that comes to mind is OK.

92
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,539
So Kaspersky is an antivirus company

93
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,309
and I have alternatives.

94
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,979
I have North American alternatives,

95
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,179
wechat.

96
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,710
Yeah, basically I have alternatives. I have a

97
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:01,679
lot of alternatives

98
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:03,460
and then, but Tik Tok,

99
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,210
well tiktok is tiktok like you don't, I mean youtube,

100
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,009
I guess youtube shorts now exist

101
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,729
but it's kind of like Instagram or Facebook and that

102
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:12,970
if I'm

103
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,809
on that platform consuming that media,

104
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,410
I don't really have an alternative.

105
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,410
You don't.

106
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,010
Right. And so I think that kind of makes Tik Tok a little more interesting

107
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:27,260
to me banning Russian antivirus when you have alternatives of North Americans,

108
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,000
who

109
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,299
cares

110
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,100
who in the government needs tiktok to do their job.

111
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,290
Seriously.

112
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:36,019
Social media, peoples

113
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:37,769
managers,

114
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,399
-- the Canadian forces has a tiktok,
-- I'm sure some of them can get

115
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,589
exceptions.

116
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,230
I mean, for, for any government rule, there are ways to get waivers and exceptions,

117
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,350
but

118
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:56,070
-- there are countless people
-- official underscore Canadian underscore army

119
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,829
-- on
-- tiktok and, and I'm fine with that. I, I think

120
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,109
if you are a government organization,

121
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:06,029
you need to go to where the people are and the people are on tiktok.

122
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,299
-- Well, the young people,
-- but at the same time,

123
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:14,279
if I'm a government employee that's doing government work, be it, you know,

124
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,350
dealing with paperwork or whatever it, or, or security or something,

125
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,820
having

126
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,510
these apps on my device

127
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,700
or computer or whatever.

128
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,149
Yeah, that could be a potential problem because of the metadata.

129
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,119
Remember, metadata is my concern here,

130
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,739
not the app like hacking me or doing something like that.

131
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,929
-- So I think it's legit.
-- One thing that blows my mind is I've, I've spoken with and

132
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:39,899
so some people basically

133
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,779
this is a first hand account. Somebody was retiring from the government

134
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,779
and they wanted to keep their government cell phone number.

135
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:47,720
And I was like, what?

136
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,269
And it's because they canceled their personal phone number like 10 years ago.

137
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,690
And I like

138
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:51,690
the government

139
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:52,410
and I was like,

140
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,739
they use their government phone for all their personal stuff and she was like, yeah,

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,839
100%.

142
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:57,690
And I'm like,

143
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't even know where to begin with that.

144
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,369
-- I am not even a little surprised that that would happen. I get
-- it.

145
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,570
Like,

146
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,779
because cell phones in Canada are pretty bloody expensive

147
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,950
and that's like 1000 bucks a year easily saved.

148
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,049
That's

149
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:08,579
the

150
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,399
cost of the phone.

151
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,119
So, like some people, man.

152
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:11,839
Right.

153
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,359
But I'm just like, I would not put my personal life on a government device.

154
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:16,190
Like no, but,

155
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,000
oh, for sure, like, well, I mean,

156
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,579
you hear these instances where people had, like,

157
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,950
they had their family photos on their work computer or

158
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,790
something and then they got laid off or fired or,

159
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,119
or

160
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:26,304
it

161
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:29,024
happens and then they're like, can I get my pictures back? And it's like,

162
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,654
no look, I've been, I've been there, we gave them the pictures back.

163
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,234
But like, at the same time. It's like,

164
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,904
don't ever do this again. Like, you're lucky we're nice

165
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:43,214
because other, it departments would have been like, ha ha

166
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:43,804
ha ha.

167
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:44,984
No.

168
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:46,725
See, my

169
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:51,144
normal experience of a lot of government it is that the stuff is

170
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:54,105
locked down and you have like a catalog of stuff you can get,

171
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,260
you know what I mean?

172
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:57,170
Like here's the list of things you're allowed to

173
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,730
grab or install or these ones cost money.

174
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:01,299
So you have to ask nicely like,

175
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:02,059
right,

176
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:03,260
and you don't just get the,

177
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,149
and I get that it's harder with mobile device because

178
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,339
you have to run the uh what are they called,

179
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,709
MS M or me?

180
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,200
What is the mobile management stuff called again?

181
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,119
MD M

182
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,000
MD M, I was getting there in the end.

183
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,679
Um you know, like it, you know,

184
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,579
you have to be somewhat competent to run all this stuff and have the anyways

185
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,239
and so a lot of places don't do that. And so

186
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,320
you kind of have to work on the honor system of like, please don't install this.

187
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,649
Uh Yeah,

188
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,760
yeah, you do get some of that,

189
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,239
-- you
-- know, to some degree,

190
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,100
but I,

191
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,369
I don't know

192
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,720
but look, ok, I wanna, I wanna clarify something before we get too far down this hole.

193
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,929
Hold on, hold on. So MD M like, I don't like MD M software because I don't like

194
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,679
arbitrary control over even employees hardware. However, I'm going to say

195
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:45,279
that

196
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,709
if an employee opening an

197
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,470
-- application on their computer.
-- Let's go with

198
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,640
device or a device or a device

199
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:57,559
results in your entire company getting hacked. Like you have garbage security.

200
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,829
Because who, who did that just happen to? There was some,

201
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:02,739
I can't,

202
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:05,179
was it was, it, was it Octa that the, the,

203
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,839
supposedly the developer opened Gmail on their work computer?

204
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,040
They, no, they had,

205
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:14,100
they were signed in on their personal account as well on their work computer.

206
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:14,700
Basically.

207
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:18,929
That's right. Which look if that, if that happens to you, your security sucks.

208
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,769
And like,

209
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,399
-- honestly,
-- the thing that always gets me is

210
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,459
what if you have a malicious insider,

211
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:25,859
right? Like

212
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:26,540
you can't

213
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:26,750
defend

214
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,160
it. We didn't, we, we did a photo

215
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,630
-- like a year ago basically
-- all this anti fishing and like, oh blah, blah, blah,

216
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,429
like what if you have even a remotely malicious insider?

217
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:35,989
Like,

218
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:36,919
yeah,

219
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,260
I bet you the fishing training creates more malicious insiders than anything else

220
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,289
related here on

221
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,859
-- fun
-- fact, I was looking at some stats

222
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,729
according to one fishing report, fishing is up over 1200%.

223
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:55,580
So, like that is what a factor of 13 times more fishing

224
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
since the release of chat.

225
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,390
54.

226
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,260
Oh, I totally believe that

227
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:02,919
because now you can make very convincing fishing mails versus the

228
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:06,299
garbage ones we've all been getting for years and years.

229
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:11,359
Yeah. The number of times my ceo has been in a Mexican jail needing uh gift cards is

230
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,419
itunes gift cards to post bail

231
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:15,929
to

232
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,369
pay

233
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:16,830
tax,

234
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,760
which I love revenue. Canada actually issued an official statement saying

235
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,770
we do not take payment from gift cards.

236
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,830
They have to

237
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,760
and also that they will never,

238
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,520
the thing I love about revenue. Canada is they straight up. We will never email you

239
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,590
with one exception of

240
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,099
if you get a message in the system, like if you have an account and you're registered,

241
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,289
they will email you a notification

242
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,989
with no link with no link to click.

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,929
And you should love,

244
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,690
I like that.

245
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,229
They will never phone you.

246
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,700
And that's actually not true. They will once in a while phone you.

247
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,909
But everything is sent via physical mail in these

248
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,390
or gray envelopes.

249
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,549
-- And I love that because
-- the government owns a post office. So,

250
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,809
yeah, I guess they get

251
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:57,989
a, a discount.

252
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,690
I wonder, I bet they don't get a discount.

253
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,809
Well, no, because they, they presort,

254
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,830
-- oh, they might. That's
-- fair.

255
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,609
That's

256
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:06,840
true.

257
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,520
That's probably true. But back to the sea.

258
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:10,979
So the thing I'm thinking is like number one,

259
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,030
if

260
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,580
hypothetically speaking, if the Chinese government were to go full on,

261
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,820
like we're gonna use Tik Tok in a way that everybody will end up hating it.

262
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,619
Like, so we're gonna ship uh an update with a security thing to

263
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,020
maliciously whatever

264
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,880
they would have. They have that capability because

265
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,580
to quote myself when the nice men with guns show up, you do what they

266
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:31,155
routing software,

267
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,335
I can address that as well though.

268
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:38,015
So I would compare it to the malicious packages in N PM, which in fact,

269
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:43,554
I just had a friend asked me about this literally hours before we started recording,

270
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:44,534
basically saying like

271
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:48,229
he sent me a link to it and there were more malicious MBM packages.

272
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,210
I'm like this is, this is normal now

273
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,890
and he's like, I don't get it.

274
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,369
And I said, look, people,

275
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,820
this is people love talking about this stuff because it's kind

276
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,000
of like I compared it to the poison candy problem where

277
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,000
people don't shut up about poison candy.

278
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,969
And Halloween when cars literally kill hundreds of Children,

279
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:07,250
every Halloween and poison candy kills zero kids.

280
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,969
-- Same thing with this stuff. So
-- it's not zero people. Sadly

281
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,520
what? For poison candy?

282
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:13,979
Sadly,

283
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,020
there's, but it's in the single digits.

284
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,179
I didn't realize that was even a thing

285
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:24,260
regardless. Cars are vastly more dangerous than Halloween. Ok.

286
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,179
Now,

287
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:31,179
I think using N PM packages is our example when there is a malicious M PM package,

288
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,299
it generally gets found pretty quickly because there's so many people,

289
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,289
there's people looking

290
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,739
and there's people who are going to be affected and it's detected by their

291
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,789
endpoint detection software or their security software

292
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,229
or they just have a clever developer,

293
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:44,510
whatever.

294
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,679
There's a million things, right?

295
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,830
And so generally speaking,

296
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,419
these malicious packages make it a day or two at the most and then they get found

297
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:51,989
and then they get dealt with.

298
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,159
And I think if tiktok

299
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,429
pushed out a malicious update from the Chinese government,

300
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:58,900
it's

301
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,210
going to be

302
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,320
found literally in minutes, most likely.

303
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:05,080
And then all of the app stores are going to push a button

304
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,960
that says remove tiktok from every single device it's on right now.

305
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,460
And now that now Bytedance is gone as a company.

306
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,739
But the argument would be is if that's something you're using, like

307
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,010
the Chinese government might not care about by dance. Right?

308
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,950
-- That's something to keep in mind. They're not
-- idiots.

309
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,770
I mean, this would be the dumbest thing you could do. Like if you're going to pa

310
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,289
-- you got to go in slow and low. Like, but
-- it's possible

311
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:31,820
and I would point out with Ukraine and Russia. Right. Not Petya.

312
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,059
We've seen it happen where they,

313
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,070
they broke into that accounting company that all the Ukrainian companies use

314
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,719
maliciously back door of the software.

315
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:40,659
And so

316
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,419
the thing to remember too is with like strong authoritarian governments.

317
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,039
They don't have the checks and balances that we have

318
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:47,840
stupid

319
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,539
-- things. But
-- at the same time,

320
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,530
they're not going to go after wechat or tiktok,

321
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,179
they're probably going to break into some

322
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:57,280
non

323
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:59,020
Chinese company

324
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,549
tell them

325
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,650
and that's what's going to get pushed to all the

326
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,669
government devices because they are already on them all.

327
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,340
Like maybe,

328
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:07,890
I don't know, a company called Solar Winds. Maybe,

329
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,849
for example, you know,

330
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:11,000
-- that's the thing.
-- Oh,

331
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:14,659
and I love the solar winds thing where everybody's freaking out about like,

332
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,309
oh the co and everything is being

333
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:18,820
potentially gonna go to jail for this. And it's like,

334
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,409
it's not what they did.

335
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,650
It's they lied about it to investors.

336
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,450
And if you know, if you lie to your investors,

337
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:29,320
the SEC will come down on you like a sack of hammers.

338
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,780
-- It wasn't
-- the investors, they lied to the SEC,

339
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:32,080
right?

340
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,380
Fundamentally to

341
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,280
the sec.

342
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:38,169
Like of all the organizations on the planet, the SEC is literally the like,

343
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:41,320
do not lie to these people more than any other organization.

344
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,239
-- Like for real, I
-- love how every time, you know, don't lie under oath.

345
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,239
What happens is these people made a gamble and said,

346
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,559
I think lying is less dangerous than the alternative

347
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,679
and sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.

348
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,320
And my suspicion is in this case it was not.

349
00:13:59,559 --> 00:13:59,869
Yeah,

350
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:03,299
but back to this. So I think if nothing else, I would ban

351
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:06,719
Kaspersky just because there are better alternatives like

352
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
that are not also from,

353
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,940
you know, a country like Russia.

354
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:13,580
Oh, yeah, for sure, for sure. Which,

355
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,200
yeah.

356
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,570
And, and my, you know, if you look at Kaspersky, it's not the nicest program ever.

357
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,820
I mean, maybe it's better now. I don't know.

358
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,690
But the last time I looked, it's weird that like a lot of people,

359
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,099
like use it.

360
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:23,619
Like I,

361
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,890
it seems like when I run into people randomly

362
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,460
using antivirus quite often they're using Kaspersky and I,

363
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:31,179
maybe it's because they have a free version and a aggressive UPS sale.

364
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,609
I don't know.

365
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,229
But

366
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:32,429
I

367
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,409
kind of like thinking about tiktok.

368
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:37,530
Like, I know some people that I, like, I used to have consume tiktok.

369
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:40,789
There was a couple of uh content creators on tiktok that I found amusing

370
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:42,140
and

371
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,869
much like Twitter, I decided.

372
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,020
No, I'm done with this and it was more about um the time usage than

373
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,669
security concerns. Right.

374
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,190
So, same thing with Twitter, I realized Twitter was just like,

375
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,400
had already turned into a pretty not great place and

376
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:56,039
then Elon Musk acquired it and I was like,

377
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:56,119
well,

378
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,900
this is probably not gonna go well and

379
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,979
-- it did not go well.
-- It did not go well.

380
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,919
-- Yeah,
-- they're worth what they say internally $19 billion from down from 44. So, like

381
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,599
another year and with any luck it's done.

382
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:09,580
I

383
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,010
mean,

384
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,340
it takes a long time for companies to die.

385
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:17,179
I think Twitter will probably outlive both of us. But

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,250
I mean

387
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,669
slash dot is still around and dig is still around, but they're not,

388
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:23,750
it,

389
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,679
it's not at all anything

390
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:29,719
like part of me kind of wants to always allow list and be like, here's like,

391
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:30,599
here's the suit.

392
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:32,440
Well, and we kind of do this at the CS A,

393
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,140
like here's the suite of apps and services and stuff we use and like,

394
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,000
here's the core stuff that

395
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:38,015
everybody gets by default, you know,

396
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:40,854
you all get one password and please please use it, you know,

397
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:45,104
we all go Google Microsoft 365 you know, the, the usual suspects and then

398
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:49,174
ok, if you need Adobe, yeah, we can buy Adobe for you. Like, uh, not

399
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:49,304
a

400
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:50,585
but what else are you gonna do? Right.

401
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:54,085
Like gotta use Adobe if you're like our graphic designer, like,

402
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:56,585
I don't want to use Adobe. I'm like, uh I get that

403
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:57,534
like

404
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,400
we'll pay for it.

405
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,200
Um

406
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,880
And then, but I've, I've not gone so far as to like,

407
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:04,280
well, I guess I've

408
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:07,539
sort of banned in the sense of like we use Defender 365

409
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,039
for antivirus and everything else is you're not supposed to use that,

410
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,450
right? You're supposed to use the, the one that we provide.

411
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,700
So I guess I've implicitly banned some of these.

412
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:20,150
But uh oh, it was when I was looking at the web browser in Google,

413
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,770
you can control what extensions are.

414
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,530
You can either block list or allow list extensions.

415
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,080
And I was like, well, I'm not,

416
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,880
I block listing them because like

417
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,969
that's a waste of my time.

418
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,479
And if I allow listed,

419
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,559
people are going to be constantly yelling at me for more extensions.

420
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,200
And so like,

421
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,840
I think web browsers are a good example of sort

422
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:40,750
of a similar threat profile mobile devices where it's like,

423
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,280
I just want to get like this little bit of useful code that does X

424
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,650
and like how many of these extensions are, like, always, like,

425
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:49,640
it will see your full browsing history and this and that.

426
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,289
-- I'm like,
-- all of them have like full control, web, web,

427
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:57,409
web browser extensions are almost certainly more dangerous than apps on phones.

428
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,270
I guarantee it.

429
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:03,799
And again, though, look, this comes back to that whole,

430
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,410
if your entire organization can be p

431
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:11,329
by someone, a malicious web browser extension,

432
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,319
your security is crap.

433
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:15,449
That's just the way it is.

434
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,239
-- And, and like, I mean, that sounds kind of mean, but it's
-- true.

435
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,729
Well, I mean, it's like saying, you know, like, like banks,

436
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,560
banks have lots of good controls now to prevent them from being ripped off

437
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,640
both by robbers and by internal people because that happened for 200 years.

438
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:29,119
You know,

439
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,520
like I remember the first time I saw the cash

440
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:34,479
machine, counter, vault box thing,

441
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:35,920
you know, where I basically,

442
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,510
I was withdrawing like $100 and normally they would like tap, tap, tap, tap, tap,

443
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:39,810
tap,

444
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,239
open up a little drawer and like,

445
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,920
you know, 2040 6080 whatever, 100 I'd be a bad bank teller, but she instead stood up,

446
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,040
turned, swiped her card on this thing, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap and then it's like,

447
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,170
you know, like little vault size things spat out some money

448
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,510
and I'm like, what the heck is that?

449
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,469
And she's like, oh, we don't have cash stores anymore. It's this thing

450
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,199
-- Oh, interesting. So, it's like an ATM.
-- Basically, it's, it's an internal ATM and

451
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,229
it will not give money unless there's an,

452
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,660
unless there's a transaction associated with it.

453
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:06,930
So, if you

454
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,099
drop

455
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:12,165
the bank, you have to, like, they'd have to do a transaction to withdraw it $20,000.

456
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:16,344
-- Do they have a, a ransom like account? They might, actually,
-- it's a

457
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:20,175
computer. So I'm, you could very easily have a panic button. You know.

458
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:21,435
That's very simple. Right.

459
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:24,145
I'm assuming there's like one of those blue buttons she was clicking on,

460
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:25,814
one of them is probably marked, like, you know,

461
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:27,474
with a little skull and crossbones or whatever.

462
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:31,344
Um, but it, it got me, you know, like, or when you, if you ever done a,

463
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:34,244
a large cash transaction at the bank, right.

464
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:37,954
Oh, I have to go get a sign off or even, oh, when I transfer money between accounts

465
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,479
I have to go get a sign off. It's more than $1000.

466
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:44,650
This is an example of having good internal security controls. Right.

467
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,530
-- That's why can't
-- we do it

468
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:45,829
in Infosec?

469
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,270
We can just a lot of people don't.

470
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:53,000
I mean, so, actually, ok, it's funny you say this now because

471
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:55,040
there is a new fed

472
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,640
ramp

473
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,089
standard

474
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,780
that came out fairly recently and I have spent

475
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,869
a lot of time last week. It's, it's Fed

476
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,069
Ramp Provision Five if you're looking forward to anyone.

477
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,760
And I spent a lot of time this week. Reading

478
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:12,400
fed ramp version five because there's things we need to do internally as a company,

479
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,449
there's things we need to do in the product

480
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,150
to, because while our product isn't fed

481
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,119
Ramp certified we,

482
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,479
it's used for others because we run on prem basically and in other, uh,

483
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:24,560
organizations and whatnot.

484
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:25,189
So anyway,

485
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,640
I've been reading this a ton

486
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,900
and

487
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:31,339
they cover a ton of these kind of controls about, you know,

488
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:33,739
limiting access to single users,

489
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,459
making sure you have to like off up to do activities, making sure.

490
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh, so step up off. Yeah,

491
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,380
like all kinds of stuff like that. Right.

492
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,739
Making sure you don't have people running as admin when they're doing work.

493
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,329
And it's funny because you read this is like,

494
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,010
why do you even write this down?

495
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,410
And I'm like, oh, because lots of people do this, like that's why, well,

496
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,449
like we tried, you know, we

497
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:56,343
tried at various stages in the CS A to do least privilege and I'm like,

498
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:59,662
we're a public facing organization like we can't do that for our docs.

499
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:00,373
Like it would just,

500
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,682
and I think that's part of it is

501
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:04,282
people could implement these controls but it would

502
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,432
slow work down and cause so much overhead.

503
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,542
But here's the thing is the,

504
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:12,442
the cost of that more than the cost of the occasional security incident.

505
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:14,532
And the answer is for most security incidents,

506
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,902
you can just externalize the cost of like, oh, we're so sorry.

507
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,703
We lost your personal data. Here's like a

508
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:23,456
$17 credit for credit monitoring at Expedia or,

509
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:23,796
I mean,

510
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:28,465
that's a typical risk calculation, right? Where

511
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:29,926
when you're doing

512
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:30,965
actual, like,

513
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:32,725
I know a lot of security people use the word

514
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:35,105
risk a lot but they don't actually use it correctly.

515
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:38,115
There's a group called the, it's called the Fair Institute.

516
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,046
I think I'll put a link in the

517
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:39,215
show

518
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,336
but the Fair Institute has done a very nice job of

519
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:45,576
basically saying like here is how you quantify risk properly.

520
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:46,005
We're like,

521
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,319
and, and they use like these are lawyers doing this stuff, right?

522
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,260
These are like these people know what's up

523
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,390
and it's saying things like this is how much an

524
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,660
yeah, they they literally have

525
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,160
data,

526
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,770
-- they
-- have the receipts.

527
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,619
I remember the first time I looked at them like, oh

528
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,359
actuarial got

529
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,540
it. This is true data nerds.

530
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:04,170
But they're saying things like this,

531
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,895
this is how much an incident could cost.

532
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:09,324
This is how much you're going to spend to try to prevent this incident.

533
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:10,685
And there's like this calculation,

534
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,604
you used to basically say like spending a

535
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:15,805
million dollars to prevent $10,000 worth of damage.

536
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:20,244
That doesn't make sense, spending $5000 to prevent $10,000 worth of damage,

537
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:22,204
totally worth a good investment, right?

538
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,000
And this is an organization that it helps you do this kind of stuff

539
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,099
and I think that's part of it, right?

540
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:29,680
But however,

541
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,609
when you're dealing with something like fed ramp because

542
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,359
this is a federal government and they're going to,

543
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:35,079
like, they're going to tell you what to do.

544
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,239
There's no risk calculations like you do it their way or you don't do it.

545
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,560
That's just the way it is.

546
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:43,280
And the beauty is the federal government is one of the few, like,

547
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,829
and generally most federal governments, not just the US,

548
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,839
one are one of the few players that has enough buying power

549
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,430
and

550
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:54,000
it's not like they externalize this cost and it just goes away.

551
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,319
It's, they externalize this cost and then they pay for it.

552
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:58,640
Oh, yeah, they, they pay extra, they know they pay extra.

553
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,550
I mean, nearly every company on the planet has two price sheets.

554
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,189
-- They have a
-- government sales department,

555
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,040
one price sheet for everyone else and another price sheet for the government.

556
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,969
And,

557
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:09,670
yeah. Right.

558
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,420
And the government knows this.

559
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,430
But they also, they're like,

560
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:14,780
we're going to make ridiculous demands and we're

561
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,589
going to pay extra for our ridiculous demands.

562
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:16,819
It's like

563
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,930
we're all happy here.

564
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:18,890
It's funny because I was just,

565
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,910
I was just actually writing about A I safety and so

566
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,829
this term A I safety is being used a lot.

567
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,180
And it's interesting that everybody's using it, including us at the CS A and

568
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,449
there's, as I see it three levels,

569
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,989
there's the national security level where like they don't want the

570
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,069
A is to help people do bioterrorism or nuclear terrorism.

571
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,030
Or stuff, which is a legitimate concern.

572
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,640
I mean, that's fair.

573
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,469
That's fair.

574
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:41,920
So, anyway, so we'll have the national security side

575
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,219
kind of doing what they do

576
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:46,500
the next level then would be the criminal side, right. Obviously.

577
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:49,560
And like a lot of things, it's not so much that you have a tool.

578
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,359
It's when you use the tool illegally.

579
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,520
So, for example, Home Depot sells burglary tools,

580
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,280
also known as crowbars and hammers

581
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:56,119
And

582
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,680
I own a very complete set of these,

583
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:02,160
but I'm not wandering around at three in the morning with them and a black mask on.

584
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:04,400
So I'm fine. Right. No, seriously. Right.

585
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,270
Yes, there is.

586
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,140
And then the third level though is the business side where

587
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,530
it comes down to business risk because you can as a

588
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,449
business have an A I that is totally national security safe,

589
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,579
totally criminal

590
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:16,430
safe.

591
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:19,229
And you use the A I and you do something stupid with it,

592
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:21,189
like not checking the output and it hallucinates some

593
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,439
random garbage code that causes you a problem.

594
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,430
And so

595
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,989
that's kind of where the CS A fits in those. But thinking to this as this,

596
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:33,790
back to this, the Canadian government banning the software. Now it Twix my mind that

597
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,880
like, they have a different threat profile than we do. But more importantly, I think

598
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,180
they have a different,

599
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,579
I don't know what to call it. Like, not a use profile but a different,

600
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,430
like they have a different set of finances and a

601
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,130
different set of what they can and cannot externalize.

602
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,359
And to some degree, the Canadian government cannot externalize like,

603
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:53,750
like a private company can externalize stuff if the waste ends up three blocks over,

604
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,619
not their problem

605
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,760
from the Canadian government's point of view though,

606
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,920
that waste is still in Canada and we still have to pay for health care to deal with the

607
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,430
whatever problems it causes or whatever. Right.

608
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:04,810
And so the Canadian government can't

609
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:10,900
externalize stuff that a provincial or a local municipal or a company could.

610
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:13,969
And maybe that's part of what's happening here. Why

611
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:16,439
they always do things that don't make sense to us

612
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:19,060
is because they can't externalize things that we can.

613
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,569
I mean, that's probably fair.

614
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:21,930
Like lead gasoline,

615
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,089
right? Like lead gasoline is a perfect example.

616
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,949
Carmakers loved it because it reduced engine

617
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:29,489
knock and increased the engine lifespan.

618
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,369
But we ended up with a generation of criminals. Right.

619
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,150
That, that whole lead poisoning problem.

620
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:36,819
Yeah.

621
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:37,349
Yeah.

622
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,270
Yeah. I mean, I don't know anyway.

623
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,630
And I guess that, that additionally comes back to the whole,

624
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,140
ironically you brought us back to the topic and I guess accidentally,

625
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,790
like,

626
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,489
this is the government banning these apps

627
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:51,619
and they get.

628
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,000
Right. That's right. That's right. Not for citizens, for themselves.

629
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,380
And that's like,

630
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,209
they, they can't externalize, they,

631
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,930
they're unwilling to and can't externalize the risk.

632
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:03,489
And so they're like, we just don't want to

633
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,400
deal with it and we're going to say you can't do it. And that's the way it is because

634
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:09,079
we said so. That's it.

635
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,390
-- That's funny. Well done. Coming back around.
-- It's always about the money.

636
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,219
-- I
-- mean, is it about money though?

637
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:19,010
-- These are free apps,
-- money as a measure of externalized,

638
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,459
internalized risk and cost?

639
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,060
Right? Because a lot of risk,

640
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,189
like I hate to say, but we even like there is the, the US government has that number.

641
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,449
Here's what a human life is worth.

642
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,229
Like, I remember my favorite thing when I went to work for the government,

643
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,189
uh provincial government, you know, have to sign a whole bunch of paperwork.

644
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,430
And one of them was like on the,

645
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:40,410
like you get kind of on the job insurance against injury.

646
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,189
Ok?

647
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,280
And I'm like, kind of laughing. I'm like, what?

648
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,349
Like, you know, I felt like a filing cabinet falls on me.

649
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:49,319
She's like, no, somebody cut all their toes off once. And I'm like, what?

650
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:50,609
Ok.

651
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:54,530
So this is when, you know, all, every time you're repairing a lawnmower,

652
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,449
you're supposed to like unhook the spark plug or unhook the

653
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:59,040
batteries or like disconnect stuff so it can't turn on.

654
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:00,010
Yeah, this guy didn't.

655
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:02,849
-- So he lost all his toes
-- and he was a government.

656
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:06,589
Well, back, this is a long time ago when like, landscaping

657
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,619
for the government was actually done by the government. Oh, fun fact

658
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:14,189
I had to learn about hedges and the Ontario government has

659
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:19,030
the most amazing 60 page manual on hedge landscaping and care.

660
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,459
One thing I learned is all my hedges were the wrong shape to handle snow load.

661
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:24,260
No, seriously, like in Canada, snow load

662
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,709
stuff is a concern, I guess.

663
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:30,660
Anyway, so the Ontario government has this lovely publication for like 1960.

664
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,010
Something about hedges.

665
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:32,439
Super.

666
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,780
But so anyways, but back to this, like,

667
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,930
Nist has peanut butter.

668
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:42,219
-- Yeah, it's like 1400 bucks a jar,
-- $1000 a pound. Yeah.

669
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:43,770
My favorite thing about Nist is,

670
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,430
you know what they use for their reference root beer.

671
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:47,150
I don't actually,

672
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,449
I can respect that. A, I love a and wr

673
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,079
here, like,

674
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:55,469
-- and, and in my mind I'm like, well, what else would it be?
-- I, I'm ok with that.

675
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:58,739
-- There's an A W down the street from my house. They're in
-- America.

676
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:01,130
-- I did not know that.
-- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

677
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,189
They've been here forever as long as I can remember.

678
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,430
And there's one down the street from my house and I,

679
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:08,739
every time someone like my wife or kids will be like, oh,

680
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,359
we should go get a and w I'm like,

681
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:13,650
we have to go in because you get the frosted mug and then you

682
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,959
get the root beer you put in the frosted mug and it's just like,

683
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:16,839
it's unbeatable.

684
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:18,839
One thing I'm sad now is their floats use that like,

685
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,839
frozen puck of ice cream instead of a scoop.

686
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:22,525
I

687
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:23,765
got

688
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,224
a, I don't like, I don't like ice

689
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:26,204
-- cream
-- floats. They used to be

690
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:26,454
now

691
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:28,805
-- anyways,
-- I don't think they've ever been good.

692
00:27:29,045 --> 00:27:33,395
-- But
-- I thinking of this, here's a question I have for our viewership. Hands

693
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:33,805
up.

694
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:38,435
They're listeners. Kurt, we don't have viewers because we both have faces or radio.

695
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:38,614
Yeah.

696
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:39,494
Yeah, we do.

697
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:41,224
Um, so anyways hands up

698
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:47,915
who here has actually done any sort of financial calculation around the cost

699
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,800
of security incidents and controls.

700
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,939
-- And I'm guessing, like, I know I've, I've never done it. No,
-- it's not a fair question.

701
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:57,290
And you're not going to because you don't work for a company that can do it.

702
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,359
So the reality is if you're doing that sort of calculation,

703
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,880
you probably have 30 or more people on

704
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,020
your security team is my guess from my experience

705
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:11,390
that level of security kicks in and somewhere around 30 to 50 people on

706
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,119
a security team because the reality is it's expensive and it's hard to do

707
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,319
and you need people whose only job is like collecting evidence

708
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:23,680
and collecting data and monitoring the data and logging the data.

709
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:27,750
And so a small organization isn't doing calculations like that.

710
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,520
It's, there was uh you know what this reminds me of,

711
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,560
there was a blog post from a long time ago

712
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:35,560
from like some start up where basically the start up was

713
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,089
some big company was saying, oh, we have this contract for you to sign and

714
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,089
they asked their dad like, what his dad was a lawyer or something.

715
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,859
They're like, what do we do? He's like, you sign it. Who cares what it says?

716
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:45,709
He's like what he's like.

717
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,959
Look, if you get, if you, if you get big enough that this matters,

718
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:50,099
we'll deal with it then.

719
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:53,410
But the reality is your company is probably gonna go under in the next year anyway.

720
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,849
So just sign the contract.

721
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:55,810
This is what gets me like,

722
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,760
like people are pooping on cloud floor right

723
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,310
now for having an outage and they're like,

724
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,079
oh the cloud flare, prioritized development of features over safety.

725
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:03,530
And it's like,

726
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:04,739
yeah,

727
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,390
like

728
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,030
that, that's why they're a successful company like

729
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:11,410
does that they added features that made people buy it?

730
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,020
I mean, this is why security, no one likes security.

731
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,180
It's like

732
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,069
you can listen to me or you could sell more product

733
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,829
because you have the features customers needed like pick one,

734
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,569
it's up to you.

735
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:23,089
So anyway,

736
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,310
so that, that is why your question I think is invalid and I don't think it's fair. Ok.

737
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:30,719
Well, let me rephrase it. How many people have ever even thought of

738
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,849
the cost? And the ro I and is it

739
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,650
worth it?

740
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,819
Not just in sense of security R I but will

741
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:38,699
this because there's been some people that like for example,

742
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,449
fishing training was suggested and I was like, no,

743
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:42,170
we're not doing fishing training because

744
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,770
a bunch of people fail it and

745
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,420
it not only will there be no Roy, security wise,

746
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,599
it'll just waste people's time and, and annoy them.

747
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:52,270
What's, what's the action that comes out of fishing training?

748
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,640
-- Yeah. Right.
-- Like

749
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,760
nothing.

750
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,160
I mean, if you're a regulated company and you're really big

751
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:02,969
you can use fishing training to justify spend or, or something like that.

752
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:05,199
But even then I still hate fishing training because I think it's,

753
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:07,160
it's deceitful and immoral.

754
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,640
-- And
-- my favorite thing is when people get the fishing training

755
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:14,956
and delete it or ignore it or report it and are like or filter it.

756
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:15,475
Like one guy,

757
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:17,355
there was that one story where the one guy just filtered

758
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:19,015
it for like the whole company because he was an admin,

759
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:19,176
right?

760
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,875
And he's like, is this not my job?

761
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,225
And he got in trouble for that because we're trying to do fishing training?

762
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:23,796
He's like, but

763
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:25,536
am I not supposed to block this?

764
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:29,265
I feel like that's a perfect example of fishing training. Gone well,

765
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:29,735
yeah,

766
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:31,595
like I, I just as a side note,

767
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:34,515
I actually a few weeks ago blocked a couple of swear words,

768
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:39,232
our email because I realize we'll never get a legit email with certain swear words.

769
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:42,482
And some can you send the naughty words or is it only if I send

770
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:42,911
word

771
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:43,822
only

772
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:48,072
incoming? So you can reply to me using inappropriate language? But I can't

773
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:49,791
maybe appropriate depending on what you did.

774
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:54,682
But anyways because somebody was being abusive to our support staff and I'm like,

775
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:55,991
I'm done

776
00:30:56,362 --> 00:31:00,261
and it's, it's, and it's funny because the, the, you will get a message saying like

777
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,109
that language is inappropriate. Please be polite.

778
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:03,569
I like

779
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:03,890
that.

780
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:05,180
I think

781
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,479
my take was,

782
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,630
I think people should maybe take cues from what the government bans or doesn't ban,

783
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,270
kind of like California as a state banning all sorts of cancer.

784
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,030
Chemicals

785
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,280
-- might not be the worst thing.
-- Now, every single item in the world carries A

786
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:22,130
-- I this
-- the C 95 or whatever label

787
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,790
this has

788
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,140
been found to cause cancer in California or whatever,

789
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,780
or the best one is where people started

790
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,780
intentionally adding a little bit of sesame or

791
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,819
peanut or whatever to the product so that they didn't have to worry like they can say

792
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,319
we don't care about cross contamination.

793
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:37,459
It is contaminated so you can't eat it anymore.

794
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,300
Sorry.

795
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:39,170
Um

796
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:41,219
I think we should take their cues from them.

797
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:43,250
But I think now that I say this out loud like

798
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,770
that what they can and cannot externalize versus what we can and cannot externalize

799
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,170
and not to say ethically or morally what we should or should not externalize.

800
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,609
So I'm, I'm not even touching that

801
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:53,260
because, you know,

802
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,099
some people say ethically you should not externalize the cost of that software.

803
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:56,859
And I'm like, well,

804
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:57,550
I

805
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,900
would love to live in that world.

806
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:02,979
-- Where, where are you getting this software from?
-- Exactly.

807
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:05,069
And actually this is another show we need to do but the, um, the,

808
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:09,290
the whole FDA software thing and life reliance software that

809
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,160
they're saying people are starting to realize

810
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,709
it might need to be open source so

811
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:15,339
that people can't like repossess your kidney monitor or

812
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,540
your kidney monitors and just stop working in two

813
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,979
years when the company decides to stop supporting it

814
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:20,739
a

815
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
different one. But,

816
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,819
and that's, I think that's

817
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,859
so it's looking at what the government does

818
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:30,010
and trying to look at it through the lens of the government, not your lens

819
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,239
-- and it'll make a bit more sense.
-- Look, this is just part of the government's job, man.

820
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,109
Like the government says, don't put these chemicals in your stuff,

821
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,790
right? They, they, they can say like we think this software is dangerous.

822
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,810
We think this is the way you should deploy applications. This is, you know,

823
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,599
part of their job is having

824
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,489
people doing the boring actuarial work. No one else wants to do.

825
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,790
And then using the data they found to tell people like

826
00:32:57,979 --> 00:33:00,760
this is a good idea to do it this way.

827
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,069
I remember the day I walked into King tire trying to buy a water bottle

828
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,449
and they were all gone

829
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,180
and that was the week they banned the BP A plastic,

830
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,180
right?

831
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:10,699
And I

832
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,180
was like,

833
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:15,500
because the lady was like all the water bottles are gone. I'm like, what?

834
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,319
-- Like all of them hockey,
-- everything.

835
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,790
Yeah, they were full of terrible chemicals for you

836
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,520
anyway. So, yeah. That was a fun lesson to learn.

837
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,479
-- So
-- anyway, all right, I'm gonna call this one. I think we're dragging it on.

838
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,839
But all in all

839
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,670
I feel like what did we come to a conclusion of like

840
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,449
-- good job government, bad job government? I don't know.
-- You know what?

841
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,010
I think a broader lesson would be,

842
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:37,969
pay attention to what other people do when they ban things,

843
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:40,099
but look at it through their lens because

844
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:40,849
it might,

845
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,140
it may or may not make sense for you to also then ban it or to block it or whatever.

846
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,160
For example,

847
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,310
don't ban books.

848
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:49,949
-- I
-- don't ban books,

849
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,689
look at it through the lens and be like, oh, they're fascists.

850
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,150
I am not a fascist. Therefore, I'm not going to ban it.

851
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,560
OK. That's true. Sometimes people are an anti

852
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,160
example. I actually had this conversation

853
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:01,724
with my Children the other day.

854
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:03,785
There are people we will experience in life who are

855
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:06,005
role models and there are people we experience in life

856
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:11,165
who are anti role models who like their job is to give you the example of what not to do

857
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,875
anyway. All right, I'm ending this show.

858
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,793

-- Kurt. Have a marvelous rest of your day. You too,
-- I guess.

862
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:25,333
Don't try to be the anti example of today's lesson.

863
00:34:25,574 --> 00:34:28,375
I mean, I don't, does anyone try to be the anti example,

Sam

Beman Fried.

866
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,120
Did he try?

867
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:37,580
He testified at his own trial? Which everybody agreed was a bad idea.

868
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,320
He is the anti example. But did he try to be an anti example or is he just a moron?

869
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:43,780
I think he's just a moron.

870
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,100
What does it,

871
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,159
what does it never attribute to malice or can be explained with stupidity?

872
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:48,850
I

873
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,469
think in

874
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:51,820
this case he doesn't sound like a nice person.

875
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,188
Thank you, everyone. Bye bye.
