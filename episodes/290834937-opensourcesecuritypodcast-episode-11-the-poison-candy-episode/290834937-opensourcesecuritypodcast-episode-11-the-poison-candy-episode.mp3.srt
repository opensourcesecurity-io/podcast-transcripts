Welcome to the special Halloween episode of

1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,229
the Open source Security podcast this week,

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:11,079
Kurt couldn't join us.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,180
So I have a special guest star, a fellow named Dave Serene. Say hello, Dave.

4
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,360
-- Hey, guys, how are we
-- doing?

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,670
-- Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, Dave? Yeah,
-- sure.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,489
Uh So, uh I'm a fellow Red Hatter here.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,229
Uh Working with Josh, I'm a, actually a technical account manager.

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,590
Uh I work on the public sector team

9
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:32,799
and uh managed to uh luckily enough or unluckily enough.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,159
Uh put all my eggs in the basket of uh security, product, security platform,

11
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:37,840
security,

12
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,189
you know, specialize in identity, uh crypto.

13
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:46,959
And I also like to bake and play rugby and uh do various other uh extracurriculars.

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,000
You bake. That's fascinating. What do you bake

15
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,750
uh everything. Um and uh ask around.

16
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,590
Apparently I am well known uh for my chocolate chip cookies.

17
00:00:56,919 --> 00:01:00,869
-- Um
-- I, I am hurt then. I have never had your chocolate chip cookies, Dave.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,810
Uh Well, I'll be doing some,

19
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,330
I'll be doing some holiday baking coming up after Thanksgiving.

20
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:10,449
Uh So give me, give me, give me, give me your address and I'll send you,

21
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:11,239
I'll send you a box.

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,980
I'll send you a box.

23
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,489
I

24
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,230
hereby declare this the holiday baking episode

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,800
of the

26
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,150
Security podcast.

27
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,580
It's no longer the Halloween episode. It's the,

28
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:25,010
speaking of that, it is Halloween today, which for us is today for other people.

29
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,970
It might be tomorrow or another day. Well, yesterday, whatever time is hard.

30
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,849
So,

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,650
so I thought, why, why don't we talk about that? Right. Halloween is a

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,000
crazy time.

33
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,660
This is one of the few times that it's ok to dress up in a costume, roam the streets

34
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,690
and demand people give you things when you knock on their door.

35
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,400
Actually, you know, we should, we. Ok.

36
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,839
So it,

37
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:50,260
it is quite conceivable that we have listeners who have no idea what we just said.

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,870
So let's have, why don't you

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,389
explain the concept of Halloween in the United States for those who

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,839
are going to think it's the most ridiculous thing they've ever heard.

41
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:00,680
So,

42
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,279
the concept of Halloween in the United States is

43
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,800
probably the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard.

44
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,739
I could delve into the history of it.

45
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,800
Uh But suffice it to say it's when kids and those who are kids at heart

46
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,399
will uh dress up in outlandish costumes and

47
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:21,600
go from door to door in their neighborhoods or to their friends and

48
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:27,559
you know, request or demand, uh uh treats, uh they go a trick or treating.

49
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,529
Um, and uh you are obliged often to be standing at your door with a bowl full of candy,

50
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:34,229
uh, to,

51
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,190
-- to, uh, dole that out,
-- which I will be doing this evening. How about you?

52
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,940
Do you, do you walk around or do you, do you hand out the candy?

53
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,149
So, I, I will,

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,309
I would love to hand out the candy because I don't like being that

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,309
guy who puts the bowl of candy on the front porch saying take one.

56
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,149
and

57
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:50,419
the

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,130
-- first kid who shows up takes the whole bowl.
-- That's exactly right. Right. Right.

59
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,490
So, uh, I, I should put a camera there saying you are being monitored, right.

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,940
This is to keep people honest.

61
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:04,179
Um, no, but, uh, I, I love handy candy.

62
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,240
-- I always buy way too much and the kids
-- call me,

63
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,649
you're gonna put a camera that says you're being monitored,

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,210
but they're all wearing costumes. So you don't know who they are.

65
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,100
What's the point?

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,250
Yeah. But, you know, it's, it's, it's the, it's, it's that fear, right?

67
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,610
You know, I mean, how many kids do you think will say?

68
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:25,419
Oh, well, he can't see my face or he doesn't know who I am. How is he gonna know? Right.

69
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:28,009
They're gonna be, oh, I'm on camera. It's, it's, uh,

70
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,339
it's that, uh, it's that magic button. Philosophy, right?

71
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,660
You know, we're in the elevator, you push the closed door button,

72
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:34,940
it actually doesn't do anything.

73
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,979
-- It just gives you the feeling that it's doing something.
-- Right?

74
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,100
Which this leads beautifully into,

75
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,169
I think the most important Halloween topic we could discuss,

76
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,869
which is real versus perceived risk.

77
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,070
Now, when I don't know how, if this is true, where, where, where you grew up.

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,750
But when I was a kid, there were all these stories all the time about, oh,

79
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,889
you gotta check your candy.

80
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:58,190
There's razor blades in it and there's poison in it and there's, you know,

81
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,229
rusty nails and whatever.

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,630
And in reality, if you look at history

83
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,949
that has never happened.

84
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,970
And I don't hear of this as often today, but it's still,

85
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,339
it's one of those things that people are afraid

86
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:17,000
that they're gonna get bad candy from somebody. When in reality,

87
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,630
you have a far greater chance of either choking to death on one

88
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,899
of the pieces of candy or dying of obesity from eating it all.

89
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,579
That's exactly right. Right.

90
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,019
Uh, you know, so where I grew up,

91
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:32,940
I grew up in very rural Northeastern Connecticut and, uh,

92
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:33,500
uh, the

93
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:37,154
people to whom I went trick or treating were family. Right.

94
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:39,984
And, and it was usually a 15 minute ride to get there.

95
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:43,545
So I didn't have to worry about the, you know, razor blades and candy,

96
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:45,565
but you definitely heard a lot about it.

97
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:46,815
Right. You know, and it,

98
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:50,154
it's one of those things that, on the news every year that the story is,

99
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,614
check the candy, check the candy, but there's no substantive, as you said,

100
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,464
no substantive,

101
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:58,545
uh, uh, research on and no substantive evidence on

102
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:02,575
-- it being an actual problem. And
-- it's even crazier than that. I remember

103
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,709
this was, I was, I was old enough.

104
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,250
I wasn't going around the houses because obviously once you reach a certain age,

105
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,989
it's just uncool to go get free candy.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,179
But then you, then you reach another age, we're like free candy.

107
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,250
Like, that's awesome. Right.

108
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,670
Fortunately it's frowned upon now when you're an adult and,

109
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,589
and you show up at the door.

110
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,200
But anyway,

111
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:20,839
I remember when I was older, like,

112
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,510
there were, there were a doctor's office and dentists who would advertise,

113
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,630
they would x ray your candy for free

114
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,429
after Halloween. And in hindsight, I'm like, that's the most ridiculous, I wonder

115
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,679
just irradiating the candy

116
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,850
that probably makes it more dangerous.

117
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,440
That's, that's good marketing. That's what that,

118
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,299
that's good marketing for the dentist in the doctor's office. Right.

119
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,209
We're gonna get you in and then we're gonna try and sell you.

120
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,970
Right.

121
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,359
Hey, kid, it'd be a shame if something happened to those nice teeth.

122
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:47,600
Right.

123
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,239
Exactly. Exactly.

124
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,799
So, so I guess

125
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,440
insecurity,

126
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:54,440
yeah, we'll,

127
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,320
we'll keep on this topic is there's always this real versus perceived risk.

128
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,980
Like my favorite thing is,

129
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,359
is passwords

130
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:04,239
where you got to have this ridiculous password that

131
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,450
you can't remember and then use it in everywhere.

132
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,549
Right. And that, that's kind of like

133
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:10,839
there's always that perception gap, I think between real security

134
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:11,589
and

135
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:12,160
I

136
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,970
guess schneer

137
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,029
calls it security theater, you know, whatever you want to call it. But it's,

138
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,570
it drives me crazy and it makes me wonder if we can't fix this with candy

139
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,970
on Halloween.

140
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,730
Is there any hope

141
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,720
that, that we're ever going to get, get, get in front of this, in,

142
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,660
in the technical world?

143
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,309
Likely? No.

144
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,929
-- Um, but you know, me, I dave,
-- you're up

145
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:35,070
to,

146
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:39,480
I gave this one to you, like I handed it to you on a plate,

147
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,640
making me feel good about myself.

148
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,190
-- Yeah.
-- So let me, let me go ahead and let me be my, my perpetual hopeless optimist.

149
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:47,774
Right.

150
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,855
And I'd say I'd say yes,

151
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:54,054
because one would imagine that in the security world we're all adults here, right.

152
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:54,584
You know,

153
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:58,005
and we should all be, have critical thought. Right?

154
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:01,695
Um, when you're talking about candy and kids and parents, there's the,

155
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:05,114
there's the natural instinct to be overprotective and

156
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,184
over cautious and this plays into that,

157
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:09,214
over cautious and over protectiveness, right?

158
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,239
Um,

159
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:11,049
but

160
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,149
as, as freethinking, free willed adults, I'd say

161
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,739
there should be, there should be a possibility here to

162
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,070
get around some of that security theater.

163
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,279
You know, it's funny you mentioned passwords, right.

164
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,700
You know, I just, uh, I just had to, uh, uh,

165
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,320
reset a password this weekend on one of my accounts and

166
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,954
the, the password requirements where, you know, your,

167
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:35,915
your password needs to be 6 to 10 characters long and it needs to be,

168
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:39,195
you know, characters uppercase, lowercase in numbers. It's like

169
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:41,644
-- you are drastically limiting
-- by,

170
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:46,195
that's gonna take in upwards of 25 seconds to crack, I imagine,

171
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:48,154
I say. Right. Right.

172
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:50,994
I, I like, I like you're, you're killing me smalls, you're killing me.

173
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,125
Uh, you know, so, um,

174
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,674
uh, I think, I, I think that

175
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:00,290
it, it, it, there, there's an interesting middle ground here to be had, right?

176
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:00,820
Because, you know,

177
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:03,750
6 to 10 characters you're making it easier for people to remember,

178
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,429
but you're also limiting that uh, footprint of the password, right?

179
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,089
Uh You know, XK CD did a great comic, you know, and I've seen,

180
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,320
I've seen debates about it, you know, one way or the other where, you know,

181
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,899
it lays out how long it would take to crack, you know,

182
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,670
certain types of passwords and password complexity.

183
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:19,950
But,

184
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,309
you know, you string together five words that mean nothing together, right?

185
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,559
Um But put spaces,

186
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,099
it's infinitely more, uh uh memorable, but infinitely more difficult to crack.

187
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,640
So this would be the time. Do you know, have you heard of Dice Wire?

188
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,890
Are you familiar with it?

189
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,700
Uh Dice?

190
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,510
No, I'm not.

191
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,049
So, the XK CD, correct?

192
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:45,390
Horse Battery Staple comic, which I still wonder how many people use that password.

193
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,989
I bet, I bet the number is horrifying.

194
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:50,239
-- But anyway, I'll bet
-- you it's any Rainbow Table you find out there,

195
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:50,460
right?

196
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,200
Without

197
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:52,140
a doubt.

198
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:55,070
So I'll, I'll put this in the show notes, but

199
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:58,669
there is this, this thing called dice wear. And the idea is,

200
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,150
you know, human is gonna remember

201
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,669
crazy passwords, right?

202
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,820
Like a good properly secured password is, is unmemorable by a human being.

203
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,700
But as you said, a string of words is easy to remember.

204
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,150
And so what dice where essentially is is you're supposed to like, you use real dice,

205
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,030
you roll them

206
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,280
and you write down your rules and there's,

207
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:20,929
they've got like the rules to find how you should roll them, what you should do in,

208
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,580
in all this

209
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:26,059
and then they have like a catalog of words and you look up

210
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:29,130
the words that correspond to what you rolled

211
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,729
and then you write them down.

212
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:33,650
And so you aren't because here's the deal as a human being,

213
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,719
your string of five nonsensical words is probably not very nonsensical.

214
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:40,630
And I suspect even a bad a, I could predict

215
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:44,010
what your password is if you know the first one or two words.

216
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,309
Whereas with dice where you're obviously you have a certain

217
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,559
amount of guaranteed randomness and the guys who did this,

218
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,510
like, they go into

219
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:51,150
the bits of randomness and,

220
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,789
and what this all means and how hard it would be to crack and all this stuff.

221
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,669
But I mean, fundamentally speaking, they've done a wonderful job and if you have,

222
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,559
I think like a six character password,

223
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,169
they figure at this point would take thousands of years to crack.

224
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,309
It's a really cool system that they put together.

225
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:06,520
Interesting.

226
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,260
Definitely check it out, man. It's super cool.

227
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,950
I, I, I'm gonna let my nerd, I'm gonna let my nerd show here a little bit.

228
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,500
That, that reminds me back in the days of playing Dungeons and Dragons where, uh,

229
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,340
uh, the,

230
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,940
the player's handbook had a name generator where you would

231
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,419
roll dice and you would find the number in this table

232
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,020
-- and, and you've got your name. Yeah. exactly.
-- Exactly.

233
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,169
I mean, I still have all my dice. My kids think it's awesome.

234
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,400
I have this enormous bag of dice because, because I,

235
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:34,909
I used to do dungeon masters stuff in, in college

236
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:35,659
and

237
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,869
I like a bunch of the guys I played with

238
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,229
that either didn't have dice or they'd always forget them.

239
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:44,830
And so I just one day went and I bought like 30 sets of dragon dice at the,

240
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,719
at the comic shop.

241
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,010
And, yeah,

242
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,650
the bag is enormous now and my kids think it is the coolest thing they've ever seen.

243
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:55,169
-- I'm like, you guys have no idea how dorky this makes your dad just,
-- just don't,

244
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:57,169
just don't let them get their hands on the D four.

245
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:57,340
Right?

246
00:10:57,349 --> 00:11:00,580
-- If you think stepping out of Lego is bad, stepping out of D four
-- is, uh,

247
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,929
I've never done that.

248
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,960
I've, I've always taken very,

249
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:07,010
I've been very careful about not losing my dice and in fact,

250
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,359
I do love the D four somehow.

251
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:11,739
I don't know how this happened. I have ad four that glows in the dark.

252
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:12,869
That's,

253
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,780
it's awesome. I'm not gonna lie. I love that thing.

254
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,909
It is my, it is one of my most prized possessions.

255
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:20,010
Excellent.

256
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:20,390
Excellent.

257
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,919
Oh, man. Ok. So, so speaking of prize possessions, let's talk about our

258
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,780
uh golden calf for the last

259
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,200
two weeks.

260
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,429
Yes.

261
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,119
What, what, what has been eating up a lot of our time?

262
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,159
And that would be Dave,

263
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,900
that would be dirty cow,

264
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:40,159
dirty cow.

265
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:43,059
So, in fact, Kurt and I talked about this in the last episode,

266
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,780
uh kind of gave a rundown of the technical bits and, and what not, but

267
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,020
I guess it's, it's a gift that keeps on giving. Let's what's going on now.

268
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,609
-- Yeah.
-- So, um you know, we've put out a, a uh

269
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:59,840
uh publicly facing article uh uh outlining the,

270
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,150
the vulnerability talking about how to

271
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,789
fix the, fix the issue.

272
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,429
You know, patches have been uh shipped for rail seven,

273
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,789
rail six and I believe rail five at this point.

274
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,580
Um

275
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,559
um but, you know,

276
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,299
as with all things patching kernels and nobody

277
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,179
has time for uh rebooting thousands of systems,

278
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,539
right?

279
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,580
Um So it's probably a slow roll out.

280
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,429
So, um we have uh put together a, a system tap script that

281
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,390
uh

282
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,630
is, is meant to mitigate the issue by intercepting the uh the suspect system calls.

283
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:41,500
Yes. And there is also uh K patch which lets you do line patching. But

284
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:45,619
I think you have a really interesting point is reboots

285
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:48,820
are painful and a lot of people can't even do them.

286
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,010
I know, I, I've heard stories about,

287
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,909
you know, regardless of the whole Dev

288
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,369
ops. So let's just keep moving things around rebooting quickly.

289
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,619
I've heard stories about people with systems that are

290
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,929
built in such a way and they're so large

291
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,109
that it literally takes more than a day to reboot

292
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,919
because you obviously have to take things down sanely and

293
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:10,080
then do your work and then bring them back up and they have to load stuff off disk and,

294
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,760
-- and
-- put, and

295
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,619
load into memory.

296
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,250
It's crazy.

297
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,219
S

298
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:13,419
a

299
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,630
is, is a huge uh uh part of that, that, that issue, right?

300
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,590
Because those systems tend to be so huge and so

301
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,049
important to the business workflow, right? Where,

302
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:26,359
you know,

303
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:29,270
they may have maybe two hours of downtime and it

304
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,570
takes them an hour and 50 minutes to boot,

305
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,039
right? So it's crazy.

306
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:33,809
So, you

307
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,109
know, it's,

308
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:40,330
I remember when I was my first job out of college, I was an A IX system administrator,

309
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,489
which

310
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:45,929
was, this was back when I, I wouldn't even say A X was popular then.

311
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,570
It, it has it ever been popular anyway.

312
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,419
I, I remember that we had this machine

313
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,500
that literally took half an hour to shut down and it took half an hour to start.

314
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,820
And so if you had to take this thing down, like it was a huge deal and I'll never forget,

315
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,919
like, one day it crashed

316
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,340
and we literally had

317
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,700
30 people just staring at you like, what's going on and,

318
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,510
and they could not do their jobs until the, and I'm like, it's booting this.

319
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,940
Like, I can't do anything else but watch the screen

320
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,049
as it, like, ticks through the numbers.

321
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,239
That's right. It's, it's going through its memory check now.

322
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,940
No, I was, I was a, uh, uh, I was a net wearer

323
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,890
uh in a previous life and the same,

324
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,690
same issues applied, right.

325
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,729
You know, these giant behemoth machines that were running a

326
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,630
relatively slow os. Right?

327
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,049
And it's got to go through all the system checks on boot up and it just took forever.

328
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,309
We ran on X 86. Right.

329
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:37,710
-- Uh
-- Yes. Yep.

330
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,530
Yep. Right. Right. Oh, man, I do. I remember network too.

331
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:42,289
I have one of my claims to fame

332
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:45,150
was when I was in high school, I helped

333
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,190
the local

334
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,630
uh land administrator guy take care of the network

335
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,919
and of course we ran netware. Right.

336
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,440
And I, I found,

337
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,030
I

338
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,900
don't remember the details or what I did,

339
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,960
but I remember finding a way to create a drive share.

340
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:00,679
That was where we put all our games

341
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:03,460
and I somehow made it so even the,

342
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,159
the network admin could not view what was in the drive,

343
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:09,080
only me and my friends could get to it.

344
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,419
So we would log into the school's computers and we

345
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:13,510
had drive G for games and everyone was like,

346
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,869
oh, we want Drive G and I'm like, no, you can't have it.

347
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,179
And to my knowledge it was still there after I

348
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,909
graduated and they could not make it go away.

349
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,890
So, like, the people, the younger kids, I knew

350
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:27,130
who were part of the group still had access to the games and they

351
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,890
could not get rid of them because they could not figure it out.

352
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,950
-- It became myth and lore.
-- Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right.

353
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,489
I don't remember how I did this because it's, it's long enough ago. It's in the sense

354
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,159
of that, that,

355
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,289
that speaks to security too, right? Because

356
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,460
you

357
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:41,900
trust

358
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,440
personnel and uh

359
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:44,530
I,

360
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:47,270
I was clearly not a trusted personnel

361
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,700
in the, in the public sector. We would call that a bad actor.

362
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,549
We would call that a bad actor

363
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,950
and nothing's changed.

364
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:55,789
But,

365
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,159
oh my goodness. All right. So,

366
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,030
yes, bad actor. I love it.

367
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,890
So the other really crazy thing that came out this

368
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,820
week is there have been a bunch of hardware timing attacks

369
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,669
and,

370
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,940
and these always get my, get my ire because I remember when the first one came out,

371
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,030
man, I bet it's been at least five years, maybe more.

372
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:25,390
And it was about stealing RS A keys on virtualized machines where you had one VM

373
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,080
could do things to essentially

374
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,760
acquire information about another VM. But like,

375
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,849
man, it's been,

376
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,690
these guys have taken it to the next level and, and in ways that scare me to death.

377
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:37,669
Oh,

378
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:39,309
yeah. Absolutely.

379
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,770
Because you, you think about the hard, you can't patch hardware, right? I mean,

380
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,530
you can't address it.

381
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,440
-- I mean, that's
-- not technically true

382
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,690
because,

383
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:51,429
well, so, so I,

384
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:56,400
there are, there are different things that exist and not ignoring the F PGA world,

385
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,299
which is a field programmable Gatorade.

386
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,340
And that's literally, you have a chip, you can program it to do anything you want.

387
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,690
And in fact, back in the day when they would,

388
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,239
I don't know if they still do it anymore just because the chips are so big.

389
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,520
But back when they were doing,

390
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,640
the pentiums Intel would build a Pentium out

391
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,880
of F PGA arrays to essentially test the logic

392
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,459
to make sure it was correct before they would send it off to the fab factories.

393
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,829
Because obviously, if you make a mistake in your logic, you're talking about, well,

394
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,160
like look at the floating point error they had that cost them a fortune to fix, right?

395
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,050
But anyway, there's something called micro

396
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,869
code in in CP US today

397
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:35,459
that lets you essentially do a, you can't do tons of fixes.

398
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:38,219
Obviously, there is a certain level of hardware fixing.

399
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:38,540
You can do,

400
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,619
you cannot fix the particular issue that was found with the Haswell chips though,

401
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,229
which is a, a cash timing attack on the branch predictor,

402
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:52,189
which probably doesn't make a lot of sense to most people. But

403
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:53,839
so, so here's the issue.

404
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,969
I'll kind of, I'll give you the, the nickel tour just because I can.

405
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:57,849
And

406
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,670
you have what's called the pipeline. See this, this gets crazy.

407
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,089
It's so complicated.

408
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,439
You have what's called the pipeline.

409
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,130
And now processors don't like,

410
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,369
you don't take one instruction and run it through the chip and then you're done

411
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:11,260
and then you take the next instruction, run through the chip and then you're done,

412
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,589
right?

413
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,250
They what's called the pipeline and

414
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,900
you basically put it in, you,

415
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,609
you keep loading this pipeline where you put instructions

416
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,930
in and they like this is this instruction starts,

417
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:20,140
you know,

418
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,739
doing what it needs to do and there there's multiple stages

419
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,319
and I don't even know how many they have these days.

420
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:26,180
I just remember back when I was in college,

421
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:30,520
we were talking about like, I think it was maybe eight stage pipelines or something,

422
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,819
which seemed insane at the time.

423
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:35,660
I'm sure it's ridiculous now. But anyway, if you, if you miss the branch

424
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,709
because the branch predictor decides.

425
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:37,939
All right,

426
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,550
I think it's gonna take this branch and

427
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,979
it starts loading those instructions into the pipeline.

428
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,839
And if you have a branch miss,

429
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,630
then it has to throw away all those instructions,

430
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,660
all that work it's doing and it has to load the new branch path

431
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,619
right?

432
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:55,630
And then start doing the work on that and granted these chips run super fast.

433
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,869
But in a high performance environment, you're talking about potentially losing,

434
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,640
you know, nanoseconds of work.

435
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,660
But you know, I mean, again, depending upon many factors,

436
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,469
it can make a big difference.

437
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,699
So anyway, you have the branch predictor.

438
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:12,290
And from what I read in this paper is they essentially have it set up. So you can

439
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,500
put together a fake program

440
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,459
that

441
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,510
mimics

442
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,099
the kernel space branches

443
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,459
and kind of run them side by side.

444
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,380
And based upon the performance,

445
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,089
you can determine if the kernel is missing certain branch calls

446
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,510
or if it's making those certain branch calls because of the cache

447
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,310
because obviously it,

448
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,939
it caches certain information

449
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,459
inside the chip.

450
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,859
And so what happens then is

451
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,180
by by paying attention to the cash hits and the cache misses on your

452
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:47,939
not the kernel program that's just mimicking the the flow of the kernel,

453
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,020
you can figure out what the kernel A SLR

454
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,209
uh random I I guess random offset is

455
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,250
which is like crazy to think about.

456
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,140
And the thing is that's important because when you write a kernel exploit,

457
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,280
there's something called kernel address space lay

458
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,219
randomization.

459
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:06,920
And the purpose of that is so when you write a kernel exploit,

460
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,369
you need to know memory addresses, important things are stored

461
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,699
and they use the

462
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:15,540
A SLR to essentially randomize those locations, but they're,

463
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,130
they're the offsets are known.

464
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,859
So if you can figure out the base

465
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,380
of the randomization,

466
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,339
you can use it to figure out where other stuff is.

467
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,520
And so the goal of this attack is to figure out that base.

468
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,500
So then you could write an exploit in the kernel knowing

469
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,589
where important memory structures are you want to overwrite or control.

470
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,719
And this is like this is such a Rube Goldberg machine.

471
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,400
But it,

472
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,160
but it, so there's, there's two, there's two sides to this, right is on one side,

473
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:46,359
it's awesome that we've reached this point of insanity

474
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:48,900
in how we attack systems, right?

475
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,119
Which is super cool because that means a

476
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,219
lot of this other technology we're doing works.

477
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:54,750
But on the other side, it's like

478
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,420
it's so complicated. How do you possibly plan for or even defend against this?

479
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,750
Uh Yeah. Yeah. Right. So,

480
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,319
I don't know. Uh

481
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:06,989
I'm

482
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,300
not being super familiar with the way

483
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:13,829
the system calls and those things are, are cashed up and, and, and pushed out and,

484
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,209
and flush through the system.

485
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:19,550
Uh I'd imagine that the busier a system is the more likely it is to

486
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:22,449
quickly get that offset, right? Is, is,

487
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,130
-- is that kind of a correct assumption?
-- I I'd imagine.

488
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,030
So, historically speaking,

489
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,489
these attacks only worked in labs because you had

490
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,430
to have a relatively idle system to build,

491
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,660
to exercise this stuff.

492
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,260
But as,

493
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,540
as roll hammer, for example, shows us

494
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,550
that's not always true. And in fact, there was last week too, Ro

495
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,150
Hammer,

496
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:43,510
someone released an android exploit.

497
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,729
You can root like any android phone with the Ro Hammer attack,

498
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,369
which is just like what, what is going on, like,

499
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,329
what has happened to the world we live in.

500
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:52,920
Right. This makes sense.

501
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,880
Yeah. And, um,

502
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,920
you know, I'd imagine, uh, I'd, I'd imagine, I think, uh,

503
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,199
I read something yesterday, uh, about this,

504
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:06,400
there was a conversation going on about using, you know, uh, CRC checks or, you know,

505
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,959
um, adding some, uh, adding some functionality in there, right,

506
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:12,180
to be able to mitigate some of this.

507
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:12,589
But,

508
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:18,530
um it will inevitably slow the system down. Uh you know, sometimes imp perceivable.

509
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:18,869
But

510
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,729
um you know, you talk about

511
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:25,439
uh you know, f si folks, right, who are doing high frequency trading, right?

512
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:28,739
You know, every last bit of performance is

513
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,780
crucial,

514
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,900
right? Um

515
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:32,449
But now, in their case,

516
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:36,599
I would imagine they don't have random people who are able to execute a

517
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,280
-- hammer attack on their systems,
-- right?

518
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,599
-- At
-- least I hope not.

519
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,709
I'd, I'd, I'd hope not. But you know, those, those are,

520
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,650
that's that soft

521
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:50,239
Nity Sinner, right? That, you know,

522
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,469
that's, that's the holy grail. So people are going to try, right?

523
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,880
People are going to try very hard.

524
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,040
-- But, but
-- so, so here's the irony of this as well is CRC

525
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,839
is

526
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,579
easy to discredit in this instance because it's going to

527
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,770
be very slow and with memory speed is king.

528
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,430
Now, let's even think about the context of ECC which is error,

529
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:15,209
correcting memory and it's not perfect and raw hammer can easily get around ECC.

530
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:17,130
You just have to flip two bits instead of one

531
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,689
and then your check some works out whatever it doesn't matter.

532
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:22,609
The point is. ECC ra M has been around for a long time.

533
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:26,290
It does what it's supposed to do. It even corrects errors

534
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,890
where you can have a certain amount of problems in your memory and it will fix them.

535
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,219
And there's, uh, people have done studies on how often RA M

536
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,719
has bit errors due to hardware or solar rays or like frogs, whatever,

537
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:40,260
it doesn't matter.

538
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:43,300
And it's, it's not zero but it's not very high.

539
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,660
But ECC is expensive

540
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,859
and it is slightly slower

541
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,339
because of this fact.

542
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,180
Now

543
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:54,099
it is never caught on in the industry. And generally speaking,

544
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,150
it is a very niche market.

545
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,430
And in fact, like, I know some people who swear by UCC and I'm like, II,

546
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,099
I refuse to pay the extra $20 AAA sim or whatever,

547
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:03,890
whatever, the

548
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:06,829
whatever I

549
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,560
don't even, I've got a pile of one on my

550
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,400
shelf over there. They're so cheap.

551
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,640
But,

552
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,069
and, and here's the thing

553
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,430
is the people who most need this technology, be it like

554
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:24,109
a, a cell phone or an end user or even even a cloud provider,

555
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:28,250
they don't want to pay for it because they're already operating.

556
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,040
Either they're cheap skates like me where I just like, I'm like, no,

557
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,250
I won't pay an extra two cents for more security.

558
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,189
Right?

559
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:41,219
Or, or you have the margins are so small that like a nickel, a device or a nickel,

560
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,270
a machine makes a huge, huge

561
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:47,170
and we're actually not talking nickels, we're probably talking dollars,

562
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:47,869
right?

563
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,030
And, and you're not, and you're not just talking about,

564
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,339
you know, currency cost either.

565
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,750
You know, you mentioned speed and speed is king when it comes to memory. I mean,

566
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,000
you know, it,

567
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,329
I just, I just overheard a conversation this morning, um, you know, at,

568
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,349
at the store because, you know, I had to get my caffeine fixed this morning.

569
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:09,979
Um People complaining about the chips and uh credit card now, right?

570
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:13,699
Uh People hate it. People hate it because it's slower.

571
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:16,599
Um But, you know, albeit, you know, chip and sign,

572
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:18,459
that's a whole another conversation, right?

573
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,160
Chip and sign is really not much more secure than swipe and sign, right?

574
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,010
You know, until we get the chip and pin. But

575
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,979
um

576
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:29,739
you know, it's there for added security. It's that first step.

577
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,030
But people hate it

578
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,229
and people would love to go back to the swipe even though it is markedly less secure.

579
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:39,819
You know, this is,

580
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:44,060
there's various other people I pay attention to and there's a fellow out there.

581
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:44,619
Uh

582
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,329
I think it's Michael Santa

583
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:50,099
Angelo. His name is and he talks about this a lot and the fact that

584
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:55,180
we've yet to see a significant benefit from moving to chip

585
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,250
chip and sign

586
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,969
because apparently the levels of fraud are not decreasing,

587
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,329
which is

588
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,550
that fascinates me a little bit because on one

589
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,569
side I would have kind of expected the chips

590
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:07,859
to, you can't clone a chip. Well,

591
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:09,750
as easily.

592
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:10,189
I

593
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:12,140
won't say it's impossible because I know there's

594
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,689
been some research done around this but,

595
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,270
but that makes it right.

596
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,380
So there's still, and that,

597
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,589
that clearly means a significant amount of this fraud

598
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,520
is either online where you don't need the card present

599
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:24,839
or they're just stealing the cards and going and buying stuff with them.

600
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:25,739
And

601
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,089
I, I don't know exactly how it is. I don't pay that close of attention to this.

602
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,060
And

603
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,869
I, in, in the case of a stolen card, a pin will obviously

604
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,349
deter that attack,

605
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:40,540
but in the case of online, no card present.

606
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,760
It doesn't matter if you have a pin, right?

607
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,859
You're, you're still gonna be able to do that stuff.

608
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:48,949
Mhm. Yeah. All, all you need is that what the C, the CV V on the back of the card?

609
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:50,989
The CV V? I don't let me

610
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,239
-- right.
-- That

611
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:55,089
terrible noises as I dig my wallet out here. Uh,

612
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:57,109
and it doesn't say

613
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,849
so, what about my other card?

614
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,030
I have no CV V. Sure. We'll, we'll call it that

615
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,810
if we can.

616
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,319
Now,

617
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,630
I do have one awesome story here is I,

618
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:13,150
so, so my work credit card has been stolen so many times I've lost count.

619
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,150
I get it replaced probably every two or three months

620
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,109
and the last time I got it replaced was shortly before I was going to Europe

621
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:21,680
and

622
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,060
I call him up and I'm like, look guys, like, let me set a pin.

623
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:29,839
This thing keeps getting stolen and I'm going to Europe and I, I give me a pin, right?

624
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,300
And they did, they gave me a pin and I was like, oh, this is so cool.

625
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,500
And now even in the US

626
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,680
when I use that card, I have to type in the pin instead of signing a sheet and I love it.

627
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:42,790
-- It is so nice.
-- Absolutely.

628
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,829
I just, I actually just got my uh my new card uh couple weeks ago

629
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:47,795
and it,

630
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:49,135
it had the chip and

631
00:27:49,244 --> 00:27:50,415
pin, it had a pin.

632
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:54,795
-- I didn't have to ask for one. They just gave me one.
-- Oh man, that's so nice.

633
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:57,314
In fact, I called my bank with my my other card,

634
00:27:57,454 --> 00:28:00,805
my personal card. I'm like, hey, give me a pin like no, we won't do that.

635
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,234
Come on guys like help me out here,

636
00:28:03,844 --> 00:28:03,915
you

637
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:04,454
know, they

638
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:07,494
have nothing to do with it. Although I guess in, in

639
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:10,244
so I, I kind of under here. Here's the question right.

640
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,314
Here's the ultimate question if we want to kind of tie it all back is,

641
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:17,869
is the cost of supporting pins. Good look, face, people forget them.

642
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:20,880
They type in the wrong pin, the key pads are broken, whatever,

643
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,270
there's a million things that can go wrong

644
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,910
is the cost of supporting a pin infrastructure cheaper than the amount of fraud

645
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:30,349
that happens

646
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,390
without

647
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,699
it. And, and, and I, I don't know. Right.

648
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:37,170
I can't answer it, but fundamentally that is the question that has to be asked.

649
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,150
Uh, as long as insurance rates are low

650
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,780
uh for, to, to cover fraud. Right.

651
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,270
I mean, I would imagine that the economies of scale. Right. You know,

652
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:51,510
if, if they can pay a couple of $1000 a year to be insured against fraud and get it,

653
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,390
just get it paid,

654
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:53,390
then

655
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,030
why bother?

656
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:55,670
And,

657
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,229
right,

658
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,140
because,

659
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,020
yeah, because,

660
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,640
you know, once you go to pin, you know,

661
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,750
not only do you have to support the changing of those

662
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,430
pins and assigning those pins and people forgetting the pins,

663
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:05,719
but,

664
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:07,329
you know, you have the,

665
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:12,290
the added hassle of making sure that those pins are stored in a secure way.

666
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,479
Right. Like, like one would hope, you know, passwords are stored hashed and salted.

667
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:16,810
Right.

668
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,609
You know. Um,

669
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,420
so it, it

670
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:22,569
seriousness though, I,

671
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,069
well, I, I shouldn't say that. So

672
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,689
with chip and pin,

673
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,640
I don't know who stores the pin.

674
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,739
I think it's, the card issuer

675
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,619
has control over that or it might even be

676
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,310
Visa or mastercard.

677
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,520
The, the.

678
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,109
Hm. That's a good question.

679
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,109
I, I should actually look this up but I know like in the context of PC I,

680
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,729
they have very good rules around password storage and

681
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:47,099
things like that and even even card number storage.

682
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,880
Where there's some, I mean, granted

683
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:53,439
we can complain about PC I all day long but that particular part they,

684
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,099
I think they did an ok job of is,

685
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:57,609
is having very clearly defined rules for storing

686
00:29:57,619 --> 00:29:59,300
these passwords and what's going on there.

687
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,439
Yeah. Uh, the PI I protection,

688
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:04,479
um, you know, in general. Right.

689
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:08,430
You know, social security numbers, card numbers pins everything.

690
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,380
-- Yeah. No, absolutely.
-- In, in theory. Right. I mean,

691
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,339
there, there been some incidents

692
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:14,920
we will say,

693
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,750
depending on the auditor who read the, uh, compliance standards at that moment.

694
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,040
Right.

695
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:21,550
And that's actually, that,

696
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,680
that's something else that comes up every now and then is,

697
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:27,280
I will have to deal with an issue where an auditor has decided

698
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,640
this is the way the rule reads

699
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,250
and the old auditor didn't.

700
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:34,410
And now we have to reconcile that

701
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:35,650
and it's,

702
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:37,979
and it can be such a pain in the neck. I mean,

703
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,390
so that's one of the problems with compliance, right?

704
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,390
Is you at the end of the day, you're at the mercy of your auditor.

705
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,780
So, so buy him very nice dinners when he,

706
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:46,400
uh,

707
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,900
we, we, yeah, that, that, that, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Right. So

708
00:30:52,494 --> 00:30:53,035
questionable.

709
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,494
That's exactly right.

710
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:58,454
So, we, we run into that a lot in, in the public sector, right. Um,

711
00:30:58,675 --> 00:31:03,324
where, uh, each program, each project has what's called ad A a and,

712
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,964
and I don't ask me what that stands for.

713
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:07,895
I don't know, off the top of my head.

714
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:10,285
Um, but when dealing with things like AAA.

715
00:31:10,574 --> 00:31:11,015
Right.

716
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:13,324
Uh And for those who might not know,

717
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:14,160
you know, and IE

718
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,650
A is, um,

719
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:18,689
it's, it's a, it's a vulnerability audit, right.

720
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:20,890
That's put out by disa be between dis

721
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,310
A and U cyber com. Compare

722
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,500
to a CV E ID, which people

723
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,810
will be very familiar with.

724
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,540
It's more complex than that in nuance,

725
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:32,130
but we could conveniently say it's basically a magic CV E ID.

726
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:35,020
Exactly. And it contains a bundle of CV ES

727
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:35,750
and,

728
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,859
and not even just that it can also contain

729
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:41,300
uh like physical requirements and,

730
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:45,020
and warnings about non computer security events.

731
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,979
It's, it's crazy what they are. But anyway, we won't,

732
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,359
I'm not, I'm not going there, man. Like my brain can't handle it this morning.

733
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:56,589
But uh, so, so basically to, to shorten this up a little bit. It,

734
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:00,810
you know, we run into that a lot as well where, you know, I, if, if you, if,

735
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,030
if somebody says, hey, you know,

736
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,400
we're not gonna fix this vulnerability because it's super

737
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,949
low and here's what you gotta do to,

738
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:07,449
to,

739
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:11,310
to uh exploit it and you know, the way we ship the product, it,

740
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,780
it doesn't really affect it in, in the way that the CBE out outlines.

741
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:20,069
Some DAAs are like fine, great. Just give me that right up and we'll move along.

742
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:24,589
Some are absolutely, you know, no, we need a patch for this and we need it tomorrow.

743
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,180
Right.

744
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,469
So, uh, you know, it's,

745
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,310
we've run into that a lot, um, in,

746
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,589
in the security world where depending on who you talk

747
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,300
to will depend on what answer you get and how

748
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,130
important they feel a certain issue is.

749
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,719
You kind of love it. There's nothing like reproducibility

750
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,410
that.

751
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:42,719
Right.

752
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,569
Yeah, exactly.

753
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,380
-- That's right. Predictability and reproducibility. Right.
-- Oh, man.

754
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,109
Yes.

755
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:49,180
Oh,

756
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:52,050
my brain. I can't take it.

757
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:52,739
It's,

758
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,380
it's early in the morning. Let's

759
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:56,119
talk about

760
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:56,300
it.

761
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,979
A more pleasant topic

762
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,479
which is, uh, Schneer

763
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:03,790
had a thing about listening to voice over IP keyboard

764
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,339
noise to figure out what a person is typing.

765
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,260
That's not horrifying in every way.

766
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,319
No.

767
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:09,619
And,

768
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,839
and I'm staring at my mechanical keyboard right now saying I have made some very,

769
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:15,280
very poor life choices.

770
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:16,000
Uh,

771
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,140
you know, I think computers were where we went wrong, Dave, if,

772
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,140
if we had just paper and pens, everything would be fine.

773
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,680
Let's go back to abacus and punch cards.

774
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:29,280
And, uh, I think, I think the world would be a better place.

775
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:31,515
I think punch cards are, are too modern,

776
00:33:32,015 --> 00:33:32,645
too modern

777
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:33,594
actually.

778
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:39,645
I mean, so this actually this ties back into some of the hardware timing attacks and

779
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:42,964
there's the issue of lab environment versus real world.

780
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:44,765
And in fact, I remember reading uh,

781
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:50,204
an attack some years back where people were analyzing the noise on a power line

782
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:54,165
to determine what a person was typing on the keyboard. Because obviously

783
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,640
with the way electricity works is any time anything happens on the computer,

784
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,780
it generates a certain amount of noise and the

785
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,300
noise ends up feeding back through the power line,

786
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,250
like, like literally the outlet your, your computer is plugged into.

787
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,300
And these researchers figured out a way to

788
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,219
ascertain what is being typed by the noise

789
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,478
on the, on the power system.

790
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,000
Well,

791
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,989
that's, there's also the, one of

792
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:21,770
uh it was, uh, the iphone guys figured out you can use the, uh, uh, uh, what is it, the,

793
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,070
the gyroscope in the, in the iphone

794
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,688
to figure out what someone is typing if it is on the same desk.

795
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,870
Oh, interesting.

796
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,620
Yeah, it's,

797
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,540
we're just doomed like that. That's

798
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,540
the lesson from all of this. We're doomed. There's nothing you can do.

799
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:39,469
Go eat your poison candy.

800
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:41,929
-- And that's the end.
-- Right.

801
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:45,188
I, I, I'll, I'll gladly eat my poison candy because then I'll,

802
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,909
-- I'll at least I'll at least go out fat and happy right
-- at the end.

803
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,699
The hurting finally stops.

804
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,370
But,

805
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,188
so here's the thing

806
00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:58,029
that I always come back to is I look at all this and if you read

807
00:34:58,269 --> 00:34:59,208
the research,

808
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:01,789
everything is on fire

809
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,020
yet

810
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,989
the world is mostly still functioning.

811
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,500
Right. Yeah.

812
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:08,290
And

813
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,479
what that's going on.

814
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:15,939
-- So, I think, uh, if I were to hazard a guess and
-- please do,

815
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:20,070
we often guess and speculate and nobody is fact checking us.

816
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,969
So it's just fine and, and by the way,

817
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:24,139
if you have any problems with the content of the show,

818
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:26,500
uh I will put Dave's Twitter handle in the show notes.

819
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,409
Tell Dave because I don't care.

820
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:31,560
And, and, and I will, I will

821
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:35,669
speculate your guess. Let's hear that. Why, why is everything

822
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,540
not

823
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,540
on fire?

824
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:40,139
Uh Everything is not on fire because, and, and I,

825
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:43,540
I'm gonna tie it back to how we started the show with the poison candy, right?

826
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:43,939
Because

827
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:49,300
it gets these stories come out and they get so publicized that people think that,

828
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:55,419
you know, I can do this on my Commodore 64 and you know, be able to exploit these,

829
00:35:55,429 --> 00:35:57,159
the these vulnerabilities

830
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,820
where as you mentioned, Josh,

831
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,659
a lot of them are very pristine in the lab.

832
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,610
You know,

833
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:09,060
Mars and Mercury need to be in retrograde to be able to uh

834
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:09,570
-- but
-- they're

835
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,800
-- not,
-- actually, here's the deal. They're actually not anymore.

836
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,939
Like Row Hammer is a great example of Row

837
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:17,260
Hammer is like legitimately being exploited in the wild,

838
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,260
not in the lamp,

839
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,600
right? And, and

840
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:24,939
y yes, uh we're gonna, we're going to have, we're gonna have those. But

841
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,110
a

842
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,270
a

843
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,100
again,

844
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:33,219
I think the the bar to entry for a lot of these vulnerabilities is just really high.

845
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:33,770
And

846
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,330
um the the cost benefit analysis there,

847
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,239
there's a whole economy around these types of things, right?

848
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:43,780
Where I think a lot of these, a lot of these vulnerabilities like Ro Hammer,

849
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,550
it's not going to be worth somebody's time and effort to

850
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,870
leverage this, this exploit this vulnerability against

851
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,790
you. You know,

852
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:53,399
uh

853
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,669
you know, grandma Smith down the road, who's just, you know, sending, you know,

854
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,469
facebooking pictures of her kids, right?

855
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:03,020
Um The there's this whole economy of scale and

856
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,770
this whole economy around this cost benefit analysis,

857
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,129
right.

858
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:10,449
So where uh you, you mentioned these v these vulnerabilities,

859
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:13,709
these exploits are getting more and more complex and more and more

860
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:16,889
uh uh technically advanced and

861
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,370
-- the time energy and
-- effort,

862
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,850
-- Goldberg machines.
-- Right. Right.

863
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,489
So the time energy and effort that it requires to um

864
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:29,610
put, put the resources in place and put the

865
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:33,550
uh facilities in place to be able to leverage these exploits.

866
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,889
And these vulnerabilities is so high

867
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:40,459
that they, they need to be very targeted as to how they are used.

868
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,209
But then we get Iot botnets, right? You know, so

869
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,729
there's things on both sides of that coin.

870
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,479
Yy, you know, we

871
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,070
-- Yeah,
-- II I think

872
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,909
you must apologize actually since he brought it up because I

873
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:57,919
spent the entire episode mispronouncing the name of the botnet,

874
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,379
which I, I'm slightly embarrassed by uh luckily not too embarrassed,

875
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:03,360
which is why I'm still doing a podcast now, but

876
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,310
it's,

877
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:06,179
I love it.

878
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:09,439
It's, I mean, keeping track of all this can be such a hassle sometimes, but all right.

879
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:10,010
So

880
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,860
I'm not gonna disagree with you.

881
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,639
I, I think you're,

882
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:17,800
I'm not gonna say you're wrong because I can't say one way or the other.

883
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,239
But I,

884
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,840
I think what you've just described is probably more plausible than

885
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,399
anything else because if you listen to the security people,

886
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:28,679
there's no reason civilized society is still functioning, but it clearly is.

887
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:29,879
Or at least I think it is.

888
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,159
And so

889
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,189
it's,

890
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,949
yeah, I don't know, whatever. Like,

891
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:36,050
I don't

892
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,320
go human race.

893
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:37,840
That's,

894
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,219
that, that's, that, that's, that perpetual optimist in me. Right?

895
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:43,830
Is, is II, I like to believe that there's,

896
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,719
yeah, IIII, I just like to believe the best. Right?

897
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:49,959
-- You know, that's,
-- and although there's, there's an election next week,

898
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,159
so maybe you can change your mind.

899
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:52,969
I, I'm,

900
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,350
-- I'm still, I'm still digging my bunker in my crawl space.
-- So

901
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,189
you better get on that, man. It's, uh,

902
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,419
no matter who's elected, the world ends next week.

903
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,300
I, I'm, I'm optimistic but I'm also a realist.

904
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:09,139
So, and then half the country moves to Canada as well. So which half we don't know?

905
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,469
All right,

906
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:15,000
I've got one more topic here that I want us to talk about and then

907
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,780
we're gonna call it a wrap because I think we've wasted enough time with our,

908
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,250
our wonderful listeners.

909
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,050
So

910
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:27,260
Mozilla I heard is going to support TLS 13 in Firefox 52.

911
00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:32,620
There are two crazy things about that I think is, first of all,

912
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,000
they're, they're turning it on by default, which generally speaking in history,

913
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,750
we've been

914
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,889
a little bit more conservative with things like

915
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:43,969
this where TLS 13 might have been there,

916
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:45,639
but we wouldn't have used it automatically.

917
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,000
But the craziest part

918
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:51,760
is this protocol is still under review at the I ETF like,

919
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,760
it is not a formalized done deal,

920
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,790
which is,

921
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,439
that's crazy. Like, like

922
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,120
they're supporting a I,

923
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:01,330
I won't call it a beta protocol but like this

924
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,159
is still something in review that's still in draft.

925
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:06,159
Unbelievable. Absolutely. Right. And

926
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,689
I like the gumption.

927
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,209
-- It's fantastic.
-- I

928
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,699
agree completely. I think,

929
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,449
I think this is the way everyone should work is move fast, make mistakes,

930
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:16,929
let's face it.

931
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:18,030
There's gonna be mistakes.

932
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,489
There are,

933
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,729
I bet you they released a fix for this less than two days

934
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:26,050
after it goes out because it's probably going to break something nobody foresaw.

935
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,090
But I think that's ok because the,

936
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,429
the answer here isn't to do it perfectly the first time,

937
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:33,760
which let's face it is the reason this thing is still

938
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,169
in draft review,

939
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,229
not to get it right the first time,

940
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,070
but to be able to move quickly.

941
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:44,129
So when you make a mistake and when you have a problem, you can fix it immediately

942
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,189
-- instead of obsessing over corrupt, which never happens.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

943
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,350
I mean, look, look how long it took people to move from SSL V two to SSL V three. Right?

944
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:57,919
-- Um Being able to move quickly,
-- there was, there was no SSL V three.

945
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,540
It was called TLS one point. Oh, Dave.

946
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:02,989
Totally different. Totally different.

947
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:04,379
Was there a

948
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,469
L three?

949
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,850
I don't think there was

950
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:08,310
all right. We gotta look,

951
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,219
thank goodness we have the internet. Right?

952
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,560
Uh Let's see here. Now there is an SSL V three.

953
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,040
Yep.

954
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,060
Uh Is it 3.1? Is TLS 1.0

955
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:22,409
I,

956
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:26,989
you may be right. I, I, I'm not super familiar with the details on that.

957
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,879
It's, it was a pedantic

958
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,149
problem and I think it was a, a trademark issue or something like that.

959
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:35,110
Got you. Got

960
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:35,489
you.

961
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:44,330
Ok. So yeah, TLS 1.0 would be about like TL S3 0.1 because it has minor differences.

962
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,320
Ok. So I was wrong.

963
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:50,629
There is an SSL V three. I'm, it pleases me that this was long enough ago. I forgot it.

964
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,399
Fair

965
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:51,810
point.

966
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,459
I, I'm very happy for that and the fact it was, oh, man,

967
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:57,169
1999 it was in TLS 1.0 was drafted.

968
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,649
Oh my goodness.

969
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,169
And, and we're just, we're just at TLS 1.3 today.

970
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,270
Uh

971
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,479
Well, ok, so let's look at the timeline here. TLS 10, all right.

972
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:08,590
Let's start at the beginning.

973
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:12,449
SSL 1.0 1995.

974
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,760
Yes.

975
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,560
Uh It

976
00:42:16,209 --> 00:42:16,409
is uh oh,

977
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:21,939
wait 2.0 is 95 1.0 was never publicly released because of serious security flaws

978
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:23,580
so good for them.

979
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:24,639
Uh

980
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,320
3.0 was 96

981
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,610
and we just got rid of 2.0 what, like a year ago. Not even

982
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:33,169
so good for us.

983
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,399
Uh, 3.0 which I,

984
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,570
3.0 I don't think I really caught on all that. Well,

985
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:40,229
uh, TLS, 1.0 is 99

986
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,620
TLS. 11 was 2006, took seven years.

987
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,060
Uh, 1.2 was 2008. Only two years.

988
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,310
And now 13, which we're expecting this year would be eight years, eight years later.

989
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:54,469
So that's,

990
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,929
that's too long.

991
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:56,989
It is.

992
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,649
We are in a universe now where

993
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,110
I think if we're not updating these drafts on at least a yearly basis, if not faster,

994
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,030
we are going to have significant problems.

995
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:10,699
I, I, I'll add it to my to do list. Josh,

996
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,590
good. You get on that, that would be helpful.

997
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,939
Uh Yeah, and, and I mean, if you look at the rapid fire, you know,

998
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:22,159
issuances at the beginning, you know, you had 9596 then 99 for, what was that?

999
00:43:22,169 --> 00:43:23,929
99 for TLS one point? Oh,

1000
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,439
and then just these huge gaps of time, right?

1001
00:43:26,629 --> 00:43:30,850
And things change so fast, you know, why aren't these changing fast? And

1002
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,860
it's that fear, failure, right. And

1003
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:37,100
why fail, fast, fail loud, learn from it. Move

1004
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:37,510
forward.

1005
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:42,389
Although I guess so, I part of me understands this from the,

1006
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,010
the,

1007
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,520
the the perspective of being the standards bodies is you look at something like IP

1008
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,739
you know, I PV four

1009
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:52,129
that's been around for, like, 20 years.

1010
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:54,550
Like, they clearly did a pretty good job there. And I think

1011
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,000
that's the prevailing attitude is if we do it right, once we never have to do it again.

1012
00:43:59,149 --> 00:44:03,629
But for something like TLS, like, even if you did it 100% right in two years, like,

1013
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:05,030
it's, it's a piece of crap

1014
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:07,340
in 10 years.

1015
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:07,979
Cry, cry,

1016
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,310
cryptography research has gotten to a point and computing power has gotten so

1017
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:13,469
great

1018
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:14,629
that it,

1019
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:17,110
it's al it's null and void. Right.

1020
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,379
-- Yep.
-- Yep. Yeah. Right. Exactly. It's,

1021
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,479
the world is changing, the times they are changing.

1022
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,260
But II, I, I'm, I'm with you on that.

1023
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,790
II, I love the fact that they're, they're making it on by default,

1024
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,010
they're pushing it and,

1025
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,189
you know, see what breaks, fix it.

1026
00:44:33,459 --> 00:44:34,520
-- Right. Fix it
-- quick.

1027
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:35,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1028
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,780
Now, of course, the,

1029
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:43,419
this also depends on the server side also being able and willing to move quickly.

1030
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,100
Sure.

1031
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,459
So we will see this is, I mean, that's one of the challenges is the modern internet

1032
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,139
isn't like one thing.

1033
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:54,379
It's like 7000 pieces that are held together

1034
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:56,500
with duct tape and some good intentions,

1035
00:44:56,649 --> 00:44:56,830
right?

1036
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,330
-- Prayer. Lots of prayer.
-- Right. Yes.

1037
00:44:59,530 --> 00:44:59,629
That's

1038
00:44:59,780 --> 00:44:59,919
right.

1039
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:00,790
Unicorn

1040
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:01,389
tears,

1041
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:02,570
quantities of it.

1042
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:04,060
-- But
-- that's like I remember I was,

1043
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:06,510
I was at black hat and I was walking around and I saw

1044
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,590
there was a sign that said prayer room and I'm like the,

1045
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,989
the best chance of fixing your infrastructure is like right there, you know,

1046
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,300
all this other stuff they're selling, whatever

1047
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:16,030
praying

1048
00:45:16,169 --> 00:45:19,735
-- will probably get you farther
-- because, because, you know, you know,

1049
00:45:19,745 --> 00:45:21,445
there's a not insignificant quantity of

1050
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:23,135
infrastructure out there that's still running on

1051
00:45:23,145 --> 00:45:26,514
NT four in the version of IIS that was shipped in NT four.

1052
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,175
-- Right.
-- It's without a

1053
00:45:27,465 --> 00:45:27,614
doubt

1054
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:28,135
without,

1055
00:45:28,735 --> 00:45:28,885
well,

1056
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:32,235
how many things still rely on IE six every now and

1057
00:45:32,245 --> 00:45:34,405
then I'll run it into something that talks about IE six.

1058
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:37,665
And I'm thinking like, where do you even find that today?

1059
00:45:37,675 --> 00:45:42,485
You must have like a windows 95 CD on the shelf, you know, just for that,

1060
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:44,864
the box of the box of 3.5 floppies,

1061
00:45:45,114 --> 00:45:46,054
the box of three and a half

1062
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:47,604
seriously.

1063
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:49,409
So, you know, speaking of that, and,

1064
00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:52,649
and we can end on a happy note is remember booting up

1065
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:56,179
the old machines with floppy drives and they would make that crazy like

1066
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:57,159
noise.

1067
00:45:58,629 --> 00:46:00,169
I found out what that is.

1068
00:46:00,669 --> 00:46:02,790
So the reason they did that is

1069
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,899
the floppy drive generally had,

1070
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,639
what is it like 50 sectors or 60 sectors or whatever it was?

1071
00:46:07,649 --> 00:46:08,850
I forget. And obviously

1072
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,929
the red head, the computer had to know where the red head was

1073
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:15,010
and most of these drives were inexpensive

1074
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,800
and did not have sensors that could tell the computer where the redhead was.

1075
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:23,000
So it would basically just tell the floppy drive back the reed head up like 50 times.

1076
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:26,689
And obviously, when it hit the end, it had a mechanism in place did not ruin anything.

1077
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:29,590
So it just make a funny noise when the re head was parked,

1078
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,709
but it was still getting back up the redhead commands.

1079
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,790
And that's what that noise was,

1080
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,270
was essentially backing the reed head up to zero by

1081
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,709
just issuing like 60 back up the reed head,

1082
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,040
you know, commands in a row to get it there.

1083
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,510
And then you knew the reed head was at

1084
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,300
sector zero and you could start going from there.

1085
00:46:46,669 --> 00:46:46,959
Problem

1086
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:47,699
solving. Josh,

1087
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,989
you think that's like an elegant solution to what could have been.

1088
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,300
And, and again, this kind of comes back to that whole ECC ra M thing is

1089
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:00,419
you could add a sensor to the drive for probably a dollar or

1090
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,340
just back the thing up 60 times which costs nothing

1091
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,760
-- and maybe wear and tear and you got to buy a new drive sooner.
-- Right.

1092
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,820
But with this, then

1093
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:12,820
the sensor costs a dollar, but it's gonna cost you as the consumer five. Right.

1094
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,350
Yeah. Right. Right. Well, that, that's a good point as well.

1095
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,750
It certainly won't be free and

1096
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,570
yeah, it's

1097
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:21,810
maybe that's, we need more elegant, simple

1098
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:22,979
solutions.

1099
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,780
-- I, I like that idea. Josh. I like that idea a lot.
-- Get right on that.

1100
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,739
We'll have it next week, right. We'll cover that.

1101
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:33,010
Oh, my goodness. All right. All right. So

1102
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:38,199
it has been a fantastic time, Dave. Thank you so much for helping.

1103
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:39,110
I really appreciate it

1104
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:39,810
and,

1105
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,590
and to fill in for, for those of you listening.

1106
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,350
If you want any of the links to any of the crazy things we discussed,

1107
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,560
it'll be on the website, open source security podcast.com

1108
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:50,820
and

1109
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,620
uh Dave's Twitter handle will be there.

1110
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:56,090
So by all means, let him know whatever mistakes we made

1111
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,260
because then he can tell me and I don't have to pay attention

1112
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:02,340
and, and yeah, thanks for listening folks. I really appreciate it.

1113
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,020
Have a great week. Happy Halloween.

1114
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:04,699
Thank you.

1115
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,590
Have a Happy Halloween.

1116
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:08,979
Assuming you're listening to this on Halloween, which you probably won't. So

1117
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,169
we I I'm assuming you had a Happy Halloween. All right, there

1118
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,439
you go. Alright. Take care, Dave,

1119
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:14,159
-- take
-- care.
