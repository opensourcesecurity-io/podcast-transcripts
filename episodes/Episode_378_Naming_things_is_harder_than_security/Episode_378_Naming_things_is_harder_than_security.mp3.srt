Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,939
Kurt Siefried and my partner and

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,720
trying to figure out what names mean, Josh Presser.

3
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:18,799
That was a strange pause between open source security.

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,940
I literally was like open source.

5
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:22,709
What comes next? Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,260
Well, in my defense, it's been,

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,100
we've only recorded one podcast in seven or eight weeks.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,149
That's true. Ok. I'll give you that

9
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:29,860
and, you know,

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,009
words are hard as well.

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,069
And also I haven't slept longer than three or four

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,880
hours at a stretch in the last eight weeks.

13
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:39,560
That's rough, man. That's really rough.

14
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:43,750
Well, it's funny because I, I remember reading this World War Two book, um,

15
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,139
a Canadian sailor wrote about Life on the Corvettes,

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,909
the flower class Corvette that Britain gave us that were not,

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,759
they were, they were designed for like the Caribbean,

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,979
not the North Atlantic in winter.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,369
Those are basically the same thing,

20
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,450
basically. Right? Like heating.

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,259
What's that?

22
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:00,220
Um,

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,889
and

24
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:01,689
you know,

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,889
the whole port and starboard watch system where you're

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,870
on for four hours and off for four hours,

27
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,089
for days at a time.

28
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,330
That's something.

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,319
Well, I imagine it's not like you're getting a good sleep on these things anyways. I

30
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,970
don't know. I feel like

31
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,739
if you were on a boat

32
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:21,214
enough you would figure out how to sleep in that environment.

33
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:22,764
But I, I can't say either.

34
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,385
We also get woken up because there's all, you know, torpedo attacks and

35
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:31,495
air attacks and, well, look, if there's a torpedo attack, I, I want to be woken up. Ok.

36
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:32,175
Like

37
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:33,555
I'm ok with that.

38
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:34,245
Yeah.

39
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:35,065
You know,

40
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:38,014
they talk about how the ice hitting the outside of the hole wakes them

41
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:40,735
up at night because it's just on the other side of their bunk.

42
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:43,974
So it's funny you say that I watched a documentary about

43
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:44,745
Antarctic

44
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:46,885
Antarctica, Antarctica,

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,779
like research

46
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:53,059
and they were showing an icebreaker who is paving the way to one of the research

47
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,529
stations and they had the camera in the boat while it was like breaking the ice.

48
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,910
There is no way anyone can rest on that boat.

49
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,800
Like the whole boat is like vibrating and the

50
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:02,980
noise is out of control and it's just like,

51
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:03,809
holy cow.

52
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,330
And they're basically like, we're going to be doing this for the next 48 hours.

53
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:08,970
No one's going to get any sleep.

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,580
There's nothing we can do about it.

55
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,729
I'm like, oh my goodness, I can't imagine so. Yeah, back to, to name spaces. So

56
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,440
I've been

57
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:16,669
doing a

58
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:16,940
lot

59
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,419
of thinking we have to set this up first. So in the last episode,

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
we

61
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:25,419
briefly discussed name spaces.

62
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:28,130
And we, in fact, I think we, we made a comment like, you know, github

63
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,710
solve Typo squatting or something, which not get up do?

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,830
They didn't name spaces don't exactly.

65
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,500
They change the attack against typo squatting. They don't solve it.

66
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,139
And we say a lot of stuff so, whatever, but

67
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,050
it exploded into this gigantic threat on Mastodon

68
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,779
that I don't think it's available to the

69
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,860
general public to see. Oh, that's why I couldn't boost it. It involves Toma De

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,649
Pierre

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,970
and Carol Nichols, both of whom have been on the show

72
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,979
and neither of which

73
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,460
likes name spaces we discovered.

74
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:58,389
And so

75
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,050
it,

76
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:02,699
it resulted in a very interesting conversation.

77
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,160
I, well, no,

78
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,940
let's not say they don't because we don't know that they don't like name spaces.

79
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:10,889
I suspect they don't like the current implementations, maybe of name spacing.

80
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:14,750
And also I think like a lot of people like a lot of technical solutions,

81
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,610
we were promised a lot of things that were never delivered or can't be delivered.

82
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,820
So a great example of this would be like DNS E a lot of people hate on DNS Sec

83
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,050
and you ask why and they give a bunch of reasons like, well, yeah,

84
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:27,229
DNS EC doesn't really do that that well,

85
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,009
but it does these other things that are helpful.

86
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,970
So maybe it's not evil.

87
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,660
And then of course, once in a while it breaks dot New Zealand,

88
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,130
I want to

89
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:38,770
framing it in the context of DNS tech is perfect because

90
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,830
when we were discussing with this, with Tama and Carol,

91
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,050
I think we were all discussing

92
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,889
the solution aspect of name spaces and not really

93
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:51,205
very much of the problem portion of it.

94
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:53,285
And this is the same with DNS SEC because I think when

95
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:56,445
you try to explain what are the problems DNS SE solves,

96
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:58,595
I think it becomes a less compelling story.

97
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:01,804
And I think name spaces are similar where there are certain problems

98
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:05,104
name spaces help with and there are certain solutions they don't.

99
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,714
And I think Toma and Carol are correct

100
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,485
to

101
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:12,839
disagree with us. I'll say I, I would say it's actually

102
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,358
more difficult in the sense of we're all correct and wrong

103
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,899
because there's what name spaces can and cannot do.

104
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,608
There's what the solution side of it is.

105
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,720
And then there's the expectation side. What do we ask

106
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,269
anticipating or expecting?

107
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,679
Because I see a lot of comments saying things like, oh,

108
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,359
if we implement name spaces with some form of validation,

109
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,739
then that will lead to a false sense of security.

110
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,200
And my and I'm like, well, do, do we actually know that like is that what people think?

111
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:42,040
Because I, I don't know,

112
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,869
you know, if I go to like for example, if I go to get oh a perfect example.

113
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,119
Well, my, my one example is gonna be Burger King.

114
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,950
Like if you go to Burger king.com dot A U, it's,

115
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,730
that's Burger King except Burger King in Australia is not Burger King.

116
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:57,630
It's, it's a Burger King.

117
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,339
Burger King in Australia is Hungry Jack's because there was already a Burger King.

118
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:06,760
But a good example of this is if you go to github.com/red Hat, that's not Red Hat.

119
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,149
It's really not Red Hat.

120
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,829
And that should be very obvious because it's one of those, you know,

121
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:15,730
you commit this year. Yeah. The person squat. Oh, my goodness, you're right.

122
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,510
Oh, they do one commit every year or two or three?

123
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,049
Oh, no, there was no commits for anyways.

124
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:22,670
The point is github.com/red Hat is not Red Hat.

125
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:25,049
It's somebody who squatted the space back in 2010.

126
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,130
And I guess because of how

127
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,660
github

128
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,730
works and trademarks and abandon or not abandon recounts, whatever Red Hat,

129
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,809
the company

130
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,350
was never able to get a hold of it,

131
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,570
you know,

132
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,450
and I mentioned it once or twice because I was like, oh,

133
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:42,380
this is not great because almost worse in ways Red

134
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,000
Hat had something like 100 plus orgs on github.

135
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:47,730
Like at one point I tried to track them all down and it didn't go.

136
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:51,570
Well, one of the challenges of namespace is what is the actual expectation here?

137
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,609
Because for example, if I go to a namespace, let's say for the sake of argument.com.

138
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:57,220
Well,

139
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,010
the.com namespace, Burger king.com, what is that? Well, it's, it's Burger King.

140
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:03,010
But if I go to the.com dot A U

141
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,130
namespace, it's, well, it's not

142
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,450
Burger, well, it is Burger King legally in Australia,

143
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,369
but it's not Burger King.

144
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,709
And I actually, now I'm curious,

145
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,029
I'm gonna check if they have a presence on Github because it wouldn't be shocked.

146
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,010
Burger King.

147
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,329
Oh, my goodness.

148
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,209
04040, I should go grab that

149
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:19,929
anyway. Oh, don't do that.

150
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,769
We'll see how long it takes after the show goes public.

151
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,559
Someone's gonna grab it now, I think. But that's the thing, right?

152
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,609
So when you go to a name space and you look at a name,

153
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:31,380
if it's something like Google or Amazon or Aws,

154
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,130
I think the expectation is that it is Google or Amazon or Aws, which is

155
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,750
one of the reasons I keep going back to.

156
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,450
Well, let's just do domain names and be done with it. Well, and, and so that's

157
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,769
where I think a lot of the conversation ended up with Toma

158
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,529
and Carol, both kind of mentioning.

159
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:47,500
Why not?

160
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,970
Just, for example, let's say you want a name space in for N PM packages,

161
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,220
why not just run an N PM registry

162
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,690
with your domain?

163
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,459
And then your stuff is in that. And II, I think that makes a lot of sense.

164
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:05,579
And even better than that, for example, then you could actually do a very

165
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,040
easy central discovery protocol of when you go to N PM.

166
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:12,339
Js.org/red hat.com for the sake of argument,

167
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,619
it redirects you to red hat dot com's actual service

168
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,299
and,

169
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,290
and see that's the thing I this is one of

170
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:21,290
the things that spacing does solve is it allows you

171
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,519
to have multiple things in one space which for example, searchability,

172
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,579
you have a like sure

173
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,690
people go to N PM js.org and are clearly searching for things like security.

174
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,239
Because N PM js.org/security,

175
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,079
the security module hasn't been updated in um what was it?

176
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,000
Four or 10 years

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,170
and it gets still like 2000 downloads a week, 1386 is what it says right now, right?

178
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:48,119
If you search packages for security,

179
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:48,950
it's

180
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:50,940
yeah, last published 11 years ago.

181
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:54,200
Version 1.0 0.0 weekly downloads. Yeah, 1400.

182
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,390
So like roughly 200 downloads a day for 11 years

183
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,920
and it's horrifically out of date and people are like,

184
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,149
hey, this provides security.

185
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,190
So, ok,

186
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,579
so here's kind of what I've been thinking about in the context of this

187
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:07,420
whole discussion because I'm not done putting

188
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:08,899
all the thoughts together in my brain.

189
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,109
So my opinion may have changed by the time this actually lands,

190
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:16,269
I feel like there are a couple pieces to this name Space Story

191
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,410
and we're

192
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,040
bring them all together

193
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,839
things like a name space on N PM, which do exist N PM originally was completely flat,

194
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,640
which is why you see like name space dash package name in certain packages.

195
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:28,670
And now they have the like Ampersand

196
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,630
name space slash package.

197
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,349
Name is the new way, but a name space in a service like github

198
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,000
or N PM or something else.

199
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,960
I don't know if that's really a name space because you can kind of own it,

200
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,369
but it's not yours.

201
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,320
But I would argue you don't really have control over any name space.

202
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,369
Ultimately, then by that definition, because for example,

203
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,039
even DNS, somebody could, you know, have the sea

204
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,349
as a trademark and come after me and,

205
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,309
and threaten me with legal action and take it away from

206
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,739
me and which has happened to people with their domain names.

207
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,900
It can ultimately any word or trademark or name we use in this sort of business,

208
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:03,989
technical world can

209
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:08,090
probably be taken away from us, right? There's even been, let me rephrase that, OK.

210
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:12,929
When you own a domain, you have a certain amount of control over those resources,

211
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,359
right?

212
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,849
When you have a name space in N PM,

213
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,210
you are almost entirely at their mercy.

214
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:22,309
And that's only because of their licensing terms being different than say

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,969
the DNS registrar N PM, for example,

216
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:27,909
could have different licensing terms that do give you a lot of control.

217
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,679
They could choose to do that. I mean, that's fair.

218
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,000
They could and I suspect some of the open source ecosystems do N PM.

219
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,739
So maybe a bad example because it's controlled by a company, you know,

220
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,409
you could look at like

221
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:36,760
the

222
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:37,630
like

223
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,489
they're not gonna go out on a limb to protect you like

224
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,650
no really, I mean, because it is a business that would be insane. Absolutely.

225
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,080
100% you know, whereas some of these other, ok.

226
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,380
But now here's where this starts unraveling in my mind

227
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,539
when we look at the context of something like

228
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:55,659
crates dot IO for rust or pi pie or whatever

229
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,609
these are open source services

230
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,609
provided at no cost to really the developer or the user pulling from them.

231
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,809
There's, it's, it's, these are foundation run, right?

232
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,760
They run on a shoestring budget and like if they don't, it's a

233
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,130
nonprofit backing it.

234
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,260
Right. And if they don't want name spaces, like I think that's fine.

235
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,159
And that makes sense because I know like Carol works with the,

236
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:21,679
the rust stuff and they don't like them and I get that well,

237
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,650
I would simply say their playground, their rules.

238
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:23,890
But

239
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,340
for me, what gets me is number one. So there's clearly problems with

240
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,179
allowing people to choose package names

241
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:31,979
because

242
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,609
Attackers are, you know, like if you search for Aws on N PM,

243
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,840
there's a couple of legit ones and a whole bunch of maybe legit, maybe not legit ones.

244
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:45,030
Here's where I think that gets even funnier in tech.

245
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,130
We have never had an ecosystem last for more than

246
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,770
maybe a decade or two at most at this point.

247
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,270
And

248
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,320
when you think about like names are not just naming packages,

249
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,429
like N PM has millions of packages.

250
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,260
We're running out of words for package names in N PM. Well,

251
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,780
exactly. And,

252
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,500
and that's the other reason I think name spacing is important because there's

253
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,349
probably a good case to be made for more than one security package.

254
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,109
Right. Like

255
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,510
there could be a company that wants to have

256
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,700
a security package for their service or some protocol,

257
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,250
like an HTTP S security package or maybe an FTP security package or something.

258
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,539
Right.

259
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,700
And that would be the other benefit of name spacing is that

260
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,030
it allows us to have sort of different countries

261
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,340
with different flavors and different cultures rather than.

262
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,390
Well, all the good words have been taken. Now, what do we do?

263
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,549
Here's a thought. Why do we allow people to choose names at all?

264
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,090
Why don't we just simply assign them

265
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,979
on a unique, globally, unique ID? And if they want to have like

266
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,369
a description of what it is that is searchable, like this is an Aws SDK,

267
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:49,739
allow them to put that in.

268
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,729
But otherwise it's just a UED and that's what you type in,

269
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,109
that's what you put in your config files and you

270
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,630
could put a comment there saying what it is,

271
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,659
I mean, look, the the user experience of that would be ridiculous.

272
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,169
OK. That's one argument against it.

273
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,719
But for example, you could allow them to set an alias

274
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,789
of this is the AWS SDK.

275
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,299
And for example, multiple people could set that alias,

276
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,400
they could say this is described as like R PM packages, right,

277
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,690
R PM packages have a file name

278
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,179
but then they have other information like you know

279
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,729
the description and so on of it that well can

280
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:20,640
be the same between different, completely different packages.

281
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,640
Uh Perfect example being this is an email server and you can choose send

282
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,549
mail or post fix and they both implement like I need a mail server.

283
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,159
So like

284
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,169
install one to meet the requirement.

285
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:33,210
I mean that's how Debian works where you can specify,

286
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,239
I forget what they call them, like virtual dependencies or something.

287
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,929
But you can say like I need a male server and then things can be like I am a mail server.

288
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,320
Yeah, like

289
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:44,570
exim or whatever you want. Right.

290
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:45,380
So

291
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,179
my one thought there is, I think part of the challenge is letting

292
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,900
people pick arbitrary

293
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,070
names

294
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,039
that they may have

295
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:57,049
or may have nothing to do with.

296
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,119
I think you are technically correct.

297
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:02,010
But I feel like

298
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,380
from a practical standpoint, this is a ridiculous suggestion.

299
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,450
But there's a simple.

300
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,609
But then, OK, so,

301
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,609
so we've agreed that having these completely

302
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:12,929
random name like assignments would be terrible.

303
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,820
Yeah, I, I would be inclined to agree with that. This is how Discord

304
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,700
works.

305
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,840
Like, well, and I would be,

306
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,369
I, and I would say that on the,

307
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,049
having that on the back end is one thing but having it on the front end.

308
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:25,630
Yeah, that's terrible. So we're agreed that that's probably not a great solution.

309
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,070
So then, well, then that means we have to let people pick names and here we are,

310
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,489
we do have to let people pick names.

311
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,369
And I think

312
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,070
there's the human aspect of this

313
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:37,830
that

314
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,789
I think Carol and Tama were focusing on and you and I were not,

315
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,479
and the human aspect should not be discounted because fundamentally all tech

316
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,469
is for humans

317
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:52,250
at the end of the day. Now, here's a second thought. Ok.

318
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,599
So we're agreed that we should let people choose names. That is the same way to go.

319
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,039
Yeah.

320
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,440
Yeah. Well, then how

321
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:04,739
do we let them choose names that they have no control or any legal standing of?

322
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,960
Like, for example, with github.com/red hat,

323
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:11,140
I mean, this is where things start to get a little more dicey, I think.

324
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,400
Well,

325
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:14,969
they get messy because clearly the Attackers love that because they're

326
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,570
picking names that are like Aws official SDK or whatever.

327
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,010
So now we get into the discussion about like do name spaces improve security?

328
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:26,083
I don't think we can say yes. Well, let's dial it back one.

329
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:28,942
No, no, let's, let's ignore name spaces right now. So

330
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:30,812
we're agreed in principle that totally

331
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:32,663
random strings are purple monkey dishwasher.

332
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,742
Terrible idea. Purple monkey dishwasher is a great name.

333
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:37,802
It's from that documentation thing from ages ago.

334
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,112
Anyways, it's an Easter

335
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:40,982
egg. It's been on the show before anyway.

336
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:41,273
So,

337
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:43,513
and we've agreed in principle that letting people

338
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:46,703
choose names is good but leads to problems

339
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,546
because for example, they choose names like

340
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:53,676
Aws official SDK and then they harvest your keys. So here's a question.

341
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,835
What names can we let people pick

342
00:14:57,015 --> 00:15:00,945
that are? And I'm making air quotes here safe. I mean, historically,

343
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:02,116
we haven't

344
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,276
because

345
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:06,736
we've just assumed all names are equal and there's

346
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:09,156
not a concept of safe or unsafe names.

347
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,666
You have typo squatting

348
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:11,435
and,

349
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:13,859
you know, imposter stuff.

350
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,580
Like I remember when my ISP back in the olden days would let you pick your host name.

351
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,250
And I tried like male admin, all that stuff was reserved and blocked. Yeah.

352
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,880
Didn't you use like local host,

353
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,219
local host and like my cable modem tipped over and I, I had to phone Kevin and tell him,

354
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:28,669
you know,

355
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:32,090
first of all, I can't change my host name because my internet's down

356
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,570
because I'm getting flooded.

357
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,429
And secondly, you need to put this name on the reserve list and he's like, oh God,

358
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,369
you know, damn it,

359
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,770
Kurt, like, stop it.

360
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,140
That's also when I discovered that they would

361
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,250
route 10 dot Star traffic down their network.

362
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,210
And again, my NFS traffic caused problems. But anyways, I digress. So, ok,

363
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,419
here's the thing. If we let people choose names, then

364
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,590
what are names

365
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,219
that we can let people choose that we can

366
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:57,179
establish that they have some interest or control in.

367
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,869
And I would suggest there's three big ones, URL S email and domain names.

368
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,979
I mean, how does URL not just fall into domain names

369
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,099
because proving control of a domain name is

370
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,049
very different than proving control of a URL.

371
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:13,380
In the proving control of a URL, you have to put something on the page which is to

372
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,200
very messy and difficult versus proving control of a domain.

373
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:20,940
There's several ways that are generally accepted as secure to do that.

374
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:21,679
OK?

375
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:21,969
You know,

376
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:27,450
like you have email as host master at domain.com or you can set up a DNS record of,

377
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,799
you know.

378
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:29,960
All right, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna argue with you on this,

379
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,640
but this one feels sketchy.

380
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,320
Ok? But in general, right? So let's let's

381
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,440
let's avoid URL S because

382
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,619
they're just kind of messy anyway, right?

383
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,140
And

384
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:41,059
emails are very easy, you know,

385
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,000
you send an email with a magic link to the person saying click this link to review

386
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:46,309
manager control or whatever this email address.

387
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,049
I mean, that's how every time you sign up for a service, right? Yeah.

388
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,419
Yeah, that's fine. I get that.

389
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:51,250
So in principle,

390
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,789
then we could let people choose domain names or email addresses or possibly URL S,

391
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,820
although it's a little messy and use that as the names face and they,

392
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,409
they are

393
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,919
able to prove that they have control over that domain name,

394
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:03,849
email address

395
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,920
which all fundamentally boils down to.

396
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,739
It's either a domain name that they control or it's a domain name

397
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,130
like github.com that allows people to set up web pages and so on.

398
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,050
And so forth typically within a name space that's clearly identified, right?

399
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,170
If you look at a github,

400
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,760
like one thing I love now is when I'm browsing documentation and stuff,

401
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,540
people will just put something slash something.

402
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,160
And the assumption is that it's github.com something slash something.

403
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:27,819
Well, that's their mark down does that.

404
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,520
And I, I mean,

405
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,040
that would happen on any site I'm talking about stuff that's just like random.

406
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,829
I'm reading docs on the internet and they say the source code is available at bla

407
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,489
slash F

408
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,589
and well, the assumption is bla slash F

409
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,459
lives in github.com because where else am I gonna look?

410
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,160
I see. Ok. Anyway. All right. I don't,

411
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,760
I don't see where this is going in a helpful way. Well, so the, the point of this is

412
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:51,329
is that if we allow people to pick names,

413
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,170
allowing them to pick names arbitrarily clearly has problems.

414
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,619
So what if we only allow them to pick names that

415
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,219
they can prove they have some control or interest in?

416
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,000
Now, Attackers can't pick red hat.

417
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,020
Like for example, now you can't pick Red hat.com, you can't pick amazon.com.

418
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,579
He just lost me. I think

419
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:11,494
trying to impose these restrictions

420
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,084
in the name of security.

421
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:17,074
It's not just, here's just talked about Attackers. Ok.

422
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:17,974
But the other, well,

423
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:20,474
what I wanted to get to though was one of the benefits

424
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:23,375
of domain names is how do we interact with things online,

425
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:24,614
domain names right now?

426
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,895
Yeah, with our web browsers for sure.

427
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:30,800
I mean, I agree with that and email, if you want to email somebody,

428
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,119
it's kind of dependent on their domain.

429
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:32,709
I

430
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,150
mean,

431
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:34,229
well, for

432
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,020
example,

433
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,709
I used to work at security portal

434
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,569
site partners and I would email developers saying, hey, can you, you know,

435
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm trying to get some information about the security vulnerability.

436
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,239
Could you

437
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:44,359
talk to me about

438
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:44,619
it?

439
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:45,589
No response

440
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:48,125
when I started working at Red Hat

441
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:52,444
immediately getting responses all the time because of that Red hat.com Domain.

442
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:56,594
I mean, I'll agree with that. It definitely carried a certain amount of respect.

443
00:18:56,604 --> 00:19:00,545
You didn't get elsewhere. That is fair. But I don't feel like

444
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:04,084
this necessarily addresses the name space discussion

445
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,459
in the context of software packages. Specifically.

446
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,119
What I'm saying is I haven't gotten to name space yet.

447
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,750
I'm just saying when we talk about,

448
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,229
we have to allow some form of name because we established that if we just assign

449
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,390
uh globally unique I DS, that will be terrible and horrible.

450
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,949
There's a reason people don't refer to products by their barcode number,

451
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,530
right?

452
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,530
You know, I or for example, go get me some 4011. I have no idea what that means.

453
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,630
Get me some bananas or is that the plu for bananas?

454
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,949
The code for bananas across North America.

455
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:36,560
It's like one of the few codes I know I also used to know one of the brand of apples that

456
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,880
we used to obsess. I used to know some of them. I worked at a grocery store long ago.

457
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,189
Exactly. Right. Like everybody is like, oh, yeah, 4011 that's bananas.

458
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:47,130
Everybody knows that. But nobody ever says it because,

459
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,189
well, you use the word bananas.

460
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:49,790
Duh.

461
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:56,260
And software is the same way. We use names for software. We don't use a hash.

462
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:57,520
It is.

463
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,300
Right.

464
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:02,599
Well, because it's for humans. Right. Names are for humans.

465
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,949
Well, and we need to be able to talk about this.

466
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,780
We need to be able to say I am looking at two different packages.

467
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,079
We need to pick between them

468
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,400
or I need a package that does X and well, thanks to

469
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,800
reasonably named packages. If I'm looking for a package that does a hash function

470
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,599
generally, if I search N PM or crate or whatever for hash, I will,

471
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:24,790
I will get something hash related, hopefully.

472
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,719
And then I can look through those options and you know,

473
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,390
pick one. So here's something interesting for you. I just typed hash into N PM

474
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,689
6872 packages found and, 00, my goodness. This is terrible.

475
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:39,569
The first one is a, a package named hash

476
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,949
that was updated five years ago. Exactly.

477
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:44,770
And this is my point about letting people choose these names,

478
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,270
even if it's not an attacker not malicious.

479
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,260
Now, you have somebody squatting the hash,

480
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,694
you have somebody squatting the security word that hasn't updated or anything.

481
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:55,645
With it in half a decade or in the case of security in 11 years

482
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,685
and maybe we should take that back and

483
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:59,464
update it. This is ok.

484
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:02,555
So here's the discussion and I think this is a different problem

485
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:06,055
than name spaces because I don't think name spaces necessarily fix this.

486
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,005
Exactly. But this is an interesting discussion.

487
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:10,125
So there's a package named hash on N PM

488
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:14,084
hasn't been updated in five years. Right. If we go look at the github

489
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:17,244
repository, I assume it hasn't been updated in five years.

490
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:18,359
Uh Yes.

491
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:19,319
02 years ago,

492
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:22,890
there was an update to package that JSON which apparently hasn't made it to N PM.

493
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,160
More to the point. There's eight commits, the whole thing has eight commits.

494
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,859
This is where I think the discussion gets interesting.

495
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:31,089
You know, name spaces are a possible solution.

496
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:33,829
But I think the problem hasn't been identified deep enough yet

497
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:35,959
is there are these terms

498
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,349
in these packaging ecosystems and they are flat.

499
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:41,119
The name hash is gone forever and you could say, oh,

500
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,959
let's just give it to someone else.

501
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,099
But here's the thing.

502
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,319
There is

503
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,969
an enormous amount of difficulty,

504
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:52,280
confusion and security problems in gifting away these names to someone else

505
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,290
because

506
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:56,410
how do you know the person who wants it isn't like, you know,

507
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,560
an adversarial government just like waiting there knowing like one of these

508
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,800
will get one of them and someone's going to use it.

509
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,209
Then

510
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,390
I have good news for you.

511
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,770
That's a problem with everything online, an email address, a domain name,

512
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,449
everything at

513
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:11,520
some level now and with packages is just a bit

514
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,369
more kind of directed in your face of like,

515
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:20,420
well, perfect example, uh hash gets 2600 downloads a week a week.

516
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,790
So like couple 100 a day. So if you want to go compromise a whole bunch of

517
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,540
systems, well,

518
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,739
this would be a really easy way to do it.

519
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,510
I mean, there have been other things,

520
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,150
I know there were certain things in N PM at one point

521
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,250
that had millions of downloads a day that the,

522
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,310
the authors had abandoned and no one knew what to do with it.

523
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,949
And I, I remember talking to some N PM people and they were like,

524
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,589
we can't give this to anybody like it's too,

525
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:48,589
it's too big because how do you trust the person saying I'll take care of

526
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:49,199
this?

527
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,719
Can, can do it.

528
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:51,439
You know,

529
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:55,380
the thing is ultimately we have to allow for that trust to be built because ok,

530
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,229
story time when I was at Red Hat,

531
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:00,900
there was somebody with and it was actually an N PM package who was freaking

532
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,599
out because they get 10 million downloads a week or a month or something.

533
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:06,410
It was a big number and there was a really bad security flaw in it.

534
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,119
And this poor guy,

535
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,900
21 years old, I remember that specifically

536
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:15,260
was freaking out. He's like, am I gonna get sued? Am I am I am my toast.

537
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,140
And

538
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,250
what had happened is he had started

539
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,479
fixing some of the documentation,

540
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:22,969
fixed a few things in the documentation.

541
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,109
Then he noticed a flaw in the code or a bug in the code. Fix that

542
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,890
and then like basically six months or 12 months later. It's kind of like cool.

543
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,930
Uh I guess it's like

544
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,000
it's yours now,

545
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,349
you know, you touched it,

546
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:34,829
you touched it last.

547
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:36,170
And so the,

548
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,310
that's the thing like we,

549
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,520
we need

550
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,479
people maybe

551
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:44,670
foundations like tide lift or something or the Linux,

552
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,030
sorry, I thought,

553
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,469
ok, which one am I thinking of then? That's like tide lift.

554
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,199
But a foundation, whatever, it doesn't matter.

555
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:55,280
The point is we need to allow people to build trust somehow

556
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:56,989
because, well, we already have that.

557
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,709
Like everybody implicitly trusts Linus Torvalds

558
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,199
and his cabal because,

559
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,810
well, we're all running Linux

560
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,400
but everyone trusts N PM,

561
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:04,709
right?

562
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:08,130
Nobody, nobody vets anything on N PM.

563
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,469
They just install it like a drunken sailor and they go

564
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:13,160
to town quick question who's actually in control of N PM?

565
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,329
Like what I want the names of the people who,

566
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:18,369
how many people at N PM would it take for them to

567
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,635
subvert N PM and just serve malicious code all day long?

568
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:21,805
And that is we have no idea.

569
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:25,885
Uh We kind of do. It's, I mean, you have to be on the inside but

570
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:26,814
how many people is that,

571
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,425
I think, I think I could do it with one.

572
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:33,614
I know, I know a person that I'm pretty sure could pull it off and I don't, but I mean,

573
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,805
look, it's, it's controlled by Microsoft.

574
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:37,724
It lives under the N PM umbrella.

575
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:39,084
There is

576
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,935
a lot of pieces to this and you could maybe argue it should be a foundation,

577
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:44,454
it shouldn't be a foundation, whatever.

578
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:45,015
But at

579
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,395
the end of the day, I don't think

580
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,619
any of this matters because people are just

581
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,890
gonna blindly install whatever solves their problems.

582
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,270
And I think that's the thing as security people, we keep forgetting.

583
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,530
Developers don't care about name spaces, they have problems to solve.

584
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,729
No, no, it's worse than that.

585
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:05,339
It's to actually do a proper like risk assessment and audit of N PM and how it uh M PM,

586
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:07,369
js.org and how it's run and who's in control of it

587
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,150
and how many people it would take to subvert and how safe

588
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,939
it is is basically expensive to the point of damn near

589
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:13,930
impossible and more to the point it doesn't matter because yeah,

590
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:14,510
what are you gonna do?

591
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,010
Not use

592
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:19,714
PM? If you wanna use N PM, you have to use N PM, gs.org. There's no sane alternative,

593
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,425
right? If you wanna use Pearl, you gotta use CPA.

594
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:26,915
If you want to use PHP, you gotta use pear. So here's where I think

595
00:25:27,114 --> 00:25:30,944
I've just landed on all of this as security people, especially security people.

596
00:25:30,954 --> 00:25:33,834
And this is why I'm so thankful for people like Toma and Carol who,

597
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,584
who hold their feet to this fire

598
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:39,515
is we have this obsession with trying to warp

599
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,435
the upstream of open source to do our bidding.

600
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:47,969
And the reality is we can't, they aren't listening to us. They don't want to.

601
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:50,180
It's not even that they're not listening. Is that a

602
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,810
lot of this stuff they can't do.

603
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:53,790
That's a

604
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:57,119
stupid question. Is the person that did hash, are they alive?

605
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,250
We have no, we, we don't know. We, we, I don't know. You could probably look at their

606
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,160
github profile. Well, trick question. Do we even know the person?

607
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:04,099
A

608
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:04,729
no

609
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,010
is an account on?

610
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,150
But I don't know that that's a person they, they had to commit, um, what,

611
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,319
three months ago,

612
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:12,750
like you could be a

613
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,660
triggered off a server

614
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:15,760
function.

615
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:19,680
I don't know. Anyway. Anyway, here's the point. Here's the point of all this I think

616
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:20,479
is

617
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:26,880
as security people, we need to do a better job of

618
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,270
warping our expectations to the world instead of

619
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,459
trying to warp the world to our expectations.

620
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:33,979
And I think that's what it comes down to.

621
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:37,859
I think when people like Carolyn Tomas say, name, faces are dumb. Don't use them.

622
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:39,959
The immediate reaction from us should have been.

623
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:41,900
They're probably right. Why are we wrong?

624
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,900
Instead, we had this lengthy discussion where I think that's why it ended at the end.

625
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,989
But like

626
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,569
here's my thought and argument on this, I'm not even

627
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:54,849
name space point yet. I'm just at the, how do we do naming at all?

628
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:58,880
That, that conversation's done, Kurt, like we decided people just make crap up.

629
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,390
Then we actually, once we do name spaces,

630
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,459
now we have additional problems is what I'm saying.

631
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:07,280
Right. We have the original problem of choosing names and having names.

632
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,020
And now we also have this problem of like, for example,

633
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,680
what is the expectation around a name space?

634
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:14,290
Well, I would say, for example, if I go to github.com/,

635
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:16,099
Red hat.com,

636
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:19,229
the expectation is that darn well, better be Red hat.com.

637
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:22,660
Now conversely github.com/red hat. Well,

638
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,089
again, my expectation is that would be Red Hat.

639
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:27,140
And luckily, the person who or entity or the,

640
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,359
the thing that owns that account has made it pretty clear that that is not Red Hat.

641
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,069
Like if you go to there, it's really clear, it's not Red hat. It's true.

642
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,939
Now, let me, let me ask a different question. Let's say

643
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,170
N PM has name spaces. They do have

644
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:40,829
names.

645
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:45,780
I know. But OK, let's say everything shut up. Let's say everything is in a name space.

646
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:50,689
I search for the package hash and I, I get back 2000 name space

647
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,060
hash packages. Which one

648
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:56,199
is the package I should do. Here's a really concrete example,

649
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:59,430
if I search for Aws, I get AWS dash

650
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,400
SDK slash credential provider node.

651
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,319
Now what is

652
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,579
AWS SDK? I assume that's the official

653
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:05,810
A

654
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:06,449
w how

655
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:06,630
do I,

656
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:07,439
how

657
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,550
do I like? They don't say what it is anywhere on this web page.

658
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,060
You should sell an EV certificate. And then,

659
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,800
well, and, and, oh,

660
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,800
actually that was one of my other things I wanted

661
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,130
to talk about was we've clearly landed on domains matter.

662
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,270
That's it full stop because domain validated certificates have taken

663
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,670
over the world and Evie and OV are basically dead.

664
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,349
The only thing that with a slight wrinkle is BMI the um what the heck is Bey

665
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,270
stand for again, I should know this because I bought one the uh

666
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,859
brand indicators for

667
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,520
me, message identification. So that's the thing we're on your email.

668
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,680
Like if you get an email from me, you get the S A logo

669
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,770
because we have this certificate and this thing with an

670
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,689
SVG or whatever PNG file that shows our logo,

671
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:48,040
same with Air Canada and a bunch of other companies,

672
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:50,130
Amazon just got one actually about six months ago.

673
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,099
And so the idea is that when you get an email from, say Amazon, well,

674
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,989
the real one has the Amazon logo and the not real one doesn't have that logo, right?

675
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,109
And

676
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:58,810
it's

677
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:02,849
mediated by your client and only shown if they have the correct record,

678
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:03,959
the attacker.

679
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,829
The idea is the attacker can't do it short

680
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,959
of subverting a very comp uh relatively secure process.

681
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:09,910
I'm gonna say like where you,

682
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,089
you have to go to a public note,

683
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:15,030
they basically validate that you own the trademark that you are on behalf of

684
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,290
the domain that you are allowed to be on behalf of the domain,

685
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,949
blah, blah, blah.

686
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,000
You know, we basically, they emailed the CEO and was like, can Kurt do this?

687
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,189
Yes, Kurt can do this. And then Kurt went to a public notary and

688
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,819
they looked up our trademark in the US patent office.

689
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:26,589
So

690
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,869
it costs about 1000 bucks a year. And that's basically what real validation costs

691
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:31,540
about

692
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,939
1000

693
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:32,219
a year.

694
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,300
So that's not gonna work for N PM Js.

695
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:34,729
No,

696
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:35,619
no, not at all.

697
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,369
But on the flip side

698
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,660
to actually Thomas and Carol

699
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:41,290
pointing out that some of these big companies, like,

700
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:42,770
maybe they should spend a few bucks.

701
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,119
I agree with that.

702
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,449
And that's the part of the conversation I I'm not willing to have right now,

703
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:49,329
but I do think we need to think about is

704
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:53,170
an enormous amount of big companies are just like free riding the crap that

705
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:53,859
source.

706
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,650
And that's,

707
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,770
they also don't really have an alternative because remember we talked about this

708
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,270
with the whole security and what can your company do for security?

709
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,839
Uh Remember with the German thing about what, 56 years ago, it's been a while.

710
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:05,770
They're just, they're like here like we're,

711
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,489
we're just gonna allocate some money to bug bounties

712
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,770
because that's legally what we can set up and do.

713
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,140
But yes, that's what they could do, but now there's the Sovereign Tech Fund. Right.

714
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,939
Well, and,

715
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,180
but it took half a decade to get there. It did, it took a long time.

716
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:22,390
So, I don't know, I need to think about this more. I just feel like

717
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:23,660
at the end of the day,

718
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,579
uh trust the

719
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,819
smart people, we're not the smart people.

720
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:28,150
And the other question is,

721
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,670
has anybody done any research at all asking people

722
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,430
what is their actual expectation of name spaces?

723
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:39,109
Like what do people think name spaces mean? Or do I doubt it? We just make this crap up.

724
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:39,989
I mean, let's face it.

725
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:41,319
It's all made up crap, right?

726
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:46,119
Because to me the name space Aws SDK, I would have gone with Amazon

727
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,579
or at Aws.

728
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:53,439
I don't know why they were with Aws SDK is they were probably the 700 meetings

729
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,280
to pick that name.

730
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:55,900
Like I just,

731
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,640
I look at this and I'm like trying to figure out

732
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,150
what is that here if go to the root of that?

733
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,329
Does that take me to a thing?

734
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:01,729
No.

735
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:04,959
So anyway, as much fun as this is to listen to Kurt navigate N PM,
