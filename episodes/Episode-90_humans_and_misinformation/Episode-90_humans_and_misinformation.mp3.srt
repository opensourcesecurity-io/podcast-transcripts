Hello and welcome to episode 90 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,199
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,270
I found the greatest story the other day

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,430
and,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,090
and this is actually sent to me by one of my cousins which

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,129
which makes it even funnier is so apparently during the season of Lent,

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,569
the number of computer virus installs or I guess attacks,

7
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,189
whatever you want to call it, um compromises compromised might be the best word

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,009
goes down by infections. There you go. I like,

9
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,119
maybe I don't, I don't know,

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,529
I don't think about this anymore. So it makes me happy.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,049
But anyway, the number of infections goes down drastically during Lent.

12
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,099
And do you know what the reasoning supposedly is?

13
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:48,060
No

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,909
that, that people are giving up looking at online porn during Lent,

15
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:53,900
which

16
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:59,330
like this website is totally dodgy and the story is incredibly questionable.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,380
But it's like, I don't even care.

18
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:02,459
Like I want to believe this because it's funny,

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,550
it's even better than that because I just Googled Lent

20
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,440
to see when it was and when it was until.

21
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:08,220
So it's for those of you though. Don

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:08,900
um

23
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,580
lent is a 40 day thing

24
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:15,610
-- where people give up stuff, I guess, like
-- 49 days,

25
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:18,059
you don't, you don't even have to give things up.

26
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,099
It's just according to tradition, you often

27
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:23,040
give something up as a way of, I don't know,

28
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,910
connecting spiritually or I've never totally understood like,

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,410
the whole giving thing up portion of it.

30
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:27,730
But

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,790
anyway, you kind of, it's common for people to give something up

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,519
and then it starts on Ash Wednesday and it

33
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:36,019
ends on Easter and it's actually like 49 days,

34
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,760
but they don't count Sundays and there's some weird technicalities.

35
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,989
Well, like, like, of course, it's not religion if it doesn't have technicalities,

36
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,190
right?

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,989
But here's the best part. So just googling the word Lent

38
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,559
top stories,

39
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,440
computer virus levels drop during Lent because

40
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:50,919
Catholics give up porn on the observer and

41
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,319
giving up porn for Lent may have caused 17% drop in computer viruses on Newsweek.

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,970
-- So I'm calling it then. This is totally
-- true. It must be. I mean, Newsweek is re

43
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,639
reporting it.

44
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,260
Well, actually this is funny because this is,

45
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,519
I, I saw a news story once

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,380
and, and I'll, I'll see if I can dig this up and put it in the show notes.

47
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,570
But it was basically

48
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,320
somebody updated Wikipedia with a lie about somebody else

49
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,160
referencing an article

50
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,440
that the article then referenced Wikipedia

51
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,279
crazy circular reference.

52
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,419
And it's like,

53
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,570
that's,

54
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,179
that's kind of funny,

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,460
but it also makes you think like when something seems super crazy,

56
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:32,289
it's good to find maybe more than one source and I have a suspicion.

57
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,580
-- This story has one source.
-- The problem is that

58
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:37,830
journalism used to be about fact checking and confirming, you know,

59
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,679
and they would say

60
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,339
we were able to confirm with sources or anonymous sources

61
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,029
or we were not able to confirm with sources,

62
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,130
you know, or it is reported that, you know, when they, it was like second hand

63
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:53,500
and kind of all that has been thrown out now because, you know, everybody's like

64
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,449
basically all the online media, you're looking at 15 minute deadlines

65
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:02,139
because if somebody beats you by 15 minutes and gets that on Twitter,

66
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,759
you get zero traffic and you starve that month.

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,850
It really is that simple. Like when I worked, this is 20 years ago, mind you,

68
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,190
but back when I work for Security portal.com,

69
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,710
you know, I got the hang of how to get something slash dotted,

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,009
like how to write a headline and how to write an article

71
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:21,220
so that it would go on slash dot We'd get over 100,000 views.

72
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:26,000
And back then that was essentially, you know, that would be over $1000 in revenue

73
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,880
easily,

74
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,259
you know. So you can, I mean, II I

75
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,009
didn't write anything that was factually incorrect, but I may have, you know,

76
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,669
dressed, I may have, what's the phrase?

77
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:38,410
Sex it up a bit, you know,

78
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,320
maybe, you know, made it a little more interesting

79
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:44,800
and I, I did do a really good job once we got death threats, actually.

80
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,820
Um,

81
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,009
Clickbait today. Right.

82
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,410
You

83
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,490
wait, how did you get a death threat?

84
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,839
-- Writing an article about S si
-- essentially titled at the end of SSL and SSH.

85
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,139
And it was, uh, it was with respect to Doug, you remember Doug songs? Uh D

86
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:00,720
sniff

87
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,100
way back in the day.

88
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,809
So, yeah, folks go on Wikipedia. This is ancient history.

89
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:06,710
But, uh, yeah.

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,630
No, I mean, I mean, essentially, yeah, I got the hang of Clickbait articles and

91
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:14,050
I mean, yeah, some of those articles generated a lot of revenue for us.

92
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,769
-- That's awesome. It's nice to know nothing's changed.
-- No, absolutely not.

93
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:20,089
If anything, it's gotten much, much worse

94
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,570
or, or maybe you were, you were a pioneer,

95
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,010
right? You're the reason the world is bad now.

96
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:25,910
Like,

97
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,559
at least

98
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,850
I didn't send the first spam

99
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:29,250
and,

100
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,100
and Siegelman.

101
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,359
Oh, my goodness. Yes. Yes. Yes. So, so anyway, I guess

102
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,450
this story actually and the fact that we have a suspicion it's fake,

103
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:40,559
even though I don't care.

104
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,320
And I love it

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,200
kind of ties into the topic we were thinking of today is just kind of

106
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,700
hacking people,

107
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:47,519
right?

108
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,079
-- Which is kind of becoming a thing. Well, it's been a thing for thousands of years
-- but

109
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:53,799
people have always been hackable.

110
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:57,739
I mean, essentially fraud is, is a form of hacking people, right? You know,

111
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,660
but what's really interesting to me now, is this, it's,

112
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,040
it used to be like in the old days, if you wanted to hack a computer,

113
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,299
you had to go to that computer and hack it.

114
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:05,880
Now everything's attached to the internet.

115
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,600
And,

116
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,040
well, so is everybody,

117
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:11,839
everybody's attached to the internet in the form of we read online news,

118
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,779
Facebook news, cnn.com, whatever.

119
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,940
Not even that man.

120
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,089
Just you've got email and,

121
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,739
and Twitter and Facebook and like there's millions of ways to contact a person.

122
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,489
And in fact, I saw a message the other day,

123
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,570
I don't even remember where this came from,

124
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:30,049
which again is funny because I don't even know where I get some of this news.

125
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:34,269
It, it just goes in one hour and probably falls on the floor. But, but anyway, uh

126
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,119
there was a new malware that was basically looking at your email inbox,

127
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,510
finding a thread

128
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,149
and replying to threads with

129
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,019
malicious documents attached.

130
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:46,359
Right?

131
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:48,049
I bet they click through

132
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,809
sky high. Right.

133
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:52,160
Yeah, here's that PDF you asked for.

134
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,820
I literally don't remember what you're talking about.

135
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,440
I better open this up and see what it is.

136
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,329
Right. Exactly.

137
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:58,820
And depending upon who it comes from,

138
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:02,339
like there's obviously certain people I work with that if they send me a PDF,

139
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,859
like I'm just gonna look at it because I would assume

140
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:08,779
-- it's important if they're sending it to me in the middle of the thread.
-- Right.

141
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,480
That's brilliant.

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,820
And that's the problem. Right. Is like, you know,

143
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,649
again, it used to be that, you know, various levels of

144
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,739
information, kind of had various levels of reputation attached to them.

145
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,190
You know, that thing the Wall Street Journal says,

146
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,100
versus that thing your uncle says.

147
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:24,820
Yes. Yes,

148
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,619
-- I do not believe anything my uncle tells me,
-- but now that distinction is gone

149
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,619
and, and Right. Right. Right.

150
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,730
And, and my uncle has a platform because he's on Facebook

151
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,339
and,

152
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,399
right, his,

153
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:39,399
his crazy friends, like the things he put there

154
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,130
and

155
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:42,769
-- it's
-- great. Yeah. And that's the other thing too is it, it's, it's,

156
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,000
there's so much media available now. We can actually pick and choose.

157
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,160
Like I remember growing up, right, our, our newspaper,

158
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,959
like our town Edmonton had basically two newspapers with the Edmonton Journal

159
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,220
and the Edmonton Sun

160
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,700
one, you know, the Edmonton.

161
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,130
So was the one with the, uh the Sunshine Girl on page, whatever.

162
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:02,100
Um The Edmonton Journal was a little bit more highbrow.

163
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:02,600
And then, oh,

164
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,679
obviously you could get like the National Post if

165
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,869
you wanted like kind of a real newspaper.

166
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,549
Um But fundamentally you had those

167
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,559
three print news sources.

168
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:16,640
Uh And then, you know, we had what, three or four over the air channels,

169
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,459
two or three of them had news programming, one of which was the CBC,

170
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,089
the Canadian Broadcast Corporation which,

171
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:26,910
you know, as, as boring stable news organizations goes right up there.

172
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,089
And so, you know, essentially all the information you could get in

173
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,850
print or on the TV was,

174
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,730
you know, it came from very large organizations that generally,

175
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,220
uh, did their job reasonably well.

176
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,609
I mean, granted they had agendas like selling your eyeball to advertisers

177
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:44,399
but,

178
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,940
-- you know, they weren't, like, all owned by Rupert Murdoch back in the day.
-- Right.

179
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,500
Right. Right. And let's, let's tie this into

180
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,119
the, I guess the big story is Guccifer.

181
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,320
Right. Turns out we know who Guccifer is and, and shockingly

182
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:02,989
he's a Russian

183
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,480
-- or she, I should
-- say,

184
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,359
I mean, to be clear when that lone DNC hacker,

185
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,010
it was pretty clear to me it was like 90 let's

186
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:17,589
say 98% chance of being like a Russian state level actor,

187
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,739
-- I think with, with a 2% margin with
-- a 2% margin of error being some like maybe whack a

188
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,390
dod old conservatives in America who are competent,

189
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,920
you know, who wanted to embarrass the DNC?

190
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:33,739
I, I question, I question if, if the statement you just made.

191
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:34,840
But, um,

192
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,619
so, and I mean, this is a perfect example of, you know,

193
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:42,260
when this person or entity supposedly hacked the DNC and started

194
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,859
releasing those emails and embarrassing the hell out of them.

195
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,960
Ok. Well, why would somebody do that?

196
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:50,000
Because, you know, they believe in truth and justice in the American way.

197
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,059
Probably not so much.

198
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,520
Did they want to, like, hurt the Democratic Party? Yeah, clearly,

199
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,070
I, I always viewed it as kind of a Chaos Party

200
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,859
platform

201
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,950
where you can, you can kind of argue that with Wikileaks

202
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,669
where Wikileaks loves to release all this information

203
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,000
-- is, don't get me
-- wrong. I'm

204
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,869
right. Exactly. Ok. That's fair. Yeah, that's better than chaos, probably. But.

205
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Right. Right. It's not that they even have a specific intent necessarily.

206
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,030
-- It's just
-- let's destabilize these Western democracies and weaken them.

207
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,419
Like, look at how much,

208
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,469
I mean, God bless America,

209
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,190
but look at how much time you guys have fucked

210
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,820
around now with your government basically being somewhat broken.

211
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:29,950
You've had a government shutdown.

212
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,989
You've had,

213
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,340
have you guys really passed any meaningful

214
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:35,830
legislation moved forwards on anything of substance?

215
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,929
-- The answer is not really.
-- I think we have trade tariffs.

216
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,539
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

217
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,400
OK. True. No, the trade tariffs. That's a thing.

218
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,119
Not a good thing. Mind you, but

219
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,280
um just ignore what every single economist has ever said

220
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,960
in the last 50 years.

221
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:52,169
Um

222
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,049
But yeah, I mean, this is my point, right.

223
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,809
There's, there's countries out there that really don't have a lot to lose.

224
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,150
Like I was looking up Russian

225
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,799
economic stats and like

226
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,669
their biggest trading partner partner is the Netherlands.

227
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,950
It's Bonkers, their, their, their exports is like,

228
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:08,849
yeah, it just,

229
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,989
yeah. No, it's

230
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,750
uh they really don't have anything to lose

231
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,880
by destabilizing Western democracies and the world economy.

232
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,150
And

233
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,739
when you look at what the cost of it is to have, you know,

234
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,549
a couple of foreign intelligence officers

235
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,950
a million bucks a year, maybe 2 million bucks a year.

236
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,900
The damage they've done is, is a lot more than that.

237
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,010
Sure. No. And, and I guess that that ties into the overall theme then of

238
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,250
humans are incredibly gullible and, and let's face it, the

239
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,309
something,

240
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,030
something I've been thinking about and I've started writing

241
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,349
a blog post about this to a degree is

242
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,669
the, all the misinformation that we see these days

243
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,229
and the way things are going is uh I would

244
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:51,229
compare it to like a security exploit against social media,

245
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:51,830
right?

246
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,590
Where you're leveraging,

247
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:56,789
you're basically taking a platform that is expected to operate in a certain way

248
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,520
and you are are making it do something it was never intended to do,

249
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,159
which is basically how like security exploits work, right?

250
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,039
Where you make an application do something it's not supposed to do

251
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,919
fundamentally, any system

252
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,599
can be gamed.

253
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:09,989
Now,

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,760
the question is whether or not gaming it gets you some advantage and you want to do it.

255
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,710
I mean, a perfect example of this is,

256
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:21,200
I mean, you could go around breaking uh the windows at bus stops, you know,

257
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,140
bus stops that have those glass panes so you can stand out of the cold in the wind

258
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,090
and you could go around breaking them right

259
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,000
now. Most people don't do that because they're not jerks

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,570
fundamentally, right? Because there's, you don't really gain anything from that.

261
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,919
I mean, maybe unless you're the guy that provides the replacement windows.

262
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,710
Um, but, you know,

263
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:40,919
locally we had somebody doing that a few years ago,

264
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:43,400
they broke something like 40 or 50 bus stop

265
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,929
of these windows and, you know, they're quite expensive.

266
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:48,750
And luckily most people don't go on social media and

267
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,669
try to destabilize, you know, the world with

268
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:53,669
wonky news or made up news.

269
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,909
But for some people there is that motivation

270
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,489
and, yeah, we don't have good ways to deal with it.

271
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,419
Not at all.

272
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,059
But, but I, I guess my point is

273
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,059
that

274
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,299
there are accepted norms in any society

275
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,169
and anytime someone steps outside of those norms,

276
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:16,859
it, society often struggles to deal with them correctly. And

277
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,659
a great example is like you, people stand in line for something.

278
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:23,059
If someone runs to the front of the line and just stands there,

279
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,049
how often do is everyone just like, wow, that guy's a jerk and that's the end of it,

280
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:27,260
right?

281
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,750
It's not like there's, there's hard and fast rules that say don't do this.

282
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,510
You know, there's, there's the law

283
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,479
that if you break it, you have to deal with police and authorities and,

284
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,369
and possibly fines or prison.

285
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:41,849
And then there's like the rules of society. And that's something that

286
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:43,530
I, I think

287
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:48,200
we don't do, we don't know what to do when someone violates a lot of these norms.

288
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,210
And I think when we look at something like social media, especially,

289
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:57,419
we, we lack the ability to comprehend that even the norms are being violated. Right.

290
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:57,840
It's like you,

291
00:12:57,849 --> 00:13:01,210
you're hacking people because people don't even know they're being hacked,

292
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,359
which is crazy.

293
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:06,859
Well, I mean, I see people sharing these stories that are clearly false or,

294
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,000
you know, driven by some crazy agenda

295
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:09,520
or,

296
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,960
or my favorite now is how many magazines have stuff that is very

297
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:18,109
subtly labeled as advertising but looks like the actual content of the magazine.

298
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:20,729
Oh,

299
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,780
my goodness. Nothing drives me crazier than that.

300
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:28,369
Yeah. No, it's, um,

301
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:31,650
it's worrying to me because I'm, I'm, you know,

302
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:34,900
I'm finding I'm really having to pay attention to what I'm reading and consuming.

303
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,210
You know, is this true? Is there an agenda behind this?

304
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:40,400
I mean, sometimes there clearly is like a great example is that, you know,

305
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:41,450
if I'm going to get married,

306
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,609
I really should be spending three months of my salary on a diamond ring.

307
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:45,669
Ok.

308
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,150
Well, clearly de beers has an agenda and what's really fascinating is,

309
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,250
and I've noticed this on the radio.

310
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,369
Somebody was commenting about this.

311
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,130
I remember when the radio ads

312
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,210
started and they were sort of against these manufactured diamonds.

313
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,849
Essentially the biggest diamond store locally was like, you know,

314
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,299
are we buy diamonds, blah, blah, blah, you know,

315
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,500
they're not like those fake diamonds that you make

316
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,969
and are not real diamonds pulled from the earth,

317
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:08,770
blah, blah, blah.

318
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,260
And now a few years later they're like, our

319
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,479
artisanal diamonds are better. They're like 25% bigger than the regular diamonds.

320
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,390
And somebody pointed out that essentially China is

321
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,559
manufacturing the bejesus out of these things,

322
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,049
selling them at quite a bit cheaper than the beers will sell you a diamond wholesale.

323
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,000
And so, yeah,

324
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:28,020
the jewelry stores are like, well, screw that we're on board with making more money.

325
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:29,770
Well, and not only that, I,

326
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,239
I read that de Beers is paying quite a lot of money right

327
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,099
now to researchers trying to figure out how can we identify these,

328
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,140
essentially lab made diamonds and they can't,

329
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,299
they're, they're so good, they can't figure it out, which is

330
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:44,809
hilarious.

331
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,940
Like,

332
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,359
well, the funny thing is actually that's,

333
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:48,809
that's one of the ways you can tell it's

334
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,760
a fake diamond is if there's no inclusions or flaws

335
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,780
because natural diamonds have, you know, impurities and stuff.

336
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,880
So, yeah, you can do that in the lab too.

337
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:57,840
Um,

338
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,059
I know in Canada there's like these diamonds you get and they have like a

339
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,280
little polar bear laser cut on them and I think it's a trademark thing.

340
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:05,349
That's how they enforce it,

341
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,750
you know, and so it's like, you know,

342
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,760
that these are good Canadian diamonds that didn't involve, you know, little

343
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:14,099
Children being used to mine them or sweatshops grinding them or whatever.

344
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,469
But, I mean, fundamentally, you know,

345
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm supposed to spend three months of my salary on this stupid diamond ring.

346
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,280
Uh, yeah. Ok. It's pretty clear who and why

347
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,299
they have that agenda, you know.

348
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,900
But I mean, here's a great one, right? Like you stated on,

349
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,530
well,

350
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,619
you've privately stated on many occasions that you have

351
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,609
some very strict rules around uh foods and when,

352
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:32,679
and how you consume them.

353
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,080
Right?

354
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:34,119
Wait, do I,

355
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,739
which, which, which rules are those like?

356
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,210
Well, so for example, breakfast foods are for breakfast, not for dinner.

357
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:44,599
Uh Yes. No, that, that's just, I'm, I'm, I consider myself a crazy person.

358
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,609
Yeah, like bacon and eggs. Breakfast only, no questions asked.

359
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,229
Exactly. And well, why, why, why is it a breakfast only food?

360
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:51,510
I,

361
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,169
I assume I suffered some sort of traumatic

362
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:56,609
event involving breakfast food as a child at

363
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,090
maybe at lunchtime.

364
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,289
-- No,
-- it's just, that's how, that's, uh, that was marketed by some, uh, hang on a sec.

365
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:02,650
Um,

366
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,700
I, I blame my school cafeteria.

367
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,619
Actually, they used to serve breakfast for lunch and it was like abysmally bad.

368
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,510
And so now when I think of breakfast for lunch,

369
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,340
I immediately think of my school's cafeteria and like the terrible bacon

370
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:18,650
and the awful eggs.

371
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,479
Yeah, like the eggs you could have bunch the eggs on the ground, dude,

372
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:22,340
they were terrible.

373
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,460
So that's my suspicion as to why I feel this way.

374
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,539
Anyways, um,

375
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:29,140
Bernays got a doctor to agree that a protein rich heavy

376
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,640
breakfast of bacon and eggs was healthier than a light breakfast.

377
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,619
And then sent that statement to around 5000 doctors for their signatures he then got

378
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,940
newspapers to publish the results of his petition as it was a scientific study,

379
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,400
explains Carol that brought bacon and eggs back into fashion and added more weight

380
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:46,179
to the idea that breakfast was not only very important but medically recommended.

381
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:48,630
So essentially it was the egg and bacon.

382
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:51,559
Ok, let's start here. Uh,

383
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,580
first of all, breakfast is the dumbest meal of the day,

384
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,840
but I love bacon and eggs. So,

385
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,419
so I eat them. They are fantastic. There's nothing pleases me more.

386
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,409
Actually, that's one of the things,

387
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,069
one of my favorite things to do is I get up early on Saturday and

388
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,709
I cook like this massive breakfast with bacon and eggs and hash brown potatoes and,

389
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:08,979
-- oh,
-- you're

390
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:10,770
-- like
-- one of those people in the movies where it's like,

391
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,160
who the hell has time to make?

392
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:12,368
Like,

393
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,089
-- because
-- I get up really early

394
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,979
and then the kids grab a piece of toast on

395
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:19,689
everyone's, this is on Saturday mornings when we have nothing to do.

396
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,130
I will do this and I'll cook for like two hours

397
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:27,058
and it, I love it because at the end I get this marvelous breakfast and then, yeah, we,

398
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:29,639
we all eat it together and stuff, but again, only if there's nothing to do,

399
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,619
which is pretty rare.

400
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:31,499
Uh,

401
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:33,779
but anyway, no, no, I, I totally get that.

402
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:37,098
And that's something similar happened with, with, I think it was sugar.

403
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:38,058
Where,

404
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:39,250
where some,

405
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,949
what was it like the sugar industry paid off some

406
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,410
doctors to talk about how bad for you fats were,

407
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,969
but like, sugar is fine.

408
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,810
No, you're wrong too.

409
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,770
And so, like, in all seriousness, I, I take, you know,

410
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,660
this is a good point and this totally ties into our,

411
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,849
our conversation here is the fact that

412
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,930
I it's even difficult to trust certain medical advice because like,

413
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,290
where did it come from?

414
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,770
Right.

415
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:02,400
Well,

416
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,010
remember when cholesterol was good for you and then it was bad for you and

417
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,250
then certain types were good for you and certain types were bad for you.

418
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:08,569
I,

419
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,239
I

420
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,680
forget I, I just know that I'm not supposed to eat so much like schmaltz.

421
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,050
It's like rendered bacon fat

422
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:17,680
like that

423
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:21,359
on toast. It's delicious with a little cracked salt and a little cracked pepper.

424
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:25,290
You, you, you smear bacon fat on toast. That does sound nice.

425
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,849
Rendered bacon fat. It's like a spread.

426
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,180
It's basically bacon,

427
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:29,510
I

428
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,209
think crystal. But

429
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:31,500
out

430
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:31,900
of pigs,

431
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,050
-- that sounds delicious.
-- It's also good for,

432
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,329
I actually, I like to fry my eggs in bacon fat where I cook the bacon first

433
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,849
and then I take all the fat and I use that

434
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,369
to cook the eggs which makes the eggs way better.

435
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,290
Of course better for me. Maybe not. But

436
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,650
man, they're so delicious.

437
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,239
You can, you can go wrong with bacon fat.

438
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,109
Oh, I'll be danged. Uh Apparently our body also makes cholesterol.

439
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,400
Nothing surprises me. Right.

440
00:18:58,689 --> 00:18:59,380
Your liver

441
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,800
So, yeah, we still, we're still on good versus bad.

442
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:03,199
So it seems we

443
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:03,810
out

444
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,199
on that.

445
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,430
But

446
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:04,949
I guess

447
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,109
here's the point and, and here's the craziness and all this with, with all,

448
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,199
like the online fake news

449
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,119
and online real news and, and what's true,

450
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,729
what's false and this is even true in the world of security.

451
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:16,859
Like,

452
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:20,040
remember when we thought changing your password every 30 days was more secure.

453
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:21,170
Right.

454
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:21,500
It,

455
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,219
it's so hard to figure out what is right and what

456
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:27,449
is wrong and who to trust and who not to trust.

457
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:31,469
And, and I feel like I see this more and more especially in the world of security where

458
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,800
where people hand out advice and it's like that is terrible advice. And

459
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,530
well, part of the problem too is a lot of this advice is not

460
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,089
general in the sense of, for example, are firewalls good or bad.

461
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,410
Well, depending on how your network

462
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:47,479
is configured in what it is,

463
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,180
they can be very good or they can be very bad. But for example,

464
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,180
um, you know, I deal with cloud security lines, we don't have any physical servers

465
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,250
to the best of my knowledge.

466
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,000
We have a office with a bunch of like half a dozen people in it.

467
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,780
It's all bring your own device, everything we use is in the cloud.

468
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,479
So are firewalls of any use to us.

469
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:08,520
And the answer is, well, traditional firewalls, absolutely not.

470
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,869
Um, like a firewall running on the host, like the built in, you know, your phone,

471
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,079
your laptop, whatever.

472
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,839
Sure. Yeah. Like whatever the default, you know, windows or Apple thing is.

473
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,270
But, you know,

474
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,640
am I going to go out and purchase some Cisco adaptive threat intelligence firewall?

475
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,680
Absolutely not.

476
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,209
Right. Because what would I do with it?

477
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,099
No, I, I get it, you know.

478
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,050
But is that, is that good advice for a university with a large campus land? Oh, yeah.

479
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,560
Yes,

480
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,589
you

481
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,400
damn well better have one of those things,

482
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,390
you know. Otherwise Lord only knows what you

483
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:37,280
-- do,
-- you know.

484
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:37,839
I read,

485
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,949
I read a news story the other day that some university installed a bunch

486
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:44,699
of ad blockers in their computers and their bandwidth went down by 40%.

487
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:45,630
I

488
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,469
can believe

489
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:46,800
that

490
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:49,079
it's crazy

491
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,839
even worse now, crypto mining,

492
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,770
-- right?
-- All those sites that run javascript to crypto mind in your browser, which is,

493
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,640
it's got to be the most inefficient way to crypto mine ever.

494
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,800
But hey, it's, it's free from the attacker's point of view basically.

495
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:02,920
Um

496
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:06,400
So, I mean, I, I imagine that would even have an impact on your electricity bill

497
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,280
potentially, you know, half a percent, which would add up.

498
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,109
Definitely

499
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,719
-- just see I making up numbers.
-- They're true.

500
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,040
Right.

501
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,050
And yeah,

502
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,390
that's, that's why this is so hard, man. I mean,

503
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,949
how do you, how do you decide what's right or wrong?

504
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,949
And, and I guess even from our perspective,

505
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,829
one of the challenges you run into is

506
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,849
it is difficult sometimes to have a coherent conversation

507
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:36,770
in a manner people can understand. And my example is gonna be password advice.

508
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,670
There is I'll put a link on Twitter where

509
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,109
uh there was some VPN provider that, that tweeted this advice of like here.

510
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,089
So you should create passwords and the advice is terrible. It is, it is awful advice.

511
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:49,880
And then they of course,

512
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,130
like pinged a whole bunch of important Twitter people to like, oh,

513
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,939
look what we did and they're getting tore up as they should,

514
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,839
right. Which is funny. That's, that's great. They haven't taken the tweet down yet.

515
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:00,400
I took a screenshot of it just in case.

516
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:04,650
But, but anyway, anyway, here's the thing though. II I replied and I was like,

517
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,469
so

518
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,560
I know this advice is wrong and it's bad.

519
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:09,520
But

520
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,430
like, like, what can we say? That's correct? Easy to understand.

521
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:16,400
It actually has some truth behind it.

522
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,199
Not just like crap I think is correct and that doesn't exist.

523
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,430
Well, it's, it's hard because it's like, it's,

524
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:24,219
I mean,

525
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,770
the problem too is sometimes uh health is a great example.

526
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,780
I'll give you two really solid pieces of health advice that are almost always true.

527
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,750
Number one, reduce your calorie intake. Number two, get some more exercise,

528
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:35,660
right?

529
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,010
But those things are so generic

530
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,900
as to be not super useful

531
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,000
because quite frankly,

532
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,020
if you could just cut your calorie intake by 10% you would have done it by now.

533
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,989
You know, it's like those people, like, well, and I'm one of those people.

534
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,300
Unfortunately, it's like, how did you quit smoking?

535
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,099
Well, I just quit one day and it didn't bother me. Sorry.

536
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:54,459
Like, I,

537
00:22:54,469 --> 00:22:56,400
I almost feel guilty about how easy it was for me

538
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,500
to quit smoking and I have no cravings and I'm like,

539
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,780
I, I'm really sorry for all you people that do

540
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:04,819
work really hard at this and fail horribly at quitting smoking

541
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,760
because, yeah, for some people it's just not easy.

542
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,540
And, you know, security is the same way. I mean, it's,

543
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,540
it's one thing for me to be like, yeah, we have no servers, we have no land,

544
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,489
we have nothing like that.

545
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,140
So, like, I get to ignore a whole pile of problems

546
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:19,130
that's not going to happen for a fortune 500 company

547
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,900
or anyone who has infrastructure more than five years old. Right.

548
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:23,640
Yeah.

549
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,229
No, I, I get

550
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,869
it, but more importantly is,

551
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,510
I think this is one of the reasons that the security industry.

552
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,790
I, I would say, like, like in all seriousness hasn't really

553
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:37,599
-- moved forward drastically and
-- we

554
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:38,189
have

555
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,630
no, we don't. That's the thing, like you can say, all right, use a password manager

556
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,060
and I agree with that. Like, password managers are great.

557
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:48,310
You could say use a firewall except, oh, wait, that advice doesn't work anymore.

558
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:49,500
Right. You've got,

559
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:51,479
well, it's, or it's of this type of, you know,

560
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:54,130
use the firewall that's built into your operating system and enable.

561
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,630
I guess the more advice is don't turn off the firewall if it comes with one enabled.

562
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,170
Sure.

563
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,729
In other words, don't go out of your way to, like, don't leave your spare tire at home.

564
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:06,310
I mean, most manufacturers now are trying to do a, you know,

565
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,000
a much better job on their software.

566
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,949
Well, the operating system vendors, not, uh, not so much like the IOT but

567
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,949
I, I don't, yeah, use a, use a password manager and,

568
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:18,780
and I would actually tell people to install an ad blocker for two reasons.

569
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,349
Number one,

570
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,069
that the web will just load faster and look less ugly.

571
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,339
And number two is it will reduce the chance of like getting a virus or a drive by

572
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,969
download

573
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,489
and more to the point using an ad blocker has a,

574
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,369
there's hopefully less negative effects.

575
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,729
There actually is the positive effect of

576
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,489
like every time I use somebody else's computer

577
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:39,800
or something. I see the web with ads. It's just like, oh my God, this is, this is,

578
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,400
it's so bad, man. It's so bad,

579
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:43,250
you know.

580
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,209
So, yeah, folks go out there if you love your relatives and family,

581
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,530
go put ad blockers on their computers, please.

582
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:50,209
And,

583
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:54,050
but here's the thing like password manager and ad blocker

584
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:56,829
that's good for consumers.

585
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:59,310
But that doesn't solve that. That's like

586
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:01,280
a small slice of,

587
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,319
of the bigger problems.

588
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:04,670
Right, like the, the,

589
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,280
the new GDPR regulations coming in effect in a few months here and like, yeah,

590
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,189
as a Fortune 500 company, what do you do?

591
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,010
Well, you've got

592
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,430
not just technical debt but it's like, oh my God,

593
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:15,229
where do we actually have people's information?

594
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,260
Like, probably,

595
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:20,025
yeah, it's, it's gonna be crazy with, with, you

596
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:20,454
know,

597
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:24,844
like a great example of this is something we ran into as a recommendation is,

598
00:25:24,885 --> 00:25:27,415
you know, the the marketing guys would send me badge scans,

599
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,375
uh spreadsheets of these badge scans from conventions, you know,

600
00:25:30,385 --> 00:25:32,594
and it's like the person's name and email address and crap

601
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,885
to add to, you know, the the mailing list

602
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:38,364
and well, yeah, I don't need that. I just need the email addresses.

603
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,050
So under GDPR that's,

604
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:42,869
you know, it's not illegal per se, but it's the best practice to like

605
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:46,199
only give me the information. I actually need to do my job. Oh, ok.

606
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:46,979
No, that makes sense.

607
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:47,660
But

608
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,579
that's not

609
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,839
an easy thing to necessarily do because now you have to

610
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,680
map out all your information flows and who needs exactly what

611
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,270
and you know, we're back to that least privileged thing but to do least privilege,

612
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,979
you actually have to

613
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,969
like map everything out and really know what you're

614
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:01,819
doing and then do it and enforce it.

615
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,109
Well, in, in this is totally like the eat less calories advice,

616
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,500
like least privilege is really easy to say, but nobody knows what that means.

617
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,359
Just like saying, eat less food.

618
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:13,880
That doesn't mean anything.

619
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,719
I've, I've done least privilege a number of times and then discovered, oh,

620
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:17,819
backups failed.

621
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:18,920
Kind of important.

622
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,349
You know, if I have to pick between least privilege and having backups,

623
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:24,199
even as a security guy, I'm gonna pick backups.

624
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,319
Oh, totally, man. And there's, uh, it's just,

625
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:30,849
this is the thing that I guess annoys me about security is

626
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:34,069
I feel like this is a sign of the immaturity in our industry

627
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:38,849
-- that it, it, there's so many if, but if, but if, but
-- if

628
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,150
I,

629
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,540
I would say it's a combination of immaturity but also

630
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,050
a combination of how fast and how far we're going,

631
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,719
like look at cloud or, well,

632
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:51,479
a better smartphones 1012 years ago they did not exist cloud 67 years ago,

633
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:52,780
did not really exist

634
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,810
and now everybody has them,

635
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,650
you know, I wonder how did, how did we live before? Smartphones?

636
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,089
Like filthy savages.

637
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:05,119
Seriously, man. I mean, I think about, I was just on a trip recently

638
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,369
and I, I have no maps. I have no plane tickets. I have nothing.

639
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,319
And I remember before I'd go on a trip,

640
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,459
I'd print out my maps and I print out my plane tickets and I'd have, you know,

641
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:17,010
information about the hotel just in case they lost it.

642
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,430
And like,

643
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,750
I've got like three apps now and everything's in there. It's crazy.

644
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:21,510
I love it.

645
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,680
Yeah. The cloud has basically gone from zero to,

646
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,280
you know, if you're building a data center,

647
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,119
you better have a really specific reason for doing that as opposed to just

648
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,869
don't, don't build the data center.

649
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,099
Now, let me, let me move this conversation

650
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,479
back towards where it, where it started was.

651
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,569
Do you think the problem with our inability to get security?

652
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:46,270
Right is more because the people doing it come from

653
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,020
a different universe than the one we live in today.

654
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,579
Whereas you think young people are going to

655
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:56,250
have less trouble adapting and understanding these problems and solving them

656
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,010
than we necessarily do because

657
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:01,089
like we grew up running M sds on a computer.

658
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:05,839
Yes and no because my Children are going to grow up with augmented reality glasses.

659
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,250
What is, I mean,

660
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,089
you want to talk about privacy implications every time you look at somebody's face,

661
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,030
it pulls up their Facebook profile and tells you a whole bunch of stuff, right?

662
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,069
Like just the security problems we have like, I'm,

663
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,329
I'm not even thinking about like buffer overflows and remote code execution.

664
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:22,300
I'm talking about like,

665
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:23,530
you know,

666
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,140
you try to walk into a restaurant and they

667
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,319
refuse you service because like six months ago,

668
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:30,699
you left a negative review over a similar restaurant

669
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:33,849
and didn't black mirror covered this, right?

670
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,420
And in China they're now executing it.

671
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:39,589
Yeah, that's right because they've got your social score or

672
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:40,050
whatever

673
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:40,479
because

674
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:43,410
you said, you know, we were talking about this and, like, let's face it all secretly,

675
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,800
you know, somebody who's really disgusting or route on a plane.

676
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,930
Would we love to kick them off that plane and ban them from plane travel for a year?

677
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,420
Oh, my goodness. Yes,

678
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:50,959
absolutely.

679
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:54,729
But, but here's, so, here's the problem with this though

680
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,650
and, and

681
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:59,800
like, the part of me says, if you're a bad person and I don't like, you,

682
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:02,810
uh, get off my train, whatever, right?

683
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:03,650
However,

684
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,790
who decides what's good or bad

685
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,829
and see the worst thing is it doesn't necessarily have to even have that value.

686
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,979
It could just be we start attaching facts to people that then you can see, oh,

687
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:15,380
this person likes dogs.

688
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:18,449
Oh, this person is a smoker. Oh, this person

689
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,689
drinks, oh, this person eats meat

690
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,609
and for some people those are terrible things.

691
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:28,959
Yes. And, and I guess this is where we come back to the conversation of

692
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,140
in a free society.

693
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,849
The negatives far outweigh

694
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:38,410
or I'm sorry, the positives far outweigh the negatives even though in, in this,

695
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,819
this goes back to the very beginning

696
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:41,989
of our conversation about like hacking humanity

697
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:42,829
that

698
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,930
there are people who abuse the system and

699
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:48,329
there will always be people who abuse the system

700
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:52,189
but the benefits gained from existing in,

701
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:55,709
in the manner that people can abuse the system I think are,

702
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:58,310
are they tip the scales so far

703
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,729
that trying to lock some of this stuff down and trying to avoid it

704
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,709
isn't worth it.

705
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:06,969
However, I will say that I feel like in the world of online social media,

706
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:10,329
the scales aren't tipped as far,

707
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:15,339
necessitating the freedom that we enjoy. And I feel like we have to figure it out.

708
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:17,510
-- Well,
-- we're at the point where it's threatening democracy.

709
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:18,050
Yes.

710
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,930
Yes, that is very true.

711
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:21,770
And people's mental health, right.

712
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,329
They've done some studies and basically not super surprising

713
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,500
all the teenagers and indeed,

714
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,329
a lot of the people who spend a lot of time on social media are kind of miserable.

715
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,099
Now, we don't know about the causation factor.

716
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:37,729
Maybe it's people who are miserable are more drawn to social media

717
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:40,689
or, you know, so one theory I read was that essentially,

718
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:43,410
you know, you go on Facebook, you see the Facebook feed,

719
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,530
you see everybody else doing amazing stuff like all the time

720
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,790
and you feel inadequate, you know, kind of like if you watch TV, and watch, you know,

721
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,069
TV, families, they have,

722
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:52,459
you know,

723
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:54,790
they both work two low income jobs and they have this huge house

724
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,050
because you need to have a really big house on a TV.

725
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,449
Sitcom for the camera crew to move around in. Right? Like,

726
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,839
like the first time I watched the big bang theory, I'm like,

727
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:03,359
how does that waitress afford that apartment?

728
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:06,900
That is like, basically big enough to park a car in,

729
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,750
you know, every single room.

730
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:09,430
No.

731
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:12,410
And anyways, yeah, we don't know about the causation and that's part of the problem.

732
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:12,680
But

733
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:16,454
the reality is though, is, is, yeah, we've crossed the Rubicon, like,

734
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:17,175
oh,

735
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:18,285
all these people are going to drop

736
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:19,915
Facebook because of all the privacy implications.

737
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:23,375
Yeah. Even if, like, 10% did, even if 10% it wouldn't matter.

738
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:25,905
No, it isn't going to happen. Let's face it.

739
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:29,944
I mean, as much as I'd love to see Facebook get a, get a good punch in the gut.

740
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:30,935
They, they won't.

741
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,494
Facebook will at some point.

742
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:38,045
But it'll be, you know, people will move to a r augmented reality space or, you know?

743
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,574
Yeah. You remember when myspace was the big thing?

744
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:41,895
Yeah. Not anymore.

745
00:31:42,354 --> 00:31:43,515
Is it even hang on a second.

746
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,900
It, it still exists

747
00:31:47,729 --> 00:31:48,949
and it was actually,

748
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,750
it was, it was glorious. I was,

749
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:53,550
I was on a fishing trip recently.

750
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,680
We were, we were fishing on a lake and, and the guy, the, the captain says,

751
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,680
hey, here, I'll take your picture for myspace and we all laughed hysterically.

752
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:01,910
Right.

753
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,189
-- As soon as he said that
-- I'm just looking at the site,

754
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:05,979
I'm not even clear on what the site is.

755
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:08,150
Is it social media or is it news or is it

756
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:10,369
-- social media news?
-- I don't,

757
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,520
I, I think they're just, is it, like,

758
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,430
desperate to find love from whoever will give it to them?

759
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,640
Oh, it's dig looks almost identical. Ok.

760
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,130
-- So they're just some sort of news slash social media
-- blob.

761
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,859
They're, they're probably owned by the same company sucking up

762
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:31,079
latent traffic from people who don't know better or haven't updated their links.

763
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,569
No, it's,

764
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,689
and I, I don't know, I guess, I don't know the answer to this,

765
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:41,229
but I do feel like some of the problems we see in social media as well as

766
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:45,069
some of the problems we see in security as well as just problems with humanity are,

767
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,969
are vaguely related.

768
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:49,859
I would say one thing I think there's an even bigger problem is

769
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:52,750
that we don't even have a vocabulary to describe these things yet.

770
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,109
Like, I was looking up on Wikipedia

771
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,270
and we have terms like, you know,

772
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,739
the media echo chamber and the filter bubble

773
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,380
which are becoming more common and more understood.

774
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,829
But fundamentally like, what do you call something like

775
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,790
the Guccifer hacking the DNC to destabilize our,

776
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,569
uh, elections to muck around with it.

777
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:13,520
Like, I don't know if you saw the news but, um, Facebook has given, uh,

778
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,119
Canadian politicians like a special way to contact them to recover their

779
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,719
accounts if they get hacked because we have an upcoming election.

780
00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:20,800
Nice.

781
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,119
I mean, I, I get the points for doing that.

782
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:26,589
Yeah, exactly. And we don't even have words to describe this.

783
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:29,439
We don't. And, and, but here again, I wonder if,

784
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:32,520
if we won't because we're the wrong generation.

785
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:35,239
But if the young people are going to be able to deal

786
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,680
with this just because they grew up as part of it.

787
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,400
Right.

788
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,250
So, II, I don't know, I guess it, it is, it will be interesting to watch this evolve.

789
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,339
And I certainly try to keep an open mind

790
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,140
when, when discussing the topics and trying to understand what's happening.

791
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,319
You know, I was just about to say, hey, teenagers,

792
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:53,969
if you could tweet at us and tell us what you think,

793
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:55,250
but I realized they're not on Twitter.

794
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,469
Twitter is for old people.

795
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,170
I, uh,

796
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,569
whatever, you know, Twitter is awesome.

797
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,880
And, and I wonder, do you think any, you think any young people listen to our podcast?

798
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,630
Uh, they might accidentally overhear it when their parents are?

799
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:11,649
That could be, that could be. Well, I don't mean this is one of those things like

800
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,879
I look at security and I remember when I was a kid,

801
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:17,929
like, I really wanted to get into security in a bad way and,

802
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:21,159
and I spent a lot of time reading and teaching myself and stuff and I, I don't,

803
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:25,840
I don't see the appeal with the youth like I feel like existed when I was a kid

804
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,070
and maybe I just don't notice because I'm an old person and don't hang out with them.

805
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,320
But,

806
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,070
but I do feel like this is, this is kind of an old,

807
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,550
-- it's the
-- way we're doing it as an old person industry,

808
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,070
the way the young people are doing it, it's called Agile Ops or what is it? Agile Dev

809
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:40,639
Ops

810
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:41,418
Dev

811
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:42,219
Ops. That's the

812
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,620
see

813
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:45,550
on Dev

814
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,938
Ops, which is something else.

815
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,458
I'm giving a talk at

816
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:51,500
OCON about Dev psychs

817
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:51,989
actually.

818
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,208
Have you

819
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:52,530
done

820
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:53,938
this?

821
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,219
I make up, I make up lots of things. No, no, in all seriousness. I mean, I,

822
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,909
I'm at elastic obviously and we have a very psych

823
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,570
ops culture and so

824
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,189
not psych

825
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:03,760
ops, Dev

826
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:03,959
ops

827
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,570
culture.

828
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,370
And so adding security in there is certainly that, that's something I'm very

829
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,909
sensitive to is I don't want to show up and

830
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,870
be the security person who's like you're doing it wrong,

831
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:14,649
do it this way.

832
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,770
But rather say if, if we did this

833
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,540
right?

834
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:23,239
And, and kind of, I, I'd like to talk about security as an MVP minimum viable product,

835
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:23,989
you know,

836
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,010
with security in mind because I think security is notorious

837
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,790
for trying to solve all of the problems at once,

838
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,340
which means we solve none of the problems

839
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,169
instead of saying let's do this one little thing

840
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:37,989
and then move on from there. But that, that's a topic for another day.

841
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,040
All right, man, I'm calling it.

842
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,139
It's, yeah, I don't know. Good, good luck, democracy and humanity in general.

843
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:47,409
That's the lesson of the day.

844
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,199
All right. So thank you, Kurt. Thank you for listening. You can go to open

845
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,709
source security podcast.com and find some links

846
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,110
to the various depressing topics of the day

847
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,820
and you can use the Pound Os S podcast hashtag to hit us up.

848
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,790
