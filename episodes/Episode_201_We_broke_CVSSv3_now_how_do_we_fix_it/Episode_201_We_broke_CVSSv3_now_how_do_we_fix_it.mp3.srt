Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,420
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,310
-- So
-- before we hit record, the first time we hit record,

3
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:16,510
Kurt was mentioning how he's tired

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,989
and I have a lovely story about being tired from the other night.

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,860
So

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,799
I'm

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,719
asleep. What you should do if you're tired at night is go to sleep.

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,299
Well, obviously. Yes. No, no, this was, I'm sleeping soundly like a baby

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,759
-- and all of a sudden
-- there babies do not sleep soundly.

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,700
They don't.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,119
-- Now that
-- I've

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,590
-- had kids, I'm like, no, no babies are like they were sleepers.
-- Ok.

13
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:39,340
Anyway,

14
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:40,479
I'm sleeping

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,360
and there's this ruckus outside

16
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:47,439
and it sounds like something crazy is going on. So obviously,

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,380
I jump up and look out the window

18
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:52,180
and it is 415 in the morning

19
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:57,240
and someone from the city is changing the no parking sign in front of my house,

20
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:58,590
sorry, like,

21
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:00,729
like you have like a permanent no parking sign

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,169
in front of your house like a steel pole.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,660
-- And yeah,
-- I live on a busy street like I have an alley in the back and no one,

24
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:06,970
no one can park on the street.

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,010
But, yeah, 415 in the morning, the guy's in his boom truck in his boom,

26
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:16,669
-- changing the sign and it's making a horrible racket,
-- I guess over time, I

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,910
don't know.

28
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:20,669
All I could think of is, I'm like, this can't be real.

29
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:22,836
And then he gets, he, he finishes,

30
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:24,436
you know, packs his stuff up,

31
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:28,027
-- drives to the next no parking sign and they're changing it and I'm thinking
-- like,

32
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:29,637
changing the hours on it or something.

33
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:31,037
No, it just says no parking.

34
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:35,677
They were, the old signs were old and dingy and these are obviously fancy new signs,

35
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:38,357
but 415 in the morning.

36
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:40,126
-- Well,
-- but it might be one of those things.

37
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:41,806
Some places when they do traffic work,

38
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:45,067
try and do it outside of the hours when streets are busy because, you know,

39
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:46,177
it's safer and easier.

40
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:47,537
No, you say that

41
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,556
except

42
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:52,783
down the street, they've got a big hole dug in it for the utilities.

43
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:54,774
Yeah. But that's the utility guys.

44
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:57,583
-- They don't, utility guys don't care, like,
-- whatever.

45
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:59,304
I don't care what your reasoning is.

46
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:02,594
Do not change signs at four o'clock in the morning.

47
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,744
I had the same thing happen here at like three in the morning.

48
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:06,024
I thought there was like a fire outside

49
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,223
because there's like this weird orange pulse and glow

50
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:09,782
kind of showing through the window.

51
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:11,533
And I'm just like, you know, oh my God,

52
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:15,244
is my neighbor's house on fire and I get up and I look, and it's like city works trucks,

53
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:16,854
the big ones and they were

54
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,751
potholes on one on the street, you know, on the major street behind my house.

55
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,710
And I'm just, like, cool.

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,600
Like, I appreciate that because the potholes are getting bad.

57
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,770
Like, there's this one pothole I can still hear, like,

58
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,651
when I'm in the backyard and a big truck comes by and it's like,

59
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,171
good.

60
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,910
That's awesome. Anyway. Anyway. All right.

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,001
But, well, it's kind of, you know,

62
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,141
it's kind of the same topic is what we're talking about now,

63
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,270
which is kind of trying to figure out

64
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:43,460
-- how bad things are so you can prioritize fixing them.
-- Maybe that's a stretch.

65
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,951
But I'll let it, I'll let it go.

66
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,000
Uh Right.

67
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,589
So the topic today, we're going to focus on CV SS,

68
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,699
scores and severity and risk and the threat and what it means to you.

69
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,699
And we got here because I actually started writing a blog post

70
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,309
to kind of throw NVD under the bus a little bit.

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,860
So

72
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,029
for those of you who may not know. Congratulations.

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,270
NVD, the National vulnerability database,

74
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,539
which is run by NIST here in the United States,

75
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,899
they take all of the CV E data and they enrich it, they add some more information

76
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,809
and it's a very nice feed of data.

77
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,050
And one of the things they do is they add a CV SS score to the CV ES

78
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:22,289
and

79
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,850
it's never right.

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:24,910
And

81
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,070
see and that's where things go.

82
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,110
We'll get to that. We'll get to that.

83
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:33,330
Let me, let me set the stage and then we can start bickering over minor details.

84
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:35,330
-- So they're
-- not minor. That's the problem.

85
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,380
So anyway,

86
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,940
they assign a CV SS score to the CV E and then people use that score like when you

87
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:47,720
get a scan from one of the container scanner vendors

88
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,619
that we complained about a couple of weeks ago,

89
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,089
that's where they get their severity from.

90
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,089
Generally speaking.

91
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,529
And so I was, I've been getting annoyed by these container scans.

92
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,919
I get that everything is critical and it's like holy crap. No, it's not.

93
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,100
This is nonsense.

94
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,779
And so I started writing a blog post explaining what is wrong with NVD scores.

95
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:10,660
And in the process of doing this, I thought I should actually crunch some data.

96
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,979
So it's not just me making crap up,

97
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,220
which is basically what the first draft of this blog post was.

98
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,380
-- So I took the NVD data and I thought I can't just use their data. I need, I need
-- more.

99
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,140
-- You mean their CV SS scoring data,
-- correct? Yeah. Right. Right.

100
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:27,220
And so I thought I'm going to grab the redhead data. Redhead has a huge corpus of data.

101
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,600
I trust

102
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:29,533
it because I know where it comes from.

103
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:33,253
It's well done and it's really easy to get, I tried to find the Microsoft data,

104
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:36,414
but it's behind a bunch of like login pay wally type stuff.

105
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:39,614
And I thought I, I give up, I'm, I'm too lazy to do this.

106
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:41,134
I'm just going to grab the redhead data

107
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:43,063
because it's there and anyone can download it.

108
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,574
So anyway, I grab the redhead data.

109
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,903
I shove it into an elastic search instance and I start

110
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:51,933
crunching the numbers and it totally changed my perspective on everything.

111
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:55,174
I, I honestly, I don't think NVD is the problem anymore.

112
00:04:55,268 --> 00:05:00,488
I think they're using CV SS fundamentally correctly. I think CV SS is the problem

113
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,667
just to give a bit of back story on this.

114
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,447
So like because I've been involved with this and I'm very

115
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,328
aware of how NVD operates because I've spoken with them.

116
00:05:08,338 --> 00:05:10,338
But basically, yeah, they enrich the data.

117
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,167
They're what's called a CV E data publisher.

118
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,997
So they don't actually kind of do original research or CV ES.

119
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,967
But what they do, like you said is they enrich the data.

120
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:22,007
The problem is when you're going to assign a CV SS score, it's very contextual.

121
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:22,727
And so what the

122
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:26,731
has to do is essentially assume kind of a worst case scenario.

123
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:28,481
Well, here's the question, why are they enriching this data?

124
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:28,891
Well, it's,

125
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:31,851
it's fundamentally for the US government to consume and

126
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:34,902
use and other people use it because quite frankly,

127
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:36,481
managers love.

128
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:39,122
How do you feel on a scale of 1 to 10? Oh, you feel like a three? OK.

129
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,141
We're going to like we're going to hire somebody with puppies to

130
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:43,402
come by the office and bring everybody's score up to a six.

131
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,881
Right. Right. Or maybe buy some play doh or something.

132
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,441
I don't know who I do like play doh.

133
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:48,041
Yeah.

134
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:51,506
So the problem is NVD, for example, when they sign a CV SS score,

135
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:54,816
they kind of have to assume like a worst case scenario.

136
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:59,515
Whereas I know at red hat we had certain, I would say expectations about,

137
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,895
for example, this is how this product is sort of used correctly.

138
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:07,096
And so thus where NVD might say, like look,

139
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:11,635
this service is attack over the network like from remote from the internet.

140
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,825
Red hat might say no, no, no, like look if you,

141
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:17,346
if you run this service and expose it to the internet, that is way out of spec like no,

142
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:21,170
you this locked down to your local area network and or trusted systems.

143
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:23,730
And so that that is part of the difference in their scores.

144
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:27,079
Let's give an example here because I think what you

145
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,070
just gave an explanation that makes sense to me,

146
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,670
but I bet it doesn't make sense to everybody.

147
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:34,290
And I want to give two examples. Samba being the first.

148
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:36,980
Yeah, Samba's the classic one where Red Hat's assumption is, you know,

149
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,109
Samba's a file server.

150
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,570
So you're running that on your local network,

151
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,790
you're not exposing it to the entire internet.

152
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,309
-- Yeah,
-- don't do that because if you expose it to the internet,

153
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,623
you're going to have a bad just full stop.

154
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:47,313
Well, exactly.

155
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,213
I mean, and if you do have to allow remote, remote access to it,

156
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,873
that's what VPNS are for.

157
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:55,683
Yeah. Right. Right. Now, so, I guess in that instance NVD

158
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,533
claiming something is maybe critical Red Hat might claim it's

159
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,394
important or moderate because Red Hat's going to say,

160
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:01,723
don't hook this up to the internet.

161
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:05,713
NVD is going to say maybe it's hooked up to the internet who's for us to say,

162
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:09,623
and I'm not going to argue who's right here on the other side though.

163
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:12,813
One of my favorite examples is there are security

164
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:13,067
in

165
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:13,648
bin

166
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:14,287
tis

167
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:15,178
where

168
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,398
you might run this.

169
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,747
Like, let's say you're running some application,

170
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:20,398
let's pick on the file application, right?

171
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:26,268
You run the command file and NVD is notorious for rating those as being critical,

172
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,618
whereas Red Hat would call them lower moderate because in order

173
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:32,618
to attack that in order to get someone as root,

174
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:35,138
running the file command against your bad thing

175
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:38,417
is such a bizarrely complex chain of events.

176
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,497
Yes and no, because there's a lot of work

177
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,691
where you actually are poking files with the file utility to see

178
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:47,891
what the heck it is to see what to do with it.

179
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:51,971
-- No way. I don't buy that.
-- I've done this all the time. I have mystery files.

180
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:54,772
I have to deal with all the time and I quite honestly,

181
00:07:54,782 --> 00:07:56,221
when I have to deal with these mystery files,

182
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:57,932
-- usually I shove them through virus total
-- first.

183
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,171
-- I mean, yeah, that's the easy answer.
-- Exactly.

184
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:04,171
And then I, you know, I run file on them to see what is this thing, you know,

185
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:07,182
and it's like a PDF or an HTML or it's like some office do

186
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,041
that, lost its

187
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,519
-- extension.
-- Ok.

188
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:12,410
So here's where this starts breaking down though

189
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,220
is you can make the convoluted argument.

190
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,000
Everything is critical

191
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,839
using

192
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,799
-- that line of thinking and I think that's broken. Here's the
-- problem.

193
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,519
So CV scoring has a couple of areas that it

194
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,190
looks at and I'm just gonna read them off quickly.

195
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,980
Number one is the attack factor. This is how do you get to it? Right.

196
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,270
Number two is the attack complexity and I love

197
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,039
attack complexity because you have low and high.

198
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,090
There's apparently no nothing in the middle, you have privileges required,

199
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,481
which makes sense like the,

200
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:42,791
the the thing that you're attacking kind of like what level of privilege do you need?

201
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:45,882
You know, do you need a log in or can you just attack it without an account at all?

202
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,062
You've got, is there any user interaction required?

203
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:50,882
Because obviously that's, that's a big deal then you've got scope.

204
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:54,242
So the scope of the attacker, does it stay the same or change?

205
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,762
So, you know, there's a big difference between, for example,

206
00:08:56,771 --> 00:09:00,091
breaking into a web server and getting the context of the web server

207
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:02,731
and breaking into the web server and you know,

208
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,622
somehow getting rude access through that flaw.

209
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:05,921
Sure, a better example

210
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,445
like with Docker, right?

211
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:10,296
So breaking into doctrine, being able to mangle Docker is bad,

212
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:13,786
but breaking into doctrine being able to like touch the system as root very,

213
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:14,385
very bad.

214
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:17,046
And then you've got your CIA your confidentiality,

215
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,445
integrity and availability impact and again, you have none low and high.

216
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:24,426
There's again, apparently no moderate, which always confused me.

217
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:25,565
But who am I to say?

218
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:30,366
And then there's two huge areas of CV SS scoring that are always ignored.

219
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,866
And that is the temporal score and the environmental score.

220
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:34,745
I never touched this either. Exactly because

221
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,879
to get that data is so hard and what the

222
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:39,648
temporal score is a couple of really interesting things.

223
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,289
Number one is exploit code maturity.

224
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,479
So it's almost always left as not defined because your

225
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:46,229
options are unproven proof of concept functional or high.

226
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,559
So exploit code maturity for example would be, you know,

227
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:51,369
oh there's like a there's a zero day out in the wild.

228
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,078
Well, that's bad.

229
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,218
But for example, you know,

230
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,078
there's a zero day out in the wild and somebody you

231
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:57,489
know figured it out and posted an example of it to github

232
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,448
with, you know, a full fully packaged solution. Well, that's really bad.

233
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,109
Same thing for remediation level right?

234
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,682
There is little bit easier because you can hopefully look at the vendor, you know,

235
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,052
official fix temporary fix work around unavailable

236
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:09,531
and same thing for report confidence,

237
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,072
you know, unknown reasonable confirmed.

238
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:14,081
So report confidence would probably be the easiest of these three to

239
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:16,072
score because basically you look at the source of it like,

240
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,382
oh, it came from Red Hat or Microsoft.

241
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:17,492
Well,

242
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:21,411
that's confirmed remediation level again is relatively easy to find

243
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,091
the data for because you go to the vendor site.

244
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:25,461
But the exploit code maturity thing is basically, I mean,

245
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:28,731
I worked at vendors where that's what we did and it was a huge amount of work.

246
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:32,452
The next one is that environmental score where that is kind of takes into account

247
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:34,275
is this product used? How is it critical?

248
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,775
So like my favorite example here is always DNS servers.

249
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:38,135
There's a lot of DNS servers,

250
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:41,474
like the one on my local network that are honestly not that important, right?

251
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:43,335
You pop it, you can sort of attack, well,

252
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:46,375
you can redirect my machines but everything's http S now.

253
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:47,655
So it wouldn't work that well.

254
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:51,054
And then you compare that to like, oh, I don't know the root level DNS servers,

255
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,775
those are kind of more important than my local DNS server.

256
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:57,815
And so those two areas are always ignored because the data is so hard to get.

257
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:01,265
Here's the thing, I, I've actually never met anybody that uses Temple

258
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,968
-- or environmental scores.
-- Well, they don't really exist.

259
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:07,377
-- So I mean, this is in
-- theory, you could use them within an organization.

260
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:08,937
Well, that's the intent, right?

261
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:12,138
I think the expectation is organizations and vendors

262
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:13,398
are supposed to fill that stuff out.

263
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:14,947
But yeah, nobody, nobody fills them out.

264
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,778
And in fact, like from my perspective at work,

265
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:21,797
we publish security advisories and I've just started publishing my own

266
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,518
CVSs scores because the ones at NVD are generally wrong.

267
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:27,177
So it's easier for me to do it right.

268
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,018
-- And
-- that's the second thing is traditionally, nobody

269
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,801
-- CVS S scoring apart from NVD because it was so much damn work
-- and it still is,

270
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,940
it's not easy.

271
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,551
-- And so
-- some vendors are, and that's one of the changes I helped push through.

272
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,080
What I'm happy about is vendors can also push their CVS S scores now

273
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:46,541
and NVD can push their score and you can have multiple CVS S scores,

274
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:49,870
for example, Red Hat and Debian shipping the same software,

275
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,901
but with slightly different configurations by default,

276
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,700
very different CVS S situations.

277
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,380
OK? OK.

278
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,341
There's, there's, we're, we're,

279
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,950
I think dangerously close to rat Holing and there's a,

280
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:03,903
a couple of other really important points I want to bring into the conversation. So

281
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:08,064
if you look at the Red Hat data, they have a CV SS scores,

282
00:12:08,073 --> 00:12:11,854
they have version two and version three scores and they also have what they call

283
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:17,533
the impact and the impact uses something that I call the Microsoft severity system.

284
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:23,874
And this is low, moderate important and critical are the ratings you get.

285
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:24,703
Well, technically, there is

286
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,624
-- also a none, you don't see it that often.
-- None doesn't matter.

287
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:32,380
-- Nobody cares.
-- What? It's because I've seen oracle things with a CV SS score of 0.0.

288
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,489
-- And I'm kind of like, well, how, what, how did
-- that's probably not possible. But

289
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,219
the point is I,

290
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:40,080
I'll make sure there's a link to this in the show notes

291
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,419
and there'll be a link to this blog post I started writing,

292
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,380
which should be out.

293
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,859
By the time I decide to publish this, the Microsoft ratings are very, very simple.

294
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:52,260
And if you read them, basically, anyone can score using that scale,

295
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,450
I would say immediately after reading the ratings

296
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:57,038
where a CV S si bet would take several

297
00:12:57,047 --> 00:13:01,728
hours of reading and then a lot of screwing it up to actually start doing it well.

298
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:05,497
And in a lot of ways, I think that might be vastly superior.

299
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:08,228
And I found from a personal experience,

300
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:11,848
the Microsoft scale is generally more accurate

301
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:15,047
when I'm making decisions than A CV SS score.

302
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:17,328
The thing is though I started crunching all this data.

303
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,968
If you look at the red hat ratings versus the red hat CV S

304
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:25,526
scoring, there's a definite disconnect in those two data sources.

305
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:30,906
So part of the problem is the fundamental dimensions that CVS S scores on

306
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:35,315
are horrifically out of date like they definitely made sense 20 years ago.

307
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:38,226
Yeah, that's probably true. They don't anymore.

308
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:42,385
Like a great example is this whole privilege is required back in the day if you had a

309
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:45,205
service that required a login only people who were

310
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:47,296
supposed to really be there had a log in.

311
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:47,395
Now,

312
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:50,104
how does that work for like Gmail or a cloud

313
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:52,664
provider where you can get a log in for free?

314
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:55,984
Like there's a lot of services being run where you can just

315
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:57,984
sign up and get a log in for free with no hassle,

316
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:58,943
no credit card, nothing.

317
00:13:58,953 --> 00:13:59,763
And so for example,

318
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,843
that throws out the whole privilege required because one of the biggest sort

319
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:07,064
of separators of moderate from we care about this flaw was ok.

320
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:09,263
Can you attack this remotely with or without an account?

321
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:12,744
If it's without an account, we care, but if it requires an account? Oh, ok.

322
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:13,583
Well, you know,

323
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:15,572
you only have trusted users in there so that

324
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:19,291
significantly reduces the threat and scope of risk,

325
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:19,512
you know.

326
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:19,611
Yeah,

327
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:21,791
you have to worry about insider attacks but you don't have to

328
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:25,791
worry about everybody on the dang planet attacking you physical network.

329
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:29,192
Ok. Like what does that mean in a data center where shared tendency is a thing?

330
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:33,932
No, I agree. It's, it's right. Many of these concepts are very old

331
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:35,012
and

332
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,992
they, they definitely don't always make sense.

333
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,331
Well, they, they assume an on premises network where you run your own data.

334
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,580
-- Yeah, it kind
-- of does. I agree with that.

335
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,960
And so my comparison here actually is, I've,

336
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:48,799
I've done way more thinking about this than I probably am comfortable with.

337
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,780
If you look at something like CV SS,

338
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,200
it's very rigid and I don't think there's anything wrong with that,

339
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,320
but it also means that as the universe grows and changes,

340
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,520
you have to adapt basically as quickly in many instances.

341
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,799
But then you look at something like the Microsoft

342
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,719
rating system and it really makes me think about

343
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:11,547
of the US constitution from the respective, it's so vaguely worded,

344
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:16,307
it can be applied in different ways depending upon the environment it

345
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:18,578
-- exists in
-- reality has so fundamentally

346
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:20,468
changed since those documents were written,

347
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:20,817
right?

348
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:23,187
-- There's no nice way to put it like it
-- has.

349
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:25,927
But yet the US Constitution is still applied on a

350
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:28,947
daily basis by our court system for better or worse.

351
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,177
Well, and you guys have had amendments, you know, like the whole no beer thing.

352
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:32,728
That was

353
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:33,317
a,

354
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,609
that was a bad idea. That's OK. It's all better. Now,

355
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,210
the other challenge is that creating this data is

356
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,969
nontrivial.

357
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:43,359
Now,

358
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,590
I'll be blunt somebody with a good familiarity with

359
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,559
the product and a good familiar with security.

360
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,000
We can usually assign a CV SS score in like 1 to 5 minutes and,

361
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,840
and justify it and explain it.

362
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:54,559
But I'll be blunt,

363
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,239
the number of people running around with like a

364
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,690
deeply intimate knowledge of the 120 Red Hat products.

365
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:00,349
Well,

366
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:05,380
they either work for Red Hat or used to work for Red Hat. So there's like not a lot of us,

367
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:06,909
you know, same thing with Microsoft,

368
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,789
like I don't know Windows well enough to assign

369
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,479
a score to something that does some sort of

370
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,739
token reuse in the Windows authentication subsystem.

371
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,859
-- Like, I literally don't know anything about that anymore.
-- Sure.

372
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:19,039
But the problem here is that NVD sets

373
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,320
the scores and then there are lots of organizations

374
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,090
that are now defining policy putting at the CV

375
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:28,859
SS documentation for 3.1 says don't do that,

376
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:30,770
but everybody's doing it.

377
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:30,900
Yeah,

378
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:34,119
but I have power tools that literally say like don't

379
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,419
use this power tool to cut wood or something.

380
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,659
And I'm like, but it's a wood cutting tool,

381
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,450
you know, like I,

382
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,469
right,

383
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,919
like I have all sorts of things with warning labels

384
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:44,630
on them where I'm not supposed to do that.

385
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,440
Yeah, the tool is useless without that.

386
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,179
And I mean, that's part of it as terrible as CV SS is, it's a lot better than nothing.

387
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,909
I mean, yes, you know, same thing with CV is CV E great.

388
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,450
No, but having a barcode label for

389
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,539
vulnerabilities

390
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,570
and by the extension,

391
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:03,070
this is an actual vulnerability is horrendously useful.

392
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:07,630
Now in, in, in, in my blog post, I write, I basically, II I say this right.

393
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,156
I'm not bashing C DS s. My intent isn't to say this is garbage, throw it away.

394
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:12,717
The,

395
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,616
the basically what I came up with was the

396
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:19,176
fact that I unexpectedly I think showed myself that

397
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,817
CBS S it's,

398
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:23,415
it's probably time for a facelift and bring it

399
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:25,337
bring it into the modern world which it,

400
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:27,057
it is like you described.

401
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,896
It's not right. It was built for a different universe.

402
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:34,447
Well, the modern world is also much more diverse than it used to be. It wise.

403
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:36,357
I look at what's in my house now. Wow.

404
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,937
This 20 years ago would have been,

405
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:43,083
I think this comes back to the point of the Microsoft system is vague

406
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:45,443
and so it's easy to say,

407
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:49,524
ok, given the circumstances, how does that apply

408
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:53,024
to this vaguely worded list of ratings?

409
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:55,843
-- Well, you got more wiggle room,
-- you have tons of wiggle room.

410
00:17:56,093 --> 00:18:02,394
And I think that is funny enough when CBS S started, I was like, oh, thank goodness,

411
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:05,754
we finally have like some concrete rules to define these things.

412
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:10,181
And now that I look at it, I think those concrete rules are actually

413
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,431
not good

414
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:13,230
in the current environment.

415
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,931
Well, ok,

416
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,520
so here's another part of the problem is it's not just that the world

417
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:19,020
has changed and some of the rules are a bit out of date.

418
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,071
When you build a system with rules, people are going to

419
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:26,781
use that system and in some cases game the system because, you know,

420
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,980
they have an outcome that they want.

421
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,470
I, I mean, I've dealt with vendors where they were clearly gaming c

422
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:33,691
-- scores to get them lower.
-- Oh, yeah, that happens all the time.

423
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:38,378
Or conversely, I've had people try and gain the system. So the CV SS score is higher.

424
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:41,307
Well, a great example being is some security researchers are like, oh my God,

425
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:42,817
I found an end of the world flaw and I'm like,

426
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:45,458
it's a reflected cross site scripting flaw.

427
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:48,687
-- Like it's
-- every security researcher does that pretty much

428
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:49,197
-- every
-- one

429
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:49,277
of

430
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:52,248
-- them
-- except for the ones like that have a massive portfolio and

431
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:55,797
-- just stopped caring and just churn out vulnerabilities like to VSO
-- who

432
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:59,368
was the research company that had put critical in front of everything.

433
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:02,098
So it's critically low, critically, moderate, critically high.

434
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:05,108
-- Oh I remember that. I don't remember
-- who that was but

435
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,925
I remember seeing, I thought it was a joke.

436
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:10,765
-- Yeah,
-- I remember that because I was like, yeah, am I

437
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:11,964
they're trolling us?

438
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:12,604
No,

439
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:14,165
that was legit. But so

440
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:15,704
the problem is part of it,

441
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:19,275
it's kind of like doing TCP congestion until you actually put it

442
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,444
out in the real world and use it for a few months.

443
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:24,685
-- You don't know what the problems are. I mean,
-- I, I do agree with that.

444
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:29,305
-- So
-- the challenge though is that, do you have a feedback loop to not only say, look,

445
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:30,484
here's the problems

446
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:34,204
and to figure out the solutions and then to deploy an update and the answer here?

447
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:39,712
No, like CV SS moves very like I when did 3.0 come out like that was

448
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:43,822
-- well, three
-- oh Is pretty old. 31 came out in 2019

449
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,771
but 31 is, I would say an extremely minor update.

450
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:52,072
-- Oh, yeah, it's 30 came out in 2015.
-- That's a different world, man.

451
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:52,541
Yeah.

452
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:57,112
I mean, Cloud was just nascent then and now it's everything.

453
00:19:57,482 --> 00:19:57,822
Um,

454
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,151
so, you know, and that's,

455
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:03,261
that's the one thing that frustrated me a lot about a lot of these standards is the,

456
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,229
the slowness with which they move.

457
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,900
But something to keep in mind is that

458
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,900
the number of people and the types of people consuming these systems,

459
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,540
-- most of them are not what you'd call
-- agile.

460
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:21,260
Not exactly. I mean, if you're using a container scanner, which is the new hip thing,

461
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,459
you're getting CV SS scores from MVD as part of your report.

462
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:26,800
But for example, like,

463
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,319
let's say we totally rewrite CV S S3 1 and come up with CV SS four point.

464
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:31,800
Oh, well,

465
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,270
now all of a sudden all of these companies that are consuming that data have to make

466
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:38,031
changes to the software because we came up with a whole bunch of new, you know,

467
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,582
dimensions and metrics and

468
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:42,631
maybe we added medium instead of just low and high.

469
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:46,651
That's a nontrivial amount of work for people to be able to consume the data,

470
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:46,852
you know,

471
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:50,692
-- their work flows have to change even stupidly simple stuff where like
-- whatever,

472
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:52,092
that's what's your point though.

473
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:56,212
-- I mean, if you use that as an argument, the point
-- is that's hugely costly. And so

474
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,011
everything is hugely costly. And if you, if you're going to make that argument.

475
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:00,462
Like, screw

476
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,604
you. Stay in the past. I have no use for that, that argument. No way, man.

477
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:04,614
I'm not making that.

478
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:07,693
I'm pointing out that that is a fundamental problem here is that,

479
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:10,034
that institutional inertia, let's face it.

480
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,404
Right. The majority of companies are much happier

481
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:15,484
with business as usual than making rapid changes.

482
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:17,163
That's just kind of a fundamental thing.

483
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:19,923
-- That's
-- why they're disrupted out of business.

484
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:22,203
I'm not arguing for or against it.

485
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:26,015
I'm just pointing out this is how the reality of it is. We can disagree with that.

486
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:29,855
-- I have no sympathy for those companies. This
-- is how it is, right?

487
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:31,296
These companies don't want to change

488
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:33,895
-- how they consume this data.
-- I don't care

489
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:36,566
if they don't want to change. Is that my problem? Anyway.

490
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:38,306
Anyway, look, I'm trying to point out that there's,

491
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,956
there's other factors at play here.

492
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,495
This isn't just, you know, companies being lazy.

493
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:46,735
It's, they, they have, they have incentives to not change,

494
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:50,936
which is one of the reasons why this stuff is, you know, I mean, a great example is

495
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:57,760
why isn't every single CV numbering authority consistently giving out CV SS data?

496
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,900
-- I mean,
-- how do you even give it out though? Right. That's part of the challenge.

497
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,260
-- A perfect
-- example.

498
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,119
When you publish your CV E data to the CV E database, you can push CV SS data,

499
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,530
everybody can do that now, not just NVD, everybody can do that.

500
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,750
-- I I didn't even know you could do that. A
-- great example oracles patched quarterly.

501
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,369
They've been putting in their base score and then the specific, you know,

502
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,050
attack vector attack complexity privileges required, blah, blah, blah, blah,

503
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,260
blah.

504
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,349
They've been listing that out for at least 10 years.

505
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,739
How long has Red Hat been pushing out CV SS data? A

506
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,310
-- long time?
-- Forever.

507
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,599
-- Ish, not
-- forever but not all of them, but a lot of them have at least a decade.

508
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:32,089
And again,

509
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:35,819
that's why I was comfortable using the Red Hat data because there is a lot of it.

510
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:36,910
-- Why
-- aren't vendors doing this?

511
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,180
Well,

512
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,010
there's no real incentive because you start assigning these numbers and

513
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,900
it just makes people angry and they yell at you.

514
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,510
Whereas when you have those kind of nice wiggly room like, oh, it's just a low or, oh,

515
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,449
it's just a moderate.

516
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:48,880
You have a lot more wiggle room, right?

517
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,380
Because companies do have a tendency to do things.

518
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,510
-- Like if it scores more than a five, we have to yell at the vendor.
-- Yeah.

519
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,400
And that's, I mean, that's my biggest complaint.

520
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,780
We're, we're running ourselves out of time.

521
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,400
So I want to just kind of reframe the whole point of, of all of this.

522
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,589
And this is not where I intended.

523
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,800
I was actually just looking to make fun of NVD a little bit

524
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,569
and that's not where this ended up at all.

525
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,270
So I, I see a couple of pieces to this, first of all,

526
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,750
NVD doing their best and kudos to you guys, I really do think you're doing a great job.

527
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,069
You got to remember often times they don't even have access to the product.

528
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,650
-- They're trying to
-- score. Well, sure, they're doing their best. Exactly.

529
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,050
So, like they're doing a good job,

530
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,439
but then this data ends up going to something like a scanner vendor.

531
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,270
And I think

532
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,800
that the scanner, like, like security scanners today are, I think

533
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,760
negligent to a degree that is unacceptable on many levels.

534
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,569
And one of them is the severity ratings where they're accepting what NBD has.

535
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,339
And they're saying this is gospel and I think they are

536
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:45,380
misleading many of their customers into believing that these ratings have some

537
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:50,670
factual bearing instead of saying these ratings should be treated suspect at

538
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,319
best and you should be doing your own research on them.

539
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:55,609
And I don't, I don't see that today.

540
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:59,660
I see these vendors are treating it way more seriously than it is.

541
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:08,010
This is a classic flaw in humans of given even a super terrible weak data source.

542
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,510
We try to imply correlation and causation like, oh,

543
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,750
the bushes rustled over there might be a lion run away and it might be.

544
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,410
And so we have this bad mental pattern of, you know, trying to connect the dots,

545
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:20,790
right?

546
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,885
And so like, and especially something like, oh, you know, because here's the thing,

547
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:29,364
a score from 0 to 10 with this, like, scientific backing of, you know, oh,

548
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:33,035
it's a low severity confidentiality but high for

549
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:38,694
integrity or whatever, you know. It sounds scientific. It sounds like it's data.

550
00:24:38,704 --> 00:24:40,165
It sounds good.

551
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:42,895
And so bam, that's it. It's truth now. Right.

552
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:43,885
What always gets me is, you know,

553
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:45,814
when you look at somebody who does a survey and it's kind of like, well,

554
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,194
what's the actual sample size?

555
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,699
You know, and if it's done properly, it's big enough to be plus or minus nerve margin,

556
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:51,140
blah, blah, blah.

557
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,180
But I think, you know,

558
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:55,420
things where people quote something off of like a Twitter poll and

559
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,560
I look at the Twitter poll and there's like 20 replies.

560
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:57,619
Yeah.

561
00:24:57,739 --> 00:24:58,359
Right. Right.

562
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,160
Exactly.

563
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,479
And, and this is, so this is something I bring up in my blog post also,

564
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:05,319
like my sample size right now is NVD and Red Hat.

565
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,959
That is unacceptably small.

566
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,819
I, I need to look for more data now to see like does Microsoft have,

567
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:12,079
am I seeing the same thing?

568
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:15,439
Can I get oracle data and see the same thing? Like, I don't know the answer to that yet.

569
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:18,505
It will be, I think very interesting once I collect more data.

570
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:20,775
Well, but even if you get Microsoft and Oracle,

571
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:24,494
the problem is you still have sample buys of, OK, you sampled three companies.

572
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:27,415
-- Right.
-- No, I agree completely. Well, yes, exactly.

573
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:31,224
And I mean, this is part of the challenge obviously that we're seeing however,

574
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:33,875
like back to where I'm going with this right now.

575
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:35,064
Let's keep moving up the chain.

576
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:38,584
Now, we have a company making risk decisions based off of data.

577
00:25:38,594 --> 00:25:41,574
A vendor told them was good when it obviously isn't.

578
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:44,255
And so like part of the reason I'm doing this and part of the reason

579
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:49,810
we have a podcast about it is this is partially an education campaign for me to

580
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:51,869
make my life better. It's purely selfish.

581
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:56,270
But I was saying like, we need, you need to understand what this data is and isn't

582
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,430
because there is an enormous lack of understanding today where I will, for example,

583
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:03,770
I'll give you, I just talked to a customer that handed me report was like,

584
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,109
we have to get rid of all these criticals.

585
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,119
And I said, Red Hat rated every one of these low, they're not critical.

586
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,530
And they said our security team said no criticals, you have to fix them.

587
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,390
And I'm like, your security team

588
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,724
needs to be educated like I will gladly talk to them and they

589
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:18,604
said they don't care what you think you have to fix them.

590
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:20,895
I'm like, then there's nothing I can do for you. I'm sorry.

591
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:22,844
And that's unfortunately where it ends.

592
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:24,814
But like that's obviously a security team that

593
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,234
clearly has no idea what they're doing.

594
00:26:26,244 --> 00:26:28,854
Well, see, and, and my goal here with the CV E

595
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:32,675
JSON data format was to allow a global CV SS score

596
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:36,744
per vendor per product, even per configuration CV SS scores.

597
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:41,515
And the reality is that completely failed because nobody wants to do the work

598
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,939
to produce the data.

599
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,420
And very few people would be mature enough to actually consume that data.

600
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,979
And by definition, if they're mature enough to consume that data,

601
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,699
they're already doing it on their own end. Probably.

602
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,510
Well, I've, I've met organizations that do this,

603
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,680
like they consume Microsoft patch, Tuesday

604
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:00,199
and they also buy threat feeds from various vendors and then they have

605
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:02,439
their own people go over internally and look at it and say,

606
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:04,459
like, you know, how does this actually affect us?

607
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:09,489
-- What does this really mean to us? So,
-- I think there might be some incentive brewing

608
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:13,699
because I like a great example that I started publishing severity in

609
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:16,839
CV SS myself because I was sick of NVD screwing it up.

610
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:19,689
But now what's really funny is I'm getting complaints

611
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:22,530
because my CV SS scores are different than NV DS

612
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,680
and people are demanding I fix mine and I'm like,

613
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:25,930
no, no, no, no, no.

614
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:28,540
-- My scores aren't the problem.
-- Stupid question.

615
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,599
Wait, you're saying that the scores you pull,

616
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:33,250
not ending up in the CV? Oh, it wouldn't.

617
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,750
Yeah, because they'd go to the CV database but the NVD site publishes them.

618
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,209
Right?

619
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:39,469
I mean, I'll start putting them there if I can,

620
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:43,780
-- I don't know how I'll go figure that out, but
-- I don't know what the process for that is,

621
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,989
but I know who you need to talk to.

622
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,260
Yeah, I'll totally do it because I'm, I'm super happy to publish my own scores.

623
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,420
And I think it would also from the first

624
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,859
active of security people who need some education,

625
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:58,099
they treat the NVD data as gospel.

626
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,219
So if my stuff is in there, like, holy crap,

627
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:03,040
-- I just
-- want when all you have is like half a

628
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,520
sheet of paper with some vague instructions written down on it.

629
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,280
You know, it's kind of funny to me because almost always,

630
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,260
it seems to me the worse the data is, the more people treat it as the truth,

631
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,140
right?

632
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,900
Whereas when you actually have proper, proper data, number one, you have a lot of it.

633
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,979
And number two, you actually know

634
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:21,680
you have confidence or not confidence in it.

635
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,579
And so here's where I want to end this because we're kind of out of time.

636
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:27,010
And I think you bring up a really important point is

637
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:30,380
I had a lot of assumptions in my mind about this data

638
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:33,380
and then I started looking at it and I literally had to do a one

639
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,420
on everything that I thought was true.

640
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,550
I think this is true of many people in many organizations.

641
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,819
And I'm, I'm going to kind of throw CVS S under the bus a little bit.

642
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:45,010
Here is my suspicion is they've made most of

643
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,849
their decisions without data to back it up.

644
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,030
And it was probably gut feelings for people and I

645
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,000
can tell you now that gut feelings are highly inaccurate,

646
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,160
100% of the time.

647
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,030
It's just, it's, it's how it works like we're humans, we're bad at this.

648
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:01,790
What always gets me is you ask somebody to explain, why did you make that decision?

649
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,550
What data and what thought process led you to that

650
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,500
answer? And a lot of them are like, uh

651
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,619
and there's enormous power in having data sets and being able to look

652
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,270
at them and poke at them and make decisions based on them.

653
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,630
And,

654
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,880
and I, I view that as it every I,

655
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,099
I keep going through this data and like it's making my head explode constantly

656
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:25,060
because there's so many things I'm finding that I just did not expect to find

657
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,140
and it's amazing

658
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,689
and annoying and terrifying all at the same time,

659
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:31,890
which is part of the fun.

660
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,209
And I guess so I'm going to

661
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:38,250
in the show notes, I'm gonna put a link to the blog post that should be out by the time I,

662
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,250
I hit, publish on this,

663
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,650
everything I've done is with 100% public data

664
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,479
and it's with all functionally open source tools.

665
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,689
There's no reason anyone can't go do what I've done.

666
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:53,140
And I would totally encourage you. I'll have a link in my blog post to my github

667
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,489
project

668
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,829
that does all this.

669
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,910
And it is, it is fascinating and it is a lot of fun if you're a data geek.

670
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,859
All right, Kurt last word, take us home.

671
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,209
I think the fundamental problem is

672
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,459
this isn't a technology or an infosec problem. This is just how humans work.

673
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,229
Given incomplete data. We try to make

674
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,449
the best decisions possible.

675
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,130
I think the problem though is,

676
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,239
is we then assume that we made a good decision on good data,

677
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,569
which is not always the case.

678
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,670
I think that sums it up marvelously and I think that's an important point to it.

679
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,170
Our intent isn't to make fun of anyone. It's to just

680
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:32,295
maybe point out some truth such as that just because you

681
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,604
made a bad decision doesn't mean you're a bad person.

682
00:30:34,614 --> 00:30:38,005
At the same time. It's important. We give ourselves the ability to change our minds.

683
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:40,864
-- Well,
-- and that's part of it too is it's not necessarily a bad decision.

684
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:45,035
It's an incorrect decision. Bad is a moral judgment, not necessarily whatever

685
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,714
the other thing is too is that decision might look bad now.

686
00:30:47,724 --> 00:30:50,444
But 20 years from now you might be like holy crap. We dodged a bullet.

687
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,920
No, seriously, right? Like, yeah, part of the challenge too.

688
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,709
-- So I guess look up Dunning Kruger and go cry quietly while you drink.
-- I like it.

689
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,410
All right. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
