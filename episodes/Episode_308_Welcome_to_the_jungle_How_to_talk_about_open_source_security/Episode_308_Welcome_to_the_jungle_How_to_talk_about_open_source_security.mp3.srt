Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:11,159
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:15,840
So I have a sort of funny story to tell. My son

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,120
is part of the robotics club at his high school.

4
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:23,229
And one of the things they want to do is add like the computer

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,319
vision thing, like where you can detect a red object, you know, in the,

6
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,819
in the screen and all that stuff and,

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,090
and they didn't really know what to do.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,509
So I thought I will learn how open CV works,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,250
which is the Python Library that does this stuff and then I can help them.

10
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,169
And obviously the intent being I, I, if, if I want to help, like, guide

11
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,409
the Children,

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,810
I don't want to just do their work for them. So I need to know what's going on. Right.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,000
And there's this weird color format they use that.

14
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,840
I've never heard of called HSV, which is huge saturation value, I think.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,880
I don't know. Anyway, it's like a complete mystery to me.

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,720
I've tried to figure it out and I'm like, I'm too dumb to learn this.

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,000
And so

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,740
the

19
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:03,409
kids laughed at me because I just literally wrote a

20
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:06,239
program that I hold the color up to the screen

21
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:11,254
and it calculates to the HSV value for me and then spits it out and they're like,

22
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:12,894
isn't this harder than learning?

23
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:16,495
I'm like, no, this is way easier than learning something new.

24
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:17,934
When me and a friend,

25
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,004
he got a dedicated dial up and we had to

26
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,285
figure out subnetting and we figured it out like,

27
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:23,254
basically

28
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:26,084
backwards wrong but got it working

29
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:28,025
because there was no documentation on it.

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,580
Uh There were I ETF standards, I'm sure

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,480
which we

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,569
-- couldn't access because we didn't have internet access.
-- Just don't use

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,720
subnetting. Just have a flat network that encompasses everything. It's fine.

34
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,029
I

35
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:43,779
remember

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,269
when I was in college, this was in the late nineties,

37
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:50,879
the university owned a class B which was a

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,000
192.168 dot And then

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,199
the two octets after that.

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,080
And it was, I don't, I don't remember what it even was,

41
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,559
but rather than segmenting their network,

42
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:06,339
they operated the entire university is one flat class B network hardcore.

43
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,059
I like it.

44
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:07,410
Like,

45
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:12,220
it was something you could get anywhere. You could mass scan the thing. It was just

46
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,580
in hindsight.

47
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:16,320
I'm amazed anything worked.

48
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,679
Yeah, I'm kind of. Yeah.

49
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,250
Yeah.

50
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,559
Well, it's like every time,

51
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:22,589
every time somebody complains about plugging in a network cable wrong and

52
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,639
breaking it and it's like you don't have spanning tree protocol enabled like

53
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,520
you,

54
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,059
how does your network ever work? Let alone reliably. You know what I mean?

55
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:32,160
When?

56
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,539
Yeah, a simple mistake brings the whole thing down.

57
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:36,860
Or my all time favorite is like, you know,

58
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:39,100
people accidentally turning on a DH P server

59
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,699
and, you know, it just totally thrown the network into a, into a epileptic fit.

60
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,440
-- Basically,
-- that's

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,740
a treat for sure.

62
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,320
-- And weirdly enough switches deal with that now,
-- uh, they're, they're better than,

63
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,559
yeah.

64
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,630
-- Yeah. And I mean, I remember hubs back in the day.
-- Oh,

65
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:55,039
yeah.

66
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:55,630
Yeah,

67
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,770
I remember an ISP locally using hubs because I

68
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,940
ran a network sniffer to solve an email problem.

69
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,679
And I was like, whose email is that?

70
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,570
And it was, well, here's the thing if you're selling 10 megabit,

71
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,679
so bursting to 10 megabit, unlimited use connections.

72
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,250
What's the easiest way to meter that?

73
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:14,279
And it's stick all your customers on a 10 megabit hub?

74
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:19,460
-- Oh, I suppose. Right.
-- Because then they can't ever use more than 10 megabits.

75
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,550
That's an interesting idea.

76
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:22,449
Well,

77
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,259
the only challenge being is that all the customers can see all the customers data.

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,850
-- Yeah, but that's not their problem.
-- I would. Well,

79
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,919
fun story. They also put their email server on it.

80
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,169
Of course, why wouldn't you

81
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,179
so good old away net

82
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,779
anyway,

83
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:38,139
they're long gone.

84
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:40,449
So, yeah.

85
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,089
Well, I mean, some of these vulnerabilities recently, I just got to wonder.

86
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,380
Uh, no, no, no.

87
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,449
I think this is good and healthy. I think

88
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,910
we exist

89
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:51,669
in

90
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,399
this unique place in security where

91
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,649
people are,

92
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,470
they're becoming more aware.

93
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,089
There's more research happening, there's more communication.

94
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:01,919
This is great. This is great.

95
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,100
Oh, yeah, I, I know, I just, I'm kind of wondering like,

96
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,899
how are we still making these mistakes?

97
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,949
Ok. No, it's fine. I want to start with the Twitter,

98
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,880
the, the Twitter story. So I'll get the quick summary here. Basically,

99
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:14,649
some researchers search

100
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,850
github for Twitter secrets. They found a bunch

101
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,100
and the way they told people their secrets were

102
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:24,019
in Twitter is they sent a tweet as the person

103
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,799
basically saying, oh, hey, your credentials are in github.

104
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,010
And

105
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:29,950
like

106
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,679
I heard this and I of course,

107
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,850
laughed out loud because I think it's really funny and then I'm like, wait a minute,

108
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,489
this is probably breaking the law.

109
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,489
And then I also thought, however,

110
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:43,940
my, I have a strong suspicion if you just did the research, you mailed a lot of people

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,779
and well, assuming you can even contact some of them.

112
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:47,450
II, I

113
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,480
don't think the story would have gotten a lot of attention,

114
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,589
but I think this particular stunt

115
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,100
is going to get them an enormous amount of attention.

116
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,429
Well, realistically given a Twitter account attaching an email address to it.

117
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,619
Uh because email is the only push protocol we have that everybody uses.

118
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:09,350
And this speaks to that Twitter is a push protocol.

119
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:13,239
And if I can, well, essentially if I can push something to your Twitter account

120
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,950
yet. There's a good chance you might see it and read it.

121
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:19,119
And so that's what they did and, you know,

122
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,929
yeah, they actually technically broke the law by, you know,

123
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,720
computer access and I'm kind of surprised their Pinata Hub

124
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,500
Twitter account wasn't closed down for, like,

125
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,410
some sort of terms of service violation.

126
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,649
But, um,

127
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:30,269
it's,

128
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,750
who knows? Well, because, like youtube is removing videos that, like

129
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:33,899
g,

130
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:38,109
like, uh that teach how to hack and stuff. And I'm kind of like, sort of get it.

131
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,079
But like, on the other hand,

132
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,820
how does like the lock picking lawyer has over 1000 videos there.

133
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,850
-- How does that work?
-- It's completely uneven.

134
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,799
All these services take the,

135
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,630
my suspicion is, it probably works like the,

136
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,119
the FTC,

137
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,579
is it FTCFCC in the United States where they

138
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,739
really don't do anything until they get complaints,

139
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:55,980
you know,

140
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,260
when they get complaints now they make a big

141
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:00,820
deal about whatever it is they're getting complaints about.

142
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:04,519
There was a good study about that that basically found out that the vast majority of

143
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,399
sec complaints were a couple of small organizations

144
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,670
that just organized letter writing campaigns basically.

145
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,700
But anyways, that doesn't surprise me at all.

146
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,570
No, I think, like, as we learned from Log

147
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,660
for Jay, there's just,

148
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,970
there's so much stuff out there that's

149
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,089
kind of a, I don't want to say abandoned because it's not like abandoned,

150
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,359
abandoned if it was.

151
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,230
But it's, it's in the sense of, you know,

152
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,790
somebody has an old junkie car on their lawn and they just don't care.

153
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:30,079
And, you know, the same thing with their, like, there's, there's

154
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,279
tons of Twitter accounts that people set up and just kind of never use

155
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,609
well and people check things to get

156
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,130
and they forget and they don't realize they've checked secrets in and there is

157
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,630
and not only that, so one of the other things, so if you checked in, let's say a, a

158
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,450
Bitcoin wallet into

159
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,700
github, that thing's going to be cleaned out in about five minutes.

160
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,609
Whereas if you check in Twitter credentials, like they don't really have any value,

161
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:56,910
it's gonna be hard to

162
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:57,269
most

163
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:58,420
of the people

164
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,059
and yet the,

165
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,119
depending on the account right there was that the famous Twitter hack,

166
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,500
that teenager that got in and then, you know,

167
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,019
got into those famous accounts and did the Bitcoin Doubling scheme,

168
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,339
-- which was beyond stupid, but
-- I'm pretty sure that most of these accounts

169
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,649
are not that

170
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,980
-- they're
-- low value for sure.

171
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:17,410
That's the thing. Like if I found

172
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:23,410
like a Twitter accounts credentials that had four followers and I couldn't tell

173
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:27,380
exactly where this account was, like, who was behind it or if it was, you know,

174
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,149
you know what I mean?

175
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,839
I'd be like, hey, whatever, it's not worth trying to deal with this.

176
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,600
I mean, and that's the reality of that, I think,

177
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,679
whereas when you compromise thousands of accounts

178
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,079
and you tweet as them. Now we have a story.

179
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,109
Well, and it's also, it's,

180
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,000
it's the most efficient way to do it.

181
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,959
Like, as a researcher,

182
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,850
are you gonna spend even 10 seconds trying to track down a Twitter account?

183
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:48,640
No,

184
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:50,049
you don't have time for that.

185
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:50,790
It,

186
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,760
yeah, just blast it out.

187
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,940
Yeah. Yeah.

188
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,119
I mean, that's always one of the challenges is when you find, say

189
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,200
1000 problems, how do you report that at scale?

190
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,029
You, you kind of can't in most instances.

191
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,260
Well, and even if you do automate it, you,

192
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:12,059
you still have to spend quite a few hours automating it.

193
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,049
Yeah.

194
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,119
Yep. Yep. It's, it's, it's a hard problem for sure.

195
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,940
Whereas just sending out a bunch of tweets, that's funny.

196
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,660
Well, and people do react

197
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,450
well to these sort of a slow trickle problem people will happily ignore.

198
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,619
But, you know, all of a sudden

199
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,450
you have

200
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,070
some, you know, like

201
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,289
AAA, like, for example, a 30 car pileup will make the news every time on I, whatever,

202
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,789
you know, because it's snowing and blowing.

203
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:38,340
But

204
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,979
in that same 24 hour period, how many people, you know,

205
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:42,950
went off the road because they're driving like idiots a

206
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,700
lot.

207
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,570
Yeah,

208
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,650
it's not

209
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:46,869
right.

210
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:49,500
Plane crashes always make the news whereas

211
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:54,349
infinitely more people are killed by car accidents every day.

212
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:54,900
But

213
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,479
that's not news.

214
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,950
I just wonder sometimes because a lot,

215
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,950
there's a lot of security problems that don't lend themselves well,

216
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,020
to being easily able to publicize them and get

217
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,880
people's attention and get people to pay attention.

218
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,000
And this

219
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:08,739
is

220
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:12,854
literally the topic of the day is how do we talk about some of

221
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:17,815
the security stuff in a way that maybe gets the attention it needed and,

222
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:21,385
and log for J, obviously, we're going to be picking on this for years to come.

223
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:27,234
But like the, the J MD I problem behind log for J was reported in what 2016 at, at,

224
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:31,114
at Black Hat or something or at defcon, I forget which conference the,

225
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,544
the point being that.

226
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,059
So the JNDN problem was reported,

227
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,380
but it wasn't reported in a way that was sensational or noteworthy.

228
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,039
So it was functionally ignored until someone created a functional exploit.

229
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,460
And now all of a sudden it's very real and very serious, right?

230
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,419
They're, they're fundamentally

231
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:49,700
they weren't different.

232
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:53,260
It was just one of them managed to get our attention.

233
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:53,979
Yeah.

234
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:56,210
Well, it's like this recent uh what is it? The P

235
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,299
kit, the local privilege escalation and Paul kits PK exec.

236
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,109
And I like how

237
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:02,409
Kace, I mean, and

238
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:04,390
Kiss does great research, right?

239
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,510
And they intentionally did not release exploit code because they're like,

240
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,369
you know, we want to give the defenders some more time than exploiters.

241
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,669
We'll give you two hours basically. Yeah, two hours later,

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,429
there's now, well, there's now two github

243
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,969
repos with exploits,

244
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,179
you know, I, I personally think in this case, Kac

245
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,739
should have just released the exploit code because it would have gotten,

246
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,059
it would have lit a lot more fires under people.

247
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,080
You know, they would have said it was irresponsible and then ironically,

248
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,669
probably nobody would have bothered to release exploit code because Wallace did.

249
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,659
But yeah, it took like Attackers two hours or not even Attackers.

250
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,390
It took just random people to

251
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,559
two hours to come up and post this on

252
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,049
github.

253
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,080
-- Yeah, the Attackers probably had it immediately. It's fine. Yeah.
-- So I, yeah,

254
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,059
I, I personally I'm kind of, I used to be like, you know, we should do no harm,

255
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,159
we should blah, blah, blah, you know, don't do exploit code unless you have to or de

256
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,869
weaponize it.

257
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,190
And now I'm kind of like,

258
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:55,549
yeah, I mean,

259
00:10:56,349 --> 00:11:01,489
that's, well, I, I think the world is different if you look back 10 years.

260
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,520
So this is a heat buffer overflow exploit and it's kind of complicated how it works.

261
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,710
It's super interesting, go go read about it if you want. But basically

262
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:13,169
exploiting this would have been kind of difficult because we didn't have all

263
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,200
of the tools and the process and the knowledge we have today.

264
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:17,539
Whereas today,

265
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,979
there's so much amazing tooling that exists

266
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,950
that you, if you know where a bug is, you can pretty much write an exploit very,

267
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,960
very quickly because the ability to do so is now

268
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,479
a very low bar compared to where it was.

269
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,479
And so this is why the whole, oh, don't release exploit code.

270
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,359
If someone reports a bug,

271
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,200
the tooling is so good you have to assume

272
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,580
in a matter of hours,

273
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,750
any remotely competent attacker can turn that into a weaponized exploit.

274
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:45,229
Well, I,

275
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:49,349
I just remember back at eyesight and I defense there was a guy whose job it was, was,

276
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,099
you know,

277
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,840
to take essentially it was voted the most severe Microsoft bug of Microsoft

278
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:56,710
Tuesday and to make an exploit code for it in 24 hours.

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,450
Right.

280
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,169
And I don't think he ever failed.

281
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:01,020
-- And
-- I'm not surprised at

282
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,340
all.

283
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,169
-- And, and this is like over 10 years ago,
-- right.

284
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:08,190
That was a super specialized skill set. And you had very little tooling.

285
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,330
Now,

286
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,679
there's all this tooling that exists. You can inspect memory, you can decomp

287
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,969
things you can,

288
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,250
it's, it's phenomenal. It's like

289
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,150
there's never been a better time

290
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,570
to be involved in this sort of research.

291
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,520
It's amazing.

292
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,429
Yeah. So I kind of,

293
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:30,659
I suspect overall it's probably going to be better in many cases

294
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,049
to just

295
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,440
release the exploit code from day one and get the

296
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,650
press coverage and actually get people to deal with it.

297
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,159
I don't know. I, I think it would still be apr nightmare if you did it.

298
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:40,809
Like,

299
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,690
-- I, I don't know if I'd do it if I was them.
-- Here's the thing

300
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:47,489
realistically, is this the only vulnerability that your system has?

301
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,250
And the answer is no.

302
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,570
Right. That's the thing I I keep coming back to is like

303
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,760
this is one reason II I got the cloud security lines

304
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,309
off of infrastructure as a service and onto platforms of services.

305
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,739
Because

306
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,609
what value can I add to keep a system up to date?

307
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:03,799
Like the, the best I can do is I can apply the vendor patches.

308
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,849
I'm not gonna, you know, keep a ear to the ground and apply prepa

309
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:08,969
and compile it and reboot it before, you know,

310
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:11,080
an hour before the vendor releases the patch.

311
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,340
Literally, the value add I as assisted man with a quarter century of experience

312
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,380
is basically nothing

313
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,020
like

314
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,340
there's so little value add I can provide.

315
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,619
There's no doubt that somebody like Hiroko

316
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,280
can't do it better or at least as good as me, it's, you know,

317
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:28,219
it's somebody else's problem now because I I

318
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,900
there will always be a Linux vulnerability

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
that somebody can use locally to exploit to root that will be exploitable

320
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,130
-- for a few hours before I can patch it
-- a few hours.

321
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:38,794
Even in the sense of

322
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,065
in the sense of if like and that's assuming the

323
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,354
vendors get the patches out like right away right away.

324
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,275
Well, like I got to sleep and stuff.

325
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:50,065
I, you know, do we have a 24 7 ops team applying patches to our Linux servers?

326
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,494
Well, actually, yes, because we outsourced it to

327
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:53,224
-- Hiku
-- now

328
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:53,825
it's

329
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:55,034
you, you don't know

330
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,099
and look anyone running servers, you can't just reboot, whatever

331
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:03,700
you, you need outage windows for stuff like this, you know.

332
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:04,419
Yeah.

333
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,679
Well, and even if you have highly resilient systems and don't need outage windows,

334
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:11,659
it's still, somebody has to be awake to deal with it in case it goes south or whatever.

335
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:12,130
So,

336
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:13,900
yeah, I mean, ii, I

337
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,940
fundamentally think the way

338
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,469
I'm going to say something that's probably not very nice.

339
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:21,359
But if you're doing it the same way we did it 20 years ago,

340
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:23,570
you're basically doomed from a security perspective.

341
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,710
Don't do it the way we did it 20 years ago. There's so many nice tools. Now,

342
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:31,679
how many,

343
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,619
how many small medium businesses do you know that

344
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,479
are still not using any automation at all?

345
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,140
-- Lots.
-- I, some of those are special

346
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,039
but you get what I'm saying, right. It's,

347
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,969
they're, they're basically doomed. It's,

348
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,919
you know, if you refuse to build,

349
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:49,580
using modern methods and materials and put in like locks, you,

350
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,380
you can't have a physically secure building.

351
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,500
I mean, I, you're,

352
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:56,919
you're entering a dangerous territory.

353
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,969
I'm going to pull you back.

354
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:03,000
I think the biggest thing with this though is that this also presumes

355
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,250
that these vulnerabilities are found

356
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,080
by an organization that does coordinate disclosure

357
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,340
and the vendors can fix it quickly

358
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,869
and you know, and so on.

359
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,270
There's a lot, there's a lot of assumptions because for example,

360
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,900
as we found out in shell shock, oh, we fixed it.

361
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,250
Oops. Oh, we fixed it again for real this time

362
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,309
and I think it was what four or five vulnerabilities in total.

363
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:27,280
Yeah, there were a couple, I mean shell shock is special,

364
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,679
I think because for a variety of reasons

365
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,059
it it look coordinate disclosure is difficult

366
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,919
talking about this stuff is difficult.

367
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,580
I don't know the whole story. Coal is historically has been really good

368
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:43,830
about treating all of this stuff well and reporting it in the right ways.

369
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,429
But

370
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:45,409
I think

371
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,700
the challenge today is even more unique because

372
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,359
like let's take this policy kit thing where

373
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,739
it was reported, it primarily affects Linux distributions,

374
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,799
it was reported to the distributions.

375
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:01,840
But if you find something that say is a critical issue in like a node package,

376
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:07,080
there's no good way to tell. Like who, who would you tell? Right? You can tell N PM,

377
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,599
you can tell the node project

378
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,119
and what then like,

379
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,179
you know what I mean?

380
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,260
It's not like you have a couple of say distributions, distributing this stuff,

381
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,380
it's basically available to the whole world.

382
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,700
And so it creates

383
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,659
a unique problem. I think in that regard.

384
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,460
Well, there's, there's no coordinating body,

385
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,780
not even like security wise, there's just no coordinating body.

386
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,710
This is all a wonderful mishmash of open source.

387
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,510
And, and I don't, I don't necessarily think there should be either.

388
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,309
I think this is one of the things that,

389
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,109
that always scares me a little bit when we talk about the open source universe

390
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,489
is like there was just a White House meeting,

391
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,750
there's a bunch of notes all over the internet about that where the White House was,

392
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,809
was discussing open source.

393
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:50,609
And

394
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,859
I think it's easy for a lot of us to fall

395
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:56,809
into the trap of thinking of open source is one thing,

396
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,880
open source is like 7 million ant colonies that are all independent and a blue whale.

397
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,250
And sure,

398
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,118
you know what I mean? Like you can't, like you could say, oh, all open

399
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,939
source projects should generate S bombs. Well, I mean, I, I have like 70 repos in my my

400
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:16,358
-- github. Right. For me, I'm not generating S bombs for those.
-- What about the open

401
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,949
source projects that do documentation?

402
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,308
What about the open source projects that don't do code?

403
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:22,499
Right. Right.

404
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,788
-- No, absolutely. You
-- know, like it's

405
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,148
even just assuming open source means

406
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,468
so like software is is wrong,

407
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,170
creative

408
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,219
commons license. That's part of the open source world.

409
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,540
-- It's,
-- it's complicated and I think this is one of the challenge.

410
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,189
And again, this comes back to kind of the grand theme of talking about security

411
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,680
in ways that are effective, right?

412
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,680
Like there's stunt hacking, which generally is effective,

413
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,599
there's coordinate disclosure

414
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:53,805
which can be effective depending upon the circumstances.

415
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,454
That's assuming you have somebody to coordinate with.

416
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:56,724
And I think that's no, and that's a big

417
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:57,454
part of the problem is

418
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,104
like

419
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:01,635
there's no where like your N PM package example, there's OK,

420
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,464
there's definitely the package maintainer,

421
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:07,415
hopefully who's alive and cares and has time to deal with this because for all,

422
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:09,395
you know, they could be on sabbatical for six months.

423
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:12,655
You know, people do like to take time off once in a while,

424
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:14,584
especially from unpaid work.

425
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,415
It's weird. I know.

426
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,135
Right.

427
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,150
So

428
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:20,239
there's, there's like nobody to coordinate with. There's no

429
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,750
sort of implicitly.

430
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,050
Linux vendors have registered their interest in, you know, well,

431
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,650
in the sense of like Debbie and Chipsy packages were interested in them,

432
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,619
we want to help take care of them.

433
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,290
Same with Red Hat, same with ubuntu, same with blah, blah, blah, blah,

434
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:32,140
right?

435
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,770
But with N PM.

436
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:36,099
Yeah, no, that's not how that ecosystem works.

437
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:39,900
-- It, it fundamentally ships and uses software differently
-- or most of open

438
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,660
source today. It's not just N PM. I mean, how many libraries are we using that

439
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,180
aren't controlled by?

440
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:50,300
I mean, like if you're going to Red Hat, for example, for all of your R PM,

441
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,550
right? That's kind of a funnel.

442
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,670
Whereas

443
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:55,969
when I'm installing Python packages

444
00:18:56,189 --> 00:19:00,030
who is, is distributing those if I'm installing N PM packages, who is,

445
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,410
you know what I mean? It's

446
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,250
such a different environment and ecosystem.

447
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,010
And yet we still talk about open source as this like singular entity

448
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:08,859
that

449
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,979
-- we can somehow solve.
-- I mean, we can't even agree on what is an open source license.

450
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,500
-- You know,
-- we, we can the O SI is quite clear that they control that

451
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,459
and there's people that disagree with that

452
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,650
-- in the open source community.
-- I agree with that also,

453
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,680
I feel like the O SI has let us all down by basically not

454
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,229
changing anything in the last 30 plus years.

455
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,579
But that's another story we want to talk about today.

456
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, see,

457
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,609
and this is what I'm saying, like how,

458
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:35,979
you know,

459
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:40,099
how can we agree on what open source is when we can't even agree on what open source is?

460
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:40,930
And, and

461
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:43,859
yeah,

462
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,599
and I mean, but, and that's fundamentally one of the inherent, it's one of those,

463
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:50,420
you know, like I, I always tell the truth.

464
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm lying right now. Things is this is one of the inherent

465
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,739
challenges and beauties of open sources that open source in and of itself is

466
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,140
what people define as open source to some degree and it may

467
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,770
or may not be open source depending on who you ask,

468
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,209
right?

469
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,849
And, and not only that, if I'm a developer,

470
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,010
I probably don't really care.

471
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:12,849
There's a lot of like node packages that come with these bizarre licenses that

472
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:17,489
are not o si approved but are consumable by me as a developer.

473
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,010
And if it solves my problem,

474
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:22,130
I don't really care, I'm going to use it, you know,

475
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,170
you gotta love it.

476
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,140
It's well. And the thing is also, I love that people are like

477
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:30,760
just discovering how much open source there is in the world like this, literally,

478
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,060
these White House meetings are like the A FTC and stuff.

479
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:33,359
Are

480
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,939
we, we kind of use a lot of this open source, huh?

481
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:38,420
Like a lot of, and I don't mean just directly but

482
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,660
we rely on companies that rely on this stuff

483
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,310
and they're just discovering that. And it's kind of like, yeah, like, no offense.

484
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,839
But me and Josh, we, we've kind of known this for two decades.

485
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,250
Well, I,

486
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,260
I think a lot of the old school open source people have been very aware of this.

487
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,949
But again,

488
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,630
how do we communicate it?

489
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,170
We have been very bad at communicating a lot of these details because I,

490
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,829
I think generally speaking, especially from the security perspective,

491
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:05,546
we've taken the view of I'm going to try to scare you straight

492
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:10,446
and scaring people straight has worked uh zero times in the history of humanity.

493
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:12,436
So that just isn't an option

494
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:15,265
and it's even worse than that because then we also pull the whole, it's open source,

495
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:15,485
open

496
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:16,975
source owes you nothing good luck with that.

497
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:19,765
That too, which I mean that that part is true though,

498
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:22,395
-- but
-- more to the way it's not whether or not it's true.

499
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,026
That's what the open source community is

500
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,725
capable of doing the open source community.

501
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:26,526
Like OK,

502
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,586
let's bring this up those insane questionnaires

503
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:31,031
being sent out to everybody saying like,

504
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,692
are you affected by log for J what are you doing about log for J blah, blah, blah, blah,

505
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:33,842
blah.

506
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:37,302
Cool. If I have a contractual relationship with you and you're paying me money.

507
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:38,812
I might actually reply to that email

508
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:41,121
but if I'm an open source project and you send that to me,

509
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:42,141
saw it off.

510
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:46,702
Yeah, I, I agree with that. I think those are automated systems gone haywire

511
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:48,972
and shame on the companies that are

512
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:52,021
just adding open source maintainers into their systems

513
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:53,631
as, as if they are a vor

514
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,281
more to the

515
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:54,501
point.

516
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,781
It doesn't matter how we feel about this morally or ethically

517
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,550
from just a, a version of reality that we live in.

518
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:05,689
-- The majority of open source maintainers can't and won't deal with that stuff.
-- No.

519
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,130
And they shouldn't and, and good for them don't, don't. There's no reason to,

520
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:14,050
but again, we come back to this communication aspect of it. All

521
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,930
of

522
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:21,000
we can't talk about this necessarily and, and because it's not well understood,

523
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,290
you have,

524
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,540
I think some groups that think they understand open

525
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,770
source and they think open source is one thing

526
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,219
and then they have all these big meetings and they talk about things and,

527
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:34,969
and the reality is my favorite part is so the White House has a meeting.

528
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,280
They're gonna probably come up with some sort of guidance

529
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,560
and if the open source universe decides the guidance is crap, like

530
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:42,300
that's it.

531
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,260
What are you gonna do?

532
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,405
You can't make them do things

533
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:47,525
well.

534
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:49,415
And I've been thinking about this a lot because it,

535
00:22:49,425 --> 00:22:51,864
it intersects with what we're doing with the Global Security Database.

536
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,015
And I, I'm really coming to the realization of

537
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:58,655
even if you get a good chunk of developers on board wanting to do it

538
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,864
numerically at most, it's going to be one or 10%

539
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:04,925
maybe 20% or 30% if you're lucky.

540
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,905
And so again, back to that whole, you know,

541
00:23:07,915 --> 00:23:09,895
black holes don't care if you believe in them or not.

542
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,810
Like if I want to see a world where with good GSD coverage,

543
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,569
well,

544
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:16,729
somebody has to go do that GSD coverage and it's

545
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:19,410
probably not going to be all the end developers.

546
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,189
No, no, absolutely not. And that's it.

547
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:25,520
And then, and I don't have an answer yet as to like, how do we get that coverage,

548
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,619
but at least, at least I'm not trying to solve a problem that can't be solved.

549
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,180
And I think that's part of this whole universe we have to start solving.

550
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:37,260
I like one of my favorite examples is

551
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,000
I keep hearing people say

552
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,079
that the projects,

553
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,290
open source projects should be responsible for building their own s bombs

554
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:46,339
for the project,

555
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:46,979
right?

556
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,030
Why, why is that their problem? And if they, if they don't, what are you gonna do?

557
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,650
You're gonna not use their project.

558
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,130
No, you won't.

559
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,319
If

560
00:23:55,459 --> 00:24:00,489
it's the only library that does what you need, you're going to use it no matter what.

561
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,819
-- And
-- the thing is what tooling are they going to use?

562
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:06,180
Because there's so many like I remember the XML hashed off stuff.

563
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:08,079
Do you know how many projects embed

564
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,270
a

565
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:12,310
of G zip or of XML? So that it'll build on windows?

566
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,060
That's

567
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,619
a slightly different problem.

568
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,020
-- I don't think of those. It's the same thing. I,
-- no, no. What I'm saying though is, is

569
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:20,770
you want these projects to build S

570
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,739
bomb? Cool.

571
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,689
So where are the really good tools you're going to

572
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:25,260
give them for free that are easy to use.

573
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,969
Uh There's actually some S

574
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:28,880
bomb tools that do a good job

575
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,099
of figuring out the dependencies you have embedded source is a very,

576
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:37,060
very different problem and nothing does that well.

577
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:42,380
But I also think we've reached a point where that is far less common than it used to be.

578
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,469
I think it is

579
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,800
and I can't prove that that's me making crap up. I'm not gonna pretend it isn't,

580
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,189
but I don't feel like I run into embedded source

581
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,489
nearly as much as we used to back in the day.

582
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:58,489
Well, but more of the point is unless these github

583
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,520
is rolling out security features that you just have to click a button

584
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:04,530
to use and how many places are still not using them

585
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,079
-- a lot
-- because they get in the way and they're annoying.

586
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,510
I mean, I, I look, I, my favorite example is Depend

587
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:10,729
aot,

588
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,849
I love, depend

589
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,140
Aon. I think it's a great tool. But the reality is if

590
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,859
so when, when you run, when you turn to depend a bot for your, your project.

591
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:21,489
It's going to start telling you about your dependencies you're

592
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,089
using that are out of date or have security issues

593
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:25,375
or whatever. Right

594
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:28,204
now, what do I do about that? Depend a bot

595
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:30,395
has a like, oh, please fix this for me button.

596
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:31,895
That literally never works

597
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,994
because every time you auto upgrade something, it just all your tests explode and,

598
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:36,954
and nothing's functional.

599
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:40,665
So now as a developer and I'm doing this for free in my spare time,

600
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:44,314
I'm told, oh, you have 30 vulnerabilities in your package.

601
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:45,594
And I'm like, I don't care,

602
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:49,395
like I want to work on this little feature I thought of in the shower this morning.

603
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:52,285
I don't give two craps about the vulnerabilities in my package.

604
00:25:52,295 --> 00:25:53,954
If someone else cares, they can fix it.

605
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:55,229
Yep. Right.

606
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:55,489
I mean,

607
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,709
and that's kind of how open source works and that's how open source is going to work

608
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:02,270
if there's some super critical thing that, that might affect me, OK?

609
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,920
I might think about it. But if it's like a bunch of low issues,

610
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,689
I don't care why, why, why should I care about that stuff?

611
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,339
So, you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna turn depend

612
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,270
about off because now my problem goes away.

613
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,949
-- Well,
-- and there's almost never a solid upside for the developer in the sense of,

614
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:20,920
you know, upgrading these dependencies will definitely make your life better.

615
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,689
It's almost always

616
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,089
best case scenario. This doesn't break anything, worst case scenario.

617
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:27,349
Oh, it breaks everything.

618
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,790
And now now let's go back to our our communication angle. So

619
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:35,209
I'm a company using your open source project.

620
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,150
What am I gonna do? Am I gonna send you a mean letter?

621
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:39,260
Maybe?

622
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,050
Am I gonna, am I gonna

623
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:42,869
it does happen?

624
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:48,630
Am I going to spend the time and have one of my developers patch all the packages

625
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,670
maybe? But I have 7000 packages in my product. Do I want to do that? 7000 times?

626
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,709
Look now, I'm not adding features. All I'm doing is managing dependencies.

627
00:26:59,069 --> 00:27:00,560
Congratulations. You've discovered what

628
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,380
Red Hat is like.

629
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:05,790
But that was literally Redhead's business model and that, that works, right?

630
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,589
But Redhead also has a very constrained number

631
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,989
of packages on purpose because of this,

632
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,670
right?

633
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,660
Whereas if I'm a company of 10 people and I'm building

634
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,949
a web app and my web app has 7000 dependencies,

635
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,469
whatever, like as long as nothing's critical,

636
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:24,339
-- I'm not touching anyone
-- even if it is critical unless it blows,

637
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,069
-- you know, if a tree falls in the forest and doesn't kill anybody, do we care?
-- Right.

638
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,489
And now we're going to have a situation where we have governments saying

639
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,400
uh you have to patch all of this open

640
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:34,979
source project.

641
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:37,410
The open source project is gonna be like, yeah, whatever we don't care.

642
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,219
And now you've got companies using it.

643
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:39,380
Well,

644
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,420
that's a good point actually because it's the CIA

645
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,609
just has that new guidance like for example,

646
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:44,910
log for J has this deadline

647
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,310
and they're coming up with those like lists of vulnerabilities,

648
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:49,329
um both what is being exploited

649
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,189
and some of those have deadlines on them.

650
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,420
Ah So this is where SISA is getting

651
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:59,229
this right is those deadlines are for federal agencies

652
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:04,270
CIA is well aware that they can tell a federal agency you have to listen to us,

653
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,030
but they cannot tell anyone else.

654
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,729
-- And so they're very, very good
-- about that.

655
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:10,260
The F DC though apparently is making noise about

656
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,619
getting companies to fix log for Jay.

657
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,640
There's been some stuff in the press about that. I was

658
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:14,890
and

659
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,229
I wasn't able to find the original source.

660
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,319
So I didn't mention on the podcast after that whole debacle,

661
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,760
like what can copyright do for you with Apple?

662
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,619
So I actually learned my lesson folks,

663
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,099
but I suspect the FTC is going to wave that

664
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:29,209
stick around because waving the stick around costs nothing.

665
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,829
It doesn't, I mean, actually, you know, hitting someone with it,

666
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,079
we'll see. But,

667
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:37,349
but uh I suspect that's kind of

668
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:40,349
because these sort of soft squishy standards of like, oh,

669
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,709
you have to keep data secure.

670
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,959
What does that even mean?

671
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,890
Like I've been in this industry for 25 years and I don't know what that means.

672
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:47,319
Well, I think again,

673
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:50,719
we've not communicated a lot of this correctly and now this is one

674
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,310
thing I will say when you work with organizations like Nist and CIA

675
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,400
and a lot of these

676
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,719
federal agencies,

677
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,390
they are,

678
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,959
they're legendary for

679
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:02,084
pedantic. This is why,

680
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:06,165
because there is no question about intent when

681
00:29:06,175 --> 00:29:07,724
you're working with some of these groups.

682
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:08,814
And that is a good thing.

683
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:12,694
And that is literally what we need, we need security to be boring and pedantic

684
00:29:12,824 --> 00:29:13,574
and we got the pedantic.

685
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:14,555
Right.

686
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:15,314
But

687
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:16,925
it needs to be accounting.

688
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:21,464
Exactly that. And I'll apologize to all you accounting nerds

689
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,324
out there.

690
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:25,569
Yeah, I, I think it's gonna be interesting because, um,

691
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,420
it's just, these systems are so big and complex and interlocking.

692
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,339
I'm not sure anybody actually has a grasp on what the system is anymore,

693
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,520
let alone how to secure it.

694
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,520
Part of it is. Can we even agree on what security means?

695
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:41,900
No,

696
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,819
no, we can't.

697
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:43,800
You know,

698
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,939
because for example, a lot of people would want privacy.

699
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:49,800
-- Well, that's definitely not what Facebook thinks of security.
-- Right.

700
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,010
It's, I mean, it's, it's complicated and I guess we, we need to,

701
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,569
we need to wrap this one up but

702
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:56,180
like, it's just

703
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,150
as the industry matures, we have to start

704
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,709
understanding how to talk about what we do.

705
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,439
We need more standardized terms, we need more standardized process.

706
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,920
And I think things like involving open source,

707
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,050
I feel like we might have been on some of the right paths,

708
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,829
but now open source is a big deal.

709
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,089
So now we have to redefine everything and I sometimes feel like we're starting over.

710
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,290
I don't know what the answer is.

711
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,869
I don't think there's an easy solution.

712
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,689
I have a strong suspicion.

713
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:27,010
Every single profession in the history of humanity has gone through this.

714
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,729
They just did it like 300 years ago.

715
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:34,680
So we don't remember. Whereas what we're doing is very new and welcome to the jungle.

716
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,410
Well,

717
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,199
and the fact that people are talking about it now and talking about it at a high level.

718
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:40,560
I mean, that's step one.

719
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:41,219
It, it is,

720
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:43,390
it's totally step one is as much as I love to harp

721
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,119
on like the White House and big companies talking about open source.

722
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,040
These conversations need to be had,

723
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,510
they're going to get it wrong and that's ok

724
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,479
because every time you get it wrong,

725
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,880
that gives you a new opportunity to get it right.

726
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:57,010
All right, I'm calling it.

727
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,689
