Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Seefried

1
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,600
and my partner, not causing any harmful interference and accepting interference.

2
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:14,470
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,430
Oh my goodness, whatever we are here with Alex

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,729
Cogan, the Chief operations officer and co-founder of Flipper devices,

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,600
which are the folks behind Flipper Zero,

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,290
which is like the greatest hacking device known to man by far.

7
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:30,559
So Alex, welcome to the show, man. We are so excited to have you here.

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,340
Thanks for such a great introduction guys and thanks for inviting.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,700
All right, so let's just set the stage.

10
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:42,849
I'm going to assume not everyone listening knows what a flipper zero is.

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,180
So I will let you tell us all about the flipper zero.

12
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:51,189
Flipper zero is a fun looking device which is uh we call it in marketing like a Tama

13
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,279
goji for hackers.

14
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,509
But uh actually, it's like a serious multiple device we

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,619
packed with various uh access control system

16
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:03,575
like RFC NFC RF ID,

17
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:05,084
infrared and so on.

18
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:06,735
And it's used

19
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:11,474
for uh education purposes for cyber security research purposes,

20
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,035
for development purposes.

21
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:15,035
It's fully open source,

22
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:17,785
it's customisable, you can build models for it,

23
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:19,654
you can build your own firmware for it.

24
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,485
You can build uh apps for it

25
00:01:21,745 --> 00:01:25,974
and just Tinker with these technologies as much as you want. It's uh

26
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:30,379
pretty popular nowadays, especially in a Tik Tok area

27
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,410
among

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:31,809
the

29
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:33,660
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tik Tok,

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,720
we've got like, I think a billion views like totally

31
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,269
uh

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,209
uh with

33
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,959
a, with a hashtag flipper zero.

34
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,879
It's like, I guess it's the main marketing platform for us at the moment.

35
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm too old for Tik Tok, so I don't know.

36
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:49,250
Yeah. Yeah,

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,069
people love it generally. It's

38
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,209
put it simply like a Swiss army knife when you have like a bottle opener, uh knife,

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,050
scissors, everything

40
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,379
but

41
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,809
in like small, small body,

42
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:05,900
it doesn't do anything of, of those things good. Right?

43
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,630
It's not a good knife, it's not a good bottle opener, but it's all packed together.

44
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,369
So Flipper Zero is pretty much the same.

45
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:13,839
That's actually one of the reasons I bought it is because

46
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,360
when I first saw it come out, it came out. I was like, oh, that's cute. And

47
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:20,850
I kind of quickly looked into like kind of what's the parts cost like,

48
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,720
what would it take to actually build one myself?

49
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,960
And the answer is it's actually quite cheap to buy the parts and build it yourself.

50
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,432
But then you have this like mess of wires crap that like

51
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:31,152
doesn't have a nice interface. No. Really? Right. Like it's like

52
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:31,313
a,

53
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:32,212
you know,

54
00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:35,022
there's a reason people buy prebuilt P CS and stuff.

55
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:38,983
Like, just sometimes you want a thing that's in a plastic case that doesn't,

56
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,182
you know, constantly break because the wire gets snagged.

57
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,503
And I actually use mine mostly for like, diagnostics.

58
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:47,162
Like I love buying diagnostic tools, like multi meters, uh digital calipers,

59
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:47,572
all that stuff.

60
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:50,102
Like I like being able to measure things because it makes it

61
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:52,292
so much easier to troubleshoot them.

62
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,126
And one thing like that I'd never really thought about is like,

63
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:59,626
I had a software to find radio receiver for my laptop, right?

64
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:02,005
Which is great. It can like, listen to all the radio things,

65
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,126
but it can't transmit. And so

66
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:07,445
for certain types of troubleshooting, especially in radio, you have to transmit,

67
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,126
you have to interact with the device.

68
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:11,126
And that's one thing where the flipper where I'm like, oh,

69
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:14,686
it like sends or it receives and sends.

70
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,755
Like you said that, that

71
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:18,205
I think there's about five major technologies in it.

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,970
Like near fill contact infrared radio.

73
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,729
It's on the website,

74
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,580
I'll put it if you just go to the flipper zero

75
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:28,690
website and you scroll down maybe past what the top is.

76
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:32,660
It, it lists everything it does and it is ridiculous. And it's amazing

77
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,169
that does many things.

78
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,699
And the beautiful thing is too. It's like the Raspberry Pi in that

79
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,899
there's that ecosystem now of all the people writing code for it.

80
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,449
So I don't have to because I'm lazy.

81
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:42,940
I

82
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,210
hate writing code

83
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:48,380
and that's the other thing that sold me on it is I realized like I can buy the flipper

84
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,380
zero and then just kind of wait for everybody else to do the work and I download it.

85
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,429
No really.

86
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,550
That's like 90% of my it strategy is wait for somebody

87
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,220
else to build it and then buy it from them.

88
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,610
I guess it's a strategy

89
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,059
for most of the developers who just like

90
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:02,574
stack

91
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:02,774
overflow

92
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:03,214
c face.

93
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,964
Like you never stop doing this no matter how senior you are.

94
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:09,074
It's, it's actually was like our,

95
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,604
like the original original idea when it was

96
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,154
like just sitting having a beer with my partner

97
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:17,394
Paul discussing things. And uh we like

98
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,049
uh we're looking for like product ideas and stuff and uh like the original idea

99
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:29,100
was just about that you pack all the like cyber security uh technologies you,

100
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,700
you usually need in the field, right?

101
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:35,480
If you like a person who sets up a um access control system in an office

102
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,929
and you have like a F ID or NFC cards

103
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,769
and uh you

104
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,649
uh want to like penetration test it, right?

105
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,589
Like to understand how safe it is, how, how easy it is to hack

106
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,100
and usually like cyber security professionals who does

107
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:53,850
it like the physical kind of stuff,

108
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:56,489
they don't have the tools that they don't have ready tools,

109
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,220
they just build them using Arduinos,

110
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,369
Raspberry Pis, bunch of models, bunch of fires

111
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,190
and it just simply unreliable so you, like, you build this stuff,

112
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,369
you put it in your pocket or you put it in your backpack,

113
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:12,809
it gets, it gets messy and uh it just doesn't work like after 12 times.

114
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,489
So the original idea just was centre around this, like we need to do,

115
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,730
like we need to pack all of them.

116
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,950
Like it shouldn't be too complicated,

117
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,809
but it should be packed in one device

118
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:27,410
and it should be reliable, easy to use and with the screens with the buttons,

119
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,290
you know, like pro production quality.

120
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:32,209
And after that, it evolved with a like playfulness,

121
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:32,850
tama

122
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,390
goa cheese and everything else. Just you know,

123
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:39,429
it's a small thing, but I love that. It's not a box like it's got that kind of

124
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,869
kind of Star Trek,

125
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:44,609
whatever. I don't know what to call that shape like that kind of science fiction

126
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,029
angle shape.

127
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,869
No, I like it.

128
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,510
It's it's comfortable in the hand and it's not just like a little rectangle.

129
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,750
Alright. Alright. So

130
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,029
let's let's

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,929
you mentioned some of the history of this Alex. So I'm

132
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,619
I'm curious

133
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,089
like how long are we talking from, you know,

134
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,839
you and friends talking in a pub until a

135
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,269
flipper zero being released because I'm sure this,

136
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,350
this almost certainly took some time and I'm sure there's some crazy anecdotes

137
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,309
along the way.

138
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,559
Yeah, that's the show.

139
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,190
So I I think like our original conversation I mentioned it was like

140
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,549
October 2019.

141
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,869
Oh man, that's like

142
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,839
something was about to happen, I think in October.

143
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,089
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you see

144
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,720
where

145
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:29,579
it was going

146
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,519
and uh we published our first article about the device.

147
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:36,500
So the strategy was like we need to like idea

148
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,200
sounds cool to us, but when

149
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,660
there like a market for it and so it is like people who wants it

150
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,290
and there's enough people.

151
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,200
And so in December we prepared like the, you know, the first designs,

152
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,540
it was very far from what we have now, but

153
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,529
it uh showed like it's uh

154
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:57,980
uh showcase the idea and what we device looks like. And uh what can I do?

155
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,130
And we published it in uh December, I think,

156
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,489
and uh the reaction was like good enough for us to pursue this idea further.

157
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,989
But then of course COVID ca me and uh that's

158
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,529
messed with our plans a bit because like most of our

159
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,450
prototyping stuff and everything was in China.

160
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:24,089
All the logistics stop lockdowns, we cannot go out. But the like the situation was

161
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,239
not like in favor of us because like we had another businesses at

162
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,750
the point and uh all the businesses wasn't like performing good enough.

163
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,339
So that,

164
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,640
that's why we were like looking for product ideas

165
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:36,970
because we decided that like service business is like,

166
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,920
doesn't work for us anymore

167
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,149
or we are like, not good at it.

168
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,109
And we're like, ok, let's do products,

169
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:48,269
products sounds much more fun and more like suitable for um our ways of doing.

170
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:53,820
And so we like, we, we pushed like all, all the resources we had to it.

171
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,140
And by

172
00:07:56,299 --> 00:08:02,540
July 30th, we launched a Kickstarter campaign. We uh

173
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:08,100
we raised uh around $5 million. It was like a huge success, very

174
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,510
unexpected. Like we, we had some numbers, right?

175
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,019
You can calculate depending on how much, like how many leads you have,

176
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,220
how like uh people react and

177
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:17,369
all,

178
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:22,450
but the numbers were like, not even close to what we've got after that.

179
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,890
Yeah. And um,

180
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:27,570
so the company was like 30 days

181
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,369
and then we,

182
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,570
we needed to actually like to finish developing

183
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,049
those stuff because we had the prototype,

184
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:33,400
right?

185
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,090
But like,

186
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:36,840
I don't know how much, you know about Kickstarter, but

187
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,489
when I actually saw it on Kickstarter, I was like, oh, I want this but then like,

188
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,159
it almost sounded too good to be true.

189
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,250
And I've like, I've seen a lot of hardware on Kickstarter just,

190
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,885
it doesn't work. Yeah.

191
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,945
And so I, I didn't actually fund the Kickstarter

192
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:52,955
and I waited for it to actually be released,

193
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,984
which then was very annoying because it was sold out in Canada for a

194
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,965
very long time and I had to wait quite a while to get one.

195
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:01,844
Ok? I just pulled up your Kickstarter.

196
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:07,075
It says 4.8 million pledged of $60,000 goal.

197
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:10,085
So you beat that a little bit, a little bit.

198
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,979
Well, 6060 60,000 was like optimistic.

199
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,630
You usually like you usually in Kickstarter you do like you go,

200
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,059
you lower your goal a little bit because just because of the

201
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,369
uh to, you know, to me

202
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,619
up is a Kickstarter algorithm.

203
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,280
Like, because like if you, if you reach your goal pretty fast,

204
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:34,789
it gets you up on a like main page, it gets you.

205
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,159
Uh

206
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,400
so more people see it. So we put like 60,000. It was like,

207
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,849
you know, the minimum, the bare minimum, like you just like make a few devices,

208
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,809
send it and you forget about it.

209
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,309
But you like basically did more like a few 100,000 for any serious enough device.

210
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,059
Serious enough consumer electronics.

211
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,320
That's what always gets me when I see when I see these so called quote un,

212
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,929
quote simple devices.

213
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,229
Yeah,

214
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,000
you have to make tens or hundreds of thousands

215
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,580
of them to actually make money doing it.

216
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,640
And it's like that, I'd find that terrifying.

217
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,789
-- Yeah. Yeah,
-- exactly.

218
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,169
So that's,

219
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,960
that's a plastic injection molds like tens of thousands of dollars depending on

220
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:13,599
the device can be hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on the device.

221
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:17,549
And the factory you work with plus chip shortage at the moment with the COVID and all.

222
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,679
It's like just terrible. It's the wild west because you cannot get any cheap.

223
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,510
-- Yeah,
-- because you're like the cars in the washing machine

224
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:25,895
guys where like one missing chip in the device

225
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:29,455
may not work at all or have really limited functionality.

226
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:30,945
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So it's

227
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,526
-- like,
-- yeah, we'll just ship it without the screen. No big deal.

228
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:34,255
Yeah.

229
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:34,476
Yeah.

230
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:34,895
So,

231
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:39,236
so nowadays everybody design devices using like they

232
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,325
have this problem in mind right now,

233
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:41,596
right?

234
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:42,935
They remember it happened.

235
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:46,476
So you have like an alternative to pretty much everything, right?

236
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,776
Except maybe MC U or CPU, you have,

237
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:53,392
it's like an integral part but you just secure it as uh as uh as much as possible.

238
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:55,101
But everything else should be like hot

239
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,151
swappable with two or three alternatives.

240
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:59,581
That's what we were doing like in process like

241
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,942
just changing it and uh finding new ones.

242
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:02,041
But

243
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:02,692
like,

244
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:05,872
so this is what was crazy at some point.

245
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:10,132
We so we have the screen and it's like a sandwich produced by some factory,

246
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:12,531
but it's consists of like controller

247
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:14,221
unit, it consists of uh

248
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,539
uh other other parts and this controller,

249
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,770
it's like it, it's uh just in one day, they just canceled it,

250
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,390
they were producing it and they were like, OK, we have a shortage, we had a newer one.

251
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,650
We need to allocate this uh production uh production capabilities.

252
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,169
We have to the newer one. So the old one, we just cancel it right now.

253
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:40,010
And so uh we just lost the, the display

254
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:42,650
in one day and we had to finance the

255
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,729
development of the same display with this new chip.

256
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:50,409
But this just illustrates how, how crazy it was at the moment like everything

257
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,890
were like falling apart in process. You were developing it.

258
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,369
So it was crazy.

259
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:57,030
Unbelievable.

260
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:03,869
Ok. I, as much as I would love to dwell on, on how we got to where we are today.

261
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,530
The, the actual reason you're here

262
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:10,590
and this is where I'm completely blaming Kurt for all of these problems

263
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,450
is

264
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,544
the flipper Zero has been in the news a bit lately for things that can't do

265
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:19,465
that. It's being blamed.

266
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:24,065
Not, I would say hilariously, but I'm sure it's not hilarious for you at all.

267
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:27,424
Kurt trying to raise his finger and interrupt ha ha Kurt. It's your fault.

268
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:32,224
Technically, if you take it apart and rewire the whole thing, it can

269
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:34,864
potentially do what the Canadian government claimed. It does.

270
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:37,284
But this is also true of like

271
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:38,125
dishwasher.

272
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,070
Right.

273
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:40,640
Exactly.

274
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:45,130
I'm gonna rewire my dishwasher to steal cars very practical.

275
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,419
And just,

276
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,289
and so,

277
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,760
and

278
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,429
so the reason car theft is such a big problem in Canada

279
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,659
right now is it is a big problem in Canada right now.

280
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:57,090
But the justice minister had her car stolen now three times in three years.

281
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,729
And so now it's actually a problem affecting

282
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,419
the people who kind of run the country and the justice system.

283
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,260
And so now it's officially a problem that we have to, you know,

284
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,309
we must do something about, it's in the news and everything.

285
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:07,794
Right.

286
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,094
And so that's basically to put it bluntly,

287
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:13,414
that's why car theft and the flipper Zero thing all started blowing up in Canada

288
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,005
is,

289
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:14,354
yeah,

290
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:17,854
largely because the justice minister's car got stolen three times in three years.

291
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:18,145
Oops.

292
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:22,354
Ok, Alex, why don't you like, lay it all out there for us?

293
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:26,695
Tell us all the, all the silly things going on and all the, all the, I guess, blame

294
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,434
-- that flipper Zero seems to get here.
-- Yeah.

295
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:35,135
So the Minister of Science Innovation and Industry, I think

296
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,400
uh th they, they held this uh car

297
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,830
summit right? Because you guys got 100,000 cars stolen each year,

298
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,419
which is crazy.

299
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,059
And um

300
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,500
yeah, he ca me out and he said uh well, you know this f Flipper Zero device.

301
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:51,539
Well,

302
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:57,130
we're gonna ban it and they basically put a blame on us that like 600,000

303
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,929
cars got stolen because Flipper Zero ca me out like in uh t 2020 2021

304
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,950
or something.

305
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,900
And uh uh he uh blamed us on something that Flipper can't actually do cause like

306
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:11,400
uh Flipper can't

307
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:16,049
help you steal any car produced after 19 nineties

308
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,659
because like we cannot

309
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,539
do rolling oats which is like very ancient technology,

310
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:26,119
but

311
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:29,450
they accused us to visit and um

312
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,400
yeah, it was hilarious. It was insane. It was stupid. You can call it any anyhow. But

313
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,419
what we think is like very, it's very weird, you know,

314
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:41,979
because you say it's like the minister of justice get free cars,

315
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:45,859
cars stolen So like if you wanna address the problem, you should do it properly,

316
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:46,320
right?

317
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,099
But uh addressing

318
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,380
was like super populistic like let's plan this little toy

319
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,580
for $100 because it gets 100,000 cars to we we never

320
00:14:55,786 --> 00:15:01,085
like sold enough units in Canada to get so much car stolen. You know.

321
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:03,366
-- Well,
-- and what really, to be blunt,

322
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,166
what really proves that it's not your fault is the, I forget what the name is,

323
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:08,806
is essentially the Canadian Insurance Institute or whatever.

324
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:09,346
It's the, you know,

325
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:12,645
the conglomeration of insurance companies here basically said,

326
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,005
yeah, no, that's not the problem.

327
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:17,445
The problem is the cars are too easy to steal and the carmakers need to,

328
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,565
you know, have the

329
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,166
microchips and the keys and you know, the lock codes and

330
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:21,892
that so that,

331
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:23,671
yeah, you can't steal them easily.

332
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,591
And so like even like to put it bluntly when

333
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:28,271
the insurance companies say the correct security solution is this,

334
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,111
they're usually they're the ones with the data.

335
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:30,591
Yeah.

336
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:31,091
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

337
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:31,702
they,

338
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,791
and they're also the ones on the hook for paying for it. So

339
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,981
-- they tend to actually say what will work.
-- Yeah. Yeah,

340
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:42,452
I guess more problem is like the export procedures because all

341
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:46,622
these cars that get exported out to like uh Mina region,

342
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:47,978
North Africa,

343
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:52,778
Middle East. But if you can like actually steal a car and export it so easily,

344
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:55,377
it's like, it's like organized crime style.

345
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:57,968
Like you got some regulation problems.

346
00:15:58,148 --> 00:15:59,848
It's like, not about the device.

347
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:02,848
It's kind of a public secret in Canada that the gangs,

348
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,617
the organized crime runs the ports in Montreal

349
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:07,898
and are exporting like CBC.

350
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:09,487
Literally a few weeks ago, did a,

351
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:12,328
an investigative thing where they went to Africa and they found

352
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:16,383
Canadian cars with like Canadian license plates still on them,

353
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,843
you know, like parking takes for like Toronto parking lots and stuff because yeah,

354
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:20,494
like, what are you going to do?

355
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:23,484
Like, phone the local cops and be like, hey, I found a stolen car from Canada. Like,

356
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,323
why, why are you bugging us?

357
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:25,763
Right.

358
00:16:25,773 --> 00:16:29,833
And so, yeah, they found thousands of cars being shipped out of the port of Montreal,

359
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:30,643
for example.

360
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,294
Um, they just recently, you know, they ended up, uh,

361
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:36,083
seizing about 600 of them over a period of a while,

362
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:37,883
but no arrests were made.

363
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,039
Like,

364
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,349
and so it's kind of an open secret in Canada that we

365
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,679
have a very significant organized crime slash car theft problem because like,

366
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,440
well, there's money to be made there and it's nobody's getting arrested for it.

367
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:47,989
So it's like,

368
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,000
yeah,

369
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:50,450
it is what it is.

370
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,489
And yeah, it's definitely not the flipper. Zero's fault.

371
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,729
And what's really fascinating to me is they

372
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:56,409
then the Canadian government to save face.

373
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:59,820
I don't know if you saw, but they walked it back and said we're now going to target, uh,

374
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,540
you know, the unauthorized use or the illegal use of the flipper zero.

375
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,608
So kind of like burglary tools. Like I own a crowbar, I own a sledgehammer.

376
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:08,780
These are legal to own.

377
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,244
But like if I'm walking around at three in the morning with them and there's,

378
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:12,925
you know, cars being broken into,

379
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:16,286
I'm going to be arrested for possession of burglary tools.

380
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:20,165
You know, even though they are like, you buy them at Home Depot or Lowe's or whatever.

381
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:25,185
And I think that's still, I don't know, I, what I keep coming back to is like, they,

382
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:26,536
it's not even shooting the messenger.

383
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,955
It's like you basically,

384
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:31,355
well, and it's not like you even showed that it was insecure you're to, doesn't even

385
00:17:31,462 --> 00:17:33,062
break into these systems

386
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,962
and yet, yeah, they're holding you responsible for it.

387
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:37,001
-- Yeah,
-- exactly.

388
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:37,791
I don't know.

389
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:41,552
We, we, we don't, we don't know exactly what, what they mean by, like,

390
00:17:41,572 --> 00:17:45,641
not banning but restricting the use to legitimate actors.

391
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:50,661
Like, would it mean what you said it means or would it mean like a separate

392
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,322
licensing?

393
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:53,750
We don't know yet?

394
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,930
They don't respond to our questions so we like, can, can, can tell you right now.

395
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,369
Well,

396
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,469
and somebody pointed out like you can buy all the

397
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:04,050
components to essentially build your own flipper zero for like,

398
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,069
tens of dollars and solder it together.

399
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,910
It's right. There's,

400
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,020
there's the secret sauce of the flipper.

401
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,069
Zero is a very common secret sauce of you guys. Made it nice and easy

402
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:17,380
and it just works like you open up the box, you turn it on. No, that's it like you,

403
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:17,880
that's it.

404
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,709
I, that's, I loved it when I, you know, I literally opened up the box,

405
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,920
turned it on and I'm like

406
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:26,099
bloop. Oh, cool. And, you know, tried scanning the cat to find out what his number was

407
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:27,839
but he was too fat. I couldn't find it.

408
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,939
I, I want to

409
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:34,859
interrupt when all of this went down. Flipper Zero.

410
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:42,420
Put a, like animated GIF on Twitter where you used what AAA bit of wire and a head

411
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,599
jack to functionally show how to sniff car codes of the I, I'm curious,

412
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:51,050
like it's an amazing example.

413
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,500
Who did it?

414
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,630
I don't even know what to ask here other than like,

415
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,130
it was freaking awesome and good job.

416
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,839
Thank you. It's our team's work. Like we were brainstorming.

417
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,160
Like, how can we show them in most absurd way

418
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:06,209
that you can

419
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,290
use any

420
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,339
piece of electronics,

421
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,989
any piece of modern electronics right now and use it to actually catch a signal,

422
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,949
copy it and like hack it in the Canadian government's understanding.

423
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,699
Yeah. One of the ideas was like, what if we just cut it like piece of uh

424
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:28,270
with a 3.5 millimeter de and uh try to catch a,

425
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,300
like a red signal cause like basically it's an antenna, right?

426
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,140
It's like a, just a, just a normal antenna

427
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,709
and if you cut it like on a uh right lens,

428
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:40,140
you can catch a signal on the right frequency which we did.

429
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:43,380
And actually the sound card of the computer,

430
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,170
it catches it as a sound. So you can see the spikes if you like filter it

431
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:49,650
off,

432
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,760
you can actually decode the signal

433
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:53,839
inside.

434
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:58,030
Use some s uh software for radio signals which will trans

435
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,010
uh w which will transform it to like uh the code,

436
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,530
right?

437
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,069
Zeros and ones.

438
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,109
And that would be the same signal as Felipe zero

439
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,270
signals.

440
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,319
That, that's a great example. I loved it too.

441
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:16,109
Like, because it a big congrats to the team for Friday night. It was great.

442
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,060
It's so, I've no lie.

443
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,030
Watch that gif I bet more than 20 times because

444
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,010
it's just so utterly amusing every time I see it,

445
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:26,469
that actually brings up a good point.

446
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm kind of wondering if,

447
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,219
maybe that's part of the problem is like

448
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,599
capturing and decoding and signals processing 2030 years ago

449
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:35,680
was like tens of thousands of dollars of equipment, you know,

450
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,699
like I had a friend who actually bought an oscilloscope that

451
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:40,040
cost as much as a car back in the day.

452
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:44,099
And now you can get those things for like 70 bucks and they plug into your ipad,

453
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,439
you know,

454
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:47,599
and I think maybe that's part of the problem is that like,

455
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:52,099
the radio technology went from, you know, tens or $50,000 to sure.

456
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:53,089
Here's like a little 100

457
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,512
-- thing that does all of them
-- I think you're on to something,

458
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,792
but I don't think you're barking up quite the right tree.

459
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:01,272
And, and this is kind of the question for Alex.

460
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:07,512
I think in terms of we'll say very next gen hacking devices. Flipper zero is

461
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:12,613
by far the most advanced and probably in the very front of the pack.

462
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:16,512
And we can look back in time. There were hacking things, you know, like you had meta,

463
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:20,432
you had various cult of the dead cow utilities, there was like back orifice.

464
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:21,453
There's been

465
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:21,843
any

466
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:25,985
an enormous number of technologies that have always taken blame

467
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:29,456
as being somehow bad and they're going to ruin

468
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,546
the world and they're going to corrupt our Children.

469
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:33,026
But the reality is

470
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:36,505
all of these things that happened in the past are

471
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:39,385
easily responsible for some of our,

472
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:42,515
we'll say improved security because it's always very cat and mouse,

473
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:47,105
right where Flipper Zero is now created an environment

474
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:50,615
where organizations with terrible security

475
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,790
have to fix it because it,

476
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,420
it's just like you a five year old can use this stuff to like hack, you know,

477
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,170
terrible RF ID usage or, or, or whatever NFC S and so

478
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,189
this I think is

479
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:04,069
the

480
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,069
amazing thing Flipper Zero is doing for society.

481
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,339
But I'm also curious on your thoughts on this because

482
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:13,530
I think we're going to look back in 10 or 20 years

483
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:17,449
and we're going to see that Flipper Zero was directly responsible for cleaning

484
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:20,390
up a whole bunch of lazy and terrible security we have today.

485
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,969
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

486
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:26,619
That's what's, uh that's, that's uh how we formulate our like, you know,

487
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,040
um mission that we have kind of

488
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,199
that like to,

489
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:35,219
to increase the awareness of like the importance of cyber security around you.

490
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,319
Cause like all the, all these digital systems around you

491
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:42,140
everywhere you use them every day, you go to Metro, you use your card,

492
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,189
you open your office door, you open your car, you open your

493
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,729
front door. It's like everywhere.

494
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:51,300
But we, we never think how vulnerable or how secure it is, right?

495
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,819
So we think about that you need to change your uh door keys,

496
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:56,510
time to time because it's like, you know,

497
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,660
the security got better and stuff. People like lock picking.

498
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:01,560
So you, you buy a new one

499
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,319
but people like, especially like in Canada and us,

500
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,280
they like they have garage doors and stuff

501
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,079
and it's like installed in 2019.

502
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,069
And then you don't even think about it that it can be vulnerable.

503
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,069
It can be easily hackable and stuff. And it's like

504
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:19,400
if these things can be hacked with $100 device,

505
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:20,829
it doesn't mean that it's like, yeah,

506
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:21,260
the

507
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,609
the device is uh crazy good or crazy sophisticated.

508
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:30,719
It's $100 device with the off the shelf components. Nothing too crazy.

509
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,410
It just popular enough. So if you know about it now

510
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,290
and that brings me back to the

511
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:36,520
tt

512
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,290
point Right. We like it, it got so mainstream now.

513
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,170
Everybody, like, seen Flipper a t, some point

514
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:48,930
and it makes people think about it. Oh, ok. If there's so many flippers around,

515
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,089
like, shouldn't I get one and check my garage door or my,

516
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,209
uh, car or something? And

517
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:58,280
how, how safe it is. Can it hack it?

518
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,910
And you actually play with it?

519
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,800
You, you like it, it's fun to, it's just fun and cool to use, right?

520
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,790
You like catch a signal and go wow, what is this?

521
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,650
Like the signals are all around me

522
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,170
uh every day, all the time, but I never like thought about it.

523
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,589
I never catched one and now you can do it and you can think like, what is this?

524
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,969
Why is this? How does it work? Is it safe? Is it not safe?

525
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:21,609
And that's, that's uh and um

526
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,369
yeah, the the we we were really happy and surprised about the

527
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:30,900
uh support we got after the Canadian ban, right? Because like all the cyber security

528
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:35,920
uh community in Canada and not in Canada, they just raged about it. Like the thing is

529
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,319
not, cannot even do this. And plus you're just making our lives

530
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,949
uh much harder to get like the devices like this and

531
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:47,209
you get the awareness of people about cyber security much lower,

532
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,270
right? So like the bad actors are always there.

533
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:53,589
Bad actors use much more sophisticated devices they buy on

534
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,959
black market and Canada doesn't do anything about it,

535
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:56,560
basically

536
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,050
use them to steal your cars.

537
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:03,050
But you never would know about it. You never think about it.

538
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,609
And you,

539
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:06,780
if you buy also like popular small $100 toys

540
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,859
that helps you to understand how it works.

541
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:11,160
You will be more vulnerable than before. Right?

542
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,959
Because you will be like, oh my God, what is this black magic? How did it seal my car?

543
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:17,849
So, I think it's very, very important

544
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,280
that people actually think about it. Right?

545
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,040
It's like with the internet, we know that there's fishing,

546
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,520
we know that there's like http S and stuff, we know we, we need to

547
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,300
secure things.

548
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:33,280
Otherwise our data got stolen. Otherwise we get our bank accounts hacked.

549
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,449
But be because only because it gets,

550
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:38,680
it gets happened like people get the security better.

551
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:41,839
So this is the same thing with the access control system around us

552
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,599
and, and look, everyone knows what it is. I've got teenage kids and

553
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,300
so I'll, I'll, I'll tell you my story.

554
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,829
Actually, I bought a flipper zero, not for any of the, the radio magic. It did.

555
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:54,300
I was at a, a hacker conference called Cipher

556
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,780
Con and they have got these like overly complex badges

557
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,300
and people hack on them and all this stuff.

558
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,579
And I was sitting at a table with some people working on it and

559
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:04,300
this guy takes out his flipper zero and the badge did you art.

560
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,439
And so he was using the

561
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,349
UAR reader on the flipper zero. I'm like, oh, holy crap. That thing does you art.

562
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,900
But then it has, like, a little,

563
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,770
someone wrote an oscilloscope app for it and he was looking at signals.

564
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,760
I'm like, holy crap. The things got an oscilloscope in it.

565
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,540
Like I'm in and I ordered one, like, on the spot right there because I was like, this,

566
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,880
like this, that's what I want.

567
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,310
I don't care about the radio, stuff.

568
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:25,040
Like, I'm, I'm too dumb for radio but, like, you are an oscilloscope. I'm in

569
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,050
and, and, but anyway, I, I get it and, like,

570
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,140
my teenage kids and all their friends are like, oh, you have a flipper Zero?

571
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,920
That's amazing. I'm like, how do you, how do you even know what this thing is? Like?

572
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,199
-- Exactly.
-- Exactly.

573
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,869
It's, it's, yeah, it's, everyone knows that. It's awesome.

574
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,579
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, young people love it a lot.

575
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:44,449
A lot of the times, like, people buy it, like, they see it on Tik Tok,

576
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:46,459
they buy it just because it looks cool.

577
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,410
They don't know what it is. Exactly.

578
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,829
And how to use it and they just, like, come to our Discord.

579
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,560
Hey, guys, I just, like, purchased. It just got the thing looks very cool.

580
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:57,040
I love the dolphin. But what I can actually do with it,

581
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:58,290
can you help me out?

582
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:03,444
And then people, like, uh, do you have any, any NFC cards on you or something?

583
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:07,984
And you know, people start exploring, start understanding how these things work.

584
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,505
So like it's, it's very, it's very,

585
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:13,515
it's very good for uh works great for education purposes

586
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:16,675
because it gets people really into it because it,

587
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:17,714
like, just looks cool.

588
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:18,574
It feels cool

589
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:24,984
and uh it helps to uh gather young people around it and uh make them educated.

590
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:26,170
That's, that's

591
00:27:26,589 --> 00:27:26,660
what we

592
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:28,160
need that

593
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,079
because one thing I've been noticing is

594
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,520
young people nowadays don't have computers that they can take

595
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,640
apart or rather you can take an ipad apart once,

596
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,989
-- right?
-- And then it's just done,

597
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:38,579
right?

598
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,640
And part of it too is like, it's subtle things like they're all waterproof now,

599
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,760
which means they're all glued together to be waterproof.

600
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,619
Right? There's no screws

601
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:47,364
and, and the flipper zero.

602
00:27:47,824 --> 00:27:48,165
No,

603
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:50,775
you're not pulling the old man on this cart because we

604
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:53,625
have raspberry pies and all this stuff like we never did

605
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:58,045
well. But, but technology by default used to be user serviceable

606
00:27:58,515 --> 00:27:59,625
and now it's,

607
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:02,574
you have to look for user serviceable technologies.

608
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:06,165
You have to look for, you know, things that actually like the flipper zero or like,

609
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:07,944
like, because you guys published the Schematics,

610
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:09,939
right? Like,

611
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,310
as far as I know, like every single technical thing is available off your website.

612
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,500
I remember browsing it quick and I was like, oh, that's ok. They published

613
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:19,579
all the Schematics and everything neat. Like

614
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,709
there's the alternative firmware

615
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,439
you can

616
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:23,339
run.

617
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,699
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Samsung's never gonna do that for my TV.

618
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,380
No,

619
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:29,660
no. All right. All right. We're coming to the end,

620
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:30,979
Alex.

621
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm gonna give you the last word on this one.

622
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:33,489
So, like,

623
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,579
is there anything you want the listeners to know about Flipper

624
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:40,020
devices or Flipper Zero or you kind of anything going on

625
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,699
and feel free to blame Canada as much as you want

626
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,859
for this part of it and it's completely Kurt's fault.

627
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,579
-- We
-- don't,

628
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,569
we don't want to blame anyone

629
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,280
here. Like, uh I just want to like this, it's not the first band we face, right?

630
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,780
Do we have another band from Brazil?

631
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:56,400
Which is also really

632
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:59,359
hilarious because like I talked with them and uh but

633
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:03,609
basically that likes the same government body like telecommunications agency.

634
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,939
And we had like a long conversation.

635
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:10,689
I had like a three hour call describing to them like what it actually can do,

636
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,310
how it can do it then

637
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:13,229
stuff.

638
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:15,319
And uh they were like, OK, we're like, we,

639
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:18,199
we're not ready to permit it for sales because we

640
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:21,489
think like the Brazilian people a re not educated enough to

641
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,550
know all the, all the dangers. And I was like,

642
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,050
uh

643
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,449
yeah.

644
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:31,680
Uh but we actually came to the conclusion that OK, let's try to like, certify it.

645
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,890
But then they

646
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,569
uh like in process of certification because they, they had this ban.

647
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:39,650
I was uh uh contacting

648
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,319
the certification labs like Kay guys, we need like Brazilian certification, blah,

649
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:43,660
blah blah.

650
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:46,780
And they were like, uh we have this band here online,

651
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,229
we cannot do any certification while it's there.

652
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,800
And I, and I'm going back to a telecommunication agency and saying, like,

653
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,130
can you please remove the paper or just tell

654
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,619
this uh is this particular labs that's like,

655
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,099
uh disregarded?

656
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,810
And they just ignore me,

657
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,680
they just ignore me. Like after 10

658
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,800
labs, I just,

659
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,859
I just gave up. So like we're still

660
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:12,859
in Brazil. Another stupid example is uh Amazon who thinks we card skimming device

661
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:15,349
for some reason? Oh my goodness.

662
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:19,160
I think it might be noticeable if you tape one to the top of a

663
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,310
card reader

664
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,219
one day like this.

665
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:23,709
I don't know, but it,

666
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:27,750
it gets crazier and crazier because like recently just I think a month ago

667
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,540
uh Amazon bans

668
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,839
prototype ports which is like just where P CBS,

669
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,300
which are branded, branded by Flipper, we sell them and they ban them as well. So

670
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,219
I guess that's how Amazon works.

671
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:44,209
They just have a,

672
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:49,619
a building of legal people who are not technically educated in any way.

673
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,060
They just

674
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:52,665
bad news and they're like, ok, we're going to ban it

675
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:57,464
and there's no person to talk to. It's like no one, you just, you just send

676
00:30:57,594 --> 00:31:00,824
messages to a black hole and you go somewhere

677
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,604
and you get another answer which says no,

678
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:03,824
you're still banned, sorry,

679
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:05,425
you can try to appeal again

680
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:06,425
and

681
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:11,025
we're in this situation. So like any big company or government is not

682
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,780
doing enough due diligence and like technology stuff,

683
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,719
they eventually um put their attention to us and try to bind us.

684
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:23,880
We're really happy and we're really thankful for the Canadian community,

685
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,599
everyone who signed the petition

686
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,609
uh for uh uh helping us to fight it.

687
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:33,810
And that Felipe is not actually banned in Canada just because of all of you guys.

688
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,349
It's great to see

689
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,349
and we hope

690
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,910
it's gonna, it's gonna

691
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,920
change something in people's minds,

692
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,829
in government minds and think more about these things that's useful

693
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,349
and needed for society than dangerous.

694
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,670
-- Yes,
-- indeed. Think of all the free advertising you get right.

695
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,729
All the stupid

696
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:54,349
politics.

697
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,020
Yeah,

698
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:59,160
I think you raise a really important point because

699
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,660
I cannot think of any other way that, like,

700
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,130
ham radio licenses are on the decline in North America.

701
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,229
Like,

702
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:07,060
people are not getting into radio because it's

703
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:09,130
just not kind of interesting and fun anymore.

704
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,140
Like, if I want to talk to somebody across the world

705
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:14,579
that's easy. Like we all have signal whatsapp telegram

706
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:14,849
a

707
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:16,890
million options online.

708
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,219
And like when it comes to radio, like,

709
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,050
yeah,

710
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,199
radio is kind of complicated and I would not want to try and have

711
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:26,489
a child build one of these from scratch that seems cruel and unusual.

712
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,170
And so giving them a flip or zero where they can interact with it. Program it,

713
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,969
yeah, I can't imagine any other good on ramp to becoming

714
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,699
like to understanding radio

715
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,709
and you can take care of the dolphin.

716
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,290
Dolphin is cool.

717
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:42,060
All right, I'm calling this one

718
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:45,310
