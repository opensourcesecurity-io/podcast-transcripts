Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:10,810
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:13,100
-- Josh
-- Pressers. All right. I'm excited today.

3
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,420
We have Jay Jacobs, one of the creators of EP Ss Ss on the show.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,639
-- Jay. Welcome to the show,
-- man.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Hey, thanks for having me. Glad to finally be on here with you guys.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,139
It's funny because

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,215
epss, this is becoming like a, a very, I, I think

8
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:30,864
important topic and vulnerabilities and I look back, I'm like, holy crap.

9
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,444
We've almost, we've done almost nothing about it on, on here,

10
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:34,825
which is kind of surprising to me.

11
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,095
But

12
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:36,095
regardless

13
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:39,494
that makes me happy because you're here and you're like, you're the pro.

14
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:43,294
So let's start at the beginning. What does VPs SS stand for? And what is it?

15
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:47,319
It is the exploit prediction scoring system

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,369
and it does the, the best that it can trying to exactly as the name implies,

17
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,209
predicting

18
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:59,349
exploitation activity in the wild specifically over the next 30 days.

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,090
One quick clarifying question.

20
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:06,110
So this is exploitation by bad guys or who like pen testers.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah,

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,830
that's a very important question because essentially we

23
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:12,430
have to start talking about the data behind epss

24
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:17,019
because it is I I was very clear to say exploitation activity,

25
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:21,260
not necessarily first uh successful exploitations because we're

26
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:23,919
getting honey pots that will never be exploited

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,040
or shouldn't be exploited.

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,839
And then DS IP S uh devices, you know,

29
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:32,739
that will typically like IP S typically will block most of the activity.

30
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:33,830
And

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,870
to your point

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,150
when you see a packet coming into your

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,839
network probing or trying to exploit something,

34
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,589
you have no idea.

35
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,730
If it's an academic researcher trying to catalog what is good and you know,

36
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:48,069
like that stuff or if it is a malicious thing, so you have no idea.

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,550
And so

38
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:52,029
it is just pure exploitation activity.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,639
I want to ask about epss versus CV SS because I think

40
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,709
CE Ss is the kind of dominant rating system we have today.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,860
And I think it is universally hated by all security people.

42
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:06,129
Yeah,

43
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:10,470
I don't know if I would say I hate it, but I, I think everybody has an opinion

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,309
-- about
-- a negative opinion about,

45
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:13,800
can I

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,589
for a thought?

47
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,990
It's,

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,779
I think CBS has made a lot of sense when it

49
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:22,300
was created and for what it was created because for example,

50
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,970
as a security, especially when we worked at Red Hat,

51
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:29,539
99% of all I cared about is, is this network or not network

52
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,160
and authenticated or not authenticated?

53
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:35,479
Like I need those two questions answered for every vulnerability I'm,

54
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,529
I'm processing and

55
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,080
CV SS is actually quite useful for that.

56
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,000
And

57
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,899
same thing when I worked at I saw and I defense.

58
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,729
But I think the problem is because it's the only shoe we have.

59
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,330
Everybody ended up trying to climb Mount Everest in that shoe.

60
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,649
Totally. Yes.

61
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,789
So my, my take on it to your point, Kurt,

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,160
I think that the individual metrics are super useful.

63
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,960
And I would, I really hope that that maintains forever

64
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:05,410
to have somebody go in and say, hey, this is network accessible or hey, this is,

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,589
this does require some type of prerequisite or something like that.

66
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,600
Um I think that's really, really helpful, but I think where it starts to fall down is

67
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,250
except the two things, one, it produces a score and prior to version four,

68
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,389
the way that score is produced is

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,520
interesting. And then

70
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:26,899
the other challenge is that it, it is a one thing for everything.

71
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:30,259
Um And so people would use it and typically just the base

72
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,500
score not get into the environmental and the threat stuff and just say

73
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:36,800
this base score represents risk even though

74
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:41,869
like the, the documentation of CV SS says it's not risk, everyone uses it at risk. And

75
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,179
you know, I mean, honestly, it is risk.

76
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,899
-- I mean, that's what they're trying to measure.
-- We don't have anything else

77
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,100
to do.

78
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:48,979
We don't,

79
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,820
there's no other 0 to 10 number than a manager wants on a spreadsheet to offer them

80
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,339
unless well, now there's a new one,

81
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,339
right?

82
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,419
And Epss though, specifically is exploitation activity.

83
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:03,130
So, like we just said, the base score,

84
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,669
no one gets into the environmental and the threat stuff.

85
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,699
Epss is just that threat side.

86
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,399
It has no idea about the context of the vulnerability, the value of the asset,

87
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,639
what's behind it, what's around it?

88
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:17,760
-- None of that is just the threat.
-- Yes. And, and so let's talk about that.

89
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,720
What is like, what does that mean? What does it mean to

90
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,959
detect exploit ability? How does that process work?

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,970
So

92
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,320
-- you mean like the data that we're collecting or kind of
-- the machine? Right?

93
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:30,980
Because you collect data and then you do stuff with

94
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:33,019
the data and then you output a score essentially,

95
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,380
-- but you don't output a score for every CV E
-- no, every CV.

96
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,619
Oh It is every CV E

97
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:42,399
-- the initial version was not every CV E
-- oh cool. I didn't, I didn't know that.

98
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,619
That's good. I learned something new.

99
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,179
Yeah, we're on the, we're on the third version of the Epss model.

100
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:48,585
Soon to be

101
00:04:48,716 --> 00:04:51,325
3.1 or four. So I don't know, something like that.

102
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:55,055
Nice. All right. So anyway, explain the machine to us then what does that look like?

103
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:55,246
Yeah.

104
00:04:55,506 --> 00:05:01,485
Yeah. And so we get as much data as I can possibly collect and

105
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:05,825
maybe it'll help actually go back to version one because there was initially a paper

106
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:10,466
I think it was 2019 presented at Black hat where we presented this paper

107
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:15,351
on the first epss version and we had CBS S in mind.

108
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,231
And so I did a bunch of data collection and we were working with,

109
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,671
I was doing work with Kenna at the time consulting and,

110
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:23,631
and doing some research for him and publications and

111
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,552
they had a bunch of data about vulnerabilities.

112
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:27,471
And we had another client that I was working with,

113
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:29,391
that had a bunch of exploitation activity

114
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:30,671
and Kenna had some of their own.

115
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:33,631
I was like, hey, we could bring these together and create a little prediction thing.

116
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,609
And so

117
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,589
essentially, the first time we were like, all we want people to calculate a score.

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,820
So we're gonna make this as the word was parsimonious as parsimonious as possible,

119
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:43,089
right?

120
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:46,970
The fewest number of variables that would create a good model.

121
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,609
And I think we had 16 variables or something

122
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:50,450
and

123
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,450
we created just a simple uh logistic regression which

124
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:57,250
is like one variable has a weight and that weight

125
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,130
can be combined in a certain way that you

126
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,380
end up with a probability between zero and one.

127
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,309
And

128
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,200
so we expected people to have a spreadsheet

129
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:09,299
and to implement this in the spreadsheet and go get these 16 variables,

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,920
right?

131
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,670
And you get the, the humor

132
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,769
right, right off the bat. And,

133
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,859
and this was problematic and so largely it was just sort of an academic exercise,

134
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,089
release this paper.

135
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,790
And then Sasa Romanoski who works at rand,

136
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,790
um him and I were talking about this and he's one of the

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,250
co-author on the original paper.

138
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,109
I mean, he's like, we should,

139
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,589
we should make a go of this and bring this into like first or some group and

140
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,000
stand up a group around this to really help build out what this model can do.

141
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,130
And so we did that and we started having meetings and then

142
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,250
it dawned on me that like this is no longer a spreadsheet world, right? This is

143
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,859
live api S everyone's connected.

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,809
Why aren't we just calculating this in one central location?

145
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,790
Uh And so we started doing that, I started producing these scores daily,

146
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,640
given these 16 variables.

147
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,130
And the first model wasn't great,

148
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,489
it was better than CV SS specifically for exploitation activity.

149
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:02,899
Um And so

150
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,160
that's how it started.

151
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,390
Like with these 16 variables,

152
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,850
you would get them and the model would look at the exploitation activity

153
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,529
and then all this input variable and build a model,

154
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,730
derive those weights based on the outcomes, right?

155
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,910
Um And a very simple, you know,

156
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,290
like the regression was developed 200 years ago at this point.

157
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:23,850
Um So it's a 200 year old technique that we're doing in vulnerabilities.

158
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,750
And,

159
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,609
and that worked, I mean, like it was pretty good, it wasn't great,

160
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:32,000
uh really easy to find all these examples where Epss was terrible.

161
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,059
And so fast forward though, we started to centralize it.

162
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,959
And then I was like now that we're centralizing it.

163
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,179
Nobody is going to do this in a spreadsheet.

164
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,130
We can go crazy, right? We can

165
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,070
drop the whole regression simple model. Go to a much more complex model.

166
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,010
We can start to include

167
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,190
every variable,

168
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,989
every piece of data we can get our hands on because no

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,450
longer do we have to ask people to go get this data?

170
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,089
Right? They don't have to go look up if something hasn't met us white.

171
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,390
Um We're doing all of that for them and that's what it is now.

172
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,850
So the version two went to it was a I believe,

173
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,100
oh it was a GLM net um

174
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:04,790
Reg

175
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,190
and Lasso um thing.

176
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,029
Anyway,

177
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,350
so that had like 1000 variables in version two

178
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,149
and then version three,

179
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,519
we went to uh an X two boost model which has a iterative cycle to it.

180
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:23,250
And so one of the challenges is in version three,

181
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,269
a variable no longer has a single weight.

182
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,570
Um And so people say like, hey, what's the contribution of something being in meta

183
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,570
flight? And you're like, well, it depends on all the other variables.

184
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,340
Yeah, sure, sure.

185
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,770
Well, as it should I, that's one thing that's always drive me nuts is

186
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,609
like, it's this, it's this

187
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,900
really tightly linked in ecosystem of stuff with human actors

188
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:47,739
and

189
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,419
like there's humans making decisions like II I literally

190
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,820
their process for picking, you know,

191
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,500
what do we write an exploit for was literally like,

192
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,130
three people and then taking a smoke break and hashing it out.

193
00:08:58,349 --> 00:08:58,780
Right.

194
00:08:59,500 --> 00:08:59,969
Yeah.

195
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,799
But I mean, because, and people think there's like, some

196
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:06,960
big statistical, like, no, it's just like three guys in a room.

197
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,380
-- And
-- I think that is the case everywhere. By the way,

198
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:09,440
I

199
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,460
don't imagine how it would be anything but that, because, like,

200
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:13,830
yeah,

201
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,770
and I mean, like, what's interesting is something like

202
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:18,640
metas so a lot of the

203
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,590
threat intel type sources like metas

204
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,150
point where you've got humans

205
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,099
making a judgment about what to go watch for or to

206
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:27,549
write exploit for or to scan for anything like that.

207
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,280
A lot of the pen testing tools are this way,

208
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,960
they are highly efficient.

209
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,619
In other words, like a lot of what they choose,

210
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,809
we actually see exploitation activity in the case of metas

211
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,179
that might be causal.

212
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,570
Uh But

213
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,760
for, you know, like a pen testing tool

214
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,219
that is purely correlation.

215
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:43,940
And so, but their,

216
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,619
their decision to go look at or include this in their tooling or

217
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,900
something is a really good indicator that there's probably going to be activity,

218
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,859
but it's also like only a small fraction of what's actually being exploited.

219
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,049
Um So they're really efficient but they don't have really good coverage.

220
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:02,630
And these are terms that we talk about in A PSS, the efficiency and coverage

221
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,030
as we try to measure how good it's working.

222
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,179
And so, but back to the model,

223
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:10,580
um how it actually works. So that's this is how we're training it.

224
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,919
Now, we have all of this exploitation activity.

225
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,590
And the other thing is when we talk about exploitation activity,

226
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,520
we need that temporal aspect.

227
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:20,239
We need to know there was exploitation activity

228
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,520
last Sunday.

229
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:25,320
Uh And then was it on Saturday as well? The day before that?

230
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,520
And how did that look for the last two years?

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,280
And we need to know that whereas something like,

232
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,000
you know, you look at the Kev list and it says,

233
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:33,919
yep,

234
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:35,659
that's all you get.

235
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,500
Yes,

236
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,719
exploitation equals yes.

237
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,119
And that isn't helpful because

238
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,729
you know, I just released some research for the Epss A

239
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,619
saying that you know, what was it like?

240
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,859
50% of things marked as exploited were exploited in the last week,

241
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:52,869
we had evidence of this.

242
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,849
But then before that, we see roughly like 25%.

243
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:59,479
Can't remember the exact step, like 25%

244
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:02,080
were not seen exploited in like the last year.

245
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,520
So a quarter of the things that we saw

246
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,979
exploitation activity for out of like 14,000 CV ES,

247
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:09,950
we had evidence of exploitation activity.

248
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,250
25% were not seen exploited in the last year. So when somebody says, yes,

249
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:17,289
I want to say like still is it still exploited?

250
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,090
Let me make sure I understand what you just said because

251
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,669
I'm not real smart. So that feels like

252
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,859
over my head a little bit.

253
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:24,330
So you're saying if you look at all

254
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,739
of the vulnerabilities that we have exploitation data about

255
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,719
once they become, let's say, a year old,

256
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:37,849
75% kind of fall off the radar and are no longer being exploited by threat actors.

257
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:38,659
Well,

258
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,880
you got it, it's, it's way more complicated than that, unfortunately.

259
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,380
So that is not what you said

260
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:44,820
it.

261
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,090
Right. It's, it's pretty close though.

262
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,340
I mean, like I could say, yeah, that's, that works.

263
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:50,020
Um

264
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,440
Well, my one question because, OK, so like I know if you stand up a web server,

265
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,309
you'll see people still trying to hit front page.

266
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,809
Microsoft front page stopped existing,

267
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,159
I don't know, a decade or two ago

268
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,119
and

269
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,330
obviously there must still be installs of it

270
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,770
because people keep trying to s swack it.

271
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,229
Um But I'm assuming that there's like a lot of web software

272
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:12,489
that people just kind of give up on or stop trying,

273
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,880
which is weird to me because like, if I was an attacker,

274
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,150
I would just shock on that sucker.

275
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:16,830
Like,

276
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:18,409
right, because what's the downside?

277
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,719
And I guess one of my questions would be, is

278
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,000
these things that stop being, you stop seeing exploit activity for?

279
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,840
Is it

280
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,070
like, do they actually go away? Like are they gone?

281
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,270
Uh

282
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,299
I don't know,

283
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,820
you mean like the technologies go away or the exploits?

284
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:39,820
Yeah, like,

285
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,780
like are people not trying to break into Mazda cars anymore because there's no

286
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:45,750
more Mazda cars or is we're actually not seeing that kind of thing,

287
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,179
right?

288
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,239
I mean,

289
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:51,179
you got to remember like the the actors who are doing this have, you know,

290
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,609
cost versus benefit calculations, right?

291
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:54,179
And so

292
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,770
one of the things that we do notice is after

293
00:12:57,075 --> 00:13:00,645
a vulnerability is published, like in the first month of any,

294
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,075
any vulnerabilities life.

295
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,664
Um If you actually, if you look at the first month of all the vulnerabilities

296
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:08,445
and you have that sliding window whenever it was published,

297
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:11,044
there's a lot of variation.

298
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:14,505
There's a lot of trial and error that we see in exploitation activity,

299
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:17,924
we see people sort of trying something. There's, you know, like, I don't know.

300
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,640
Um So many of these have exploitation activity and they

301
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,640
sort of die out after a couple of months or,

302
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:24,989
you know,

303
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,229
maybe they start a year after it was published and

304
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,780
they try a couple of things and they're like,

305
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:30,390
hey, we're not getting a lot of hits on this,

306
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,229
let's try something else or something like that.

307
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:32,890
So,

308
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,400
and to clarify, when you say trying,

309
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:37,419
I'm assuming that they actually have a working exploit that they're

310
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,869
then trying to see if there's enough people to make it worth

311
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:43,140
using, like they're not trying to make a working exploit.

312
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,309
That's a theory.

313
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,940
Yeah.

314
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,359
Yeah.

315
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:46,890
So it's,

316
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,650
it's hard to know exactly what they're doing because

317
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,669
all we're getting is that the signature got triggered

318
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,099
generally. So getting motivation behind that is kind of hard. But yeah, I mean,

319
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,630
so we do see, like, activity

320
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,450
sort of sporadic at the beginning, a lot of variation.

321
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,349
But after, you know, like a year or two,

322
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:05,059
after publication it all sort of settles down.

323
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,789
And so, like,

324
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,909
week after week you're seeing the same things being

325
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,590
exploited for stuff that's more than two years old.

326
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:14,090
-- But you're
-- seeing more exploits for things two years

327
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,372
-- again. Like I, I wish I could say.
-- Yes.

328
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:17,692
That's fine. That's fine.

329
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:22,052
Well, I, I just heard we should only run software between one and two years old.

330
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:22,453
Right.

331
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:27,252
Well, I'm also wondering like, how much of this is Survivor bias of the data, right?

332
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:27,742
Because

333
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:30,333
I guess one could make the argument like log for Jay,

334
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,132
you know, cloud Fleer came out that post saying, oh, actually,

335
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:37,916
whoops, we saw this like, what, eight days or 11 days in advance or like over a week.

336
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:38,895
Um

337
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:40,976
And I'm kind of wondering because like,

338
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,085
they're not going to look for every single exploit to

339
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:45,116
see how many days in advance of it being public.

340
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,236
Was it exploited? Because

341
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:48,476
-- that would be a lot of work?
-- Yeah.

342
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:52,036
So this, that you're touching on some something that is

343
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:52,306
a

344
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:55,205
really interesting topic that the Survivor bias.

345
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:56,245
In other words, like

346
00:14:56,486 --> 00:15:00,306
we're seeing, are, are we seeing exploitation for the ones that we're looking for?

347
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:01,179
Right.

348
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,650
Because clearly, clearly with 240,000 CV ES right now,

349
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,809
we do not have a signature for all of them,

350
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,859
right? And we've got a signature. I think it's like 10 15% of those have a signature

351
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,049
for detection.

352
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:18,049
And so the question is like, what about the other 90% is that being exploited?

353
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,489
And the way we get around that is that there's nothing in epss

354
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:27,510
that says this particular vulnerability has been exploited in the past

355
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:31,469
if that makes sense. So we don't have that's a auto

356
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,500
aggressive feature saying like,

357
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,599
so like we know log for shell example is a great example,

358
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,380
like it would be great if we had a model set,

359
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,929
this is was exploited yesterday and the day before and the day before,

360
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,960
we're gonna expect it to be exploited tomorrow.

361
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,320
But epss does not do that specifically for this reason.

362
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:52,479
It basically says, hey, this is a vulnerability that has these attributes.

363
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:56,489
We know that exploit code is published here. It's got exploit code here.

364
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,520
It's this type of vulnerability CV SSS all these metrics

365
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:01,080
and we have all these attributes.

366
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,809
And then, and then the model says, hey, this looks like

367
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:07,849
a vulnerability that we see with exploitation activity

368
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,359
over on this side.

369
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,969
So even if something doesn't have a signature,

370
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:16,200
there's a really high, there's a chance that it may be rated highly

371
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,609
because we don't have that feedback loop directly in the scoring system.

372
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:21,299
Well,

373
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:23,179
because I was gonna ask like it from what I

374
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,479
read the paper and it doesn't sound like for example,

375
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:28,500
you're using the CIA known exploded vulnerabilities catalog

376
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:30,780
to kind of back feed into like OK,

377
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,669
like this was a good prediction because Kev saw it and I I'm also

378
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,940
guessing part of that is because the Kev didn't really exist when you started,

379
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:39,500
like it only literally,

380
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,880
it's only in what the last three months or

381
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,400
four months that they've actually been publishing data publicly.

382
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,080
And I'm curious now that they are doing that however,

383
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,349
and being a bit more gung ho on it,

384
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,090
is that something you're looking to maybe use as a

385
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:51,190
data source now that it is kind of useful.

386
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:53,580
It's in version 30 OK.

387
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:56,700
And what's interesting as I was talking about Epss

388
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,239
needs that temporal aspect and Kev doesn't have it.

389
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,760
Sorry, what do you mean exactly by that? Because that's something I think.

390
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:06,260
Yeah, first of all, what is temporal score mean in CV SS terms?

391
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,579
Yeah, ignore the CBS S temporal.

392
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,329
I'm just talking about a time aspect to exploitation activity.

393
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,598
So Kev like just says, it says here, I'm putting the CV E on the Kev list on this date.

394
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,819
And that's all you know,

395
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,900
and they're saying this is known to be exploited.

396
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,500
They're saying it's binary like there's

397
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,339
either exploitation activity or there isn't

398
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:28,599
right. And that's not the real world. I mean like the real world is we have super

399
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,719
bursts. We have

400
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:31,920
like I said, some are no longer exploited,

401
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,750
some are exploited like unbelievably everywhere.

402
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,670
Most of the time, all the time. And so it's, it's not a, it's not a yes or no thing.

403
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,689
And so Kev Kev is an Epss version three, but it is not an outcome variable.

404
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:45,660
Is, it is an indication.

405
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:47,902
We use it as an indicator.

406
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:48,863
In other words like a

407
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:54,522
CV E. So there's things on the Kev list that we do not see exploitation activity for.

408
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:55,892
-- Oh, interesting.
-- Yeah.

409
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:56,172
Yeah.

410
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:57,713
And that's one thing I was wondering because I,

411
00:17:57,723 --> 00:18:00,133
I assumed Kev kept their data close to the vest because they, you know,

412
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:01,052
the whole classic

413
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:04,652
uh what's the term uh sources and ways and means of collection, right?

414
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:07,326
Because they don't want to be like, oh yeah, this Kev was exploited,

415
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,005
Raytheon on this system one

416
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:10,796
versus this other one, you know, log

417
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:13,145
which like obviously being exploited.

418
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,406
And so,

419
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:14,845
right?

420
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:17,735
And that's the problem I've always wondered about these data sets is like, yeah,

421
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:22,475
it literally Stuxnet would be one in, you know, that would be no exploited versus

422
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,105
obviously they're not going to, you know,

423
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:27,265
probably put that on the list and they're certainly not going to give details about

424
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:27,725
it.

425
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:28,566
Yeah.

426
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:31,485
Yeah. And so that's the challenge, right?

427
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:35,755
Um We don't know if this was exploited once at one location or everywhere,

428
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:36,286
all the time.

429
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,979
Um And so when Epss uses it, it says, hey,

430
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:43,260
I've got this signal just like what analysts say,

431
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,989
hey, I've got this signal, something was added on the Kev.

432
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,449
Should I care about it

433
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:48,500
next month,

434
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,800
you know, or like it was added six months ago and this just popped up on my network.

435
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,989
Should I still care about it?

436
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,310
And that's what epss is doing.

437
00:18:56,489 --> 00:19:00,760
So you keep talking Jay about kind of the signal and the data you're looking at.

438
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:04,109
Where does this all come from? The feedback loop?

439
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,270
No, no, I mean, you're collecting like data on if something has been exploited,

440
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,689
where are you getting that from?

441
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:11,609
Because that's hard data to find

442
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,180
that is extremely hard data to find.

443
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,640
So a couple of sources, the big one is Fort

444
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:18,959
Fort,

445
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:22,349
you know, they've got 100,000 devices or something. Um

446
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,579
And they were,

447
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:26,219
they were an early partner and we've done a lot of consulting with them,

448
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:28,939
doing a lot of helping out with some of their research and stuff like that.

449
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,260
Um And so they were an early partner and

450
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:32,099
the way,

451
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,329
unfortunately, the way epss has traditionally gotten data is like for, for

452
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,609
that, I would send an email to the guy. I'm working with the for

453
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,819
and be like, hey, can

454
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,709
early on I was like, I'm building this new thing called epss.

455
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,819
Can I use your data to help train it? And I got an email back saying sure

456
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,369
because I had the date already, right? So this is the data sharing agreement

457
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,150
uh that we have in place, but we're working on, you know,

458
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,130
making that more official and things like that.

459
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,400
So we've got, fortunate

460
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,300
we've got Alien Vault, their, their OTX system behind the scenes reporting on,

461
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,660
on stuff that they're seeing.

462
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,979
We've got shadow server.

463
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:07,579
These are all on the website and I'm trying to do off the top of my head.

464
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,119
That's ok. I don't remember either.

465
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,650
But you, you have these data sources, right.

466
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,540
Yeah, they are not public except for shadow server. Um, gray noises in there

467
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,935
which I know some people complain about here and there, but I,

468
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:22,675
I'm OK with it. I think this is hard to find.

469
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:25,755
And if there's organizations willing to contribute, that's a pretty big deal.

470
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:26,295
I think.

471
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,415
I mean, I worked in this industry that data sells for a lot of money.

472
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:30,755
They're not going to give it away for free

473
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:32,655
because that's

474
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:33,535
literally

475
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:36,265
their business model is to not give it away for free.

476
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:38,275
So I could totally see them maybe letting you use it.

477
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:38,474
But yeah,

478
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:41,234
there's no way you're going to get to republish it because that would be insane,

479
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:41,905
right?

480
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:44,525
And that's one of the things like people always say, you know,

481
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,635
you know what's exploited, why don't you just tell us, I'm like,

482
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,354
I can't like we're using this data to try and

483
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,569
create something more than what's in the data. So,

484
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,209
-- um yeah,
-- so one question I have is

485
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:59,630
and maybe, you know, maybe you don't know, but the data you're collecting,

486
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,010
it sounds like would be

487
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,449
mostly dealing with sort of widespread

488
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:07,530
exploitation versus highly targeted attacks.

489
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,599
Would that,

490
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,949
is that fair to say?

491
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:14,750
-- Or or are you actually also catching indicators of highly targeted attacks?
-- So

492
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:19,750
one of the interesting things in a recent report that we released is we found,

493
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,859
I think it was like 75%

494
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:22,989
of

495
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,459
the exploitation activity that we captured

496
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,069
-- were seen at less than one in 10,000 devices.
-- Oh, wow.

497
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:32,089
So like

498
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:34,000
tiny, tiny fraction,

499
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:37,510
sorry, 75% at less than one in 10,000.

500
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:38,479
Yeah. So

501
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:42,189
three out of four vulnerabilities that we have exploitation activity for.

502
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,020
We're super sparse.

503
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,060
Yeah, I don't know what to say to that. I'm literally speechless

504
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,699
on the other side.

505
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,310
So I mean,

506
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,739
we're talking about 14,000 vulnerabilities here

507
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,849
that we have exploitation activity for.

508
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:56,849
And so it's really sparse.

509
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:02,260
And so if you, if you take that into account and then go back to our kev conversation

510
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,420
and they're saying this is being exploited and I'm not seeing anything

511
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,939
that may not be weird,

512
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,560
you know, like if

513
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,020
like if Attackers go after something,

514
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:16,000
they prob I mean, if they're really going after some value,

515
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,420
they're not gonna spray the internet, right?

516
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,479
They're probably gonna do some reconnaissance or something, you know.

517
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,219
And so you were not going to see, we're gonna see, what do we say? Like,

518
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,599
I don't know, 10

519
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,199
I wish I had the, the stat up in front of me, but

520
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,359
like some small portion of cbes are actually seeing

521
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:35,900
it more than like one in 100 you know,

522
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,640
like 5 10% something like that.

523
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,800
Like some tiny,

524
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,300
tiny amount of actually exploited vulnerabilities are seen widespread.

525
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,780
Let's, let's build off that point because I think that's kind of the,

526
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,199
that is the thing. I mean, as much as I love being in the weeds here, I think that

527
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,569
we have right now 250,000 plus CD ES in existence.

528
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:58,199
But it's a very, very small number that actually matter, right?

529
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,180
And I think if we look back, you know, 1015,

530
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:05,619
20 years ago when things like CV SS were being, you know, created and, and all of that,

531
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:08,280
the number of vulnerabilities we had to care about was small.

532
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,910
And now the number is an avalanche that no one can deal with.

533
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,250
And this, I think is the key to Epss, right? Epss is going to give us

534
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:21,380
the ability to prioritize this list in a way that is meaningful. Versus

535
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,180
when we try to use CV S SS today,

536
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:27,020
we just end up with this huge pile of criticals and people are like, holy crap.

537
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,069
What do I even do here?

538
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:28,880
Yeah.

539
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,589
And you know,

540
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,859
looking at CV S si think it was like over half

541
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,800
of them are marked as high and critical over 70 Yeah.

542
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,589
It's, it's crazy. Yeah.

543
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,630
And with Epss, another, a huge challenge for Epss is that the distribution is not

544
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,439
anywhere intuitive So like

545
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:51,160
uh some large percent, like, I don't know, 85% are under a 2% probability.

546
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,000
So like most of the CV ES are really, really low chance of exploitation,

547
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,599
which is actually intuitive.

548
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,569
But when people look at the score, they're like, why don't I see a bell curve?

549
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:01,079
You know,

550
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,800
I want a bell curve on this day,

551
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,530
I want all the scores to be pretty and symmetrical and it's like, no, no, no,

552
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,459
they're way over on the left

553
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,905
and, and you have that graphic if,

554
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:13,944
if you can send it to me or I'll try to take it up where you show that,

555
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,614
that curve over time

556
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:18,984
and it really tightens up and yeah, it shifts really left

557
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:23,944
as, as Epss progresses and your data collection becomes better and all that.

558
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:25,775
-- It's super cool.
-- Yeah.

559
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:29,145
Yeah, I'm trying to bring it up so I can get it to you guys while we're talking

560
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,280
so well. And obviously, so how do I phrase this?

561
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,250
There's kind of the elephant in the room here of you're only dealing with CV ES,

562
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,140
which makes sense because as any of our show listeners may or may not know

563
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,540
if you try and track down a vulnerability that does not have a CV E

564
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,380
like you might be able to track down the original issue or whatever in github,

565
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,540
but then trying to find any discussion of it

566
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,810
is basically impossible, right?

567
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:58,310
You're, you're doing tons of Google searches and good luck with that.

568
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,219
And so

569
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:05,130
like, is epss ever looking to cover outside of CV or is it just so much of a chore?

570
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,819
Like, how do you match signatures and names to stuff? Right. Without CV.

571
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:09,989
It's impossible.

572
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,599
So, I'm, I'm guessing that Epss is just like

573
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,839
there's just not enough good data there for us

574
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,630
to even try or is that something you're looking at

575
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:18,300
long term?

576
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,680
It is clearly, uh I don't know if I would call it like a weakness of epss.

577
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,000
It's a weakness of the industry.

578
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,170
That was gonna be my follow up question actually was,

579
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,800
is this again like this whole sort of we fix

580
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,979
CV ES because we don't have any other fixes,

581
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,300
right? Like literal. No, no.

582
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,939
Like literally, like when we worked at Red Hat, Josh, we did,

583
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:39,069
we ever ship a security update that did not have a CV attached to it.

584
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,709
-- We would have gotten one if it didn't.
-- Exactly.

585
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:45,760
And, and so I think kind of by definition people fix CV. S because,

586
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,189
well, that's, that's the only patches my vendor provides me.

587
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:49,939
Yeah.

588
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,750
And

589
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:54,670
you know, as we talked about, I think I'm collecting like 30 different data sources,

590
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,060
30 disparate

591
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,670
data sources.

592
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,060
And to your point, Kurt

593
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:02,869
trying to say if somebody calls it, you know, barking spider.

594
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,030
And the other one is, you know, crawling ants like you don't, they the same thing.

595
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,989
There's no way programmatically

596
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:11,635
do this. If you want to do it.

597
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:13,364
You have to go through a manual and there's no way

598
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,025
for every vulnerability to go through every data source and say,

599
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:18,655
ah I see how this is mapping like that just doesn't work.

600
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:19,135
But

601
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:24,364
I think, you know, going back to some of our other discussions offline is what about,

602
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,375
you know, using like the

603
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:28,895
github advisory uh number or the Red Hat advisory?

604
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:30,314
They have their own numbers, right? And they,

605
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:33,199
um, OS V has their own numbering system.

606
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:38,260
Can these start to be used to, to get more data behind? Just CV ES?

607
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,479
And I think the answer is yes, but that's going to have to be

608
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,930
a, a concerted effort by people collecting data.

609
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,170
You have to have some type of identifier

610
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,229
and it can't be your own internal one and that's it.

611
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:53,599
Well, something like, I don't think I've ever seen anybody discussing a ghsa,

612
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:53,900
a github

613
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:01,089
-- security advisory ID by the GHS A number ever in my whole life.
-- It's possible though

614
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,250
it could happen somewhere.

615
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:04,709
Yeah, it certainly.

616
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,560
But I, I, like I've only ever seen people refer to CV S and again,

617
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:10,780
Survivor buys like everything I buy at the store has a barcode on it because

618
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,339
Powells would, they put it on a shelf and sell it?

619
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,780
-- Well,
-- and I, I think what we see happening like this happens in, in the GHS.

620
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,930
A universe is if something becomes important enough, we need to talk about it.

621
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,954
Someone just goes in gets ac be for it. Right.

622
00:27:22,964 --> 00:27:26,685
It's very survivor bias in that regard where it's just event driven.

623
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:29,935
And I think we see that across every vulnerability

624
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:32,194
ecosystem is there might be a ton of stuff

625
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:36,785
that doesn't have a CV E but I also suspect if it had an EP SS S score,

626
00:27:36,795 --> 00:27:41,435
the EPSS score would be incredibly low because if it was high,

627
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:45,604
someone's going to get a CV E for it, that way we can track it and do something about it.

628
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:46,204
Yeah.

629
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,060
Yeah.

630
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,270
-- OK.
-- Jay, I want to ask you kind of and I know we're kind of coming towards the end here.

631
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,069
So I wanna, I wanna focus in on, on kind of Epss and, and how it's used,

632
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:59,060
I think the best and, and I, I will,

633
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:00,930
I can't wait to see what you think of this.

634
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:04,890
But I think the best example I've heard of, of how to apply epss.

635
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,089
Well,

636
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,069
the best example that my tiny brain can comprehend will say is

637
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,189
take the CBS S score multiply it by the Epss score.

638
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:14,604
And now you have something approaching like a

639
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:17,035
way to actually assess what you're dealing with.

640
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:18,005
I

641
00:28:18,214 --> 00:28:23,484
want to make a pleasant response but that is I get a very official reaction to this.

642
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:27,165
-- This is, this is
-- so you hate this. OK. Now I'm even more interested.

643
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:29,444
That is a terrible approach.

644
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:30,425
That is

645
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:32,155
that is I,

646
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:37,354
yeah, I, I want to throw more cold for words in there to really stress how bad that is

647
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,885
the beeper when I add it, go for it.

648
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,750
So you could just like, hold down the beeper during this whole phrase and just like,

649
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,189
just the whole thing is a beep.

650
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:52,739
Yeah, it is. It's, I, I can't, you know, it's like what's, what's in, in physics?

651
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,619
And I'm not that great at physics but, you know,

652
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,060
when you measure a particle or something, you've got the,

653
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,060
the direction and the speed

654
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,819
and someone says, well, I want to rank them.

655
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:03,030
So you take the direction of speed and you multiply them

656
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,439
like you never do that.

657
00:29:04,449 --> 00:29:07,030
That is not a thing when you describe this, you've got the,

658
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,520
the direction and the speed, right?

659
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:11,209
It's CV, SS and epss are

660
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,520
different. I mean, they're, they're

661
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,650
like to first epss is 0 to 1 and CV SS is 0 to 10. So you

662
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,000
at least get them on the same scale.

663
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:24,660
But then like if you just multiply them, you've got, you know, up to 10,

664
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,640
multiplying against whatever, up to one and CV SS is gonna wait,

665
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:32,800
you know, 90% of that score for sure. Um, 99 anyway.

666
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,000
But so like, it's just, it's a terrible idea because here's,

667
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,660
here's why it's a terrible idea.

668
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:42,300
One. What is CV SS actually measuring?

669
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,760
And this is like an open question and people are going to say, oh, it's not risk,

670
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,979
it's severity.

671
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,670
What is severity,

672
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,619
you know,

673
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:57,050
like that in all of my studying of risk analysis and risk models that is not a term used

674
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,630
in these risk models.

675
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,359
You've got, you know,

676
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:02,760
threat and likelihood or probability and consequences impact.

677
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,310
No one says severity, they might say it for an impact. So, is this measuring impact?

678
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:06,859
No, no, no, no, no.

679
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:11,219
-- This
-- is, there is one threat model that does consider severity and it's the, uh,

680
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:12,239
the chemical

681
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,339
engineers one for things like that because then things go boom.

682
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,454
Is that the severity of the impact?

683
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:20,734
-- Yes. Right.
-- So that makes sense.

684
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:23,655
Like do basically, and it boils down to will people die,

685
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:24,194
right?

686
00:30:24,505 --> 00:30:26,515
And so that's the only time I've ever seen that though.

687
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:30,415
-- So
-- typically, you know, and fair, the fair model did a great thing where they

688
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:32,354
had this whole taxonomy, but

689
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:36,675
then they got it right. I mean, like you've got some pressure, which is the threat,

690
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:40,795
applying some force and then you've got your ability to resist that

691
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:44,224
or lack of resistance and then you've got some outcome

692
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:46,780
and this is another problem where you're getting like

693
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,290
when you have the probability of some event happening

694
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,569
and then the outcome,

695
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:53,910
those are another thing that you never multiply together yet people do.

696
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,510
Right?

697
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,469
Um And so when you take CV SS, which is,

698
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,650
it is measuring, it's trying to be a risk score

699
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,750
even though they, it's not in there,

700
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:06,630
they try to be a score and then you take epss which is just measuring the threat

701
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,760
and you're multiplying that together. Like, what, what are you multiplying?

702
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,339
It's like, you know,

703
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:12,609
I've got apples and then I've got a car in

704
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:14,189
the driveway and I want to bring them together.

705
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:16,290
You know, it's like, wait, no, no, no, these are totally different.

706
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,689
But I,

707
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:19,810
I get a number on the other side and people like

708
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:22,500
numbers because then I can order them in my spreadsheet.

709
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,189
Yeah,

710
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,010
the logic to me always seems struck me as like, ok,

711
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,329
the chances of us getting broken into our 50%.

712
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,930
So like we're going to put locks on 50% of the doors to meet that 50% threat.

713
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:33,849
Right.

714
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,979
That's literally like, or, or we're gonna, you know,

715
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,709
get the cheap lock instead of the expensive lock.

716
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:39,130
Yeah,

717
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:42,689
or another thing is like, you know, taking the CS is people,

718
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:46,719
people learn about the annualized annualized loss expectancy where you take

719
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:47,119
a,

720
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:52,650
you know, you have one event that has $100 impact and then it only happens once a year.

721
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,739
So every year you lose $10

722
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,229
and that's not the case.

723
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:59,089
Like you're gonna have one year while you lose it all and, you know,

724
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:00,949
it's not $100 it's $10 million.

725
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:01,290
So, like,

726
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,400
you might be able to afford, you know, that annualized loss every year,

727
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,920
but when it hits once and it's $10 million you can absorb that,

728
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,780
you know, that is totally different.

729
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:14,359
I think a big part of the problem is a lot of this kind of thinking about

730
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:17,109
risk came from the physical world where we

731
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,810
do kind of have large numbers and statistics and

732
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:23,810
we can sort of box, like if you rob a bank, the,

733
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:27,000
the most amount of money they can lose is how much of money the bank holds.

734
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,449
Right.

735
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,069
Right.

736
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,040
Ignoring costs.

737
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,760
Like, you know, everybody gets killed or the bank gets blown up or something,

738
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,530
which generally doesn't happen thankfully.

739
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,599
But, yeah, with a cyber event, you know, we're seeing

740
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:37,020
events where, oh,

741
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,719
nobody can get their prescription medication in like half the US for like, what,

742
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:41,819
two weeks or something.

743
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,420
Oops. So, back to your question, jos,

744
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,290
how do you combine these two or how would you use it in practice? Right.

745
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,390
That's sort of your, your ultimate question.

746
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,670
Yeah. And, and that's, that's like that, that is the final question, right?

747
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,959
So, we've got epss, we have this number

748
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:57,959
and

749
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,500
what do we do with it?

750
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,020
And I know that in all of my readings and the things you've written and said,

751
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:06,030
and in just the Epss universe in general is

752
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,780
there seems to be,

753
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,119
we'll say, uh, a

754
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,069
desire to not rank them in order. Right. That's not the goal here.

755
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,339
I mean, Epss is just measuring threats. So you can absolutely rank them

756
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,400
in order of threat likelihood.

757
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,739
Right. So you can, you can rank that

758
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,550
Um And you do,

759
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,890
I think the resistance that we have in epss that

760
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,790
I personally have is to bin them to say like,

761
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:34,900
hey, an epss score of 50% or higher is a critical

762
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:35,989
and

763
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:38,420
20 to 50% is a high, whatever it is,

764
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,780
wherever those thresholds lie for a central body to bend it.

765
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,300
Like that is super egotistical like,

766
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,170
hey, I understand everybody's risk and everybody's risk, risk is the same.

767
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,510
So everyone should have this threshold,

768
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,900
everyone should call this critical like that is not the case at all.

769
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,619
-- Plus
-- 60 percent of the time works every time, right?

770
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,329
So, but how, how to use it. So

771
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:04,280
one of the things that I've been very adamant about is keeping epss

772
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,750
simple. It is just a score, it is a probability

773
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,429
and there's a whole characteristics of probability that we can exploit here

774
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,510
to combine

775
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,909
multiple things.

776
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:14,949
And then,

777
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,110
and that's all it is and specifically about

778
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,790
exploitation activity expected over the next 30 days.

779
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,129
And so

780
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,449
in whatever risk model you have,

781
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,050
that is a very nice neat component.

782
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,000
You know, it fits into one of the boxes in the fair model,

783
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:36,168
it fits into, you know, threat times vulnerability equals impact, it fits in there

784
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,770
and it's only one component. And so

785
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:44,050
as a consumer, you have to figure out the other boxes in your model and

786
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,250
some people have to figure out what those boxes should be in the first place.

787
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,580
And just from my experience, like there are

788
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,280
for, for everybody doing right,

789
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:54,955
management. There are just as many, if not more models. Yes,

790
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:56,135
in Cyber,

791
00:34:56,254 --> 00:35:00,334
in Cyber. So that's part of the challenge. So, back to the whole quick thing though.

792
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:03,774
So like if you think CV SS is truly

793
00:35:03,784 --> 00:35:06,455
valuable and you've built your entire program around it,

794
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,504
the they have a threat metric in there

795
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:12,854
and it doesn't quite fit perfectly because it's like

796
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,324
exploit, yes or no or something like that.

797
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:17,054
I, I can't remember depending on the version.

798
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,389
So it doesn't fit perfectly.

799
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:22,790
But that's where it should fit is in that threat aspect of CV SS.

800
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,370
If you want to combine the two,

801
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,570
I think, and you believed in CV SS has value,

802
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:28,969
that's where it should go

803
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:29,409
well.

804
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,590
And I think that's again,

805
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,689
that's why when you kept using the word temporal

806
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:35,370
because it's part of the temporal score in CV SS

807
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:36,969
which always struck me as a very

808
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,969
poor word to use.

809
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:41,209
But yeah, they've exploit and then they have quotes, code,

810
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:45,100
maturity renamed to exploit, maturity. E with clear values.

811
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,010
I was being part of the big step up for four.

812
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:48,570
Yeah.

813
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:52,469
Can I I want to bash one more thing about CBS S if I could please,

814
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,570
they made the assumption they've always had this assumption to assume the worst

815
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:58,840
and this is why we've got

816
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,760
over half or high and critical.

817
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,239
But if you look at the, what the data is saying, you know, for all of the data,

818
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,370
I've managed to collect about exploitation activity.

819
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:08,189
We're still seeing,

820
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:13,250
I think around 6% of the published CV ES have exploitation activity, 6%.

821
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:14,939
So

822
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,080
what that's saying is like out of that 6% we're going to assume the worst.

823
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,250
So 94% of the time they are incorrect,

824
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:27,500
right? It is not the worst. It is, there's nothing happening, there is a zero threat.

825
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:28,540
So

826
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,629
there's no other impact, right?

827
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,989
Um So why, why not assume the best?

828
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,590
And you're right, 94% of the time,

829
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,689
then you're not creating all of this extra work and stuff like that. And

830
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,729
hopefully you can get more data to bring it around.

831
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,370
-- I can
-- answer that. It's because the people assigning CV SS had missed

832
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,879
work for the government and they have to assign a

833
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:52,000
worst case scenario because otherwise they'll get nailed for it.

834
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,129
You didn't rate this badly enough, you missed it and there's,

835
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:58,719
and it's an externality for them like it basically it's alarm fatigue, right?

836
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:01,360
It's an advanced form of alarm fatigue where, yeah,

837
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,469
everything's high and critical.

838
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,689
So like you better patch now

839
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:08,044
and, and like you said, very little of it is being actively exploited or used,

840
00:37:08,205 --> 00:37:09,314
it's justified,

841
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:10,155
but it's wrong.

842
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:11,504
Well, exactly. And I,

843
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:12,754
and again, like it's,

844
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:17,754
but this is how we got here. This is how reality is currently working and set up and

845
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:21,354
yeah, like if we I don't know what the answer to this is.

846
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,314
Um I, and that's part of what I tried to do with the CV

847
00:37:24,524 --> 00:37:24,554
E

848
00:37:24,754 --> 00:37:28,264
JSON data was to have it, people be able to set their own CV SS score.

849
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:30,185
So that Red Hat could say one, this other,

850
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:32,405
you know Sousa has a slightly different flavor of samba.

851
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:33,475
So it's different

852
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,840
and of course, that never happened.

853
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,580
They just want the one true score which is provided by N.

854
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:39,439
So that's the one everybody uses. And I think

855
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,699
that's I think is the biggest,

856
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:44,429
one of the biggest problems our industry has is like with epss,

857
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:45,899
why do we use epss so much?

858
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:48,090
Because we, we don't have anything else at all,

859
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:50,800
but we don't use epss so much. Not yet,

860
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:51,449
not yet.

861
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,340
I mean, it's, it's definitely getting attention

862
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:57,719
but I do think one of the challenges to adoption is going to be like, so,

863
00:37:57,729 --> 00:38:01,300
so this whole discussion we've had for the last, you know, like 30 plus minutes

864
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,459
has really been around the fact that

865
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:06,620
this is an input to a larger machine

866
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,989
and we don't have that larger machine.

867
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,179
And today, if you look at, you know, you go by something like the fair framework,

868
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:16,919
it's very unique to each organization and most organizations

869
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,780
lack the maturity or know how to apply that.

870
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,570
Yeah,

871
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,419
well, or to have an inventory of their systems.

872
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,629
-- That's a whole another
-- story.

873
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,540
-- I mean, so
-- well, but I mean, on the maturity model like this is,

874
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,709
this is like flying when they're barely crawling.

875
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,629
-- Right. Right.
-- Right.

876
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,419
OK. Jay. So let's, I'm gonna give you the final word.

877
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:39,229
Just kind of close this out is, is Phyllis with hope and optimism here.

878
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:41,290
-- I
-- so,

879
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,030
I mean, if you, if we talk about what the,

880
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,770
the logic and the processes that are behind epss,

881
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:52,550
why can't that be applied to asset importance,

882
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,780
try and measure some of the consequence of exploitation?

883
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,350
Why can't it be measuring

884
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,820
control strengths,

885
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:02,030
you know, our ability to resist exploitation activity in the first place or,

886
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:06,879
you know, let's apply it to any sort of thing and posture management or um you know,

887
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,030
tax service management.

888
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,810
Let's talk about

889
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,629
default passwords. What is the effect of that? Well, what is our feedback loop?

890
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,260
You know, and that's all EP SS S is doing, it's just

891
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,550
finding the feedback and closing that loop.

892
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,669
So let's do that elsewhere.

893
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:26,750
So the final word in my mind is like, this is super hopeful. Epss is not done,

894
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:27,780
right?

895
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,540
You know, like we, we didn't like create epss and we're like celebrating, hey,

896
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,219
we're done.

897
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:32,760
No, no, no.

898
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,860
We're like we were working on the next version and

899
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:39,659
where epss and whatever this is going to lead to,

900
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,719
it's going to be very different than where we are now.

901
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:45,020
Like we can't just sit back like for sure we're not done

902
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:48,370
and hopefully we can get to NON CV es we can get to

903
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:52,830
other aspects and talk about these feedback loops and close those loops.

904
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:55,899
You just mentioned sort of applying EPSS style

905
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,429
analysis to other forms of data, you know,

906
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,979
are there any such projects underway that you know, of?

907
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:03,949
Uh

908
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,030
no,

909
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,229
do you?

910
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:11,530
Oh, no, like, I mean, well, the CS A does it with star a little bit but not,

911
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,580
there's no numbers involved.

912
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,659
It's just yes or no.

913
00:40:14,149 --> 00:40:19,929
I mean, you'll see a lot in academic papers where they try to do this and

914
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,169
I mean, this isn't eps didn't invent this.

915
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:25,290
This isn't something I was like, oh, this is a great idea.

916
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,899
Now, this is like basic statistics you need, you know,

917
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:29,169
when you talk about machine learning,

918
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,760
you've got unsupervised and supervised and supervised has a feedback loop.

919
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,469
That's what we're doing like, yeah, that's it.

920
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:37,590
There's no magic, there's no brilliance.

921
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,360
It's just taking stuff other people have done and

922
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,169
we're going to stand on the shoulders of giants.

923
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:41,969
I love it.

00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,290
