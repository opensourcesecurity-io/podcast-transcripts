Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,930
Kurt Siefried and my partner on Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:11,560
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,560
All right, I've changed my mind about conferences.

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,289
OK.

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:15,760
Yeah.

6
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:16,629
So

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,530
Defcon was over the weekend

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,899
and

9
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:26,760
I had intended to, we'll put the words, attend in quotes and watch.

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,549
There were some talks I had in mind there was, you know, I was part of their discord.

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,520
I had it all planned

12
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:35,250
and then like life erupted around me and nothing happened.

13
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,180
I saw none of the talks I wanted to see. Of course, they're all on youtube.

14
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:39,360
So I'm going to watch them and everything.

15
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:42,860
But obviously there's part of the fun is interacting with others

16
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,060
and none of that happened. And so I now recognize

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,200
that the single biggest advantage to going to a conference

18
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,729
is life can't happen to you generally while you're at the conference.

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,939
-- Well,
-- you've carved out the space.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,729
Yeah. So I,

21
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,319
I won't lie

22
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,959
that I still question sometimes some of the value

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,680
of the talks at the large conferences will say,

24
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,110
but I'm more amendable now after missing all of defcon.

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,800
Well, I'll be blunt, like

26
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:19,139
most of us professionals generally have more important than w we,

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,019
we generally have important work to do

28
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,910
that is probably more important in the short term than, you know,

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:25,879
professional development

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,930
and those social networks and stuff.

31
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,750
And so, yeah, sometimes we make those choices and I suspect too, the second part is

32
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,629
the conference would be a lot more valuable from like a

33
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:37,519
social networking point of view and from development point of view

34
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:41,500
in person because you can really focus on it and meet people face to face, right?

35
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,750
Whereas online it's like,

36
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,660
well, it's like, you know, it kind of like,

37
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,250
it basically looks like IRC back when we were in our twenties.

38
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:49,910
Yeah.

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,360
Speaking of which, this actually totally feeds into today's topic,

40
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,660
which is I want you to plug something into Google.

41
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:00,099
All right. All right. In quotes, cult of information security,

42
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,519
but it has to be in quotes,

43
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,680
right? That specific phrase,

44
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,360
-- what
-- is going on? I can't uh Kurt, I, I'm too dumb to do this

45
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,220
full quote. Cult of information security, end quote.

46
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,119
OK.

47
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,070
Right. It says it looks like there aren't any great matches for your search.

48
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:22,110
Well, I get one result and it's a stack overflow posting.

49
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,630
But what's fascinating is if you do it without quotes, you get 71 million results.

50
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,309
So, so I, I get one result from

51
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,929
server fault,

52
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,300
the site

53
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:32,559
not

54
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:34,699
stack, it's part of the stack overflow.

55
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,550
OK? So of course, you're going to get more

56
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:41,250
findings if you take the quotes away because now instead of doing

57
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:45,449
a literal search on those words in that order with spaces,

58
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,770
now you just get searches on all of the words.

59
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:51,710
Well, so what's interesting though is when you look at information security,

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,610
I've been looking at it a bit,

61
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:58,000
there's a lot of people who treat this as a cult. And so I was actually looking up how,

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,300
how do you make a cult?

63
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:02,059
Right, because I've also looked at this off and on for tax purposes and, you know,

64
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,479
for lifestyle purposes.

65
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:08,690
Well, and, and like every time we go to San Francisco, we would visit a new,

66
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,960
uh try and visit a new cult because there's this one, the, what is it called?

67
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,509
The American Museum? And it's basically a front for an actual cult.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,570
It's, it's pretty awesome.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,270
All the art is done by the guy who runs the cult and it's like, really terrible art.

70
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,460
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You told me about this.

71
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,630
Yeah. Yeah. And so it's, it's in some previous podcast and

72
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,949
it's, it's straight up like North Korean, like great leader, you know,

73
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,979
like did this floor tile and you can like buy the floor tiles in the shop,

74
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:34,789
you know, so you can walk on great leaders or whatever.

75
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:37,470
So I was looking at how to start a cult

76
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:40,210
and sort of the parallels between this and information security.

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,809
So I was thinking we should walk through this because to be blunt. I, I'm not sure a lot

78
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,850
of information security is doing so well or doing it very well.

79
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,429
I, I don't think anyone's going to argue with that statement.

80
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,610
So, I mean, number one is easy, choose

81
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,630
an obsession, like, pick something, you know, to obsess about.

82
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,009
Well, we got that,

83
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,059
we're good there. Yeah,

84
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,169
we totally get there and then, you know, it's, it's talking about,

85
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,139
you got to create your own reality

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,929
check.

87
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,289
Yeah.

88
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:10,449
I

89
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,919
mean, you know, what gets me is like, like,

90
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:14,994
we, we make this out to be like,

91
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,704
what I love is when people talk to me about computer security and they're like,

92
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:18,954
oh my God, it's so bad, blah, blah, blah.

93
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:21,744
I'm like, the power's still on and water, tap,

94
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:25,225
water works and like the stores still have food and logistic like,

95
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:29,924
you know, and no offense, but COVID was a heck of a lot more of a disruption

96
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,399
than any information security flaw we've had to deal with in the last forever.

97
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,390
Absolutely. And actually, you know what? It's funny you say that is,

98
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,859
there's been,

99
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:40,820
uh

100
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:44,829
an idea. I've been kicking around in my brain and it's basically,

101
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,980
you know, you, you and oh, and this came about, I was on,

102
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:52,019
I think it was an Atlantic Council call and somebody basically talked about, oh,

103
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,739
the market will solve this problem and it

104
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:54,739
hang on.

105
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,529
We literally have the security that market demands today.

106
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,769
And we all agree that security is garbage.

107
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,410
-- The market clearly doesn't demand security
-- or,

108
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,760
or I would argue the market solved the problem.

109
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,690
The problem is solved as far as the market's concerned.

110
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,890
-- And
-- maybe,

111
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,730
maybe, well, let me put it this way,

112
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,799
roads have potholes typically,

113
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:17,609
right? Roads need maintenance and resurfacing. We don't always do that. Right.

114
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:17,940
Like

115
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,399
they, they're still working on that big road next to,

116
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,869
they finally repainted almost all the lines but not all of them,

117
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,470
which I find infuriating

118
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,420
because literally all they need to do is paint a

119
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:29,190
few more lines and the whole thing is just done.

120
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,429
But because they haven't painted the lines, you know,

121
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,380
the buses keep having to stop and wait for people to

122
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,100
back up so they can make their turn and blah,

123
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:35,549
blah, blah.

124
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,839
But anyways moving along with the cult thing, number two or number three,

125
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,950
sort of is establishing the rules of the cult.

126
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,739
And I think that would be one of the great rules is most of the more

127
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,440
well,

128
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,040
or shall I say many of the less

129
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:50,220
effective people in information security in my experience

130
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,779
have very black and white thinking like you're secure or you're not secure,

131
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,529
you know, the whole,

132
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,200
you must have 100 layer onion and

133
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:03,519
-- well, I mean, I used to think like that I won't pretend I didn't.
-- Yes. Oh me too.

134
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,660
-- And we got
-- better and yeah, and it was also,

135
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,399
I would argue I was completely ineffective

136
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,880
-- with that method of thinking
-- pretty much.

137
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:14,945
And what drives me nuts is when people actually do

138
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,924
start measuring risk and saying, ok, we'll start making these trade offs.

139
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,765
You know, they get called bean counters or like, oh, you know, you're,

140
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:23,684
you're just a business person who's not caring about the technology and it's like,

141
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:25,494
no, they, they don't care about the technology.

142
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:28,345
-- Like, correct.
-- It's not exciting work either.

143
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:28,825
I mean,

144
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:33,434
one of the things I keep telling people now is security should be like accounting

145
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:36,704
where it's not interesting. You're not a rock star,

146
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:42,315
you're, you're pushing buttons all day and making numbers do things and

147
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:45,679
nobody really cares unless something explodes.

148
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,570
Well, and this is what I love about Blockchain now, right in the last couple of weeks,

149
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:51,750
Blockchain has gone from, you know what it was in the past now to,

150
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,929
yeah, banks, us, banks can offer, you know, deposit services

151
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:00,690
and there's now a couple of good financial papers about the Ethereum 2.0

152
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,190
changes and how the economics of it are a little bit screwy,

153
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,260
you know, it's like really boring business stuff, which is great. Right.

154
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:10,329
That means it's there. Right. I, I agree.

155
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,570
So, yeah, establishing the rules of the cult. I mean, this

156
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,769
and I think the black and white thinking is, is the biggest one.

157
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,779
That's kind of a problem.

158
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,500
Well, there's, I mean, you could argue this,

159
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,179
I think in countless different ways there's black and white thinking obviously

160
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,380
you've got the

161
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,779
regulation will save us all thinking you've got the,

162
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,529
-- we just need more tools thinking you've
-- got the IML or whatever the flavor

163
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:33,700
AO

164
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,899
of Rs A was this year was the flavor of Rs A this year.

165
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:42,429
-- Not Rs A sorry. Um um uh black
-- hat, I think

166
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,869
like this is boring me. I don't know. It was.

167
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,579
-- Where is
-- that happening in the next few days?

168
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,049
-- No, no
-- black hat happened. It was,

169
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,609
I was not overly impressed by Black hat in any way, I think Defcon and,

170
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:59,390
and hope the 2600 conference, those two, if you're doing anything online,

171
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,160
look at what those guys did

172
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:01,339
during,

173
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,579
look at what black I did because I think

174
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,019
it was less interesting than it should have been.

175
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,450
But I couldn't tell you what, like the big thing was at it.

176
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,579
It was probably COVID if I had to guess.

177
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,230
Well,

178
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,029
and I've actually seen a lot of places trying

179
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,940
to tie in their technology and stuff to COVID,

180
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,470
like literally work from home, that kind of stuff.

181
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:17,640
I

182
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:17,890
know

183
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,470
not entirely wrong, but at the same time, it's just like,

184
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,589
uh you know,

185
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,589
like when my phone company was phoning me and they're like, are you safe? And

186
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,670
-- like what they're like, are you and your loved ones? Safe press one
-- if you are safe.

187
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:29,910
And I'm like, I

188
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:32,070
was not happy with that phone call

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,159
because I'm like, what if my

190
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,599
-- Yeah,
-- anyways but, but the point is right, there's,

191
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,710
you can easily pick a niche of silly rules for sure.

192
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,789
So, you know, next, finding a place to practice worship. Yeah. I mean,

193
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,780
and, and infosec is actually in my experience, traditionally tried to

194
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:52,239
sort of spread out like a crack and, and, and, and touch everything, you know, like,

195
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,429
oh, you, you can't do that because of security but, like, I just want to print

196
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,289
or, you know, I, I, oh, my favorite remember was it Linus Torvalds or something?

197
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,500
He's like, I just want to reset the time on my computer.

198
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,059
Why do I have to give my kid the password for them to do that?

199
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:08,289
And I get it, like, from a security point of view. Yeah, it's messing around.

200
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,700
System time is very important.

201
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,190
But at the same time I literally, ok, I, I installed windows 10 on this machine

202
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,489
and it chose the Pacific time zone and I'm like, cool.

203
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,289
So I've got the right time but I'm off by an hour. This is not so useful.

204
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:23,239
So I want to reset it to mountain time where I live. And actually, you know,

205
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,630
and it just didn't want to let me in.

206
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,549
So I ended up doing it from the command line and I'm like, you know, just for the love

207
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,309
of right, like, people just want to have the right time on their computer and, and

208
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,570
because of security, we made it hard.

209
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,390
I have an easier argument for this even is,

210
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,549
this is something I find myself falling into all the time.

211
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,619
And it's a very old mindset of, that's my job

212
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:50,080
where someone, for example, from development might show up and say, oh,

213
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,340
I want to slim down our container images.

214
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,119
And in the back, the first thing that pops in my head is like, that's my job.

215
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,030
But wait, no, it's not. First of all, I'm, I'm already too busy.

216
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,239
I'm never going to touch this with a 10 ft pole and if you want to do the work,

217
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,919
freaking great, like go do the work.

218
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,559
Well, it's like hit and run management, right?

219
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,840
Like there's that, you know, infamous story from that developer who worked for,

220
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:10,200
I think it was

221
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:10,703
Yahoo

222
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,203
and like the manager

223
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,302
came and did a hit and run management about a

224
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,482
single form field for like zip code or something,

225
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,213
you know, and the developer was like, it's cool.

226
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:21,453
It takes like five numbers or nine numbers or a dash or a space.

227
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:24,482
It doesn't really care, it just like deals with it and it, you know,

228
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:26,843
ended up being this like huge bike shedding

229
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:27,752
thing

230
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:29,242
for this one little field.

231
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:29,682
And,

232
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:31,062
and that's my experience of a lot of security

233
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:34,252
people is they can't stay involved because quite frankly,

234
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:34,432
if

235
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,445
they can stay involved,

236
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:39,046
that means they need to really have much more valuable work to be doing than,

237
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:39,445
you know,

238
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,286
ding around with container image size

239
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:42,606
Right. Exactly.

240
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,565
-- Exactly.
-- Like that is not a high value

241
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:46,986
ad. No, I, I agree. I agree completely.

242
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:48,926
And what I've done there is instead of getting involved,

243
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,786
I just try and offer advice and mentoring.

244
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:53,726
So, you know, the classic one is like, ok, well, you know, instead of that,

245
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,635
how about you just start with a minimal container, image,

246
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:56,726
install everything you need.

247
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:58,695
That's it. That's my advice. Like that's it,

248
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:02,116
you know, or like when my devs were like, oh, we need to track CV S and I'm like, no,

249
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:02,486
you don't

250
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,760
just keep updating the software twice a week like you already do.

251
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:07,489
-- Yep.
-- Yep. Exactly.

252
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,239
Ok. Anyway, let's keep going.

253
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,450
Here's the classic one and finally keep your flock fixated on the carrot.

254
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,320
The payoff is just around the corner and only they will be the ones paid off the

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,330
and they will be raptured up and then boy, oh, boy,

256
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,239
won't all those nonbelievers be sorry.

257
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,919
That doesn't sound familiar at all.

258
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,969
-- I mean,
-- that's basically like the,

259
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,969
the fundamental attitude of security of listen to me

260
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,080
or you'll be sorry and they're never sorry.

261
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,109
And like just today, it's great. Like, it's already

262
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,190
gave me that the security company found 400 security flaws in, you know,

263
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:40,530
Snapdragon processors used in like 3 billion mobile phones, right?

264
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,030
These D SPS that do like they process media and stuff and

265
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,010
it sounds like what they did is they did fuzzing of media,

266
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,349
like reading between the lines, they did fuzzing of media types

267
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:52,330
and got like the ability to execute code on the DS P or like just borderline,

268
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,260
brick it and make it non responsive

269
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,229
and make the whole phone non responsive.

270
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,109
And it's like,

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,119
yeah, like,

272
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:04,210
but like me as a consumer, what, what exactly was I supposed to do to avoid this?

273
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:05,070
Nothing.

274
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:07,739
And I'm not saying we shouldn't use like a password manager,

275
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,830
encrypt your hard drive, you know, do the basics.

276
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,570
But yeah, some of the stuff I see people advocating for so that you can be, you know,

277
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,130
-- immune to these problems is like, no, I
-- mean, a lot of them aren't.

278
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,239
And this is one of my favorite examples is if you look at

279
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,429
kind of all of the security flaws that came out, let's say, you know,

280
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,260
in the last six months and there's probably 10 or less that would

281
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,859
be critical to the point of people should be concerned about them.

282
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:37,359
But I bet you the ones that have been actually exploited,

283
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,169
it's probably two or three Macs.

284
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,260
And of course, part of the challenge is figuring out which

285
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:46,080
two or three it's going to be. But yeah, none of this is ever as bad as it seems to be.

286
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,679
-- Well,
-- and even then, you know, when, when we see these large scale attacks,

287
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,039
a lot of them tend to be using a really old

288
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,429
flaw or even better yet they use something like you know,

289
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,429
relying on the fact that MS SQL was set up with no password by default.

290
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,260
Ok. You know, you should probably set,

291
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,690
well, I mean, how many, you know, uh, mem

292
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:04,880
Cash.

293
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:05,929
T is a great example. Right. Mem

294
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:06,690
Cash t, doesn't,

295
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:08,250
does it even still

296
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,289
have authentication? I don't think it does yet.

297
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:12,989
I have no idea. Right.

298
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,780
And it, well, it, it, it certainly didn't back in the day because, well, it's kind of,

299
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,729
its whole use case is like, it's just a quick and dirty

300
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,049
me

301
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:19,039
cash.

302
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:22,919
You know, we don't want to have all these bells and whistles, want it small and fast.

303
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,070
So don't expose it to the internet, right? Like

304
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:25,679
that's it.

305
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,039
And that's easier said than done also.

306
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:34,830
And, and I think that's another aspect of the cult is the whole, blame the user

307
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:38,090
-- if you don't set it up the right way
-- and for doing something totally reasonable.

308
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:41,130
Like, I actually, what's really fascinating to me is in Windows 10 now.

309
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,239
Um, so I, I have, um, I had like Windows seven ultimate upgraded to Windows 10

310
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:48,169
back in the day anyways. What's fascinating to me is that

311
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,080
like, Windows firewall bought default is on and pretty tight.

312
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:55,739
Windows defender is on and by default does the right thing.

313
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,219
And what's really fascinating is like,

314
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,450
I actually had to disable a Microsoft security feature.

315
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,729
Um, they, they have this thing now,

316
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,369
malware protection where it kind of protects certain files,

317
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,239
like your documents directory and prevents,

318
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:07,130
you know, basically, it only allows like,

319
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,849
specific programs to monkey around in there.

320
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,859
And so what was it, like, github and Adam and stuff were just not working? Oh, yeah.

321
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:14,760
What it was is

322
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:18,429
I could interact with the files. I could read them. I could write them,

323
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,340
but I couldn't create new files.

324
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,049
Right.

325
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,830
So, it wouldn't let me create new files and I'm like, ok, that's pretty paranoid,

326
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,500
but whatever.

327
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,570
So I had to disable that.

328
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,489
But by and large for most people that's not going

329
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,219
to be a problem because they're gonna be using like,

330
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,469
you know, Microsoft office, not github

331
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:35,989
desktop. And what, what got me is by default windows 10 is really

332
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:39,869
doing its best to protect me and prevent me from shooting myself in the foot. And

333
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,719
I also noticed I updated my kids uh phones the other day

334
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,229
and there's new settings under the automated updates,

335
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:46,710
right?

336
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,750
That make it, you know,

337
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,359
actually more effective and easier to do automated updates of the US.

338
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,469
And I don't remember setting them to the safe defaults. They were just there.

339
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,619
-- I
-- mean,

340
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,049
-- cool.
-- Like, thank you.

341
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:57,630
Right.

342
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,349
I think for consumer gear at this point,

343
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:04,030
there's no excuse to not just have sensible defaults.

344
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,419
I think that's true of everybody. If you

345
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,969
have some sort of pathological corner use case where you're like, oh,

346
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,450
we can't upgrade this because

347
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,299
blah, blah,

348
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:16,299
then that's on you and you need to go, you know,

349
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,530
monkey around with the engine and remove the spark

350
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,919
plugs and replace them with bananas or whatever.

351
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:21,440
Yeah, I,

352
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:27,419
I agree with that and I think that was not the way people thought for a long time

353
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,979
and it made a mess of things.

354
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:33,760
Remember the arguments for like enabling the firewall

355
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,219
by default on Linux and of course,

356
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:36,809
now is the default.

357
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,320
-- But remember what that took years
-- or, or even.

358
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,409
so I remember back in the day this was, oh man, this was probably, I mean,

359
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:46,890
it's been more than 10 years now.

360
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,169
I was at uh I think it was a Red Hat Summit. It was something.

361
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,289
And there's a genome guy. His name is Richard Hughes.

362
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:57,109
He, I don't know, I don't know what he's up to these days, but basically he,

363
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,419
he comes up to me and says,

364
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:01,940
what would you think if we enabled automatic updates in Fedara?

365
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,500
And I said that's a terrible idea.

366
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,229
And he goes why? And he says, why I said, well, like what's in those updates?

367
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,150
How do we know if they're safe? How do we know?

368
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,669
You know, we don't know what's going to happen.

369
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,940
How do we know it doesn't break something? And he said,

370
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:16,460
I think for normal users, we should do this. And

371
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,010
of course, I was like, no, I don't think that's right. And now like, yes,

372
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:26,020
yes, 100% we should enable automatic updates for normal users.

373
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,640
Yeah, pretty much turn it off if you don't want it. But I think

374
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,559
for, for normal people and, and this was,

375
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,849
I don't remember where I found the statistic but

376
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,440
something like 85% of people never change a single setting.

377
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:41,260
I can actually do you one better. What was it?

378
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,719
So, uh basically uh organ donors,

379
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:45,460
right?

380
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:50,530
If, if you make people opt into the organ donor system, you get like 10% or something.

381
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,890
And so like what Holland and some countries have done, I think Singapore,

382
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:58,070
by default, you're an organ donor and you, you can choose to opt out, but by default,

383
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,219
you're an organ donor and then you go from like 10% being organ donors to like,

384
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,260
90 something percent.

385
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,689
I believe the real fundamental is

386
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:06,218
people don't

387
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:08,838
change defaults. People,

388
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:09,328
you know,

389
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:12,678
if you give them a choice between not doing something and having to do something,

390
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,009
I mean,

391
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,678
how many people get angry at a conference if they sit in a

392
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:19,378
chair one day and then the next day somebody different is sitting in quote

393
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,708
unquote their chair.

394
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:21,808
Yeah.

395
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,438
Yeah. Seriously.

396
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,409
I mean, I'm, I'm totally like that. I'm a creature of habit. I don't know.

397
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:30,713
I remember when I was at university I'd sit in the same desk every day I could.

398
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:33,124
And if someone sat in my desk, I'm like, get out of my chair, like,

399
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,234
that's my chair and they're like, no, it's not.

400
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:37,183
And I'd argue with them. And

401
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,154
it, obviously it wasn't my chair in any way and you could sit wherever you wanted.

402
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:41,833
But it's just,

403
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:46,274
it's one of those things I think that is we're strange monkeys and that's what we do.

404
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:46,713
Now,

405
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:47,583
I think

406
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:51,709
something else, I think that's really important to, I wanna,

407
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:54,439
I wanna bring us back to your cult discussion because I think we

408
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,589
abandoned that very quickly because it is a strange topic for sure.

409
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:00,819
And I love the fact that we're going to name this podcast,

410
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,310
the Cult of Information Security.

411
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,369
And it will probably be the second hit

412
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,829
when we do this search.

413
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,530
Although, although we'll see, maybe, maybe people will figure out,

414
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,540
you know how happy I was to find only a single men

415
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,939
-- of that in Google because I'm like, there's got to be
-- more,

416
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:18,199
I think here's a really important thing to consider, especially in the,

417
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,229
in the topic of cults.

418
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,689
And I don't remember where I heard this,

419
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,849
but it was very recent was basically someone pointed out that

420
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,229
nobody sets out to join a cult.

421
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,260
It's,

422
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,180
it's never like I'm going to join a cult today or I want to join that cult over there.

423
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,729
It's always, you find like minded people who think the way you think,

424
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,329
who agree with the things you agree with.

425
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:40,540
And eventually you're just kind of brought into the fold.

426
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,160
And it's one of those situations where if you,

427
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,020
if you don't pay attention to what's happening

428
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:47,479
you're kind of carried along in the current until before, you know it,

429
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:48,300
you're in a cult.

430
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,219
-- Yeah.
-- You're drinking the flavor

431
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,400
and, right.

432
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:50,880
And, and like,

433
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,310
your friends are there and you don't want to be kicked out

434
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,069
because where will you find new friends and the people you like?

435
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:56,949
And you're familiar with it?

436
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:00,069
So, it's like, uh, it's not that bad and, and I think,

437
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,550
especially in the world of security, we all thought it wasn't that bad,

438
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:07,510
you know, 5, 10 years ago and if you look at it now it's like

439
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,510
it kind of was that bad and our industry kind of blows now because we,

440
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,819
we were more obsessed with strange things than, than real outcomes.

441
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:18,260
Yeah.

442
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:19,030
I mean, well,

443
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,439
the fact that I'm looking for even just basic tools

444
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:26,790
and strategies to measure risk and quantify it and,

445
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,160
like,

446
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,589
I'm currently working on essentially a list and relationships of

447
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,530
attacks against Blockchain and DLT S and nobody has that.

448
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:33,780
I mean,

449
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,500
that's pretty new. So that doesn't shock me.

450
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,819
Blockchain has been around since 2008 and we've been doing hundreds of

451
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:43,300
millions of dollars through blockchains over the last four or five years.

452
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:44,630
Like,

453
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:45,339
come on

454
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,689
or a simple, a really simple thing.

455
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,150
I know Microsoft has a good attack modeling tool for windows. No, that's it.

456
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,910
There's like, I've, I've looked off and on for an attack modeling tool

457
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,209
to like, model attack surfaces

458
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:00,920
-- and list them in the relationships with other things. I've never found
-- one.

459
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,280
There's a handful of tools, but I would agree that it's few and far between,

460
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,569
here's where

461
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:11,729
I'm going to put my cult hat back on. So there's probably someone out there saying, oh

462
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,989
wasp, does this or this group? Does this or this group does this.

463
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,969
And I found the vast majority of these groups are insular

464
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:26,453
and they don't generally create things that are helpful to the general public.

465
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:30,753
I am guessing somebody's listening to this podcast and doesn't know what CVE is or

466
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:32,762
CWE probably

467
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:35,343
CWE for sure, because so few people know what CWE

468
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,152
is,

469
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:36,892
right?

470
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,703
And you know, that's just how it is like,

471
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:40,613
and CVE and CWE have been around for two

472
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:44,052
-- decades and
-- there's nothing wrong with that either.

473
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:45,932
-- We should be clear.
-- True. Yeah.

474
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,932
Most people don't really actually know what a barcode is. If you ask them to,

475
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:50,816
it's ok

476
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:53,225
to not know what something is

477
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:57,975
and to go learn about it. And, and again, we've historically been

478
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:04,645
-- very bad at helping people learn because we ridicule before we educate.
-- Well.

479
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:07,176
And also why, like, why would anybody want to know this?

480
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:07,576
Like, I,

481
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:10,255
I actually know more than I should about plumbing and electrical standards.

482
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:13,465
Thanks to home rentals. But like, there's no way normal people need to know this.

483
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:14,735
They just hire a plumber man.

484
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,560
Yeah.

485
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,650
Like, I'm like that for car stuff and my lawnmower,

486
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,949
like I just paid them 80 bucks to fix my lawnmower.

487
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,900
But, like, here's part of the problem is if my toilet quits working,

488
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,560
I know to call a plumber.

489
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:31,420
If my internet is broken.

490
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,579
What do, what? Right.

491
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm going to call the cable company and then

492
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,099
they're going to send someone out and be like,

493
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:39,060
-- but
-- like, your device is acting, walking, showing weird ads.

494
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:42,900
Yeah, that's a better example. Like, who do you, who helps there?

495
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,180
And even, even in the context of a business,

496
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,619
there's plenty of ineffective security teams but

497
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,562
people don't even know sometimes that,

498
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:55,641
-- that they're not doing their job when
-- I see stuff like geek squad or whatever.

499
00:21:55,651 --> 00:21:58,442
You know, those big store tech healthy things,

500
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:01,222
then you hear the articles like how they're just ripping people off.

501
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:01,472
Yeah.

502
00:22:01,482 --> 00:22:01,842
I mean,

503
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:03,761
you can't really blame people for not trusting this

504
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:06,641
industry in these things and thinking poorly of us.

505
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:08,281
Here's, here's a better way

506
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:11,212
to think of this and I know I know what the answer is

507
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:14,442
but I just want you to pretend that there aren't professional organizations here.

508
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:19,394
How do you know your accountant isn't ripping you off and stealing

509
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:23,484
from you or misfiling your tax paperwork or any of that?

510
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:27,703
Right. Well, in theory they are a CPA or whatever the phrase is a charter.

511
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:32,473
Let's pretend, let's pretend the professional certifications don't exist.

512
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:35,443
How would, you know, your accountant isn't ripping you off?

513
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:36,404
-- Well,
-- you don't, you

514
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:37,223
wouldn't know

515
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,446
a bunch of them would for sure.

516
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:43,406
Every time I see information security discussed on Twitter, it's pretty clear

517
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:45,956
that the cult aspect of it comes out pretty quick,

518
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,166
for sure.

519
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:50,765
Oh, man, there's so many funny stories about

520
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:53,686
the madness of that. My favorite actually is

521
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:57,046
there was someone who put a tweet up. I'll try to find it.

522
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:59,635
I doubt I'll be able to find it because I don't even know who said this.

523
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:00,725
But it was basically

524
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:03,579
infosec Twitter is full of really smart people doing

525
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:07,060
really interesting work and people with lots of followers.

526
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,520
I'm like, oh, my goodness,

527
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:13,500
like that's a burn but it's in some ways it's kind of true because like,

528
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,229
I feel like it is and this is just true in general.

529
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,959
I think of, of any community is

530
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,599
having the ability to gain attention to yourself

531
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,660
and have lots of followers on social media

532
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,979
that is a different skill than being actually

533
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,500
good at the thing you talk about sometimes.

534
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,744
-- That's why it's true of any industry.
-- Right. Right. Exactly. Exactly.

535
00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:37,915
-- So, I think that about wraps it up.
-- We're not going to wrap it up here.

536
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:41,364
I want to like, what next? What does it mean? Right. OK.

537
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,545
So let's, let's assume information security is a cult which

538
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,045
I

539
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:47,505
don't think we're going to get a lot of argument there.

540
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,824
But, like, what do you do about it? Right.

541
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:53,935
What's the out, how do you, how do you get out? How do you escape this cult.

542
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:54,944
What's the answer?

543
00:23:54,954 --> 00:23:58,464
I think the answer and this is nice because it actually helps in users is,

544
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:00,155
is actually listening

545
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:04,410
to end users and sort of actually listening to reality a

546
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,849
bit better and being a bit more empathic and kind and

547
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:11,180
actually sort of helping people and I don't mean helping

548
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:13,579
people the way you think they should be helped,

549
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,099
but helping people in the sense of actually talking to them and asking them

550
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,760
what do they need and want

551
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,410
-- and, and those are two different things to be clear.
-- Right?

552
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,290
Yeah. What they need is often more important than what they want.

553
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:30,270
Well, but what they want is, you know, that that's what they'll kill you for sense of

554
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,219
sense of safety, things like that.

555
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,489
Well, no, like I, I want,

556
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:36,930
I want a self driving car.

557
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,109
Do I need that?

558
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,569
Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, most people don't anyways.

559
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,310
And so I think the industry actually reaching out to people, you know, for example,

560
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,209
if a developer comes to you with a question, you know, maybe

561
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:53,493
we actually talk with them before giving them an answer to find out, you know,

562
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:56,353
what it is, they, they're really wanting to ask.

563
00:24:56,363 --> 00:25:00,703
I, I have a slightly better way to describe that I think

564
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:04,552
and I would describe it as do as little as possible.

565
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:08,312
And what I mean by that is we are notorious

566
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:11,912
for a developer saying I would like to write Secure code

567
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:16,312
and then we start going on and on about security development life cycle.

568
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:20,316
You have to do threat modeling and you have to do a tax surface analysis and you have

569
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,306
to do this and you have to use these

570
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:24,906
certain functions and don't use these other functions.

571
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:25,176
And,

572
00:25:25,515 --> 00:25:26,066
and of course,

573
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:28,995
anyone who isn't buried in the middle of all of this

574
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:31,576
is going to just like shake their head and walk away.

575
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:35,515
right? Because they don't know what to do. I think this is one of those instances.

576
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,686
If someone says I want to write more secure code,

577
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:40,225
what is the one thing they could do?

578
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:44,456
That would be very un invasive, that would have an impact

579
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,449
and start there, right?

580
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:52,150
Do as little as possible because what the developer actually saying

581
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,930
to you is I want to be your friend and I

582
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:57,229
would like you to help me a little bit and if

583
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,969
you go on and on with a laundry list of things,

584
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:02,969
they're just going to say, what have I gotten myself into?

585
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,290
Well, and there's always that fear too,

586
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,890
you're going to punish them for getting it wrong.

587
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,609
Well, and actually actually that is a valid fear. But,

588
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,300
but if you even look at it from the, from the like legitimate cult perspective,

589
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,030
if you show up at a cult and or rather, I guess no one really shows up at a cult,

590
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,380
but like a cult leader isn't going to go out and say, oh my goodness,

591
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,819
you have to join my cult and here's our list of 700 crazy rules.

592
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,630
You're going to be like, no,

593
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,140
I'm not doing any of those things and that's not how they get you right.

594
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,619
They get you by becoming your friend and

595
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,260
introducing you very slowly to these concepts.

596
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,000
And before you know it, you're, you're in

597
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,239
and I think in,

598
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,260
in a way security needs to do kind of a similar thing is we

599
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,660
can't show up with a huge list of rules because people are like,

600
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,569
y'all are crazy. Go away.

601
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:51,630
But if you, if you help and you, you help with one thing, one little thing

602
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,319
that is how we bring people into our fold

603
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,810
and additionally bring ourselves into their fold because they're going to teach

604
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,939
us as much as we're going to teach them for sure.

605
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,390
Yeah.

606
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,680
All right. I feel like this was,

607
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:04,229
I,

608
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:07,329
I feel better ending on a reasonable note now

609
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:10,430
versus before where I felt like what just happened.

610
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,280
So

611
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:13,369
this is hard though, right?

612
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,369
It's very hard and I'm sure we'll get some flak for calling information security.

613
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,619
A cult, which I won't

614
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:22,579
-- prove us wrong.
-- That's exactly what cult members would say.

615
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,660
No true Scotsman, right?

616
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:29,969
Uh

617
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,930
Well, I mean, a cult would deny that it's a cult, right?

618
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:34,849
I mean, that's exactly what they would say.

619
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:38,689
That is probably what every cult ever has said.

620
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:43,060
We should start a cult that is a cult and we acknowledge we're a cult.

621
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:44,189
I feel like there's some,

622
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,050
there's, there's some traction there we could go with, right?

623
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,410
The motto could be probably not a cult. Anyway. Anyway,

624
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:54,420
we should, we should make some merch

625
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,979
information security. Probably not a cult

626
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:58,770
anyway.

627
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,310
All right, I'm going to edit. So thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

628
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,099
The few of you that made it this far you can go to over social security

629
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,540
podcast.com. Head up the show notes, you can use the Pound O

630
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,119
podcast hashtag to hit us up on social media

631
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,069
and Kurt have a fantastic rest of your day.

632
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,069
-- You too. Thanks everybody.
-- Thanks everyone. Bye bye.
