Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 111 with myself,

1
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:10,939
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,050
and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,520
111 seems more exciting than 100 and 11.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,479
But whatever,

5
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,870
I can't remotely understand

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,350
why you would call this episode.

7
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:27,100
What

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,860
R PC? 111?

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,240
Right. Oh, I see. I see.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,529
Anyway. 111.

11
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:36,169
Right. So, how are you doing, man? Uh,

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,450
good, good. The smoke is gone.

13
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:39,259
We had our

14
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:40,119
summer forest

15
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:40,610
choir in

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,619
BC.

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,369
No, no, no BC had them.

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,770
We just get the smoke.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,310
Right. Right. Actually, where I live way over in the middle ish

20
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,029
easty part of the United States.

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,830
We have haze from the California wildfires which are 2000 miles away.

22
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,150
Yeah. Well,

23
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,459
it's, it's crazy. I, I didn't think that would be a thing in effect.

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,940
It was funny because when I was leaving Vegas,

25
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:05,879
I,

26
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:08,269
I left before the sun came up and the sun

27
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:10,790
was rising over the mountains and the cab driver says,

28
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,519
look at all that smoke. And I said, what? The fog,

29
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,650
there's no fog in the desert.

30
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,669
Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't think Nevada is known for its foggy

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,940
weather.

32
00:01:22,309 --> 00:01:24,779
Well, where I live we would call it fog.

33
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,239
However, in this case, it was smoke from fires and I thought, wow, that's crazy.

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,480
Like,

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,900
I hadn't been outside because it was 100 and 10 degrees. So,

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,050
yeah. Yeah.

37
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,339
And,

38
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,779
and it turned out when I got home and they had on

39
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,949
the news that there was haze here as well from California wildfire.

40
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,099
So, that's pretty wild.

41
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:48,059
Yeah. No, last week we managed to, uh, I think we, we had the worst air quality index

42
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:48,750
like

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,660
in the world.

44
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:51,500
No, I, I'm

45
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:52,680
for a major cities.

46
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,610
I don't know, man.

47
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,940
Anyway, whatever. Right. So,

48
00:01:58,339 --> 00:01:59,860
what, what are we talking about today?

49
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,180
Well, you know, I think the big news right now would be TLS,

50
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,180
1.3 is finally going to be a thing.

51
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:09,080
Seriously. I'm super excited. You can, you can tell from the sound of my voice.

52
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:09,380
Right.

53
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,149
-- Well, it's one of those
-- things where

54
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:12,820
it,

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,220
you know, it's like having, it's like, it's like hydraulic concrete

56
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,139
in the, you know, most people don't really care but the,

57
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,899
the things you can build with it

58
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,190
are pretty cool

59
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,309
and some of the problems it solves are, are,

60
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,470
I think the biggest thing, you know, because I was reading this one,

61
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,139
I remember this one cloud flare blog where they talked about something a while back,

62
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:33,619
how they,

63
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,009
they basically tidied up something and I think it was Engine X to

64
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,940
make it a little bit faster and save something like 54 man years,

65
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,539
people years or whatever we call it now

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,270
of like waiting time for web pages to load.

67
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,940
And that's one of the things TLS does is TLS,

68
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,990
not only is better from a security perspective than TLS. 1011 and 12,

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,320
but it's faster.

70
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:53,169
And honestly,

71
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:56,320
when you think about how many TLS connections happen and how many people,

72
00:02:57,029 --> 00:03:01,389
like let's face it, it, it, it's not a lot like maybe a couple 100 milliseconds,

73
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,410
but a couple 100 milliseconds times a few billion times a day.

74
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,289
Yeah, it's huge man.

75
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,050
And, and we should also clarify for people who don't know. Hydraulic concrete

76
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:16,050
is magic because generally when you, when you have say concrete, you,

77
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,610
you obviously mix everything up in the water and then you pour it

78
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,729
out and it dries and it shrinks a little bit because the water leaves

79
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,380
hydraulic concrete gets bigger. When it dries, you can

80
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:26,399
pour it in the water

81
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,429
-- and it does work underwater. Yes, that's the thing.
-- Right.

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,630
Normally when you pump concrete into water, you get,

83
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:35,110
well, not just got concrete, spread out water.

84
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,240
Exactly.

85
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,190
Pretty much sand and aggregate

86
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,990
and yeah, hydraulic concrete.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,199
You can pour it in like you,

88
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,210
the Romans would literally build a form that would be full of water.

89
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,850
Like they would basically build a wooden box around a piece of water

90
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,250
and fill it with hydraulic concrete and then they'd have a pier a week later.

91
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,660
-- It's crazy stuff
-- anyway. Magic

92
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:53,970
man.

93
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,089
All right. So, now people know and, and you're absolutely right though.

94
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,029
TLS 13 is something that

95
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,009
most people have no idea. It's even a thing.

96
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,850
Most people will ever really see the benefits of it. Technically speaking.

97
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,279
But, but their lives will get better and they won't even know it.

98
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,589
Which is awesome.

99
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,460
Yeah.

100
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:16,829
Well, and what I also love is not only is TLS 1.3 better in speed and performance and um

101
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,278
security,

102
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:23,598
but it really paves the road to make some really good future advances that,

103
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:26,308
you know, really will help people with their privacy.

104
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,118
Uh So like here's a dirty secret,

105
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,109
Josh, when you go to a TLS website,

106
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:34,319
do I know which website you're going to?

107
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:36,438
You can't prove anything.

108
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:39,739
Yes, I can. The server name indicator part isn't encrypted yet.

109
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,910
It is not. That's true. Right.

110
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,799
So either you're going to a website that only

111
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:46,399
hosts one website or it hosts multiple websites.

112
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,329
And so you use a thing called server name indicator because the problem is

113
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,640
you have typically in the modern world, a web server hosting more than one website

114
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,619
because scale issues.

115
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,679
And um,

116
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,609
well, when you want to talk an encrypted connection,

117
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:01,670
you first of all need to know which one you want to talk to, right?

118
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,190
Because if you go to a server and say

119
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,420
I want to talk encrypted and it hands you

120
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,980
a certificate for cre.org and you typed in cnn.com.

121
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:09,850
It's kind of like your browser is going to freak out.

122
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:14,549
So first your browser is like, I want to talk to cnn.com and then the server goes. Ok?

123
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,480
Cool. Yeah, I have a certificate for that and I know how to do that. Let's do that.

124
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:20,160
So for example, with TLS, you know,

125
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,540
1.2 and earlier with server name indicator support,

126
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,109
you're still leaking

127
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,140
the, the, the host you're wanting

128
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:29,100
to talk to.

129
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,339
Right? And, and that

130
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,579
it can be a big deal.

131
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:34,500
Like when you go to cloud flare, you know, they host a gazillion websites,

132
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,140
some of them are fine and some of them, your government might not be so happy about.

133
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:39,739
Right. Right.

134
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,320
There's, there's many reasons to do this and, and the thing is,

135
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:45,959
I know there's always the, if you have nothing to hide,

136
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,720
you have nothing to fear crowd.

137
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,100
But I mean, fundamentally

138
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,859
this is one of those things, right?

139
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:53,500
They, they totally do and, and people who say that are,

140
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,440
are they either knowingly evil or they don't understand the problem?

141
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,940
It's one of those things that

142
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,779
everyone has to hide equally

143
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,160
because there are people who have legitimate needs for this

144
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,390
and of course there are some bad guys but whatever,

145
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:07,640
you know,

146
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,880
-- and
-- there are people that will punish you for doing something that's normal

147
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,929
and make your life a misery and, you know.

148
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,769
Yeah, I think online privacy is a, is a big deal because like

149
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,440
our lives are online now

150
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,440
end of story,

151
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:22,190
you know.

152
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,279
So yeah, so t that's one point through um

153
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,619
the, and one of the other things I love about the safety, they made some,

154
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,480
well,

155
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:33,399
they made a combination of safety and security

156
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,170
decisions in TLS 1.3 that really help things.

157
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,230
So for example, with Diffie

158
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,720
Hellman,

159
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,690
you've got

160
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,690
a bunch of parameters you can set,

161
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,049
not all of them are safe. So

162
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:47,489
what happens when you give a bunch of software developers

163
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,070
the ability to shoot themselves in the foot?

164
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,100
They totally do and, and on that note as well. So there are two sides to that though.

165
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:56,920
There have been honest mistakes

166
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,190
where people accidentally picked bad DH parameters

167
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,980
and there've been, well, yeah, that it's always, they don't know better. Right.

168
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:05,630
It's mistakes

169
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:09,029
and then there's been malicious attacks that go after, you know,

170
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,700
purposely causing that DH parameters to occur.

171
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,899
And so that's obviously,

172
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,179
I mean, that's a problem. Right. You, you

173
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,089
and how did they fix it? Let's, let's start there.

174
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:23,420
Uh Well, so they basically picked a safe set of parameters and that's what we use,

175
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,309
which is awesome. Right. Like,

176
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:26,160
yeah,

177
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:27,579
-- seriously,
-- like

178
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,230
we all drive on the,

179
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:32,089
I'm going to say correct side of the road for whatever your country is.

180
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,940
There's only one proper side.

181
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,420
People drive on the right side of the road and then there's what,

182
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:38,700
-- like two countries that drive
-- on

183
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,209
the left side.

184
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,880
Sweden, Japan, Britain, uh, New Zealand. Um,

185
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,329
couple others.

186
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:50,809
It's a rounding error of cars. That's what it is.

187
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,329
And if you don't like that

188
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,609
two B

189
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:59,890
this is, this is what happens when you let people decide they choose wrong.

190
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:05,019
Well, and there's something to be said for, even if it's wrong for consistency

191
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,029
because at least with consistency you can, you can clean it up.

192
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,029
Definitely.

193
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,130
It's better to be consistently wrong

194
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,010
than, than occasionally. Right?

195
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:17,260
Yeah.

196
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:18,239
Yeah.

197
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,579
Um So yeah.

198
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:22,519
No, they've, they've done a lot of good work and um well, I mean,

199
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:25,390
I just love what I really love is looking at sort of the original.

200
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,160
So, uh this guy, Eric

201
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:27,980
Rescorla,

202
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,649
I apologize for saying your name wrong. I'm

203
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,119
99% certain. I said his last name wrong

204
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,400
anyways, this is back in 2013, you know, and it's this,

205
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,659
he had this beautiful slide deck called the TLS 1.3 wish list,

206
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,049
right? Who doesn't have a wish list? We all have one, right?

207
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,979
I want a pony

208
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,919
he talks about. So here we go.

209
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,969
Basically, they want to reduce handshake latency, right?

210
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:48,239
Because well, speed is good,

211
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:48,960
right?

212
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,070
They want to encrypt more of the handshake, you know, again,

213
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,809
things like server name extensions, the extensions, the,

214
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:55,690
you know,

215
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,929
so here's what I love uh current

216
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,580
handshake leaks essentially all the negotiated information.

217
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,409
Yep, that's true.

218
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,099
Both sides identities. Yep. All extensions. Yep, the target,

219
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,859
they want to protect both sides identities from passive Attackers.

220
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:10,880
So that's your sort of man in the middle machines

221
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,559
that are either nation states or your helpful corporate network,

222
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,099
right?

223
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,179
Uh protect at least one side's identity from active Attackers, which

224
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,659
again with these men in the middle boxes there, you know,

225
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:23,530
there's a lot of active shenanigans going on

226
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:25,340
and then ideally also protect as many

227
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,580
extensions and other information as possible.

228
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,280
Um

229
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,340
The other thing is, you know, improve uh

230
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,280
cross protocol attack resistance, right? So

231
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:37,539
the signature in the server key exchange doesn't cover the entire handshake,

232
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:37,760
right?

233
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,150
See,

234
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:38,940
um

235
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:43,349
one challenge is traditionally, you know, the the server key, you,

236
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,510
you kind of pop that

237
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,099
and now you could play, you could, if you hadn't passed recorded traffic,

238
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:50,900
you can now decrypt it.

239
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:51,179
All

240
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,989
right.

241
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,349
And that

242
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:54,489
can

243
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,090
-- deal with that. I mean, there is perfect forward secrecy. Yeah.
-- Have you tried?

244
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,369
I double dog dare you to set it up.

245
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,640
I've never set it up and I'm not going to

246
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:06,659
unless it's like something, you know, where you can just

247
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,179
click a check box. No.

248
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:11,125
And so that's a great example because for example, yeah,

249
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,994
there aren't attacks to decrypt this stuff right now, but

250
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,794
there are certainly agencies hoovering up large amounts of

251
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:18,494
data and storing it because let's face it.

252
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,054
Data storage is pretty cheap nowadays, you know,

253
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:24,565
you burn that stuff to CD or DVD or whatever the heck, those optical discs,

254
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,080
whatever the technology is now,

255
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:31,159
you know, and you just keep it in a vault forever until it may be useful in 20 years.

256
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,000
You know,

257
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,520
another thing I

258
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,799
really love is that they essentially,

259
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,880
when it comes like AES advanced encryption standard is

260
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,859
a good encryption standard, right?

261
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:46,270
Like it had some teething issues when it first came out way back in the day.

262
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,299
But fundamentally, it is a good solid encryption standard

263
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,450
having said that

264
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,419
like any tool you can also smash your thumb with it,

265
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,960
right? AES has different modes.

266
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,539
There's like cipher block, chaining mode, CBC mode, there's, you know,

267
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:01,750
stream mode there or not stream mode, but whatever, there's different modes,

268
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,390
you can use it in

269
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,380
some of them are wrong

270
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,340
in the context of like TLS 1.3 right?

271
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,280
And so they've essentially as much as they can,

272
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,599
they've taken away the ability for people to do it wrong,

273
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:14,239
you know, again, going back to

274
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,280
like we know better now.

275
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:20,780
And if we know better now, why would we give you the option of doing it wrong?

276
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,919
Like we know these things are wrong now.

277
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,349
That's it. Like it's just why would we let you do that?

278
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,030
You know, it's like my car dings at me if I don't put my seatbelt on

279
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:31,049
because I'm doing it wrong. Like I should put my seatbelt on

280
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,640
and, and I think

281
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:36,640
this is one of those things that impresses me immensely with

282
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,780
TLS 13 because I remember in the TLS 12 time frame,

283
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,169
there was a, a

284
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,429
huge hesitation to deprecate anything.

285
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:49,469
And it's, I mean, it's been one of the biggest problems with TLS 12 is it,

286
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,280
it supports the

287
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:50,969
kitchen

288
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:51,380
sink

289
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,590
network protocol.

290
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,950
They always keep backwards compatibility

291
00:11:56,729 --> 00:12:02,169
and especially with something like TLS that is like a death sentence because

292
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,559
attacks evolve.

293
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,909
And now you have all this old garbage and you have to figure out what do we do with this?

294
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,130
And, and in the case of TLS 12,

295
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,150
they've,

296
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,429
they've let a lot of it hobble along much longer than it should

297
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,830
have just because there isn't a good way to get rid of it.

298
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:16,880
Well,

299
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,359
and I get the counter argument is that you

300
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,380
have a lot of devices that simply can't be upgraded

301
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,299
and it really sucks to be those people and all

302
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,919
of a sudden your phone or your whatever stops working

303
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,520
and I get it because a lot of people can't simply,

304
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,859
well, I mean, the,

305
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:30,669
the Fukushima power plant just came out in the news

306
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,789
that they have not only do they use Windows XP,

307
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,239
but guess how many machines they have running?

308
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,070
Windows XP.

309
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,570
Probably all of them.

310
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,979
Well, I think the number was 48,000.

311
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:45,539
I know. I'm like, I get that nuclear power plants are complicated but

312
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:49,390
like 48,000 machines. Running Windows XP is a lot

313
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:53,590
-- of machines, running windows XP. Yeah,
-- that's pretty bonkers. I won't disagree.

314
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,020
Yeah.

315
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:55,299
Um,

316
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,739
yeah, like I, yeah, anyways

317
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,460
just

318
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,049
gamp them, it'll be fine

319
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:03,340
except you can't because, you know, they want their online reporting.

320
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,919
But, so going to that, I, I get both sides there.

321
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,619
I mean, like, on the one hand I don't want to break, like, every cheap cell phone,

322
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,719
you know, in developing countries because that kind of sucks for those people.

323
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,299
But at the same time, it's like, I'm, you know,

324
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,809
we sometimes we have to move on and like, you know, we picked 100 and 20 volt power. Um,

325
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,799
you know, in most of North America, most of the world and, and that's,

326
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:25,770
that's what it is and

327
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,200
most of the world is 240 volt, isn't it?

328
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:30,559
I, I think one

329
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:31,650
don't

330
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,770
know,

331
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,549
-- technically
-- we have 240 here. It's just, we use 120 high

332
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,270
amperage and

333
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:39,039
their hoses burned down. But, you know, it's fine. We have

334
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,799
it in truck breakers now.

335
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:42,400
It's,

336
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,419
but fundamentally with like network protocols, right?

337
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,159
Like you look at some of them like email or like,

338
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,780
well, http, I mean,

339
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,969
some of the backwards craft we've kept that has been an unending series of pain. Like

340
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:59,059
that's one thing I really respect about the Open SSH people is that they like

341
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,700
have done releases where it's like we as of this release,

342
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,380
we no longer support Open SSH or sorry SSH protocol version,

343
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,169
like one point X basically

344
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,630
like,

345
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,530
and they can do that because they're open source and I'm gonna,

346
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:17,010
I'm gonna stand up on my soapbox here for a minute because I've, I've dealt with this

347
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,729
more than once is where

348
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,419
we want. I've been dealing with some open source projects where

349
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,159
you want to upgrade something and people say, oh, but it doesn't run on like, so

350
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:30,250
os version two from 1984

351
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:35,729
and, and the answer is ok. So here's the deal. Number one, if you want that,

352
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,299
uh you can fix it,

353
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,780
right? And number two

354
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,979
just run the old version and fork it and maintain it.

355
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,320
You don't have to run this new one because we want to support, you know,

356
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,979
operating systems only from after 1999.

357
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:49,859
Right?

358
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,000
And,

359
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,900
and I think that's the difference is when

360
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,619
you're dealing with something like open source,

361
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,340
you can, you can tell people no, we're not going to do it.

362
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:59,010
And if you want it, it's up to you.

363
00:14:59,409 --> 00:14:59,789
And,

364
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,619
and I think this is kind of kind of falls into that space

365
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,940
just because everybody's using open source now for all of this stuff.

366
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,070
And so we can say

367
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,989
let's kill old TLS.

368
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:10,590
Yeah.

369
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:11,030
Well, and,

370
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,989
and related to this though is if you have a device

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,010
that can't talk past TLS 1.2 pretty much by definition,

372
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,849
then it has an old software stack that's full of holes and problems

373
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,750
unquestionably,

374
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,830
you know, that, that is a that, that's a factual statement.

375
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:28,770
Yeah. And, and there's still gonna be plenty of them.

376
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,450
I mean, I look at, like, I've got,

377
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,520
I've got a cell phone in the drawer that's running like Android

378
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,650
version four and it's never going to support TL SS 13.

379
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,000
And, and really, I should just throw it away.

380
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,409
I kind of wonder about my bathroom scale.

381
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,270
You know, I have a, uh,

382
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,090
one of those intelligent bathroom scales so I can see a nice little chart of my,

383
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,159
my weight.

384
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,030
Yeah.

385
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:50,650
Well, it,

386
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:51,710
so let me,

387
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,400
let me

388
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,309
ask this,

389
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,409
-- do you connect to the scale or does the scale phone home to something else?
-- The scale

390
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:00,570
connects

391
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:03,010
home for sure. But,

392
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:06,010
and then you also connect to the scale to set it up.

393
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:08,780
Ok. Which I did once,

394
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,400
did you connect over TLS?

395
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,000
-- I have no idea. It was an app.
-- I'm

396
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:16,599
assuming it was

397
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:18,059
me.

398
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,030
I would be shocked

399
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:21,580
and,

400
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,739
and like this is one of those instances where it's

401
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,859
going to be up to the scale manufacturer to say

402
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:28,859
either

403
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,989
we're going to fix a scale or the scale is going to stop working

404
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,020
or we're just going to support TLS 12 until the end of time.

405
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,179
Right.

406
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,380
And,

407
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,659
and I feel like any of those situations are probably acceptable

408
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,280
and they're not your problem unless your skill stops working.

409
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:44,700
Right.

410
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,460
Yeah.

411
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,130
Yeah. And then I would get grouchy.

412
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,260
No, you wouldn't.

413
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,770
Well, you might get grouchy but you're probably still gonna keep using it.

414
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,250
You just won't have magic internet scale data.

415
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,450
Uh That's the main reason I have it is for that

416
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,979
graph because I find the day to day weight is useless.

417
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:01,130
It's looking at the trend over a week or a month.

418
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,089
-- That actually is what is useful.
-- Sure. Sure.

419
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,630
Then you should just build your own with a raspberry pie and,

420
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,219
and on a network cable to it.

421
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:12,060
So it's not using

422
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:17,829
-- and just make it waterproof because it's in a bathroom.
-- That's fine. It's fine.

423
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,930
It's easy. No big deal.

424
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,290
Uh,

425
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,719
no, I'd rather not. I really, really

426
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,069
like buying things that work.

427
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,959
Yeah. So, Ts has, and,

428
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,819
and the thing I really like about Ts 1.32 is that

429
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,510
sorry,

430
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,760
the thing I like about Ts 1.3 as well. Just so I confuse people.

431
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,000
Sorry is that

432
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,560
they support perfect forward secrecy.

433
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:41,569
Part of that basically means breaking man in the middle boxes.

434
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,500
Yes.

435
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,219
And, and that,

436
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,400
I don't know, we're going to see how that one plays out.

437
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:50,979
Well, so the, the argument there is that, you know,

438
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:53,530
all you're on the corporate network are we have this mandate to, you know,

439
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,760
inspect all encrypted traffic because of what is it socks or

440
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,540
not

441
00:17:58,729 --> 00:17:59,949
H A but is it socks or

442
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:00,599
-- one
-- of
-- those

443
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,170
financial

444
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:03,109
all crazy like that?

445
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:03,800
Yeah.

446
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,349
So anyways, because that's a,

447
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,969
that is a lot easier to deploy than to actually like go

448
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:12,310
on to end points and deploy something on the end points to

449
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:13,510
II, I don't know,

450
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,469
decrypt the traffic and send a clear text encrypted version to some central server,

451
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,349
whatever, whatever right point is.

452
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:20,400
Um

453
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,750
I think that's a poorly thought out security mandate because essentially

454
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,829
it's a security mechanism that requires you to behave like an attacker. Really?

455
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,270
Right. Having a man in the middle box.

456
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:35,030
Um, so breaking it is something most of us technical people are kind of like, yeah,

457
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,670
too bad,

458
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,630
right? Like you need to live with that.

459
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,790
Well, and there's still some things they can do. If I recall correctly, you can

460
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:41,930
in

461
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:42,479
the

462
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:43,550
certificate,

463
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,030
-- you need a root.
-- It's just a lot harder.

464
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,390
-- It doesn't work as magically as before, which
-- is good.

465
00:18:49,614 --> 00:18:53,555
I think, I think a magic man in the middle is dangerous

466
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:57,675
-- in almost every situation.
-- Well, there's been multiple situations where

467
00:18:57,994 --> 00:19:01,795
people have been found, you know, with certificates that, oh, look at that,

468
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:02,214
you know,

469
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:05,055
we just saw a Google dot Was it google.com,

470
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:07,545
I think or something like it was one of the Google properties,

471
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:09,314
you know, where somebody reported like, hey,

472
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:12,005
I found this certificate of yours floating around and

473
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:13,275
it's from a man in the middle box.

474
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,074
Like what gives,

475
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:16,969
you know, and that's when Google really went after I think it was,

476
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:18,229
I wanna say Symantec.

477
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:18,770
Remember?

478
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,599
Uh

479
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,500
Yes,

480
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,599
I know, maybe,

481
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,800
-- uh
-- it's one of them like that. Yeah,

482
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,900
I think it was a digit order

483
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,189
-- one
-- could have been.

484
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:32,900
There's, there was a couple of them caught with their hand in the cookie jar,

485
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,489
you know,

486
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:36,170
doing these men in the middle certificates that were

487
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:37,479
unrestricted,

488
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:40,150
you know, could just sign whatever they wanted.

489
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:40,949
So,

490
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:45,339
no, it's TLS. 1.3 is, is objectively, it's, it's a better standard.

491
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:49,369
And the thing to remember too is a lot of this TLS stuff. You know, we built

492
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,270
it ages ago and

493
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,800
to put it bluntly like the engineers did their best and

494
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,719
then we deployed it in the real world and,

495
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,400
and we learned a lot and the good news is we learned a lot

496
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,800
and it appears that most of those lessons have been taken to heart

497
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:04,589
and

498
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,810
TLS 1.3 is the result of that,

499
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,949
which is awesome. I mean, so like, let's, let me ask you this TLS, 12

500
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:15,229
is from August of 2008.

501
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,199
We are in

502
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,599
August of 2018. Now, how long is TLS? 13 going to last?

503
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:24,119
Do you think it'll make it 10 years?

504
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,829
Well, when you say last, I mean, it'll be around for at least 10 or 20 years.

505
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,209
But how long until TLS, 1.4 comes out,

506
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,170
I think would be the better question. And I suspect TLS 1.4 might be about five years.

507
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:37,810
Yeah, I think so.

508
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,939
I, I don't know. I think it'll take a while.

509
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,640
Iii I think five years might be optimistic. I'm thinking, I think it might be longer

510
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:47,780
because

511
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,369
the,

512
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,729
the way I see it is the real reason that TLS 13 became

513
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:57,650
a thing was because it became obvious that there were failings of TLS 12

514
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:05,300
and 13, I feel like gets enough. Right. It might last a very, very long time.

515
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,099
Well, I suspect that is true, but with the proviso that

516
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,530
sooner rather than later,

517
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,699
we're gonna probably want to look at

518
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:15,479
some quantum resistant algorithms and some other future

519
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,579
proofing. And I suspect that's why it'll come

520
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,400
out sooner because we've learned that

521
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,699
we, we can't just, oh it's probably good enough. We'll fix this again in 10 years.

522
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:26,489
No, we, we probably should get ahead of it this time around.

523
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,869
We keep talking about that for quantum and I'm not seeing a

524
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,800
lot of positive movement. I see a lot of talk

525
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,030
but I feel like if, if quantum is going to be as bad as people say it is,

526
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,400
it, it might be too late,

527
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:43,219
right?

528
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:44,160
I, I feel like this,

529
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,430
this compares to global warming where everyone's like the

530
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,199
experts are saying how terrible it's going to be.

531
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,910
But the reality is nobody's really doing anything about it.

532
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:53,880
They just,

533
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,319
they posted round one of their comments on the post.

534
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,189
Uh What is it?

535
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,099
N posted round one of comments on

536
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,729
the post quantum cryptography standardization process.

537
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,060
69 submissions.

538
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:04,989
That's quite a lot of stuff

539
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,510
our candidates for quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms

540
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,319
blah blah blah blah blah and that was back in December of 2017.

541
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,099
So and this is moving ahead with this,

542
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:15,400
they're doing some stuff but I feel like they're moving too slow

543
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,640
and it's too late

544
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,400
because if quantum crypto or

545
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:23,489
rather if quantum computers can break RS A like we think it is

546
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:29,229
we're talking 5 to 10 years just to get these algorithms like in use correctly,

547
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:29,500
right?

548
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,709
Not counting optimizations as well as just real word practicality of it.

549
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:34,400
So

550
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,099
I,

551
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,500
I don't know, man. I mean, I,

552
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,890
I feel like we're too slow

553
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,880
assuming this is true. Which of course, we don't even know for sure if it is because

554
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,640
nobody felt one yet.

555
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:52,170
But uh no, there's, there's some definite contenders.

556
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,449
I, I suspect it will happen a bit faster. Hopefully.

557
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:59,569
Uh I'm, I'm not quite as doom and gloom as you. I mean, part of me definitely is, but

558
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,250
I would like to think that

559
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,579
now that we've been through how many major crypto

560
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,410
messes in the last decade?

561
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,910
Half a dozen, a dozen,

562
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:09,280
-- a lot,
-- you know.

563
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:09,869
Yeah,

564
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,329
-- more than I can count, you
-- know.

565
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,420
Uh Here we go, sloth curve

566
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:19,069
swap. We DH Logjam Freak. Sweet 32 Poodle robot.

567
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:24,319
I know there's more but um that's the, the list in this one blog entry, right?

568
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,209
No, it's, I think it's good. And the, the thing I really love too is, is

569
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,550
people are also starting to leverage TLS more,

570
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,369
you know,

571
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,739
I mean, it's great that we have this encrypted standard.

572
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,449
But for example, now, you know, when you go to an HTTP website, now in chrome,

573
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:41,609
it says insecure,

574
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,270
right, like it straight up tells you,

575
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:45,540
uh,

576
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,550
you probably should be going to that http S one basically

577
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,459
DNS

578
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,329
TLS.

579
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:51,670
Exactly.

580
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,670
And that's what drives me nuts about DNS EC.

581
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,660
I mean, don't get me wrong, DNS Sec. It's a good idea. I'm not sure.

582
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,729
It's, no, I'm gonna, I'm gonna call it out and say DNS Sec was a terrible idea

583
00:24:02,949 --> 00:24:05,010
and, and we should not use it

584
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,500
and I know that's not a popular opinion but

585
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,359
I despise it because it's overly complex and ridiculous.

586
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,859
Well, yes, I will give you that.

587
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,949
But the problem with DNS

588
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,060
E

589
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,500
-- is, is it,
-- it's all you need.

590
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,520
-- Yeah.
-- But the thing is you use somebody like cloud,

591
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,900
you just click a box because somebody smart did the hard work.

592
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,619
No, but the thing with DNS E

593
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,180
is, I think that the thing,

594
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:27,079
at least my impression of it is DNS

595
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,000
EC is less about protecting traditional DNS traffic.

596
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,550
Like who is, you know, or not, who is, but who is the IP address for, you know,

597
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,800
cnn.com or whatever?

598
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:39,170
And it's more about some of these new DNS record types. I'd like to talk about where,

599
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,849
you know, we're, we're starting to realize we have a single,

600
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:46,209
actually globally unique name space that's enforced and that's DNS.

601
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:48,400
Right. There's no other globally unique name space

602
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,339
apart from maybe phone numbers,

603
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,280
um,

604
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,160
you know, that's enforced.

605
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,920
And secondly, we can actually publish all sorts of neat stuff to, to DNS,

606
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,119
you know, that can then be used and leveraged by other systems. So, things like

607
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:06,479
who do I allow to be my certificate authorities?

608
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,989
You know. So when you are, I think, uh,

609
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,560
Google uses it, you know,

610
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,729
and they list the two certificate authorities they're allowed to use.

611
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:13,550
So in theory,

612
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:18,109
you know, even if I get a valid certificate from some shady place that's

613
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,040
legitimate, but shady,

614
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,949
your browser should ideally be smart enough to be like, no wait, that's not.

615
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:24,729
Uh you know,

616
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:28,069
somebody that Google said is allowed to assign a certificate on their behalf.

617
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,589
OK. So here's my complaint about this though is

618
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:37,459
when you say something like you, you have to just click a box in Google or Cloud flare,

619
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:39,939
you've just delegated all the trust to them.

620
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,420
So there's a million other words, you could represent this information.

621
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:46,500
We've already done that with root DNS. You've already delegated.

622
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:49,959
-- I agree
-- completely. Which is why DNS SC

623
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,619
is, isn't really solving a problem here.

624
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,119
I think it's more,

625
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,290
I think it's more enabling stuff in the future because then we can

626
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,270
put records into DNS and say

627
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,390
I will serve this record

628
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,560
and you can request this record for me

629
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,099
and you will provably know that you got the correct record for me.

630
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:11,780
And that's going to matter because we're going to use

631
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,040
the contents of this record to help then create a

632
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,119
financial transaction for the

633
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:17,660
email.

634
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,920
You could just as easily host all this stuff over HTTP S because that

635
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,579
is just as trusted

636
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,050
for real. But,

637
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,369
but we don't have

638
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,920
what we have infrastructure existing in the form

639
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,849
of DNS DNS servers and DNS record types

640
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,890
that are easy to define the thing with HTTP S.

641
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:41,280
You would not only have to define like a record type, you'd have to define a location.

642
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,010
-- You'd essentially be reinventing DNS over. Well, http
-- S space

643
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:45,709
DNS

644
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,410
TLS, what a great idea.

645
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:47,890
Yeah.

646
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,280
Um but no, I mean, I, I like the idea. I like the idea of DNS record types too because

647
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,579
DNS auto updates, right?

648
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:59,170
A client comes online and says, hey, I've grabbed this IP address and, you know,

649
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,439
Josh just logged into me.

650
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:00,849
So,

651
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,969
you know, I'm going to register as part of my IP address that, you know,

652
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:08,050
Josh is provably logged in at this IP address and now you, you can trust, you know,

653
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,540
Josh is coming from me.

654
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:10,530
Um

655
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:13,170
going to fix that.

656
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,670
Well, no, but DNS E means that we can do that.

657
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,979
We can't do that without the records being provably correct.

658
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,589
I'm, I'm not going to convince you of this, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna tow the line.

659
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,130
-- DNS EC is overly complex and dumb and doesn't actually solve it.
-- The

660
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:28,680
other thing to remember

661
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,270
is

662
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:33,349
using DNS is a lot more efficient than using HTTP S.

663
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,810
Right. Because you have to make a DNS.

664
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,520
Basically, whenever you talk to the network, you have to make AD N SS call

665
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,160
regardless.

666
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:45,040
Right. Other things exist like DNS has timeouts,

667
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:50,229
http S or H web documents, technically sort of have the high

668
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,189
-- notes, but it's not, they
-- can,

669
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:52,979
well,

670
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:58,300
again, it's not DNS has some standards around this stuff and I'll agree with that.

671
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,900
But once you start ending in DNS SEC, the complexity goes to an 11

672
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,670
and, and people are just going to screw it up and let's say clown.

673
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,130
It totally is.

674
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:13,680
Ok. We're not in TLS 13. We just took away all your options.

675
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:15,170
Yeah. Yeah.

676
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:18,930
No, but still buying a certificate, getting the certificate deployed correctly.

677
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,079
That's

678
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,760
-- trivial
-- thing.

679
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:22,760
That's encrypt. Made it trivial

680
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:23,599
for

681
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,050
real.

682
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,430
I,

683
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,550
anyway, anyway, I feel like

684
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:30,189
TLS 13 is a great first step and,

685
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:33,760
and some of these things people aren't talking about with DNS SE C are,

686
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,790
maybe they'll turn into something, maybe they won't.

687
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,089
But I think

688
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,810
we need a, let's encrypt of DNS Sec that makes it insanely trivial to use. Right.

689
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:43,969
It, it's, that, here's the thing.

690
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:46,040
Let's encrypt is less about the certificate and more

691
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,390
about the tools that automate away all the,

692
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
all the silliness.

693
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,010
Right.

694
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,079
Yeah. Well, and part of it too is, uh, it's not just,

695
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:55,010
it's the automation piece.

696
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:59,800
Yeah. Like, like you pointed out anything that requires a human

697
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,880
to do it more like setting out my bathroom scale once. Cool. I'll do that once

698
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,560
-- and I better never have to do it again until
-- TLS 12

699
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:08,030
breaks

700
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,599
because that means it's broken.

701
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,989
You know, and that's, that's the thing, right?

702
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,219
Like if DNS Sec is essentially turning,

703
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:19,619
like you install bind or you install windows server or whatever.

704
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:21,260
And you literally,

705
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:23,750
well, the case of windows is a good example, right? Because you've got a gooey

706
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:26,650
and you, I'm looking at this blog entry and you literally

707
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,569
step one, open server manager, click tools and open DNS manager.

708
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:32,170
Step two in the DNS manager browse to your domain name, then, right?

709
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,689
Click domain name, click DNS sec and then click sign zone

710
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:38,069
and then it walks you through a wizard to set it up neat

711
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,209
bind

712
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,030
and

713
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:43,630
no, sadly bind does not. But

714
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:45,680
somebody could produce a shell script that would do it,

715
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:47,310
shell script is never the answer

716
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,180
anyway,

717
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,550
-- you know what
-- I'm saying? Right? Like you could build a nice little pipe.

718
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:50,670
I

719
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:50,849
can

720
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:54,000
argue with you and I will, I will maintain

721
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:56,785
that. The challenge here is the key management,

722
00:29:57,025 --> 00:29:58,305
not setting it up

723
00:29:59,314 --> 00:29:59,415
and

724
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:02,795
well doing key management properly

725
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,074
-- is a nightmare doing it poorly.
-- It

726
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:09,295
is very easy to screw up key management. It is, it is much easier to explain

727
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:09,944
it, right?

728
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,130
Well, it's true. Of most things in life there

729
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,209
anyway.

730
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,770
Yeah, it's something I'm actually looking towards is the whole, you know, how do we,

731
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,510
how do we deal with keys in the cloud?

732
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,810
Right. I mean, the cloud security lines is a great example.

733
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:26,689
We, we don't have a single physical server.

734
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,369
Never have, never will if it's, I have my way and I do,

735
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,459
but obviously, you know, we have certificates,

736
00:30:32,469 --> 00:30:35,000
we have all sorts of things that require encryption keys.

737
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,229
And

738
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,550
luckily most of them are sort of outsourced in the sense of, you know,

739
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,849
aws data encrypted at rest using their,

740
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,420
you know, I am and

741
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,959
I forget what the key thing is called.

742
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,380
Some three letter acronym.

743
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:50,410
But as far as if I actually needed to have access to the key directly. Uh

744
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,239
Yeah.

745
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:52,530
Yeah. What do I do?

746
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,359
I, I,

747
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:54,979
there's no good solution

748
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,510
that isn't very costly. So, yeah, it's,

749
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,630
I, I think this will happen. It'll get easier.

750
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:00,869
I mean,

751
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,810
remember how hard setting up a web server used to

752
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,550
be and I don't mean a secure web server,

753
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,000
I mean, just a web server.

754
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,530
-- It was terrible.
-- You know,

755
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:10,219
-- I remember, man
-- or setting up SSH.

756
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,130
Ssh was never hard.

757
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,680
-- It always did most of the stuff on its own.
-- True.

758
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:18,800
No, it just works out of the box perfectly.

759
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,170
-- That's the difference.
-- It was, it's always been pretty good. So, anyway, anyway.

760
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,920
All right, man, I think we should call it.

761
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:31,810
Uh I guess one other interesting point is my, I bought a pixel two which is the latest

762
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:32,689
phone

763
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,510
and it does,

764
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,719
do they do, like alphabet releases?

765
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,150
What did they? I don't pp,

766
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,239
I don't know.

767
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,760
Oh, was the last one? Yeah, they go in alphabetical order, don't they?

768
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:50,069
Anyway, anyway, it does DNS over TLS by default.

769
00:31:50,449 --> 00:31:53,420
Well, in Android nine, which it upgraded to right after I got

770
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,180
it. And

771
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:58,349
it, uh, yeah, it's cool because I can tell it to use cloud flares,

772
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:00,910
uh DNS server for TLS

773
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,949
instead of Google's, which made me happy because

774
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,050
while I know I really shouldn't trust either of them, it at least makes me feel better

775
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:12,969
farming some of this out to someone else. So there you go.

776
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,199
Alright, cool. Alright man. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
