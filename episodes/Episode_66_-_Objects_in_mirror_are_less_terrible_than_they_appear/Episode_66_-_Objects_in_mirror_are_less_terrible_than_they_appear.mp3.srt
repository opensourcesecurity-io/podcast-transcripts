Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 66 with myself,

1
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:10,859
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,210
and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:16,889
Do you know Kurt that every time we finish an episode?

4
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:20,440
I think maybe nothing exciting will happen this week

5
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,799
and there just won't be anything to talk about next.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,520
-- And I have never been disappointed yet.
-- I think the only way that will happen is if

7
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:34,939
we lose internet connectivity and cell and power and

8
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:39,520
-- basically, if one of us spends a week in the woods,
-- maybe the end of the world,

9
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:41,610
although maybe if I spent a week in the woods,

10
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,970
I bet I'd have all kinds of fun stuff to talk about.

11
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:44,270
Right.

12
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,340
I don't even know where to. Like,

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,819
there's just so much that's wrong.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,080
Like, well, how about we get the quick stuff out of the way? So,

15
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,619
you heard the latest eco fact bits

16
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,619
-- fill me in. Let's see if I've heard
-- them.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,279
-- It looks like it might have been state sponsored hacking from China.
-- Right.

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,119
Good for them.

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,230
I can't imagine what, what they need. Maybe, I don't know.

20
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:12,459
Well, I'm thinking for so, for example, Facebook has a social graph of,

21
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,129
at this point, the world

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,050
right to the point where it's creepy. I was reading up on it and, like,

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:24,089
they're linking people who are blood relatives, like biological,

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,550
uh, relations

25
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:26,290
but, like,

26
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,440
didn't know about each other.

27
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:29,239
Yeah, I read about that and,

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,519
and they were far enough removed outside of Facebook

29
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:36,080
and there was no known internet connection between the people

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,360
and, and yet it figured it out, which is crazy.

31
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,000
And then there's other cases where, you know,

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,160
people who want to have multiple identities online, for example, sex workers,

33
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,410
you know, have their profiles being linked and, and well,

34
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,540
that's kind of an easy one because any, any sort of

35
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:53,819
uh for example, I use the same profile photo on everything,

36
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:55,029
right?

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,290
So it's,

38
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,129
it's really easy to find me because you just do like a Google reverse image search and

39
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,069
you'll find everything, plug my name in.

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,199
Um

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,900
But yeah, so it's, it's uh I

42
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,389
I'm, I'm wondering if this is sort of part of

43
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,369
reconnaissance slash building a picture of the US, like who,

44
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,309
you know, who's vulnerable to blackmail, who knows who,

45
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:17,279
you know.

46
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:21,300
And also the thing is if you're, if you're planning an advanced, you know, uh

47
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,119
like if you're doing an attack,

48
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,770
an advanced persistent threat type of attack where you, you know,

49
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:30,860
your goal is to like break into swift uh at a bank and steal $60 million or, you know,

50
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:34,240
shut down a power grid in the Ukraine or whatever chances are, you know,

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,009
that's really valuable when names come up to be able to search

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,839
for them in your little database and know stuff about these people

53
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,000
that could be, that could be what you describe is certainly plausible.

54
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,039
I, I don't know, man, this one's gonna be,

55
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,360
I imagine it's going to be playing out for a long time.

56
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,179
Well, this type of thing, I mean, because it's not like we can stop this,

57
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,899
right? How many companies hold data on us? Basically,

58
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,809
you know, the number of companies I deal with where they they ask for like

59
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,779
really personal information.

60
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:08,720
Like one thing that drives me nuts is companies that ask for postal codes

61
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:09,559
because

62
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,440
-- they know
-- that. Right.

63
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,770
Well, in, in the US it's less terrible with your five number

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,419
uh zip code, right?

65
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:20,619
But if you get the extra four numbers then it's basically your house,

66
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,380
you know, or like my parents' postal code is like, I think it's 10 or 13 houses,

67
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:29,100
right? So, you know, it's,

68
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:29,860
yeah.

69
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:33,820
Um and you know, so I'm, I'm shopping and like they're like, oh,

70
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,610
can we get your postal code?

71
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,399
And I'm like, no,

72
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,539
you mean like it's funny because they used to like give me a weird look

73
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:43,029
and now they're just like, ok and they type 0000 or whatever, you know.

74
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,899
Um So it's, it's definitely, I think people are

75
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:49,610
getting used to refusing to give that information

76
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:52,539
back in the day.

77
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,800
If you refuse to give information, people looked at you were like,

78
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:57,110
when I called up the phone, when you get my DS L and they're like,

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,830
you know, uh we need your driver's license number and I'm like, not super Ken on that,

80
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,460
but sure.

81
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,399
Right.

82
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,460
Because they want, you know, see if I'm really mean and then they're like,

83
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,740
can we have your social insurance number?

84
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,559
And I'm like, no,

85
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,229
and they're like, we need two forms of government ID to sell your DS L

86
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:12,949
Sweet.

87
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,269
I, I do remember that though and when I remember there was a time

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,070
when

89
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,630
it felt like everyone was asking for my social security number,

90
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,140
like everywhere I went

91
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,190
and I of course, wouldn't give it to anybody.

92
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:27,769
And, and yeah, they looked at me like I was some sort of weirdo

93
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,149
and my suspicion is today if you did that, nobody would think you're weird.

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,829
Thank you Equifax.

95
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,260
Unfortunately, the problem is those social security numbers,

96
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:40,920
social insurance numbers, addresses, names, all that stuff is in, you know,

97
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:45,929
16,000 different places with, you know, data brokers reselling that data on.

98
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,079
Yeah, good luck. I mean,

99
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,339
anyway, so that, that's the Equifax big news.

100
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,100
Um Do we want to talk about Kaspersky and the shenanigans going on there?

101
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,670
-- Apparently
-- that, that whole thing is just

102
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,739
my brain doesn't know it is,

103
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,829
it's a badly written movie is what I feel like that is it it's like some terrible

104
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:07,690
for

105
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:08,390
real. I mean,

106
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,200
yes, to a degree. But this particular story is just

107
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,079
ridiculous and, and it's one of those things where,

108
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:16,529
well, how about you fill in

109
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:19,119
-- our listeners.
-- So, what's the latest thing?

110
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:24,279
The latest thing now as it sounds like Israel was hacking Kaspersky and found out

111
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,260
that the Russians were also hacking Kaspersky and

112
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:30,230
had access to us intelligence or something.

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,709
And then Israel told the US and it's just

114
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,899
some NSA tooling or something was found on

115
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,329
Kaspersky computers.

116
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,279
So the current theory is that some NSA contractor took stuff home that they

117
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,570
really shouldn't have had Kaspersky on their machine and that leaked it up or,

118
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,760
or intentionally was used.

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,760
And I mean, that's part of, you know, that's part of the brute, like the reality of,

120
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,040
of anything is that, you know,

121
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:57,160
if you're in a jurisdiction and guys with guns show up and tell you to do something,

122
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,959
-- you're, you're gonna kind of have to do it.
-- Oh, seriously. I agree completely.

123
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,119
And I think that's certainly something

124
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,459
that, that people should keep in mind is

125
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,619
Kaspersky is a Russian company.

126
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,540
And

127
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,309
what I love is all the people saying, oh, you know,

128
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,500
we don't know what's going on and it's like

129
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,359
given the history of everything that's happened between the

130
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:22,899
US and Russia and what is happening today.

131
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,160
If, if Russia isn't leveraging Kaspersky for their advantages,

132
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,559
they're a bunch of idiots.

133
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,130
I mean,

134
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,739
-- they're
-- clearly not a bunch of idiots.

135
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,720
Right. Exactly. Exactly. So, I, I think

136
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,369
anyone pretending this isn't real is,

137
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,100
is running around with bananas in their ears just

138
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,079
for

139
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,950
real. And, and, you know, it's frustrating for me. Right. Because,

140
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:43,899
so

141
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,940
this raises one issue for me, which is like, how, how much can I,

142
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,420
or do I trust the software running on my computer?

143
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,170
Right.

144
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,160
For example, I have a bunch of third party apps that some of them have, you know,

145
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,350
relatively high access, like, say the firewall app or whatever, right?

146
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,950
And um

147
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,480
yeah, I mean, at some point, OK.

148
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,000
Fundamentally,

149
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,220
I have to trust my operating system and the hardware it's running on at a minimum,

150
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,779
right?

151
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,170
And then, you know, the add on stuff like uh I use Google Chrome as my web browser.

152
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,480
Uh So Google Chrome May for the sake of argument,

153
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,459
even if it doesn't have access to my system,

154
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,649
it's got access to all the web stuff I do, which is like in the modern world,

155
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,640
that's like 90% of your computer use.

156
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,420
Basically.

157
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:26,170
Actually, I was,

158
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,799
I was thinking about that the other day is

159
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,579
I am building what I'm calling the container zoo where I'm on my, on my desk,

160
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,429
on my laptop.

161
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,980
I'm sorry,

162
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,230
I'm going to set it up.

163
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,200
So any time I run a shell command, it's going to run in a container

164
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,660
and I started like paying attention to my history and stuff.

165
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:49,339
I do remarkably little in the shell. And I do like 99% of my work in a web browser now.

166
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,059
It's crazy.

167
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,399
Yeah.

168
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,739
No, it's um, and I was thinking about that, like, do we containerize

169
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,660
the web?

170
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:59,859
You know, Firefox has that now with that multiple personalities thing?

171
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:02,559
-- So you could have like a work persona, a personal persona. Maybe you could
-- do

172
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:02,720
that.

173
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:09,470
I do that in Chrome now where I have, I have basically like two web browsers running

174
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,809
where one is for work and one is for home and, and what are they

175
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,329
or something?

176
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,769
Segmenting it even more. So, yeah, I do the same. I have personal profile.

177
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,470
I have work profiles, blah, blah, blah.

178
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,600
But I mean, so within my personal profile, you know, being able to say separate,

179
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,829
separate

180
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,190
out, you know, the news I read from what I shop at Amazon,

181
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,099
I see what you're saying, you know, or if I were to use Facebook,

182
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:35,549
I would prefer for that to probably be separate because, you know,

183
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,739
Facebook tracking across the web is a

184
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,669
thing they know anyway, don't kid yourself.

185
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,469
Yeah. So

186
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,479
yeah, I don't know. I mean, at this point because

187
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,570
segmenting everything properly is just such a colossal pain.

188
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,929
Well, it's not just a pain,

189
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,099
it's almost certainly impossible because even if

190
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,340
you're using a different web browser,

191
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:59,000
I mean, even if you say open an incognito window for everything you did,

192
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,200
they know how to find you,

193
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,070
right. You can't get away from it.

194
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:05,900
Oh yeah.

195
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:07,479
No, like, I mean in HTML five,

196
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:10,010
there's so many things you can use to track people like the canvas,

197
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,559
the local storage, the

198
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,049
heck you can use HSTS headers to track people uniquely.

199
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,440
-- Right.
-- There's, it's crazy, man.

200
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,190
And, but so from my perspective, I guess what,

201
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,150
what I keep thinking of is less the tracking

202
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,349
because I really can't do anything about that.

203
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:33,309
But what I feel like I can do is maybe start thinking

204
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,700
about what am I doing and how am I doing it?

205
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,950
And what can I segment from other things? And, and it's occurred to me now that like

206
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,070
when I'm running a web browser that is unquestionably

207
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,849
my biggest threat

208
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,190
on my system.

209
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,070
Right. Because it's just, it does everything.

210
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,049
Yeah.

211
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:58,260
No, I mean, banking bill's correspondence, email, uh recording this podcast.

212
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,150
I am not recording it in the web browser,

213
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,020
web

214
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:03,359
browser.

215
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,869
We do. I know it's crazy, man. Right. Right.

216
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,330
Why can't Google just record it and send us the copy?

217
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,109
Maybe they are.

218
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:11,840
Yeah.

219
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,469
So, yeah.

220
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,130
II I think honestly at the point and you know what always

221
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,260
drives me nuts is so because it was like the thing,

222
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,010
you know, that, that article about the sex worker being kind of

223
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,049
outed to herself on Facebook and people are like, oh,

224
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,049
people should just take ownership of their data and

225
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,869
not use things like Facebook and it's like,

226
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,849
well, exactly. It's like I don't like cars but

227
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,880
I have a driver's license and I own a car because,

228
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,900
yeah, I live in North America. That's how that works.

229
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,630
You know? Exactly.

230
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,190
And there's just certain things you can't, you can't avoid, I mean,

231
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,929
family coordinating, family stuff,

232
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,440
like a bunch of my extended family uses Facebook.

233
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,690
Even ignore

234
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,585
that though, saying, you know, you should own your data is,

235
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:57,604
is a very naive way to think about this stuff because I mean,

236
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,885
your freaking grocery store knows who you are.

237
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:01,424
I mean, how are you going to control that?

238
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:05,075
How are you going to control the fact that other people on Facebook talk about you.

239
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,094
Even if you don't have

240
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:06,304
a

241
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:06,474
Facebook

242
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:06,934
account

243
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:07,354
pay with

244
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:07,744
cash.

245
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,934
Yeah, that, that'll work out really well. Right.

246
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:12,505
They're going to keep calling the cops.

247
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:15,434
Always bring, bring a note to the bank and hand it to the teller.

248
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,179
Yeah.

249
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,099
Yeah. I mean, that's the reality is, it's, you know,

250
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:25,590
we can't opt out of these systems unless you literally,

251
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,369
I don't know, maybe you send a 12 year old to the store to buy

252
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,500
and then, you know, they're tracking the kids, they just pretend they aren't.

253
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,080
I mean, come on, let's face it.

254
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:38,570
Yeah. I, I don't, I think the answer fundamentally is that this is going to, to

255
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,570
continue because it's just companies feel it's valuable.

256
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,859
What drives me nuts though is,

257
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,210
is they've really worked hard to shift the burden on to the consumer.

258
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:46,609
So it's,

259
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,840
it's no longer bank fraud. It's identity theft, right?

260
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:52,599
And so it's your problem when your identity gets stolen

261
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,849
and it's your problem that you have to sort out,

262
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,469
you know, and prove to these companies that no, you know,

263
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,729
there, there's been cases where people, you know,

264
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,809
had their identity stolen as a child,

265
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:05,280
they weren't even 18 and, you know, they're having to prove

266
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,380
to credit card companies that, like,

267
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,219
legally you couldn't have done this anyway,

268
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:12,099
even if it was me,

269
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,570
you know, I wasn't 18.

270
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,039
And

271
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:21,770
so part of me thinks maybe we should just have like a AAA registry of, you know,

272
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,659
basic facts about everybody.

273
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,809
Like, uh for example, was it Finland or Norway?

274
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,770
Uh everybody's tax returns are published publicly.

275
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:33,409
Interesting, right? It's part of their transparency and their,

276
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:34,849
their sort of um

277
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,710
their culture, you know, of openness

278
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:39,070
and um

279
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,000
part of me thinks, you know, why not do that, right? You know, so that

280
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,090
if I do have to disprove something, it might actually be a bit easier.

281
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:50,419
Uh And on the flip side by having all this information out in public, you know,

282
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,020
anybody that's going to abuse it

283
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,909
will

284
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,140
so easily that hopefully these companies will, you know,

285
00:12:56,669 --> 00:13:00,729
rebuild their systems or change their systems. So they're not so easily abused.

286
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,409
This might not be a completely insane idea.

287
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,010
So, you know what this always makes me think of is

288
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,210
when I've always had a job at a company.

289
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,950
I have never made my cell phone number a secret.

290
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:18,950
And I did this knowingly for a reason though is because I, I actually, I,

291
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,729
I won't tell the story of how I came to this

292
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:23,250
conclusion because it's probably it could put me in jail,

293
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,929
I suspect.

294
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:24,890
But,

295
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:26,609
but the point is when,

296
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:29,570
when you do something for people very willingly

297
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,140
or you give them information very willingly,

298
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:33,489
I feel like

299
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,969
they, they put a burden of guilt on themselves to not abuse it.

300
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,010
Whereas if it's a secret now all of a sudden it's,

301
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,090
I have something and someone else doesn't.

302
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,049
So I'm going to use it to my advantage.

303
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,359
Well, I mean, that's the thing. Right. You can't blackmail.

304
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,039
Well, a great example being, you know, all the, the,

305
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,969
the homosexuals and past the were blackmailed because homosexuality was seen,

306
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,000
you know, in such a negative light now, it's kind of like,

307
00:13:59,169 --> 00:13:59,760
like, and

308
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,530
cares.

309
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,330
Yeah, it's like, so are we having sandwiches for lunch? Like,

310
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,539
I don't get it. What's the big deal? You know?

311
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,469
-- Um,
-- well, although,

312
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,960
although we shouldn't downplay that because there are certainly

313
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,239
places where it's a huge deal

314
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,840
-- where
-- it's legal. Right. Right. Well, not even where it's a legal man.

315
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:19,940
I mean, there are places in the United States where,

316
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,099
where you don't out yourself because you're gonna have a bad day.

317
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,979
You know, luckily neither of us live in those places. But

318
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,659
they, they do exist.

319
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,460
True.

320
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,330
Uh But part of it is, I mean,

321
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,840
it, it kind of comes back to that. It's like Chaos Monkey at Netflix, right?

322
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:37,700
If we create like a baseline of chaos, then when real bad stuff happens,

323
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,659
it's just normal.

324
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:42,570
Um You know, if you, yeah, I mean, outing yourself is definitely not

325
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,640
always an easy thing for people to do, especially if they live in certain places.

326
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,830
Uh Even in North America,

327
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,780
the whole world is chaos monkey. Now,

328
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:52,000
I,

329
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,469
I think that's,

330
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,440
this is something actually, I,

331
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:59,400
so I just moved my blog actually to uh a CSO online

332
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,669
uh today it was, and, and I published an article and,

333
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,479
and it was talking about the fact that maybe things aren't as bad as we think they are

334
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,950
and, and you're talking about everything is so bad

335
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:13,250
but, but it's not right, like the world is functioning.

336
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,710
Equifax got hacked and Equifax is still running as a business.

337
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,599
-- Like explain that to me, right? What, what, what
-- happened?

338
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,989
Who could put them out of business?

339
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,799
It's not like their customers can just suddenly stop.

340
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:27,770
It's not like their customers data was stolen, right?

341
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,530
I mean, that's the reality of it.

342
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:31,969
Their customers don't care, they didn't lose anything.

343
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:34,030
And, and that's the thing, right?

344
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,010
Is like this is what I feel like the world is turning into is

345
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,690
this is just the way stuff is and you know what, it's not bad enough to change it. Yet.

346
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:45,770
I'm not sure it will be.

347
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:47,780
Yes. I think that's

348
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:48,369
the,

349
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,419
that's part of what really gets me because, like,

350
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,200
there are so many things wrong with the world that we just accept.

351
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,750
Like, um, tens of thousands of people die every year in car accidents.

352
00:15:59,859 --> 00:15:59,919
We,

353
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,950
here's what blows me away, for example, cancer. Right.

354
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,979
We've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on research into curing cancer and,

355
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:08,349
you know,

356
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:11,109
made a lot of progress but not completely,

357
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:14,919
you know, I have to imagine self driving cars.

358
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:18,219
That's easily several, tens of thousands of people a year in North America,

359
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:18,799
not dying.

360
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,000
And more importantly, you know,

361
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,549
-- hundreds of thousands of people not being injured sometimes really severely.
-- Oh,

362
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:24,830
yeah.

363
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,260
Well, not just that you think pollution and,

364
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,890
and there's so many other aspects to that,

365
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,940
it's going to be unbelievable what it does.

366
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,219
Yeah, the number of negative externalities.

367
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:36,590
But

368
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,489
here's an important point on, on this though is

369
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,479
cars come with many downsides,

370
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:45,799
but we aren't looking to build self driving cars

371
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:49,419
to remove the negative aspects of regular cars.

372
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,599
We want self driving cars for other reasons.

373
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:55,890
And what this really makes me think of is, I read a quote once that said

374
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,289
the stone age didn't end because we ran out of stone. Right.

375
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,090
And that's kind of what I feel like here and in

376
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:04,729
my suspicion is computer security is going to be the same that

377
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,920
we're going to end up fixing security

378
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,040
not for the sake of fixing security, but rather because there's something better

379
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,790
-- that we're doing
-- instead if we were going to

380
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,709
fix security for the sake of fixing security,

381
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,900
it would have happened sometime in the last three years.

382
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:18,010
And

383
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,348
that's completely true, isn't it? People actually cared.

384
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,229
We would have done something by now,

385
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:24,949
you know, and,

386
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,560
and a lot of people are doing a lot like a great example being like Google's fuzzing,

387
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,030
it's like,

388
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,800
do we, you know, I

389
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,619
security issues are bad.

390
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,010
Crashes in a web browser in general are bad and quite annoying.

391
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,239
Um You know,

392
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,910
let's make sure that the web browser is stable and if we happen

393
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,900
to fix a big pile of security flaws while we're doing that,

394
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,060
you know?

395
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:43,630
Awesome.

396
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:44,199
Yeah.

397
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:44,750
Yeah,

398
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:45,939
I mean, that's,

399
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,310
that is a fair point. But now at the same time, I also wonder

400
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,619
are, are things like Google's fuzzing projects

401
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,900
are those helping to keep things just barely good enough?

402
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:01,420
Whereas if we just gave up and let everything burn down, we'd,

403
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,739
we'd get to fix it faster.

404
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,900
But here's the thing, how would we fix it?

405
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,359
We go back to that poll if I give you a billion, if I give you a billion dollars to,

406
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:11,920
let's let's narrow the problem down.

407
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,170
Not just not fix security but just build me a secure web browser,

408
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,319
here's a billion dollars.

409
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:20,709
Yeah, I would, we'd still have to, we have to define security, right?

410
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:23,890
So ok, it never runs code improperly great.

411
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:27,569
But it still lets people be tracked online, which some people would say is a problem.

412
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:31,150
I would just take your money and live very well

413
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,319
like that. That's the reality of it.

414
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:37,219
And that's basically how most of, most of it works today. I think.

415
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,869
So. I, you know, I, I tend to agree.

416
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,300
I don't think security will get fixed for the sake of fixing security.

417
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,500
But yeah, definitely better things will come along, you know.

418
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,239
Well, a great example, memory management, right? Let's face it.

419
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,060
Most people

420
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,579
can't write code that manages its own memory

421
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,819
C++ being a very solid example of this.

422
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:02,239
So languages that do garbage collection and memory management, you know,

423
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,130
say Python is one of my favorites,

424
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,209
just take away a whole class of problems,

425
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:07,989
not because they're trying to make better security,

426
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,589
but because they're just trying to make,

427
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,880
you know, more efficient programming languages that work better. That's a

428
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,229
very

429
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:15,079
good, you know, certain types of problems.

430
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:19,270
Uh and to be clear, like C and C++ have a place on the planet,

431
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,510
but like you probably shouldn't be building, you know, web servers in them

432
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:29,270
-- anymore. And,
-- and all the web servers are still written in

433
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:29,709
C,

434
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,750
you know, or building shell tools, maybe, I don't know.

435
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,349
There's just, there's so much stuff that really, you know,

436
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:37,609
very few people should actually be allowed to write in

437
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,020
C and C++ is basically what my point would be,

438
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,989
you should have like a special license.

439
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,989
I'm not even going to go there.

440
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,819
Well, you know, you, you remind me too.

441
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:48,390
So that this container Zoo thing I started working on

442
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,229
is I started writing some of the tools in shell

443
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,550
and after spending about two hours trying to get a raise working right in bash,

444
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,180
which is, of course impossible.

445
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,339
I was just like, screw it. I'm doing it in Python

446
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,510
and, and it's, it's the same deal right? Where

447
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,260
the world is so much better when you're using a language like Python,

448
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,949
ignoring security.

449
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,030
There's so many other reasons to do it.

450
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:10,630
No.

451
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,609
And I think that's, you know, fundamentally people, if you give a develop, well,

452
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,180
if you give a project manager a choice between,

453
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:18,709
here's something that will make it more secure

454
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,109
and here's something that'll let you add features, faster

455
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:22,270
-- features,
-- man,

456
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,349
features always win guaranteed.

457
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,560
So,

458
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,760
yeah, I, I, and the good news is, you know,

459
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,310
programming languages are getting a lot better.

460
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,430
Like some of the newer ones are actually quite amazing, like from a

461
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,619
security point of view and just a general ease of use and, you know.

462
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,209
Yeah.

463
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,290
Oh, totally. I mean, look at go go lang

464
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,609
is a great example.

465
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:42,780
It,

466
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,250
it does a bunch of really clever and interesting things and

467
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,119
I've heard a lot of good things about Rust from Mozilla,

468
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,920
even though I admit I've never used it.

469
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,040
01 thing I like about go is you actually

470
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,040
can't create temporary files insecurely like they just,

471
00:20:55,739 --> 00:21:00,660
it just the default temporary file creation capability is secure end of story.

472
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,609
But at the same time those doofuses

473
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,959
screwed up random number generation

474
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:08,170
where there's the secure and insecure random number generators.

475
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,579
It's like why, why even have an insecure?

476
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:11,839
Nobody knew

477
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:12,260
that.

478
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,099
Well, I'm sure it's faster. But

479
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:17,699
yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:22,890
But rngs in general are sorry. Pr ngs in general are quite,

481
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:24,630
quite fast.

482
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,560
Yes.

483
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,030
And I,

484
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,359
I don't know why they have two and I feel like I

485
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,819
filed a bug or something at one point that was ignored.

486
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:33,959
And my suspicion is they know they screwed it up and they're just embarrassed.

487
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:36,579
It, it's kind of like, you know, when you've got that, that uncle

488
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,150
that

489
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:40,670
you have to invite him over for Christmas, but you don't want to

490
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:41,510
sort of thing.

491
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:42,819
Yeah.

492
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:45,869
See what's weird to me is you could just,

493
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,310
couldn't you replace the insecure random number generator with a secure one?

494
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:49,910
And, and

495
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,209
theoretically speaking,

496
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:55,229
-- nobody would notice
-- my suspicion is that would be frowned upon by language

497
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,790
designers because typically what happens is when

498
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,589
you use a random number generator,

499
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,709
you see it

500
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,130
well, in some instances, not all.

501
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,930
And, and,

502
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,209
oh. Right.

503
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:08,479
That's what it is, is I believe it's, if you use a random number generator,

504
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:10,290
it's seeded with zero by default,

505
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,579
which means. Right. Right. And it's like, why did you do this?

506
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:18,140
Why just there, there's no reason for this and my guess is 99% plus

507
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,530
instances where the random number generator is used.

508
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,699
Nobody cares what the seed is.

509
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:26,560
And in fact, having, having the same seed is probably bad

510
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,239
but

511
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,680
whatever, you know how it is, man. And, and for like those six people that it affects.

512
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,030
Lord forbid we fix it.

513
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:34,119
Yeah. I don't know.

514
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:34,859
I,

515
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,439
yeah. Well, and we've seen that in like open

516
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,219
sell is a great example, right? It doesn't by default, do

517
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,000
uh host name checks,

518
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,459
right? And same with Python.

519
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:51,790
Python didn't do that for a very long time until pep whatever it was a few years ago.

520
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,479
You know, one of the arguments was this is going to break all the code and it,

521
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:55,640
and it will because,

522
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,319
well, it's, it's not even just that this is,

523
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:01,040
this is something hard to do actually because I,

524
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,719
I'm dealing with some TLS issues now now at work,

525
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:06,040
but like

526
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,640
they didn't know which cas to ship.

527
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,079
And so rather than trying to make decisions, they just took the easy way out.

528
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,380
And in part of me is sympathetic to that because TLS is really freaking hard to do.

529
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,949
Right.

530
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:23,890
-- It's, it's such a huge pain,
-- man. Why wouldn't you just use a system trust store?

531
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,119
Well, because not everything has a system trust store, right?

532
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,959
Like when you're on a Linux system, there isn't a system trust store.

533
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:31,680
There can be like four locations.

534
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:31,920
Well,

535
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,010
although it's better now because I think the

536
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,959
distro have settled on some C certificates,

537
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,300
um, similarities.

538
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,000
But, like, you know, 10 years ago it was, it was crazy to,

539
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:42,989
you know.

540
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,050
That's true.

541
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,739
Right. And if you've never done it you should try maintaining your own ca

542
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:48,609
store.

543
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,280
It's, it's terrible.

544
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,670
I've written articles about it. It's quite a pain.

545
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:56,489
It's such a gong show and, like, I feel super bad always for the people,

546
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,329
like Mozilla and Google who have to maintain these and you have to deal with these

547
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:06,270
cas and you have to determine trust and kicking one out is terrible to do.

548
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,130
It's so hard.

549
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,619
Yeah. No. Aren't they just in the process of kicking out? I think it's

550
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,290
Semantic

551
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:12,550
Symantec

552
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:14,099
and what wasn't it? Also? Startcom

553
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:14,829
Stock

554
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,810
has been gone for a while, I think.

555
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:20,089
But, but Symantec is the latest one where

556
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,589
I think Google was kicking them out and then didn't,

557
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,680
I think they sold their C A business to someone else who's going to try to fix it now.

558
00:24:26,689 --> 00:24:27,329
And it's just,

559
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,729
it's crazy town. I mean, there, there aren't good answers to most of this stuff.

560
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:36,290
Well, I mean, the C A market is literally a way to print money.

561
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,130
Like it is a very low overhead

562
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:43,150
and people are paying you 400 bucks a year for certificates or whatever.

563
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,430
Well, it used to be. I mean, I think thanks to lets encrypt

564
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,260
and some of the bottom has fallen out of that one.

565
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:53,400
Yeah, that's true. Um, well, I feel like there's still a lot of corporations that

566
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,199
don't use. Lets encrypt. No,

567
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:57,020
there's, there's lots of them.

568
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,239
I,

569
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,939
I've talked to more than one where they have

570
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:02,040
a variety of reasons and in all seriousness,

571
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,959
some of them are valid but most of them aren't

572
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,520
where they, they don't want to use. Let's encrypt

573
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,719
and, and you know what I guess, whatever,

574
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:09,180
if,

575
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:12,329
if that's your prerogative and you don't mind spending a couple of 100 bucks a year.

576
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:13,079
Good for you.

577
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, I don't know. I, yeah, cas are a great example because how do we fix this?

578
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,880
How, like, and I don't mean by just booting them, but, I mean,

579
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,439
how do we get the CAS to want to

580
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:26,160
behave properly and be secure and not miss issue certificates

581
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:28,920
because banning them apparently isn't enough of

582
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:29,079
a

583
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:30,420
punishment to,

584
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:30,890
you know,

585
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:36,050
I mean, banning AC A is going to be, that's the end of them.

586
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,329
Right. There's, there's no, I mean, was it, did you not,

587
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,989
were the ones who had the issue and they were

588
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,569
kicked out quickly just because of how bad things were

589
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:47,969
and it ended the business and, and it's going to end it. But of course,

590
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,270
it's not as easy as just saying. All right, I don't like you anymore.

591
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,729
You're kicked out because

592
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,560
if you look at someone like Symantec a,

593
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:59,619
a substantial portion of the internet is signed by their C A.

594
00:25:59,689 --> 00:26:01,959
So if you kick them out now you've actually made the

595
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:05,479
experience worse for users and in some cases even more dangerous.

596
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,400
Yeah.

597
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,329
No, it's, I, I don't know,

598
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,739
I, the whole, I,

599
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,119
I get that we want to definitely encrypt all our

600
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,160
traffic and part of that is that we have to

601
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:17,109
have some form of C A or something because, you know,

602
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,349
is this walmart.com actually walmart.com or is it Bob?

603
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,459
You know, and ideally as a further extension of that, is this, you know,

604
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:29,250
TD Canada trust.com actually like my bank or just, you know,

605
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,859
Ted and Dan's Canada Trust Fall company

606
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,729
sleet, you know, happens to have my bank login web page.

607
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:39,319
Um,

608
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:43,239
yeah, and, and fundamentally there's no easy answers to this.

609
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,750
The best we've done is, you know, the whole ca

610
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,400
thing.

611
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,949
-- Ok.
-- But here's the thing we're back to the discussion from the very beginning is,

612
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:54,510
yes, this all sucks. But it basically works.

613
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,790
I mean, it's not so bad that society can't function

614
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,630
and because of that, it is good enough and nothing drastic is going to change.

615
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,630
Like that's the reality of it.

616
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:11,079
Yeah. No, I mean, I just ran into, uh fedex.com. The secure website has a,

617
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,640
uh,

618
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,069
it has the certificate for WW

619
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,680
uh, www.fedex.com,

620
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,400
-- but
-- not just fedex.com.

621
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,520
Exactly.

622
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,839
So, fundamentally,

623
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,130
yes, classically that's a se

624
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,150
like that's an operational security error, you know,

625
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:28,989
but realistically who cares?

626
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,420
This is why they should just get AAA cert for star.fedex.com, right?

627
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,849
-- Just put that thing on everything
-- I

628
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,119
-- was
-- thinking maybe they don't

629
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:40,400
uh maybe they're worried about clients that don't have SN I support, you know,

630
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,900
server name, identification support.

631
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,670
So like literally the people running windows XP still because they're still there,

632
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,849
face it, there's still grandmas

633
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:49,359
and

634
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,229
well, I mean, I just had that experience last week of I um my computer,

635
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,989
the little office 365 update popped up, which I've seen before.

636
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,170
But this time I actually looked at the numbers, like, for each update size

637
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:01,819
and it was over 900 megabytes.

638
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,390
That's awesome.

639
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,130
Right. And that happens about once every month or two.

640
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,880
So, like, you know, yeah, I live in North America.

641
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,790
I have a couple of, you know, high speed internet connections, but

642
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:14,569
not all the world has that.

643
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,739
Right.

644
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,689
Well, I mean, even think about updating any operating system,

645
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:21,369
be it Linux or Os X or Windows.

646
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,890
It's, those updates are hundreds of megabytes.

647
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,689
Yeah. I don't know.

648
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:24,829
I,

649
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,989
I suspect people will fix these things but it'll be fixed

650
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,810
in a way that doesn't even look like a solution.

651
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:33,410
-- It'll be, you know, like we fix the horse boot problem by inventing cars.
-- Right.

652
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,130
Right.

653
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,829
I, I do love, there is a futurist who made a comment about

654
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,239
the,

655
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,180
the problem with New York City's growth will be where to put all the horse manure.

656
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,989
Yeah. Good job, buddy.

657
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:45,859
You got that one. Right.

658
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,339
Yeah.

659
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:46,890
Well, that's what I,

660
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,079
that's one thing I'm really curious to see how augmented

661
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:52,160
reality and virtual reality changes the world because I,

662
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:52,579
I, you know,

663
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:54,479
I would have never guessed smartphones would have

664
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:56,439
resulted in so much texting and driving.

665
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:00,930
Uh, yeah, I guess that's one of the negative downsides of it, but at the same time, so,

666
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,310
so, actually I'm, I'm, I'm going on an airplane soon

667
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,089
and

668
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:06,969
for some reason,

669
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:11,530
I can't use my phone for the ticket and I had to print off paper tickets

670
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,849
and I feel like a cave person now. Right?

671
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,530
I haven't used a paper ticket in, in like five years.

672
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,270
Yeah.

673
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,670
And you think smartphones have literally existed for what, 10 years at this point?

674
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,469
-- Ok.
-- 11 years. That's insane.

675
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:29,670
The difference it has made in, in just the state of humanity in 11 years.

676
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,030
Well, you know, I was talking with my parents about this and pointing out that like,

677
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,589
I don't

678
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,650
have to worry about not knowing something ever because by definition,

679
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,180
if I can't find it in Google in 30 seconds,

680
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,540
nobody knows the answer. Yes.

681
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:42,739
And,

682
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,180
and part of me is sad by that because I remember staying

683
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:50,459
up very late drinking beer with friends and arguing about the dumbest things

684
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,699
and, and the next day, we didn't even remember what we were arguing about.

685
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,500
But, but now when we talk and someone asks a question,

686
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,140
we just look it up in Google and then that's all.

687
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,290
Yeah, I, I, yeah, it's, yeah. No, the world has definitely changed and,

688
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:05,449
yeah.

689
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,170
Well, yeah, I mean, the security, there was a,

690
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,199
there was actually a good article this week about hacking power grids and why

691
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,849
it's actually quite difficult to accomplish something

692
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:14,719
like an actual shutdown of the grid.

693
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,140
Um,

694
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:21,050
and I suspect part of that too is a lot of these systems. The security of them is

695
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,819
partly just due to their obscurity and, and painfulness.

696
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,010
I,

697
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,849
I would bet it's not unlike the election system where every power plant

698
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:35,099
-- and every power station is running a different version of software or
-- maybe

699
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,050
in your country.

700
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:36,810
Ok.

701
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,880
Maybe. But

702
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,010
in Canada we have a federal election board. That's,

703
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:43,900
00, you mean for the elections? Right? And you guys use

704
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:45,910
federal elections. We have one standard

705
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:48,160
provincially and citywide.

706
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:48,579
Of course,

707
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:50,079
-- then there's all sorts of different standards
-- and

708
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:51,439
tell me about your power grid though.

709
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,310
Is your power grid?

710
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,119
Well, basically they were pointing out that to break into a power grid is, you know,

711
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,829
that's step one.

712
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,530
But actually,

713
00:30:56,969 --> 00:31:00,270
you know, if you turn this breaker off. Ok. Yeah, that turns something off.

714
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,800
But does it

715
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:05,380
actually like, is it difficult to turn back on, is it break something, you know,

716
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,400
to actually do something to the power grid

717
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,569
that results in significant damage or an actual,

718
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:10,949
like widespread outage

719
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,310
is quite difficult?

720
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:17,489
I, I totally believe that, I bet you would have to take over a lot of the power grid.

721
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,540
Although, although

722
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:23,050
I know there are places with huge control centers for the power grid

723
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:24,800
in the locality.

724
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,369
And so if you could take over one of those, you could probably do some damage.

725
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,800
Well, there was the case of it was a Belgian nuclear power plant

726
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,349
and they basically managed to drain all the oil

727
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,750
from the turbines and so the turbines wrecked themselves.

728
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:42,130
Right. And those things are not cheap.

729
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,630
Right. Well, in, in any time the word nuclear is in the name,

730
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,099
you know, it's going to be sensational,

731
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,660
whatever gets talked about.

732
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,540
Uh,

733
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,089
oh, they've actually

734
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:57,560
charged some people with this now. Interesting.

735
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,500
-- What, what country are they from?
-- This is in Belgium. Uh,

736
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,680
the

737
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,810
what?

738
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,439
Oh, interesting.

739
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,239
Anyways. Um, yeah. So it's,

740
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,719
you know, that's a case of where, yeah,

741
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:15,469
you take all the lubricating oil out of something that spins at high, high speed,

742
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,170
you're gonna have a bad day.

743
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,670
Um, but again, those things, you know,

744
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,800
are not super easy to do

745
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:24,540
or

746
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:28,579
ideally they're also relatively easy to prevent and fix.

747
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,119
Right.

748
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,079
Well, not only that,

749
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:34,819
so they did this in Belgium and I assume the country of Belgium still has power.

750
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:35,579
Right.

751
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:36,780
Right.

752
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,060
And, and so

753
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,380
how, how do you do this in a way

754
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,760
that is

755
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,239
irreparably dangerous

756
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,420
to, or, or, I guess off putting to the country,

757
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,400
right.

758
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:50,520
It's,

759
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:50,939
yeah,

760
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,479
I guess at the same time this is not unlike

761
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:54,709
the internet

762
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,989
where we talk about how terrible security is

763
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,770
and how everything's going to light on fire.

764
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,229
But the reality is, I bet, I bet shutting down the internet these days,

765
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:07,189
I bet it would not be a simple task and, and please do not take that as a challenge.

766
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,229
Anyone listening.

767
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:11,505
Well, and something to remember too is the internet is, it's not just the internet.

768
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:13,255
Right? It's a network of networks,

769
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:13,834
right.

770
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:14,685
You know,

771
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,805
so you could shut down the internet.

772
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:17,694
But,

773
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:21,694
I mean, I'm assuming tell us would still be up and running and that would basically,

774
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:22,255
you'd have

775
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:26,045
-- a Canadian internet.
-- Let's face it. If you, if you could shut down Google,

776
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,900
I, I think that would count as

777
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:31,060
-- on the internet for the vast majority of people.
-- Well, here's a thought exercise.

778
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:31,579
Remember the D

779
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,199
OS attacks on D DNS that caused all sorts of problems.

780
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:38,310
-- They were the, the DNS for a lot of service.
-- That was what Mira

781
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,199
Botnet, right.

782
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:39,859
And that was used

783
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,439
to attack. Was it Krebs or something?

784
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:42,780
Yeah. Yeah.

785
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,869
Um, but I mean, what would, like,

786
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,880
what would be the maximal damage taking out the root name servers?

787
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,060
Um, I guess you could maybe hose, routing tables,

788
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,959
routing tables would definitely be a pain in the butt.

789
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,060
Yeah. B GP is relatively unguarded but even then

790
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:05,900
people would figure out quickly that the B GP tables are whack and they should just

791
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:11,379
turn off B GP route updates and that would probably take care of some of that.

792
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:12,708
Yeah,

793
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,478
it would be, it would be hard.

794
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:18,080
I mean, like, even the root name servers, which I think would be

795
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,850
the most

796
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:19,889
heavily

797
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,129
through any cast.

798
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,478
-- So they are good
-- luck.

799
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:22,918
Yeah.

800
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,139
The only thing I can and, like, you think about, like,

801
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,728
let's say Google or Amazon or something.

802
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,260
I mean, I remember when people tried to

803
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,409
DDOS Amazon

804
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,620
and they couldn't

805
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,469
because, and that was what, 5,

806
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:37,820
10 years ago before Amazon was near as big as they are now.

807
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,489
And, I mean, I, I bet you couldn't DDOS

808
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,728
Amazon if you wanted to,

809
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,020
-- unless you used Amazon. Right. To d
-- do

810
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,409
you have to, well, you'd have to be clever about it.

811
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,800
It couldn't just like sin flood them into submission

812
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,750
like you could back in the old days,

813
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:53,080
-- you know?
-- Right. Right.

814
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,059
But yeah, or you'd have to do some, like, clever high level attack,

815
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:57,388
like some sort of api that,

816
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,908
uh, you know, like the airline seat attack, right.

817
00:34:59,918 --> 00:35:03,448
Where, you know, you can, you can easily doss a lot of, uh,

818
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:06,589
travel sites by reserving airline seats. Right.

819
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,388
And it, it reserves them for 10 or 15 minutes at a time.

820
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,668
You know, if you do this repeatedly and whatnot, then you can really

821
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:14,319
kind of make things annoying.

822
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:15,428
Um,

823
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:16,948
I've just had the experience of trying to

824
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:20,089
buy tickets online for an event through Ticketmaster.

825
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,659
And, yeah, I, I got quite grumpy at one point and thought about, like, writing a bot

826
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,479
to basically go reserve a big pile of seats so I can actually compare them. All

827
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,409
right.

828
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,530
-- That doesn't sound illegal in any way.
-- No.

829
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,379
Well, and then the US, you guys have that new act that was passed or is passing,

830
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:38,810
that makes it illegal to use bots to buy tickets online.

831
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:41,040
But I'm sure that's going to stop people. Right.

832
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,090
Everyone knows that once you pass a law, the problem is fixed.

833
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:45,649
Right? So,

834
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,389
yeah, I don't know. I think part of it, well, and

835
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,449
there are things like Puerto Rico, right?

836
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:53,969
You have a hurricane that just clobbers the place,

837
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,350
you know, but of course,

838
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,739
at that scale now we're literally talking about

839
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,080
like acts of God and natural disasters.

840
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,550
Right. Right. Right.

841
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,189
And, and

842
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,320
-- you can't plan for that level of devastation,
-- not, not reasonably like, I mean,

843
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,939
the cost involved is,

844
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:12,350
you know, it always struck me as like nuclear defense.

845
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,750
It was like, I don't think this is going to work

846
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:15,169
or

847
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,800
we're gonna find out,

848
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,379
but hopefully we never do. Right.

849
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:23,899
No, II, I get what you're saying. I, I totally get what you're saying and

850
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:26,149
I, I don't know where we draw the line,

851
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,580
but I feel like the vast majority of systems that exist,

852
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,979
have drawn the line appropriately because things are still essentially working

853
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,300
-- and at the same
-- time, well, in effect, the market has spoken,

854
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:42,479
-- I don't even know if I maybe to the
-- market by the market,

855
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:45,020
I don't mean just the people using it but the Attackers, right,

856
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,860
the Attackers aren't willing to put in the money to do this because

857
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,159
there's, I guess no,

858
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,590
-- there's not enough gain.
-- That's exactly right.

859
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,209
And, and I think you could look at something like the, the power power grid in the US.

860
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,030
What would the return on investment be?

861
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,090
I mean, how many organizations would be willing to go through that?

862
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,129
And what would they gain from it? And my suspicion is,

863
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:11,360
let's say a country attacks it and they shut it down for a day.

864
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:12,159
Like

865
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,959
what is that going to accomplish? Right.

866
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:16,239
No, it's

867
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,590
the whole thing. Just I, yeah, I, I fear that good enough is good enough and that

868
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:22,679
good enough

869
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:26,310
is good enough and it's always going to be good enough and,

870
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:29,610
and, and the question is really going to come down to

871
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,330
not, not kind of, when do we fix this, but you know, what is the,

872
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,209
what is the change that's coming?

873
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,040
And it's almost certainly not going to be driven

874
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,949
by security because security is kind of a,

875
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:42,649
a second order feature of, of the vast majority of systems.

876
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:43,050
Right.

877
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,419
It's, yeah.

878
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,129
Well, yeah,

879
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:49,449
very few systems are designed with security being an actual requirement upfront.

880
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:52,600
Other than the vague nebulous, we want it to be secure

881
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:55,689
features tend to trump

882
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,919
everything

883
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,560
and

884
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,209
let's face it. Right. Working code. Is kind of important.

885
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:01,790
Yeah.

886
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:06,030
And you can very easily have working code that's really insecure as well.

887
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:09,149
We found out over the last 4050 years of computing.

888
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,110
Yeah.

889
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,770
-- No, I, I know, man. I know.
-- So anything else crazy good happened this week

890
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:16,800
that we missed.

891
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:23,129
Uh I think my favorite thing is the iphone U I trick of the login from Apple.

892
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,340
Yeah.

893
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,560
Yeah, I, I will definitely say I've,

894
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,830
I've actually had my phone prompt me once or twice unexpectedly for my password.

895
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,750
And I was kind of like

896
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,659
being, you know, a completely crazy security person.

897
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:37,360
I actually was like, what, you know what's going on, right.

898
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,870
Um, normal people don't do that.

899
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,120
No, no, they just type in their password.

900
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:45,479
Well, I don't know how the iphone is but I know in OS X,

901
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,860
I feel like Apple asks me for my icloud password way too much.

902
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,639
So I just avoid all icloud stuff because it annoys me.

903
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,939
I, I get asked at set up time, but that's about it. I

904
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:57,989
get

905
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,600
all the time

906
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,959
and maybe I'm just a weirdo and maybe I'm doing dumb things. I don't care.

907
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:04,479
But

908
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:05,040
it,

909
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,649
it's one of those things you should get asked the password once and never again.

910
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,540
And if people see a password prompt, they should know something strange is going on.

911
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:18,729
And I feel like this, actually, this is one of the things that irks me is with gmail.

912
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,169
Gmail will,

913
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,800
you know, every 30 days or something,

914
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,540
log me out and every time that happens when I see the,

915
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,570
the window with the Gmail password prompt, I close that tab,

916
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,179
I open a new tab and I type in the Gmail

917
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:33,899
address just to make sure it's not a phishing attempt.

918
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,090
Yeah.

919
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:35,929
Yeah.

920
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:38,229
Well, and that would be one really good argument for, um,

921
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,310
two factor authentication, you know, or, or for example, the, uh,

922
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,669
with the Mac you can have, I think you can set it up so the watch will log you in.

923
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:47,399
-- I don't know if that'll work with your icloud
-- though. I don't know.

924
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:48,149
I don't care either.

925
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,560
I'm

926
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:49,080
not.

927
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,590
-- Well,
-- so, ok. Well, I don't know if we have time for this, but

928
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,620
so there's been apparently a bunch of proposals

929
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:55,590
to fix social security numbers in the US.

930
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,389
They're all crap and, you know, it,

931
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,580
well,

932
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,280
I, I feel like there's two big problems. Number one,

933
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:05,790
you have to get over the hurdle of replacing social security numbers, which,

934
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,149
you know,

935
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,270
how many tens of billions of dollars have been

936
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,290
-- invested in those numbers in software and
-- whatnot.

937
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,590
Just a regular expression. I'm sure it's fine.

938
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:16,310
Yeah, easy peasy.

939
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,949
Um, and then the second problem is coming up with something that

940
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,550
actually makes it better.

941
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,540
And so the, the one thing I keep seeing come up is, you know, public,

942
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,340
private key pairs, blah, blah, blah, which is, yeah,

943
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,370
in some ways would be better. But here's the problem,

944
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,110
the failure scenario for account recovery. Right.

945
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,810
People lose their ID and their wallets and all their

946
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,540
crap all the time or they get stolen or whatever.

947
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:43,310
So, how do you have a secure account recovery process?

948
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,870
You don't, and, and look, I'm, I'm gonna call it is I will bet you a beer,

949
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,469
nothing changes

950
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
because it's not bad.

951
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:53,969
That's a sucker bet. I mean, clearly,

952
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:58,449
even if it was on fire, even the effort of, you know, it's like the, for example,

953
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:00,840
the thought of changing from 10 digit phone numbers

954
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,370
to say 11 digit phone numbers in North America,

955
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,280
-- like, just, are
-- they 10 digits? Yeah, they are 10 digits, aren't they?

956
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,439
Yeah, that, that will not happen.

957
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:13,360
I don't even know. Right. I haven't typed that phone number in

958
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,239
-- forever,
-- but that's the thing. Right.

959
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,399
Like when, you know, people talk about changing phone numbers to make them longer,

960
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,060
it's kind of like,

961
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,560
-- no, that's really not an option. Just give
-- the US another country code. Right.

962
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,949
That would be way easier.

963
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,080
-- Yeah, I guess that would be one way to
-- do. That would be the only way to do it because

964
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:31,479
like,

965
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,659
I can't even think the number of places where social

966
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:37,729
security or insurance numbers in Canada are used is,

967
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,270
you know, it's staggering and, yeah,

968
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,879
the thought of getting everybody on board to actually change it.

969
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:44,219
I mean, look at no offense but the US with Chip and pin,

970
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,469
-- I mean, come on, we don't
-- have chip and pin, we have chip and inside, which is

971
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:49,979
dumb.

972
00:41:50,629 --> 00:41:50,830
Ok.

973
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,429
Yeah, that basically proves my point.

974
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,909
If you guys can't do Chip and Pin.

975
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,870
-- How on earth are you going to roll out smart cards for everything?
-- I agree.

976
00:41:56,879 --> 00:42:00,149
I agree completely. That, that's the perfect analogy right there.

977
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,110
You, you summed it up

978
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,389
and there's actually a legitimate, like,

979
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:07,229
good economic reasons to go to chip and pin, you know.

980
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,639
Um, although personally I, I prefer, uh,

981
00:42:09,649 --> 00:42:11,580
whatever you call it tap and pay or whatever because like,

982
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,729
I don't have to touch things like a filthy caveman.

983
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,129
And I actually get really annoyed. Now when I have to punch in my PIN number,

984
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:21,340
I, I just wish I could get annoyed to punch in my PIN number.

985
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:21,889
It,

986
00:42:22,169 --> 00:42:24,219
it makes me sad that I'm going to Europe soon

987
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:28,260
and I will have to apologize to the poor people working the cash register

988
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,250
as to why a receipt is gonna come out that I have to sign

989
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:35,419
because just like, I'm sorry, I apologize for my country

990
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:37,719
anyway.

991
00:42:39,169 --> 00:42:41,830
But no, I think, I think that is actually the perfect analogy.

992
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,719
Once you guys get Chip and Pin working, maybe we can talk about

993
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,340
something.

994
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,020
So never. The answer is never.

995
00:42:49,209 --> 00:42:49,219
Oh

996
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,899
my goodness. I,

997
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,389
anyway.

998
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:58,370
Right. So as the world continues to burn, do you, do you have any parting thoughts?

999
00:42:58,379 --> 00:42:58,909
Horus Kurt,

1000
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,260
maybe slow down once in a while and eat a nicely toasted bagel.

1001
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:06,699
Yeah. You know, I used to do that every day and now, uh,

1002
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,750
eating carbs in the morning gives me heartburn because I'm an old man.

1003
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,510
It's, it's terrible. It annoys me. I love bagels so

1004
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:12,800
good.

1005
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,149
Actually, you know, we should,

1006
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,550
we should do a show on getting old with technology because we're hitting that point.

1007
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:18,870
Yes, we are

1008
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:22,860
because I literally, for example, I've stopped keeping up with Minecraft.

1009
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,389
They've made so many changes now to the game in the last three months.

1010
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,889
It's better than ever. Well, some things are better,

1011
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:28,850
but it's,

1012
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:31,120
I, I don't understand like

1013
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,129
the whole enchanting system properly.

1014
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:36,530
-- I mean, I think I understand it but I probably don't, I
-- just don't,

1015
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,719
I enchant as if I'm a cave person.

1016
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,389
I,

1017
00:43:39,629 --> 00:43:39,739
I,

1018
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:41,060
I always have though,

1019
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,850
if I put the things I need to in the enchanting table and then

1020
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,860
I just take what's out and I know there's ways to influence that,

1021
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,580
but I just don't care.

1022
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:52,770
For example, my son showed me how you can make secret doorways with paintings.

1023
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,129
Uh

1024
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,889
Yes, that's new because paintings are,

1025
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,669
-- are they were added not too long ago
-- actually.

1026
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,520
No, we had paintings in Minecraft P for pocket edition. Did

1027
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:01,919
you

1028
00:44:02,419 --> 00:44:03,550
about a year or two?

1029
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,280
But now instead of just putting them on the wall, apparently,

1030
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,000
you can do some funkiness with the door

1031
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,360
to make them like a secret wall like you can walk through.

1032
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,629
I've seen that.

1033
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:16,620
Yeah. I, yeah. Again. Yeah. No, I'm getting old because, I don't know,

1034
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:21,139
just getting old. I mean, part of it as well is the fact that, like, you have a job,

1035
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,939
you don't have time to watch youtube all day to learn the new things in Minecraft

1036
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,010
and don't get me wrong.

1037
00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:31,159
I wish my day was playing Minecraft. But it's not.

1038
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,600
But I think we should do a show on that because I,

1039
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,840
I suspect a lot of our viewers would sympathize.

1040
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,419
-- Uh
-- It could be amusing if,

1041
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:40,110
if nothing else and then I could complain about how my back hurts.

1042
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,040
It would be great.

1043
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,979
All right. Anyway, anyway. All right, thanks, Kurt. It was fun.

1044
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:46,570
Thank you everyone for listening.

1045
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,320

1051
