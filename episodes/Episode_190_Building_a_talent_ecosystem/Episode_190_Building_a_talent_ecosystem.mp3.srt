Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,420
with myself, Kurt

2
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,399
Siefried and my Permanent Thought Crime, Josh Bress

3
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:11,840
Bonjour,

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:12,970
the new

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,670
podcast to Security. Open

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,020
Source of

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:15,800
Kurtz

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,329
et

9
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,239
partner

10
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:17,799
dance,

11
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:19,360
Josh,

12
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:19,969
er

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,559
the episode to continue.

14
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,760
All right.

15
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:26,049
So this is the Canadian content episode.

16
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,209
And if you remove that French, I will get a fine.

17
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,514
I totally not figuring it out. It's funny you did that.

18
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:36,075
So for those of you who don't know, obviously Kurt and I talk a lot every day

19
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:39,224
and any time the Canadian Prime Minister speaks,

20
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:41,375
Kurt usually sends me a link to the youtube video

21
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:45,055
and I do enjoy watching because I enjoy seeing leadership

22
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:47,354
that is leading in this time of crisis as opposed

23
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:49,294
to a significant amount of leadership in the world,

24
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:53,185
which is basically just like a clown car at the circus that's on fire.

25
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,509
Yeah, seriously.

26
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,110
But anyway, when the Canadian Prime Minister speaks in Canada,

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,270
they have two official languages,

28
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:03,400
there's English and French and so he always speaks

29
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:05,129
in English and then he speaks in French.

30
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:08,309
And what I think is extra funny about that is they translate the French.

31
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,150
So you hear him speak English.

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,980
And then I hear his translated French back into

33
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,500
the exact same thing he just said in English.

34
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,919
And I'm like, this seems needlessly complicated but whatever, whatever,

35
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,250
it's fine.

36
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,010
Well, it's, it's because he's a francophone, right?

37
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,019
So he, he, his French is impeccable.

38
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:24,900
But I'll be blunt, like the majority of Canadians such as myself,

39
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:25,599
jean

40
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:25,919
la

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:26,790
francais.

42
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,680
I, I do not speak French. Like I have.

43
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,059
-- Did you have to write that down when you, when you said it,
-- I did run,

44
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,750
I ran it through Google translate and then I

45
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,690
did actually manually tweak a few things because like

46
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,080
the uh the thought crime Google put in uh

47
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:43,089
like the literal words for like thought and crime.

48
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,500
And I'm like, no, I'm pretty sure there's like a French expression.

49
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,550
That's why I check that.

50
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,220
Like anybody who actually speaks French will be just like I apologize.

51
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,269
I'm so horrified.

52
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:52,900
And the

53
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,269
problem is,

54
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:54,160
is this

55
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,300
Canadian French is not French. Canadian French is Canadian French,

56
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,569
right? Like American English is not English.

57
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,589
No. American English is not Queen's English. You all

58
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,709
right.

59
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,429
So yeah, so this is the Canadian content episode.

60
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,929
Can con I wasn't able to find the percentages because they they changed it recently.

61
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,639
But basically I figure you owe me at least

62
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:16,309
about 20 to 50 episodes of Canadian content.

63
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:19,949
-- I'm comfortable with that. And who doesn't love Canada,
-- right?

64
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,039
Quebec

65
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,720
and I am just quoting Maximus Black from youtube.

66
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,139
You know,

67
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:27,880
I love Canada, man.

68
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:31,279
Everyone's friendly and you have poutine, which are like the only two things I know.

69
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,300
-- You know
-- what's weird to me?

70
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:36,580
So, like poutine, like you live in Wisconsin and you guys don't have it.

71
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,020
And I'm like, but you guys, I know you wear

72
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,279
-- on your head,
-- right?

73
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:43,880
And, and cheese curd are so actually a funny story is Wisconsin in the United States.

74
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,869
It is probably the closest thing you can get

75
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,949
to like another country within the United States where

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,229
everything here is really weird and you don't know

77
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,789
that until you kind of grow up and leave.

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,589
I've been to Texas and New York. Trust me, they're all different.

79
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,309
-- There's 52 countries in the US as far as I'm concerned
-- that that's probably fair.

80
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,270
Wisconsin seems especially strange though for whatever reason.

81
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,419
And like,

82
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:06,360
my favorite example is something called cheese curd where

83
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,580
a lot of people don't know what this is,

84
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:10,759
-- but like when you make cheese and they make a lot of cheese here
-- as a Canadian,

85
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,070
I'm so offended that people wouldn't know what cheese curs are

86
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,779
maybe. I mean, but they're everywhere here right now. I was a kid.

87
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,860
I just assumed everyone had cheese curd all the time. And in fact, we'll even go to

88
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,684
the Cheese Factory and get them like,

89
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:22,764
so they're fresh and they're still like dripping with milk,

90
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:24,744
which is when they're the best because they're warm as well.

91
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:28,214
Like, like literally this milk was in a cow, like, four hours ago and now I'm eating it

92
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:31,904
and normal people when I left for college, they were like,

93
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:33,544
we don't even know what you're talking about.

94
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:35,264
-- What you, you eat.
-- What

95
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,429
a part of it is.

96
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,470
I think the problem with food is people somehow think like, oh,

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,020
there's a cow and now there's like a tray, a styrofoam tray of ground hamburger

98
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:46,149
or like there's a cow and now there's a wheel of cheese in my, in the store.

99
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,789
-- Like no, there's a few steps in between.
-- Right. Right. Exactly.

100
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,339
And yeah, like growing up in Wisconsin, it was just, it's, it's part of life.

101
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,029
Like I, I literally can ride my bike to the cheese factory down the way,

102
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,990
buy cheese curd.

103
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,470
I am a fan of cheese,

104
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,190
but I don't even have that much cheese and I would say I probably only have like five,

105
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,970
six kinds of cheese in my fridge.

106
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:09,270
Oh, my goodness. I bet we have more than six right now. At least,

107
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,750
probably more than that. No, no, I bet I got 10. At least. I

108
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,630
love cheese, man. It's like, it's one of those things.

109
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,649
I love the concept of being a vegan, but I could never give up cheese.

110
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,290
Like cheese is my thing. I love it so much.

111
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:26,320
Good cheese is like a seven year old aged Quebec cheddar. Like there's,

112
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,679
yeah, you can't be it, man. It's this combination of smooth and sharp and

113
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:31,029
the

114
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,390
mouth feel the umami and like the, the richness to it.

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,350
Or like a good Jarlsberg or, or a camel bear like baked, you know,

116
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,140
with a little bit of syrup and crushed walnuts

117
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:41,970
right

118
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,440
now. I need to go

119
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,029
anyway.

120
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,420
But so

121
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,269
debating how to start this episode.

122
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,760
So well, we did that, we did the French translation and that's all you're doing.

123
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,570
Sorry folks.

124
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:53,989
But here's the question, you know who John Candy is, right?

125
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,470
The

126
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,029
-- actor and
-- Eugene Levy.

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,380
Eugene Levy is awesome. Yeah,

128
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:01,239
-- he's got the eyebrows. I love his
-- eyebrows

129
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,730
and you know, Martin short

130
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,799
and what do those three people have in common?

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,480
-- Well, I assume they're Canadian if you're asking me this question, some
-- of them,

132
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,630
a bunch of them are Canadian or Canadian American

133
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,850
-- Eugene
-- Levy is I know that

134
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:13,350
or Catherine o'hara,

135
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,589
what do they all have in common?

136
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,500
-- Like really strongly
-- home alone

137
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,000
like

138
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,029
C TV,

139
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,570
-- SC TV is
-- what? Second city TV.

140
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:27,429
It was like one of the pioneering Canadian TV comedies on from 76 to 81.

141
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,720
And then again, in the eighties, a few more times, but basically it was,

142
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,760
it was kind of an incubator for

143
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,010
comedy in Canada with about a dozen people, about half of whom

144
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
went on.

145
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,929
Well, you know, their names like,

146
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,970
and this is basically the point of Canada is that Canadian content laws

147
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,640
exist because

148
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:48,910
as people may or may not know, Canada is next to the US.

149
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,149
Dude.

150
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,100
I don't take anything for granted when it comes to American geography anymore.

151
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:57,859
That, that's fair. And not only that it is the longest land border in the world.

152
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:01,779
-- No, five 1000 miles,
-- the longest undefended land border in the world.

153
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,700
What's the longest land border in the world?

154
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,260
I thought there was a longer one.

155
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,070
No, no, I, I'm sure like Russia has a longer border,

156
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,329
-- right? But it's not shared with one country.
-- Oh, that's true.

157
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,179
Yeah, actually, no, you're right, Canada, the USA is the longest land border.

158
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,559
Oh, you know,

159
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,950
I always forget about Alaska and that's like another 1500 kilometers right there.

160
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,149
So it's

161
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,670
gigantic. 2893 kilometers or an American. It's about

162
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:26,059
5500 miles. Which,

163
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:26,880
that's a

164
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,049
lot. Yeah, it's Russia. I was thinking Russia,

165
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:30,863
which is 6800 kilometers.

166
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:31,203
Which,

167
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,733
so if you take from Canada to the lower U

168
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:37,203
si think it's slightly less than the Russian Kazakhstan one.

169
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,393
That could be because that's fair.

170
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:38,483
Yeah,

171
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,903
because Alaska has that straight part and then it goes down the coastline a bunch.

172
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:42,442
All right.

173
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,273
So I need to ask just because you,

174
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:49,342
Kurt has been annoyingly enigmatic about this episode since last week.

175
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:52,833
-- What does any of this have to do with security?
-- Well, so the idea is that,

176
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:53,156
that

177
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:55,415
Canada has to protect its culture.

178
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:58,575
Otherwise we're just like the US is gonna like, roll over and like,

179
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:01,786
and not, like, intentionally crush us but just accidentally crush us because,

180
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,015
you know, you have 10 times as many people and Hollywood.

181
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:08,705
So the amount of culture that you guys put out in the world is ridiculous. Like

182
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:12,966
the number of, you know, major movies, TV, shows

183
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:16,496
all that kind of stuff coming out of the US is over 9000.

184
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,730
And of course,

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,769
it's like

186
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,489
the majority of what our TV networks put on because, you know,

187
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,829
they just license it and it's cheap to license because, you know, some Americans,

188
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,440
like, as far as they're concerned, Canada might as well be Kazakhstan for, you know,

189
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,809
for licensing fees.

190
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:30,880
Right.

191
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,589
Well, and it's the right language.

192
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,359
-- Yeah,
-- exactly. You don't even have to subtitle it or dub it.

193
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:39,589
So we have these laws that say you have to produce or no,

194
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,429
that you don't have to produce, but you have to show

195
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,670
Canadian content on radio and on TV networks a certain percentage.

196
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,480
And then of course, people started gaining it by,

197
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:52,239
like showing all the Canadian content in summer or like between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.

198
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:55,390
So they passed a bunch of, you know, they amended the law a few times to,

199
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,910
you know, that you actually have to put Canadian content home and people can, like,

200
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,260
actually watch it and see it.

201
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,519
But the beauty is because of this

202
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:02,989
Canada has this

203
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,149
by world standards, actually quite healthy

204
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,029
but very,

205
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,029
-- very vibrant and strange and awesome content production like Schitt's
-- Creek.

206
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,010
-- I love that show so much
-- even you know about

207
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,920
like, which is a great example. I mean, it's Eugene Levy, his son

208
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,739
Daniel Levy who is awesome,

209
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:23,279
-- you know,
-- and his daughter,

210
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,700
his daughter plays a character named Twyla and Catherine o'hara is in it too.

211
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,959
-- She plays his wife and
-- Eugene Levy

212
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,739
and Catherine o'hara have been doing comedy together

213
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,080
since literally before I was born

214
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,239
1976 right? Like that's literally older than me. So

215
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,429
it's funny you bring this up and

216
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:42,789
I,

217
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,989
I knew this actually because one of my friends said

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,859
you have to go watch a show called Shit's Creek.

219
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:53,270
It's on Netflix and I started watching it with my wife and we were like,

220
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,109
this is amazing

221
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,200
and we watched them all.

222
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,419
Well, there's, I mean, there's one more season,

223
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,880
the last season isn't on Netflix yet.

224
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,239
So I don't have it. And

225
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,590
this is actually funny because Curt and I talked about this the

226
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:06,869
other day is you can't acquire Schitt's Creek on the normal places.

227
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,460
One would acquire a show, we'll say

228
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:11,479
because it turns out it's streaming in Canada on the CBC website,

229
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:13,469
which I can't access in the United States.

230
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,320
It's annoying because so CBC GM makes the current season available for free

231
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:23,179
and I, I think you can get the previous seasons and you just need to be logged in.

232
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,609
You don't actually need to pay.

233
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,450
It's not like you have to have a Comcast or a Shaw

234
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,049
or I'm going to use American terms because nobody knows what Shaw

235
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:29,460
is.

236
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,820
That's right.

237
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:31,820
Yeah.

238
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,140
So it's,

239
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,239
it's actually really hard to find through the usual channels

240
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,369
because it is so freely available in Canada that,

241
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,469
well, why would I pirate it when I can just go to

242
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:39,880
the

243
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,020
-- broadcast
-- corporation?

244
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,380
And that's ok. I will, I will wait.

245
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:43,780
I'm,

246
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:47,479
I'm very excited for the last season because it is enthralled me and captivated

247
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:50,590
me the way they've been developing the characters over the course of what,

248
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,619
like this is 66 season maybe.

249
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,460
And it's, I, I do enjoy it. But,

250
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,875
so you've got me thinking now, obviously this is a security podcast

251
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:01,734
and I think your, your technical definition of why this is a security topic is,

252
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:03,565
is maybe a little bit of a stretch we'll say.

253
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:05,695
But, well, you know what it reminds me of is Israel,

254
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,215
look at Israel and their computer security industry.

255
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:12,354
That is exactly what I was going to talk about. So well done.

256
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:17,455
-- Yeah,
-- they like, they are batting way above their size.

257
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,229
They're, they're punching above their weight,

258
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,669
-- they're
-- punching outside of their

259
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,200
sport.

260
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,000
-- They, they're, they're like, they're beating
-- up,

261
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:26,020
they're like Brazilian jiu jitsu versus dodgeball.

262
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,239
Explain why though, right? Because

263
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,270
there's a lot of people who have no idea what we're about to talk about.

264
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,539
-- So let's like, set the stage for us,
-- Kurt. Ok. So as people may or may not know.

265
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,479
Israel is a relatively small country, basically founded on the idea of

266
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,049
-- that's
-- enough of the politics.

267
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,239
Exactly.

268
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,559
But, so that, but what's interesting,

269
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:47,495
there's this thing in Israel where you have

270
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:50,765
mandatory military service and like many militaries,

271
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:54,306
the Israeli military has some stuff to do with computer security.

272
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:58,765
And they have this thing called unit 8200. That is their intelligence, corpse unit.

273
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:01,755
And they essentially, it's, it's your classic

274
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:07,395
sind computer hacking NSA style shenanigans type thing, which is cool.

275
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:10,116
But the beauty is, it's essentially, again, it's an incubator.

276
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,536
They, they basically take a bunch of like, they take,

277
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,721
they don't just take people like me and Josh were, you know, off the street,

278
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:17,721
they take the best of the best and then they, you know,

279
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,312
teach them whatever the current techniques and

280
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:22,562
also the new techniques they're developing are

281
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:23,142
right.

282
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,671
And then these people essentially age out of the military because,

283
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:30,791
because it's mandatory, you know, military service a lot.

284
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:34,111
Well, everybody goes through the military basically, but not everybody stays,

285
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:35,572
you know, some of them have normal jobs.

286
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,361
But the beauty is they, they have this,

287
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:38,312
they take this

288
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,192
talent pool, train it up a whole bunch

289
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,390
and then release it back into society and they don't just like,

290
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,729
release them back into society.

291
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:46,250
But it's like,

292
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,630
no, like you can instantly get a job at a security place or even better.

293
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,030
-- You can start a company,
-- right. Right.

294
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:57,530
And that's exactly what I was going to talk about is if you look at some of the,

295
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,309
the craziest cybersecurity start ups right now,

296
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,919
it is mostly Israeli companies or companies heavily connected to Israel

297
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,510
and, and this is why. And it's actually really interesting. So there's,

298
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,231
there's a friend and I have, his name is Jason Calloway and he, he, he was at redhead.

299
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:17,642
He's gone to Google now and he, like, this is a topic that he's very passionate about.

300
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,952
And he's got this group called Red Team and I'll put a link in the show notes.

301
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,452
But like one of his goals is like,

302
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:26,331
he wants to create content and ability to help people learn these kind of skills.

303
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:26,932
Because

304
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:30,932
in the United States and especially in the United States military,

305
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,932
there's currently AAA weakness.

306
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:37,013
They have, you know, their cyber command, they can do certain things,

307
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,314
but generally speaking,

308
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:41,073
it's nothing like what Israel is up to.

309
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:46,453
Well, I just checked and so this one site, 383 security companies in Israel,

310
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:47,124
right.

311
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:48,263
That

312
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:50,854
might be more than America.

313
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:54,554
I'm sure per capita they're probably blowing everyone out of the water, like,

314
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:55,174
seriously.

315
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:57,693
And what also gets me is just their degree of

316
00:12:57,796 --> 00:13:00,096
professionalism and competency, right?

317
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:03,296
Because I mean, we're not just talking like start ups because no offense.

318
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:04,906
There's start ups all over the world

319
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:09,245
and most of them are you've never heard of and never will because they cratered out

320
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,976
-- real things.
-- That's how start ups work.

321
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:13,455
I mean, but, you know, you look at the Israeli market and it's,

322
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:15,056
yeah, like, wow,

323
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:17,926
what I was kind of trying to figure out is

324
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:19,205
how do you build a

325
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:21,455
comedy incubator? Like SC TV.

326
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,159
How do you build,

327
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:23,789
like,

328
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,619
because nobody intentionally built San Francisco

329
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,960
and the whole Silicon Valley thing.

330
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,840
It just sort of happened,

331
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,500
like, finance in New York.

332
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,280
-- Like, it just sort of, it's not like the government had some plan.
-- Well, ok.

333
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,919
No, they didn't just sort of happen.

334
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,099
There were, it was not a government. Well, the government sort of planned New York.

335
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:41,989
That's a long story.

336
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,799
But like Silicon Valley was just, I think the fact that you had, like, Steve Jobs,

337
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,630
you had Steve Wozniak, you had

338
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,190
the xerox people were all there, the HP people.

339
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,840
Well, it came out of World War I, I,

340
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:56,479
and all the radar technology stuff happening in World War.

341
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:58,070
I, I, right. And all the transistors. Yeah. Ok.

342
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,755
That was kind of what got it kick started is, you know,

343
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:01,676
Fairchild Semiconductor and all those guys were

344
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,445
in California building radar sets and stuff.

345
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:06,255
And so you kind of hit that weird critical mass where it just snowballed

346
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,966
and I guess it's like that first mover advantage where,

347
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:12,116
because you look around the world and there's just these odd places where it's like,

348
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,875
that's the place for whatever technology,

349
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:15,245
you know,

350
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,435
and it's just totally kind of weirdly

351
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:21,036
random and strange kind of quasi inexplicable.

352
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:23,306
And you do the history research and it, like, kind of boils down to, like,

353
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,445
it just so happened that there were like five guys there

354
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:26,085
and,

355
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:27,831
and probably in some other place were three guys

356
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,281
but they just didn't hit that critical mass.

357
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,442
But there's, there's two sides to this, right?

358
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:34,421
So you can pick on New York and San Francisco for example.

359
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:37,062
And those are places that I think it was happenstance.

360
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:40,012
But then you look at Israel and say Canadian television.

361
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:43,531
-- Oh yeah, that was not happenstance.
-- Those were not happenstance.

362
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:49,012
Those were actual efforts by governments to say we want to make this better.

363
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,892
Well, with the CBC, obviously, it's somewhat intentional because, you know, we,

364
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:54,791
we literally, it's taxpayer funded the Canadian broadcast Corporation.

365
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:55,882
But I'll be blunt like

366
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:56,929
they,

367
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:01,409
it's a combination of, of skill and, and a bit of luck because

368
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,809
to put it bluntly, things like SC TV or shit's creek like, yeah, they,

369
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,789
they hit a home run

370
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,429
like,

371
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:09,289
you know, they were trying to get into second or third base and they got lucky.

372
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,330
Well, and look for every Schitt's Creek.

373
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,250
There's probably 10 shows we've never heard of.

374
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,690
I wouldn't say it's that bad because there's also like, honestly,

375
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,880
right now we've got another one called Kim's Convenience.

376
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:24,929
I have not watched and I've seen outtake and things on youtube and it is a plus.

377
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,840
It's brutally amazingly funny.

378
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:33,580
And and, and here's the thing, it's not a Canadian show. It's a Torontonian show.

379
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,119
Let's be

380
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,280
like, speaking as well.

381
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,969
Briner, you know, Born and Bred.

382
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:40,280
It's a Toronto show and I love it for that.

383
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,580
-- It's like a
-- little car

384
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,750
of Canada.

385
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,570
It's a caricature

386
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,650
of Toronto. Let's be very clear. That is Toronto like no, seriously.

387
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,609
Like you put those people, if you transferred those characters even to Vancouver,

388
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,210
the show would make no damn sense.

389
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,210
Like, it just wouldn't work

390
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,760
really. So, it's like, have you ever seen Portlandia?

391
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,080
It's the Portlandia of Canada.

392
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:06,090
It would not work in New York or Texas.

393
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,179
Exactly.

394
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,599
And so,

395
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,469
yeah, so,

396
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,919
because, you know, I keep coming,

397
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:14,320
like, all these governments are like, oh, we want to encourage innovation and blah,

398
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:14,809
blah, blah,

399
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,179
blah

400
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,809
and like they

401
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:19,375
occasionally do tax breaks or whatever.

402
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:23,974
But like, fundamentally, I, I really think it has to be this really holistic.

403
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:24,315
Well,

404
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:25,885
it kind of reminds me of women in tech where

405
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:27,304
people are talking about women in tech and it's like,

406
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:28,155
cool, but like,

407
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:31,655
we need to start really early because by the time you get to university,

408
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:33,825
like a lot of them have dropped out because

409
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,890
essentially the environment is so terrible

410
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:36,669
to put

411
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,049
a blunt way.

412
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,510
No, I agree.

413
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,650
I agree completely.

414
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:42,890
And I think that's the advantage Israel has is they have that approach, you know,

415
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,630
starting when you turn 18, we're going to take the ones that did really well, in,

416
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,239
you know, their computer courses and, yeah, here we go.

417
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,210
Well, not only that there is

418
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,130
an atmosphere of coolness surrounding all this as well in Israel where obviously,

419
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,950
like, it's different now in the United States.

420
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,729
But like, when I was a kid growing up I was a nerd,

421
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,300
I got beat up a lot because I was a nerd and I liked computers and now, like,

422
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,489
computers are cool.

423
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,770
Well, to some people, there's a lot of video games and stuff.

424
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,130
We were working from home before. It was cool.

425
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:14,150
That's right. That's

426
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,660
-- right. We were,
-- you

427
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:14,868
know,

428
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:15,329
but

429
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,770
my life has literally not changed at all significantly.

430
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:20,380
Like

431
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,930
my kids are around a lot,

432
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,420
but it's,

433
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,760
it's actually funny. I want to tell my funny story now that you just reminded me.

434
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,170
So before we hit record, Kurt was complaining about his chair

435
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,819
and

436
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:31,390
he,

437
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:33,449
well, so is mine.

438
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,000
He commented that there's people on Twitter complaining

439
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,150
about their sore backs because they're using their,

440
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,760
like, you know, $12 Walmart chair that they bought 15 years ago now to work from home.

441
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,739
And

442
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:45,640
that's right.

443
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,469
And so my funny story is I used to buy cheap chairs where I

444
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:51,770
would spend less than $100 on a chair for probably the first five years.

445
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,380
I work from home. I bet. Like, now I've been doing this for almost 20.

446
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,369
Mind you, but for the first couple of years because I was young and I'm like, oh,

447
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,800
whatever.

448
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,130
I don't want to spend that much money on a chair. I'll be fine.

449
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,819
And there was one time that there was this critical issue

450
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:06,979
in Firefox and I literally worked for 28 hours straight.

451
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:07,959
I'll never forget this.

452
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,520
And after I was done,

453
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:13,000
I, I remember I, like, I couldn't sit because, like I had,

454
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,119
I had so many medical problems after that from

455
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,040
sitting for that long in my cheap chair.

456
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,239
I literally, before that, I'd be like $1000 chair. That's not worth it.

457
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,310
And I, I was like a $1000 chair, like, sign me up.

458
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:24,630
Yeah,

459
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,209
exactly. Like I have, I bought a Herman Miller Air on task chair

460
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:29,550
20

461
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:33,969
about 19 or 20 years ago. I've had to, since I have to, I had to replace the piston

462
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,390
and I have to replace it again because it's gone again.

463
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,270
But I also have like a sit stand desk that cost it was not cheap,

464
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,689
but it will lift 350 pounds.

465
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:43,869
And I actually had to teach my kids not to ride it

466
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:49,150
because my one guy basically just wanted to hang on to the edge and, like, up and down.

467
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,390
-- Right.
-- Well, and you know what?

468
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,109
Actually, this is totally related to the podcast topic is the fact that

469
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,640
there are certain investments that a very expensive chair on

470
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,939
the surface feels like you're wasting money on a chair.

471
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:04,439
But when you use it every day for eight hours a day. Like, holy crap.

472
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,744
You need a good chair.

473
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:09,074
Gets me people and mattresses when people try to go cheap on a mattress.

474
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:12,714
And I'm like, you spend one third of your life on this thing. Like, it's like shoes.

475
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:13,025
Right.

476
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:16,005
I used to whatever. Shoes, whatever. Right. If they fit, they fit.

477
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:18,584
And then I did ballroom dancing and like, my feet would

478
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:22,984
like, I own shoes that cost four or 500 bucks and they are so nice.

479
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:25,045
I don't own any shoes that expensive.

480
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,545
But the one thing I started doing that came from,

481
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,229
uh, someone I know who sells shoes, told me to do this.

482
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,800
The shoes you buy. Yeah, just buy, I buy really expensive. Like sliding insole

483
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,479
Deos

484
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,500
and that makes

485
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,540
all the difference.

486
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:41,339
So I, I like, I, I don't buy the cheapest shoes I can buy,

487
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,510
but I don't buy the nicest and then I just buy really, I honestly,

488
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,650
half the time I'm paying as much for my insoles as I have for shoes.

489
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,030
-- But it's totally worth it.
-- Folks.

490
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,180
If I can say one thing in life, be nice to your lower back and feet.

491
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,180
When you're 80 you will.

492
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,020
No one's going to listen to you.

493
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,459
No one's gonna listen to you because you're an old man. What do you know?

494
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,060
All I know now is every time I move my left shoulder it makes this weird noise.

495
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,540
Yeah, that's just part of getting old man. Everyone has that.

496
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,300
It's,

497
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:07,750
yeah,

498
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,459
and

499
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,949
-- brush your teeth.
-- That's all.

500
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,060
Floss, flossing is so important. You have no idea.

501
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,729
Right. No, I know. I know. I know. But, but again, ok, so

502
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,079
we're comically off topic again.

503
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
But, so the point is about

504
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,119
investing in these things that eventually reap rewards.

505
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,449
Well, it's, it's the buy one, cry ones. Right.

506
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,359
Because even back in the day, you know,

507
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,459
they talk about how poor people can only buy a pair of boots that

508
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:33,199
last year and they have to buy a new pair of boots every year.

509
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:35,510
And then, you know, over five years they spend more than they would have on

510
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:35,969
a

511
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,670
decent.

512
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,060
I remember when I was buying winter tires for my car.

513
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,969
I'm like, yeah, I kind of want cheap ones because, like, I basically drive my kids

514
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,729
to and from school and I, like, run errands in my car.

515
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,699
Like, I don't drive, drive and they're like, well,

516
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:49,800
we have winter tires that are like 74 bucks and I'm like,

517
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,219
no, I think we can spend a little more than that for four tires.

518
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:55,280
No, each, like, per tire. Yeah.

519
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,939
No, no.

520
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,630
-- Yeah. 74 bucks for four tires.
-- Wow.

521
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,760
-- What are these made of
-- chewing gum?

522
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:05,390
-- Um, but I pay
-- more than that for my bicycle.

523
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,000
Exactly. Exactly.

524
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:07,650
So, you know,

525
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,630
I ended up getting slightly better winter tires than the $74 Canadian option.

526
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,439
But I was like,

527
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,569
but my one thought was like, yeah, I guess some people, you know,

528
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,589
money's tight and honestly, cheap winter tires are still better than summer tires.

529
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,310
Or even

530
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,670
honestly, even

531
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:24,780
cheap winter tires are generally probably better than all seasons.

532
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,300
And, and I live in a place where, like, like right now.

533
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:34,839
Ok, we have, I think only three days. Uh, let's see. 00, no, it's not gonna snow.

534
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:36,770
Uh, it's gonna snow tomorrow and Tuesday

535
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:40,449
and then that should hopefully be the last snow for the year.

536
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,550
Uh, we've got lows of minus 20 °C.

537
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:44,709
That's

538
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:44,920
pretty

539
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:48,209
cool and highs of like, minus 10 on Wednesday. So, that's,

540
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,430
well, the good news is

541
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,140
that weather will keep people indoors.

542
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,800
-- Uh, that is true. And that's
-- important. It's not a bad thing right now.

543
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,540
Yeah. But

544
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:56,810
I,

545
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:59,959
I think you have to hit this weird critical mass and the

546
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:03,420
problem is it has to be a critical mass of everything.

547
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,660
It has to be money and investment and it has to be mentorship and it has to be

548
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,579
not just, I don't want to say, like, mentorship but it has to be like

549
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,869
the ability to,

550
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,420
you know, have a weird question and be like, oh,

551
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,130
I know a guy that knows a guy that knows about that.

552
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,319
Let's just ask him and, like, we'll take him out for coffee and pick his brain about,

553
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:19,670
like,

554
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,510
whatever strange topic.

555
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:22,719
I, I think you're right.

556
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:24,589
But I think there's a really important part is

557
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,630
I think if you let this grow holistically,

558
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,469
there's gonna be a lot of failed starts where

559
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,229
you need like the right combination of ingredients.

560
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,020
But if you look at like, what Canada has done and what Israel has done,

561
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,959
which are very different topics.

562
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:40,699
But the fact is

563
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,810
they were basically willing to just money,

564
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,449
fire this problem for as long as they needed to

565
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,739
and, but sometimes that's OK. Right.

566
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,300
Well, dude, that's how you guys got to the moon before the end of the decade.

567
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,099
Remember, like, literally JFK was like, you know, it's,

568
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:56,420
we're doing this in by the end of the decade and NASA is like, cool,

569
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,459
-- give us all your money and
-- you know what's really funny about that?

570
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,500
So I read, I forget one of the, one of the early astronauts I think it might have been.

571
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,739
Was it Jim Lovell? I don't remember which one.

572
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,699
Now, I read a book he wrote, I'll, I'll, I'll figure it out and put it in the show notes.

573
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:10,959
But basically

574
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:14,099
they were talking about the space program and Kennedy

575
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,839
before Sputnik, he didn't care, he was like, whatever nerds.

576
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:21,079
I don't care about space. This is stupid.

577
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:23,520
Well, and the thing is until Sputnik he wasn't wrong

578
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,170
and

579
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:24,780
Yeah. Right.

580
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,160
But after Sputnik all of a sudden it was like, all right, how do we get to the moon?

581
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,040
They're like, wait, what? And then he was like, yeah, like, get us there now.

582
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:34,280
And it was, of course, it was kind of bananas.

583
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:34,410
Oh,

584
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,040
the amount of money they spent that if they'd even taken one or two

585
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,239
more years that they could have saved like 30 or 40% of their budget.

586
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:42,020
But they had

587
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,584
stake in the ground and they made it happen because they

588
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:49,805
were willing to literally put any resources possible into this problem.

589
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:52,155
Well, and the thing is that the ironic thing too though

590
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,204
is I say if they'd spent like one or two more years,

591
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:56,925
they could have saved a significant amount of budget.

592
00:23:56,944 --> 00:24:00,505
But on the flip side by making it happen now,

593
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:03,915
they made a whole bunch of like electronics and, you know,

594
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:06,824
just all sorts of amazing computer stuff happened.

595
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:07,474
Well, no,

596
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:07,625
just

597
00:24:07,854 --> 00:24:09,584
happened one or two years earlier, which

598
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:13,890
got us one or two more years of internet, which honestly in the long term, sure means

599
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,630
they probably should have spent twice as much money in taking six months

600
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,280
off the project because we would have had six more months of internet.

601
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:19,589
Right.

602
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,489
Well, not only that the Russians would have gotten to the moon first,

603
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,650
which was basically

604
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,089
like, that is the only thing they cared about was getting there first.

605
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,770
But it is sad though because I look at that and think, look at all this progress we had,

606
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,229
we got there and we were like, well, screw it.

607
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,979
-- That's good
-- enough at the time though.

608
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:38,194
Technologically speaking, there was nothing more you could do.

609
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:42,015
However, now, now we're at a point where, ok, you know, we found ice on the moon.

610
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:44,505
That means we can make rocket fuel. That's interesting.

611
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:44,954
There,

612
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:49,905
there's a really interesting concept behind this and I forget who I was reading

613
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:51,775
that talked about this. But you think about it.

614
00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:53,864
We went to the moon in the sixties because

615
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,505
we could right where like the technology existed,

616
00:24:57,515 --> 00:25:00,675
but it was an enormous amount of work to actually make it all work together.

617
00:25:00,685 --> 00:25:01,035
And again,

618
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:03,165
this is where like the government just shoveling money

619
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,755
in the fire is what made it happen.

620
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,349
Whereas now we actually have the technology to actually

621
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,000
go to the moon in an economical and reasonable.

622
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,380
SpaceX

623
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,329
is getting there, right? Elon Musk talks about this.

624
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:17,410
He's like you can build the first one, you just make your engineers do it easy.

625
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,589
The second one, yeah, you can kind of make them do it

626
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,349
but you want to produce one of these a week,

627
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,780
you can't have your engineers

628
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,989
and the worst problem. And he talked about this

629
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,869
is your engineers then have to build

630
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,900
horrendously complex systems to make

631
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,530
the thing you want to make.

632
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,729
And the the thing is

633
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,030
to build the systems that make the thing you want to make.

634
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,869
They have to be horrendously complex and amazing so

635
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,729
that like people like me and Josh can operate them

636
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:40,579
because

637
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,810
you know, like I, I like to watch machining videos like a shout out to a VE ABC guy,

638
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:48,890
French Canadian or he speaks, his French is beautiful anyways

639
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,560
and

640
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:51,040
the way the guy does

641
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:51,390
machine,

642
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,920
his videos are amazing.

643
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,300
I've learned so much about power tools and how

644
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,839
to just how to think about mechanical systems.

645
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,239
And it's just brutal to think the difference between him and me and Josh,

646
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,030
like me and Josh.

647
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,319
If you put us in front of a lathe

648
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:10,055
piece of metal, we would. Best case scenario, we only maim ourselves,

649
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:11,844
I'm losing a finger for sure.

650
00:26:12,165 --> 00:26:12,295
The

651
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:12,744
best,

652
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:15,545
that's the best case scenario.

653
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:18,005
Worst case scenario is we kill ourselves and burn down the shop.

654
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:21,685
-- There's a good possibility that would happen also.
-- Yeah. And shrapnel,

655
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,709
you know, when you think about a piece of metal spinning at like one or 2000 R PM.

656
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:26,390
Uh

657
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,790
-- Yeah,
-- that's, that's a bit of kinetic energy.

658
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,310
I love watching

659
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,959
the, the metal lathe

660
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,349
when they do that one,

661
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,949
when they do that smoothing cut and it goes from all rough to just mirror.

662
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:37,319
I

663
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,579
know it's so beautiful, isn't it?

664
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:41,550
So they don't get like any chowder marks or any,

665
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:45,369
like all of a sudden it goes from rough to like just mirror and it's just

666
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,619
all,

667
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,989
there's a video I'll try to find a la.

668
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,199
There's this guy who goes and like digs out tree

669
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,300
roots and then makes things out of them on a lathe

670
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:54,530
and it's the most,

671
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,410
but the lathe is like bouncing up and down while he's like trying to, you know,

672
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,089
trim it down.

673
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:58,489
I'm like

674
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:58,969
this

675
00:26:59,099 --> 00:26:59,119
guy,

676
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:02,000
this guy is nuts. Right? Because it's,

677
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,900
you know, the center of gravity is not where the lathe is turned

678
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,500
and, but when he's done it's beautiful.

679
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,199
-- But I just, every time I watch this guy I think like, this is the day you die, man.
-- Well,

680
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,469
what also gets me about fever

681
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:16,680
like that is like the differences in densities in different parts of the

682
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:17,719
world like that just,

683
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,890
and now I know that from watching these youtube videos,

684
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,670
like I know that like you will never catch me putting

685
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,219
anything on a lathe that like,

686
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:28,260
I don't know exactly what it is because like I understand how dangerous it is now.

687
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,880
Yeah, it's, it's something, it's something for sure.

688
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,680
Yep. Yep. Alright.

689
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:35,420
Anyway, anyway, we, we, we were at hold again, we're nearing the end. So

690
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:39,020
I, I guess let, let's tie this one all up and

691
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:42,619
my, my thought on this topic is that

692
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:47,060
what you really need to kind of push the needle in some of these places?

693
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:50,510
And this is true of an organization. It can be true of yourself personally.

694
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,229
It can be true of a country of a government of the planet.

695
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,030
If there's something you want to do,

696
00:27:56,229 --> 00:27:58,829
you're gonna have to invest in it and sometimes it's gonna

697
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,150
suck and sometimes it's gonna feel like you're throwing money

698
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,560
or time or anything in the fire and you are,

699
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:04,560
but that's ok.

700
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,719
And it's even worse than that. You're not only going to have to invest in that thing

701
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,699
but all the things that touch it.

702
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,959
Yeah, that's probably true too. Like, no offense.

703
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:16,270
You can't have Silicon Valley without potable water, reliable electrical grid,

704
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:17,170
good

705
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,189
roads. Good. Take out.

706
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,709
I was reading something where you can't ship stuff to a lot

707
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,930
of places in the world because it gets stolen on the way.

708
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:27,329
And I was thinking, I'm like, oh, that actually makes sense because, you know,

709
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,150
I'm thinking like, I,

710
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,329
I buy stuff online all the time and these just completely random people, like,

711
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,900
drop it off on my doorstep and I'm trying to think of the last time

712
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,689
-- I ordered a package and didn't get it
-- every time I have that problem.

713
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:41,030
It's because someone down the street got it actually.

714
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,949
So it's funny, I live at 519 and there's a 915 down the street and it's

715
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:46,969
very common. We get each other's packages.

716
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:47,550
Well,

717
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,199
and I think that's more an indication of how

718
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:51,790
many people have numeric dyslexia than anything else.

719
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:55,510
Humans. Exactly. Whatever. And we just, you know, go walk it down the street.

720
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,589
Yeah, exactly. That's like,

721
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,449
yeah, last mile problems. But,

722
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:02,910
but fundamentally, like, I honestly, if I had to send 1000 bucks to somebody,

723
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,459
I couldn't email it to them, I would just put it in an envelope like Canada Post.

724
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:08,069
Honestly, Canada Post is like,

725
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:08,630
the,

726
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,109
literally the only thing they've ever done is I

727
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,640
once got my mail with like treads on it,

728
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,869
like tire tread marks.

729
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:15,609
I've

730
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:16,020
got that

731
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:19,219
and I'm like, ok, well, somebody dropped it, whatever it was flat to begin with.

732
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:22,300
Have you ever heard the story of how they shipped

733
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,199
the Hope Diamond in a brown box in the mail?

734
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:30,020
-- And
-- after making a big to do of a security production, security theater of like,

735
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,479
oh this big lock box

736
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,295
it was gonna get stolen.

737
00:29:33,614 --> 00:29:34,275
And they like,

738
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:36,375
and they mailed the real one like just in the post,

739
00:29:36,744 --> 00:29:39,775
which is perfect and nobody knew no one cared and whatever,

740
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,454
it's just another box in the post.

741
00:29:41,464 --> 00:29:42,395
So a funny story,

742
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,734
a friend of mine ordered me some uh food and didn't

743
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:46,234
tell me because they wanted to do something nice for me.

744
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,655
So this guy shows up at the door like two days ago,

745
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:51,025
he only gives me the the street number, not the street.

746
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:53,464
And I'm like, yeah, and he's like, I have, you know, skip the dishes.

747
00:29:53,474 --> 00:29:54,734
I'm like, it's not my food. Sorry.

748
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:55,510
He's like,

749
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,199
ok and he leaves and then I get this text

750
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:58,670
like 20 minutes later saying did the food arrive?

751
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,859
-- And I'm like,
-- what, you know what? That's one thing I've learned over the years is

752
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:06,089
it's lovely doing nice things for people but like tell them

753
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:10,089
it's coming because that exact thing happens more often than not.

754
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,969
Well, especially right now, I'm like, I'm literally at the point where, like,

755
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:13,969
if you're not the mailman,

756
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,750
get out of my, get off my lawn. Anyway.

757
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:20,140
Anyway,

758
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:22,449
I think the moral of the story is, is that

759
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,290
it's, you know what, this reminds me of a lot is dependencies in software

760
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:29,849
because you can't just build Silicon Valley with like a bunch of computer geeks.

761
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:31,280
You also need people to feed them

762
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,359
and to house them and to like provide them with, you know,

763
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,459
pinball bars so they can go hang out and like

764
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,030
whatever

765
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:41,880
-- we will call it the supply chain. Ah
-- It's more than the supply chain.

766
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,310
-- It's the, I hate to say this. It's the ecosystem. Yeah.
-- Yeah. You know.

767
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:48,250
-- Yeah, exactly. I, I'll agree with that. I'll agree with that.
-- Right.

768
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,729
I, I'm sorry, I hate to use that word because it's overused,

769
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,329
but I'm not wrong.

770
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,250
You

771
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:55,719
hear

772
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:55,890
it,

773
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:56,689
folks,

774
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,689
I'm gonna end on that.

775
00:30:58,819 --> 00:30:59,430
It's

776
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:01,420
the ecosystem. Everybody

777
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,300
-- that's, it's anyway. All right,
-- we'll put a link to the IT crowd.

778
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,310
Yeah.

779
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,069
All right. Awesome. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,979

781
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:16,800
Pound Os S podcast. Hashtag

782
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:18,319
to hit us up on social media

783
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:21,609
and I have one added thing I'm going to throw in at the end of this one is,

784
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:24,040
these are horrible times for many of us.

785
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,680
So if you have a fun topic or something.

786
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:27,660
You think that would be enjoyable by all means,

787
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,079
let us know because we are doing our best to not talk

788
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:33,994
about terrible news because there's already enough of that in the world.

789
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:37,244
-- So next week we're going to talk about assembling a treadmill.
-- You can't say that.

790
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:40,285
Now I'm gonna put these out of order. You can't say that I'm gonna do it wrong.

791
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:41,714
No, I'm not. I'm leaving it in there

792
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,785
and I'm gonna purposely not do next week as

793
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:45,564
a treadmill just to teach you a valuable lesson.

794
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:45,964
Kurt.

795
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:46,885
So.

796
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:47,545
All right.

797
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:52,175
Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Kurt. Have a fantastic rest of your day. You too.

798
00:31:52,185 --> 00:31:54,765
Stay safe. Everybody. That's right. Thanks everyone. Bye bye

799
00:31:59,469 --> 00:31:59,599
that.
