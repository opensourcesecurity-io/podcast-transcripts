Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,180
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Digital Sovereignty.

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:11,960
Josh Bresser,

3
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:14,670
-- are we
-- Digital Sovereigns? I'm not sure how that works.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,590
Uh Well, that's because we're traveling. We're not driving somewhere,

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,159
-- don't you travel when you drive?
-- Well, yeah,

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,340
it's, it's, it's a riff on that sovereign citizen.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,190
I'm traveling, not driving thing, you know,

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,989
where they are asked for their driver's license and they're like,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,670
but I'm not driving, I'm traveling

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,040
and then the cop is like, uh huh.

11
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:32,060
-- I still want to see your driver's license and then, you
-- know,

12
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:33,299
I've never heard of this.

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,470
I, I purposely don't pay attention to these people because

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,169
they definitely don't live in the world I live in.

15
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:40,060
And so

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,819
I'm happy to live in my bubble of ignorance or

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,139
whatever you want to call it and be like whatever.

18
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,200
So anyway, before we move on,

19
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,310
I think there's an important thing we should cover and

20
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,299
we're not going to talk about it today in depth.

21
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,860
But holy cow, the collapse of Twitter is a site to witness.

22
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,270
-- I,
-- I think it's not so much the co

23
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:01,064
maps of Twitter, but Ok. So it's a couple of things.

24
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:06,315
Number one, this is now my third financial crisis of the century in 20 years. Yeah.

25
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:09,834
Right. Right. Like, I'm getting a little tired of these. I've done the.com.

26
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:13,885
They're just normal now. I did the.com boom, did 2008.

27
00:01:13,894 --> 00:01:16,754
The mini, I guess technically the mini in what, 2014

28
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:20,595
and now, you know, meta announced they're laying off 11,000 people.

29
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:25,165
Twitter fired half their global workforce and then realized, oops,

30
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,970
some of the people we fired, keep the site running

31
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:29,180
minor detail.

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,540
You know, I tried to hire them back and apparently a lot of them said no, because,

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,910
well, that's what I would have said.

34
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,750
Like at that point, I, I don't trust, like,

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,360
unless you give me a suitcase full of money.

36
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:38,349
No, I'm done

37
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,819
anyway.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,879
Ok. Here's a, here's a fun fact. Um, Master Dawn,

39
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,360
the open source was started in 2016.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,389
The company was founded in 2021 and, you know,

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,519
it's been chugging along doing whatever kind of rank.

42
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,739
And then for the last couple of weeks, they've been getting 4000 users an hour.

43
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,849
I know it's pretty wild

44
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,680
and, and it hasn't collapsed now,

45
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,080
it has definitely gotten slow and things are buggy and like, like my,

46
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,440
my feet on my mobile versus my feet on the website is like

47
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,160
hell out of sync. We'll talk about this properly someday.

48
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,889
But it's, it's, it's lurching along and, you know,

49
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,449
like people are contributing patches.

50
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,169
Like I wrote a web finger server, I guess it's 12 lines of javascript.

51
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,130
I don't know what to call it. It's not really a Damon, but

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,479
like, so now if you want, you can put up a clot floor worker and have like,

53
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,830
just basically serve

54
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,289
your, like,

55
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:25,800
name

56
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,979
domain. So, like your email address and redirect it to your Mastodon accounts.

57
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:30,940
Boom, done,

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,470
you know.

59
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:34,300
and so everybody's improving this stuff, you know,

60
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,100
and it hasn't tipped over

61
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,220
-- and it's
-- awesome.

62
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,179
It's open

63
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,910
-- source. That's what I love.
-- Well, it's not just open

64
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,990
source. Twitter runs on open source,

65
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,419
but Twitter isn't open.

66
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:47,339
The community is well, OK, we're going to talk about this later.

67
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,130
We're not going down this rat hole right now.

68
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,619
I just wanted to mention it because it amuses me to no end

69
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:55,559
-- anyway. Anyway.
-- But today, what's is GCHQ?

70
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,589
So the um the, the basically the UK, you know, Cybersecurity

71
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,720
Agency has basically been scanning all the web

72
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,809
servers hosted in the UK for vulnerabilities.

73
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,759
-- Did they start or are they going to start? When was this supposed to start?
-- Uh It's

74
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,110
already started,

75
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,800
-- did it?
-- OK. I don't remember a date in this story.

76
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:16,610
Yeah.

77
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,199
OK. So we'll assume they're doing it, which is fine.

78
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,600
So, well, it's, it's, it's not a date. It's not. No, no, no. To be clear.

79
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,639
This is not a story. This is the

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,330
NCN

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,449
CS c.gov

82
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:31,720
dot UK. Slash blah, blah, blah. It's their web page that says they're doing this.

83
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,440
Ok

84
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:35,360
and sorry, it's not GCHQ. It's the National Cybersecurity Center.

85
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:38,509
Why did I say G GCHQ? Oh, you know, it's just in my brain, everything. UK

86
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,080
securities, GCHQ,

87
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:44,889
it's fine. Whatever. Anyways. So the N CS C which does not roll off the tongue.

88
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,000
This is on their website,

89
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,250
like this is an official government web page saying we're doing this

90
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:50,750
and like what we're doing and

91
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,710
you know, for example, oh, here we go.

92
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,300
Like all activities performed on a schedule

93
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:56,470
using standard and freely available network tools.

94
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,649
So they're using like what N map and like,

95
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,990
I don't know, we're not going to guess

96
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:00,649
metas

97
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:01,580
PLO whatever

98
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,009
um within a dedicated cloud hosted environment.

99
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,539
Yeah, of course, it's cloud hosted. Like you're not going to do this on prem.

100
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,990
All connections are made from one of these two IP addresses.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Then they give the two IP S

102
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,500
note that these IP addresses are both assigned to scanner dot scanning dot service,

103
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,970
scanner dot scanning dot service.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,730
Ok. I guess that's,

105
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,440
I guess that way if you do a reverse DNS look up like it's really clear what's going on.

106
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:22,579
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,739
And, and they also include a header right? To tell you it's them

108
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,218
which I'm sure no bad people are going to use.

109
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:32,569
And like what makes me laugh is if you're online,

110
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,709
you're already getting scammed by like, well, showdown.

111
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:36,509
-- Oh
-- tons of stuff.

112
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:36,868
A

113
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,218
dozen private companies by

114
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:40,859
bad guys. Even

115
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,799
like to the point where that's one of the reasons I

116
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:45,970
use cloud flare is to kind of filter that junk out.

117
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,850
So I just don't even have to see to my logs. Not that I have logs anymore.

118
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:52,709
I just, I put seafood do or in an S3 bucket and left it there.

119
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,850
It's interesting because some people got really bent out of shape about this.

120
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:59,100
And it's like, yeah, but like is it, I I kind of look at this.

121
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:01,415
Now, if the, if the for example,

122
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:04,065
if the Canadian government announced a plan where they were basically going to

123
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:07,494
have police check every door to make sure it's locked at night.

124
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:10,595
For example, like uh that feels kind of creepy and weird.

125
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:13,734
I don't think that's a valid comparison. I think

126
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:17,105
the, the way I would view this almost is

127
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:18,894
the internet isn't

128
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,619
comparable to like your house scanning an IP address

129
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,160
isn't like going up and trying someone's doorknob.

130
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,000
It would be more comparable to the millions of cameras, especially in the UK

131
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,679
that are just observing public spaces. Like if you walk around the UK,

132
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,359
you're going to be on a CCTV camera

133
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,279
somewhere during uh probably

134
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,369
a five minute walk just because they're like freaking everywhere there.

135
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,220
They, they, they love CCTV.

136
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:47,200
Well, they, they use it for their policing to, to direct police services to,

137
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,910
you know, like there's two guys kicking off and

138
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:53,609
-- over at that bar and like, you know, send a squad over to break it up and,
-- and so, I mean,

139
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,000
I, I think about this one,

140
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,690
there's part of me that says, who cares? Right.

141
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,250
And because you're on the internet, if you have an IP address,

142
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,540
you're getting hammered with crap.

143
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:03,640
I mean, I remember

144
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,679
there was

145
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,480
an elastic search worm at one point

146
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,160
that, like, as, as the elastic search security team, we were like,

147
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,839
what does this worm do?

148
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,529
And I said, I'll just stand up a honey pot and we'll see what happens.

149
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,920
And I did and it took, I think three hours for it to be found.

150
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,440
And then it was really funny because there were like competing worms

151
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,600
constantly trying to ransom the server back and forth between each other.

152
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:26,760
And I'm like, this is great.

153
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,510
And the, oh I remember why

154
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,399
because

155
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,049
our

156
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:34,299
note was being put into the elastic search instance saying I've taken your data.

157
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,890
We were like,

158
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,239
did they? No, no, they did not.

159
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,760
They were just deleting all the data,

160
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,339
adding a ransom note and then demanding Bitcoin.

161
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:44,540
And then I tried to pretend to pay them Bitcoin, which they, they,

162
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:46,859
I never got very far because I'm like, I paid you what's up?

163
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,859
They're like, we didn't get it. I'm like I paid you what's up?

164
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:51,230
Like we didn't get it and then they stopped replying to me

165
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,859
and II I didn't pay them

166
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,390
but

167
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:54,380
but anyway,

168
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:55,260
the

169
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:58,750
like if you have something on the internet, this is just what happens.

170
00:06:59,209 --> 00:06:59,339
It

171
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,670
is what it is.

172
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:03,640
And so I, I think getting upset over this is silly but I,

173
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,260
I think there's a better question is,

174
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,779
does this

175
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:14,570
make sense for a government agency to try to police the IP space in their country?

176
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,869
Pause

177
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,230
-- you say to police the IP space
-- for whatever I use the term loosely.

178
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,679
Yeah, my understanding of this is this is more of a data gathering

179
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,320
at this stage. It's not calling you up and saying like go patch your server.

180
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,839
Yes, that does seem to be the case.

181
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,609
And I think part of this is like

182
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:33,480
that kind of data is actually really important because

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,850
part of it is

184
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,160
without data, a baseline. How do you know if you're making things better or worse?

185
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,709
Like a perfect example of this is I have um a thermometer,

186
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,260
digital thermometer that I take my temperature.

187
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:47,079
My kids' temperature, my temperature is like 36.4.

188
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,220
That's it. That that is my temperature plus or minus 0.2 of a degree.

189
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,019
Now, what's interesting is my one son,

190
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:55,010
his temperature over the last year and a half has actually gone

191
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,869
up about 0.8 of a degree and that's his new normal.

192
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,950
And so what in the past would have been like, oh, he's getting pretty warm.

193
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,910
Maybe he has a fever is now. No, no, no, that's like his temperature has changed.

194
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,420
He's grown,

195
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:07,040
it's something has changed in him and his

196
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:09,510
body temperature now is consistently a bit warmer.

197
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,799
And my other son is like, still bang on, you know,

198
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:16,010
37.2 because I have those baselines now and I have those long term trends.

199
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:16,700
I can see.

200
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,709
Oh, no, it changed. Right.

201
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,839
And that's the thing, like,

202
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,850
if you make some policy change or you talk to these providers,

203
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,459
these hosting providers like,

204
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,040
ok, they say they're patching more but like

205
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:31,450
are they like at scale is anything actually better?

206
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:34,130
And also kind of does this matter?

207
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,130
So like we scan a whole bunch of hosts, find a bunch of vulnerable hosts that are not,

208
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,409
maybe not being exploited.

209
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,239
-- Well, why is that? That's interesting.
-- Right. They're probably all honey pots

210
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:45,898
and a lot of this, it's like public health right now, you know,

211
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:47,439
uh Edmonton public school boards, for example,

212
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,229
has been doing an excellent job of tracking and

213
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,598
publishing data with about a one day delay of like

214
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:54,629
what percentage of kids have reported COVID and what

215
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:56,739
percentage of kids are out sick for other illnesses?

216
00:08:56,749 --> 00:09:00,838
And it's like 14% right now. It's really bad. Yeah. Yeah. But again, like

217
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:03,708
without that sort of longer term data,

218
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:06,568
like we know it's worse in the fall because all the kids go back to school.

219
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,948
But like, oh no, no. This year it's like really worse

220
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,280
because we have the data now from the previous two years.

221
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:15,900
Ok. Ok. So I think there's

222
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,500
a couple of interesting pieces in everything you just said.

223
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,419
First of all, they do seem to be just scanning and not doing any and, and even if you,

224
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,580
we could discuss for hours,

225
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,799
how you would even figure out who to contact

226
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,719
if you're just scanning IP addresses because that in itself

227
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,539
-- is very difficult
-- DNS register

228
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,049
it, it, but it's not even that simple because what if you're using,

229
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,979
what if you're using a cloud service and one

230
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:42,929
IP address is hosting 30 services because it's a,

231
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,130
a load balancer.

232
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:48,030
-- You're
-- assuming they're just scanning IP si assume that they're scanning both IP S

233
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,340
and host names.

234
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:55,119
Like if I was the British government, I would download the well.uk DNS file and like,

235
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,969
-- OK, and map, like go
-- do it.

236
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,369
They, they should be doing that

237
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,049
and, and because, well,

238
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,659
although that even that's funny because there's going to

239
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,510
be that UK things hosted outside the U.

240
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,159
OK. But whatever, because of I PV six, you can't scan I PV six.

241
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:10,590
There's too many, right. You can scan all of I PV four in a couple of hours.

242
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,799
You can't brute force scan I PV six.

243
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,119
Right? But that's why you need the host names. Exactly.

244
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:16,289
And, well,

245
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:20,500
the other thing to remember too is they have boxes that monitor

246
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,840
the traffic and they know which IP S are in use.

247
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:27,659
I mean, probably to a degree you can you can ask, they don't scan you,

248
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,380
they have an email address for that.

249
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,820
The thing is the government can do things at scale that

250
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,580
we can't because they have access to information that we don't

251
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:39,229
sure there was, there was actually a really good podcast motherboard did.

252
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,659
I'll try to dig it up and put in the show notes.

253
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,150
I don't, I don't know if I've talked about it here before but there is

254
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,500
a service.

255
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:45,419
The,

256
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:46,609
not the jig.

257
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:50,270
Um, um, it's, I think it's NCIS, it's like the, the, the lawyer,

258
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,330
one of the lawyer groups in the Navy or the law enforcement of the Navy.

259
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,729
-- I think it's NCIS. That would
-- be the NCIS as we know from the TV show.

260
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,729
Is there a TV show?

261
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,770
Dude? There, they have like six.

262
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:02,330
I don't watch TV.

263
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,270
NC.

264
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,840
Well, it was funny because I tried watching it for a little while and it was so boring.

265
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:09,549
I couldn't, and this one guy just tweeted recently that, like,

266
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,630
his daughter watches NCIS to fall asleep.

267
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,359
So she, like, doesn't know what it is but she knows about NCIS and she's like,

268
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:17,400
eight years old or something.

269
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,640
Yeah, there is an NCIS show.

270
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:21,599
-- There's a lot.
-- Really.

271
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:22,679
There's,

272
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,479
-- I think there's four,
-- 40, there are

273
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,219
Ncislancis, Hawaii. NCIS, New Orleans. Wow. Neat.

274
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:31,400
Anyway, whatever doesn't matter.

275
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,549
Ok. So

276
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,119
NCIS,

277
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,099
they were

278
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,539
contracting with some company that was like,

279
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:40,210
collecting enormous amounts of net flow data and selling it.

280
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:42,780
To them with the excuse of obviously metadata doesn't matter.

281
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,049
So, no one cares and you don't need warrants and things like that.

282
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,510
And then, then motherboard did a big, big thing about it. But.

283
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,809
Right. Right. So there's, there's definitely ways to access a lot of this data.

284
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,059
Now, now, the thing I think

285
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,849
that everyone is going to say is first of all, how do I prove something is in the UK,

286
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,080
which

287
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,270
I don't know how they're doing that or if they care,

288
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:07,869
the thing you could do is you could just do it by geographical IP space and just say,

289
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,429
like, look, if this is forwarding on through a VPN to somewhere else,

290
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,909
not our problem. Like, we're just, I suppose,

291
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:16,989
you know, we're just all the A SNS that are, like, quote unquote in Britain.

292
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,979
Like, ah, I just learned about the, um, the A SN IP or the IP. What was it?

293
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,119
Oh, dang it now, I can't remember it. The, uh, not IP info.

294
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,994
Anyway, there's this database, like, where you ask it an IP.

295
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:32,315
And it's like this IP is located in this and

296
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,674
it's probably not a VPN but it is probably this,

297
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:37,104
you know, blah, blah, blah, it's a residential service or not or whatever.

298
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:37,414
Right.

299
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,864
That's something I wanted to talk about. Like, what is

300
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:40,974
digital UK?

301
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:44,655
Like is it.uk, do we just say, like, look if it ends in.uk,

302
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:48,215
it's their jurisdiction because it's registered to a DNS registrar

303
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:49,054
in the UK.

304
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,179
Well, and even that they're not in the UK necessarily, right?

305
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,919
Because I think God Daddy sells them.

306
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,119
-- Is it the IP space?
-- So here's what they put on their website.

307
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,539
They say these activities cover any internet accessible

308
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,280
system that is hosted within the UK.

309
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,059
-- And
-- so I would assume they're going by IP address and routing, right?

310
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,969
Like, so it doesn't get out of their digital borders,

311
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:11,520
I would assume. So.

312
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:12,239
You know, but,

313
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,080
and let's ignore like VPN S and tunneling and redirects and stuff like that.

314
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,359
Well, and even like, it's funny too because think about cloud flare,

315
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,489
cloud flare has endpoints all over the world.

316
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,619
And when you connect to a cloud flare site or service,

317
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,710
you connect to a local IP that's very close to you.

318
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:34,030
And then magically the data arrives at your location from the cloud flare.

319
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,010
Magic cloud,

320
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,510
well, a local point of presence because they use any cast.

321
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,179
So they have this block of IP S that they just globally advertise from,

322
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,840
I think they're at like 200 points of presence now or something.

323
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,669
It's a lot,

324
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,289
I bet it's at least that.

325
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,289
So,

326
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,000
yeah, it's the, the other thing to be blunt is if they're using open source tools,

327
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,270
they, they're not doing anything that Attackers aren't already doing.

328
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,469
Right. Oh, absolutely. Like they're not like they're not using zero days.

329
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:03,750
-- So
-- here's what makes this funny as well is from the perspective of a governmental

330
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,789
intelligence organization.

331
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,599
You can't use secret tools because

332
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:13,229
you will have adversaries specifically running hosts

333
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,130
in your order

334
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:18,440
just to snarf the information of what you are doing.

335
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:19,840
I, there's,

336
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:24,200
I guarantee you every other country's intelligence agency has stood up

337
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,719
a server in the UK just to watch these scans 100%.

338
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,090
-- I
-- think you're giving people too much credit. But, yeah, I mean, no, I

339
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:32,960
guarantee it.

340
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:34,119
I, I would be

341
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:34,489
all right.

342
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,750
Maybe not every, every intelligence organization, but we'll say at least

343
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,599
-- the top 10. But
-- yeah, as we learned from uh what was it? The NSA eternal Blue.

344
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:42,549
Like, oops, you know,

345
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,140
the wanna cry ransomware ended up using it and it became a bit of an issue.

346
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,690
Right? Well, that's a, that's a whole other story in itself. But

347
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:52,280
regardless, I, I feel like

348
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,559
I read this story. Part of me says, not the dumbest idea ever.

349
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,520
Part of me says the dumbest idea ever.

350
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,299
And I have a strong suspicion. This is just the kind of crap we're gonna see

351
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,200
because every government on the planet is now making a huge deal about the cyber.

352
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,190
And so they, they, they need to do something, right?

353
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,359
I mean, fundamentally when you are a government organization,

354
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,669
someone is going to show up and say, here's a bunch of money, fix the cyber.

355
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,400
And now you have to say,

356
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,869
how am I going to spend this money? Because if I don't, I'm going to get fired.

357
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,390
And so,

358
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,750
-- yeah, and worse, we're not going to get that money next year. Right.
-- Oh. Right.

359
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,799
Well, exactly.

360
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,729
And so they're,

361
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:32,320
they're going to do things that maybe some of us geezers who've been on the

362
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,750
internet a long time are going to look at and shake our heads and say,

363
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,830
why on earth is this even happening?

364
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,710
And some of it will be stupid. Some of it won't be stupid.

365
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:42,400
And it's just, I, I think we're going to see more of this everywhere.

366
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,650
I remember back in the old days when intrusion

367
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,750
prevention systems were just starting to take off.

368
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:50,229
And somebody pointed out, you know what the real value of an IP S was or not, sorry,

369
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,872
intrusion prevention systems, intrusion detection systems,

370
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:54,622
like we weren't even doing prevention back then.

371
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:58,072
And he pointed out that the value of an I DS was

372
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,893
you stuck one in front of your firewall

373
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:02,353
and you stuck one behind your firewall and then

374
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,263
you could show your leadership the delta between the

375
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:06,312
two and say like our firewall is working.

376
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:09,632
Sure, sure. And then you could get more budget for a better firewall.

377
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:10,572
That's probably true.

378
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,973
This is what drives me nuts is like some things

379
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:15,593
we kind of know inherently will be better like,

380
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:18,473
you know, having passwords versus

381
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,776
like not having passwords at all. Ok?

382
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:23,736
Like having an account and a password that are unique and not shared, right? I

383
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:26,116
don't really need data to prove that that's better.

384
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:30,185
But then there's other things like, well, should I deploy this vendor a or vendor BW?

385
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:33,195
And maybe there are different technologies, maybe they're, you know, whatever,

386
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:34,306
like which one's better,

387
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:35,875
you know, supply chain security.

388
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:39,036
-- And, but the thing is that's where you need to gather the data.
-- OK.

389
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:39,276
No, no,

390
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,286
I want to pick on this though because I think what

391
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:43,695
you just brought up is interesting and you're not wrong.

392
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:46,716
But there's another angle to this when we're dealing with governments.

393
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,570
If the government has the ability to detect

394
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,200
weaknesses in a product over another product,

395
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,630
do you think they're going to say

396
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,510
vendors of this product or even product vendor who built this,

397
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,960
you should fix this bug or do you think they're going to

398
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:04,660
take that bug and use it to their advantage against adversaries?

399
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,959
We know the answer

400
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,040
but a lot of those weaknesses aren't really exploit.

401
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,760
Like think about the supply chain software that we're seeing like, oh,

402
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,920
like for example, as we all learned from open SSL recently,

403
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,130
a lot of these supply chain software things don't unpack stuff and look for it.

404
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,839
Like you were talking about it,

405
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,959
how your engineer spent the weekend writing a

406
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:23,699
thing that looks for that magic string,

407
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:27,180
like that's not a vulnerability that I can really exploit or

408
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,930
kind of use and but I can report it to the vendor and be like,

409
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:32,410
can you please fix this capability?

410
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,670
So that your product works. Right.

411
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,989
And that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about more like,

412
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,109
I'm not talking about a buffer overflow.

413
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:37,890
I'm talking about, like,

414
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,560
you know, this product

415
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:40,739
just like,

416
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,469
doesn't understand this protocol or something, you know?

417
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,260
Ok. All right. All right.

418
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:46,780
But

419
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,130
regardless you get, you get the point, we've got

420
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,540
the government now in the UK is going to try to do

421
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,420
scanning of all the UK stuff.

422
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,180
They're gonna no doubt go outside of the UK,

423
00:17:57,189 --> 00:18:01,089
which probably will create diplomatic nightmares for somebody at some

424
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,219
point because it's just the nature of the beast.

425
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,650
And then they're going to collect all this data.

426
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,760
We don't know what they're going to do with it yet. And

427
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,709
I think you're going to see a bunch of people losing their minds,

428
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:12,430
which is obviously what the hacker news threat threat is for.

429
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,239
And I think at the end of the day, no one's gonna care in like, uh six months.

430
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,040
That's my guess.

431
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,239
Well, I mean,

432
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,209
the thing is like

433
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:24,949
showdown IO already did this. Like, and how old is Showdown Iowa?

434
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,390
It's pretty old now. I think

435
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,209
I want to say more than 10 years.

436
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,310
I still love, I must say from the showdown perspective.

437
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,000
And now I don't approve of this in any way.

438
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,910
But when they ran their own NTP server to start capturing I PV six addresses,

439
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,079
like that was so brilliant.

440
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,819
-- Just like holy cow.
-- Well done.

441
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,709
I, at 1.20 years ago,

442
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:46,619
suggested the organization I work for start running IRC servers so

443
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,530
we could monitor Irc.

444
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,520
Right. Exactly. Because when you run the server, you can access a lot of

445
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,500
stuff.

446
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:54,939
-- Well,
-- it's

447
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:57,569
just you see all the traffic and that's the thing we would have had to run,

448
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:00,020
like, um, one of the sort of more central distribution nodes,

449
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,040
not like an end node that just gets what's going through it, but like

450
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,099
an actual, I forget what they were called like a transit or something or,

451
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,150
I don't know, I mean, this is one of the,

452
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,390
it's suspected that the NSA runs an enormous number of Tor

453
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,130
exit nodes and entry nodes for this exact reason because,

454
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,180
well, you can't control the path the data takes through the Tor network.

455
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:21,599
If you run enough entry nodes and enough exit nodes,

456
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:25,140
you can start correlating data and figuring out who's going where, which is

457
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,500
good for them, I guess.

458
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,719
See,

459
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,650
this is the thing that people forget is like there's a

460
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,160
lot of law enforcement and criminal investigations that are like,

461
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:32,560
OK,

462
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,859
well, we knew it was a red truck.

463
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:37,469
So we just checked every red truck in the city,

464
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,619
right? That's it.

465
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,959
Like it's, there was no, there's no magic like no Sherlock breakthrough moment.

466
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:44,219
It's just like yesterday,

467
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:46,170
the cops announced they charged this guy with a

468
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,979
crime from a DNA sample collected in 1981.

469
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,290
-- You know, like it's in the computer So
-- I like to read,

470
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,209
we'll say in, uh, uh,

471
00:19:55,719 --> 00:20:01,010
analysis of criminal investigations on, specifically on Twitter,

472
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,619
I follow a bunch of lawyers and it's fun to do.

473
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,300
I need to find them on Mastodon now. But

474
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,140
anyway,

475
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,630
like, yeah, I'll get there.

476
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,099
But

477
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,660
something I found out that happens in a lot of these cases is

478
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,795
an organization like the FBI might technically

479
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,395
break the law to collect some evidence.

480
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:17,175
The evidence is not admissible in court,

481
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,775
but they can say we know this person did this.

482
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:24,854
Now we just have to work backwards to finding evidence we can use in court.

483
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:27,694
And I think this is an example of something like that where the,

484
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,619
the, the UK government or any governments is going to, you know, maybe scan things,

485
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,500
look for things that they find something that they know is problematic,

486
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,339
then they might not directly use that information because like I, I guess, you know,

487
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:42,589
what else this reminds me of is, remember all the cases

488
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,099
where they

489
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,800
FBI had evidence off of someone's phone and they were like,

490
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,979
you have to tell us how you got that off my phone and they were like,

491
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,300
we're just gonna drop this case after all. Like everything's cool everybody.

492
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,780
It's like holy crap. Like what, what must you have done that?

493
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,260
You're willing to literally drop the whole case instead of admitting

494
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:00,800
in those cases. It was pretty clear like uh what was it,

495
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:01,760
is it called?

496
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,369
Celebrate or celebrate or whatever it's called,

497
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,150
celebrate is one of the companies is that I'm pretty sure their contracts say,

498
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,609
like if you leak this stuff, we're not selling to you ever again

499
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:11,420
and you lose that capability.

500
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,979
And so this is the exact same thing that,

501
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:17,650
like the allies had a problem with World War Two with where we, ok, we broke enigma

502
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,760
and we broke, you know, purple.

503
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,239
Well, how do we use this without like

504
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,410
them figuring out that, you know,

505
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,500
we broke this and we're reading this and like, you know,

506
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,520
the German Navy went to a four rotor design and try, uh you know,

507
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,209
threw them out for a while.

508
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:35,810
But like that's the thing, how do you like if I'm on your phone, reading your phone,

509
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:36,380
how do I

510
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:38,229
use that without

511
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,430
you then really quickly figuring out like, oh he's, he's on my phone.

512
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,729
And so, yeah, creating like parallel discovery like, oh

513
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,390
no. And, and this would actually be a good example of where they can maybe start from.

514
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,770
Parallel discovery was like, oh, no,

515
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,239
no. What happened is we actually scanned this IP. And we found this, like,

516
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:55,469
weird looking vulnerability and we investigated a bit

517
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,829
and that's how we found the illegal activity,

518
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,489
right? It wasn't, you know,

519
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,739
some spy stuff that's illegal,

520
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,000
you know. So, but regardless, it's

521
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,969
like you said, like the government has to spend the money, they have to do something

522
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:09,339
in all honesty, they do need this baseline data.

523
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,420
It's useful to have like there's companies there that just track who is data. Like

524
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,939
the DNS changes. Like where does this DNS point to? What is the NS server?

525
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,020
You know, all that stuff going back like a decade or two?

526
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,900
-- So, you know
-- what's really cool is when I was at Elastic,

527
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,540
there was a guy I worked with who he did a

528
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,260
lot of demos for threat detection and things like that.

529
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,530
And he, there,

530
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,890
there's a feed from let's encrypt where let's encrypt will

531
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,449
just like they have a fire hose of all the,

532
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:35,589
-- all the certificates being requested, their
-- certificate, transparency

533
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:35,979
logs.

534
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:36,609
Yeah. Right.

535
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:40,040
And so he was snarfing that up and he was writing it into elastic search and then

536
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,300
obviously he would look for certain things and

537
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,130
like when there would be like Bitcoin stuff,

538
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,729
you know, obviously scam domains and things like that.

539
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:48,329
And it was

540
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,650
just because obviously one of the tricks you can do in like elastic search is like,

541
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,589
let's say you have, you know,

542
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,739
cried.org,

543
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:57,089
you can say, like, show me domains that are similar to this.

544
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,869
-- And then you can be like, oh,
-- wow,

545
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,829
remember when Cloud Flower got fish and they were like part of it is,

546
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,579
the domain was like, what 45 minutes old?

547
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,479
The system didn't catch it,

548
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:07,729
you know, because they're monitoring

549
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,959
and that's part of the beauty is like, I can't get a DNS registrar feed like,

550
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,959
there's no way they're ever going to give that up.

551
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:17,619
But a certificate transparency log, especially Lutz and Crap,

552
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:18,959
who's a good citizen.

553
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:20,770
Yeah.

554
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,250
Yep. Yep. Absolutely.

555
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,609
It's, uh, it's funny because I actually,

556
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,489
I have a draft cwe for that kind of as a problem.

557
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,250
But also, like, it's interesting because

558
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,930
we have to do it, we have to do it in real time for it to be of value.

559
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,050
But for example, it does, like,

560
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,739
there's literally we're at a point now where if you

561
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,699
stand up wordpress server and it generates a certificate,

562
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,250
by the time you try to log in as the fresh admin thing,

563
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,689
somebody else might have already hijacked

564
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,489
-- it. Uh
-- It's certainly possible if you install an old one. Yeah.

565
00:23:45,744 --> 00:23:48,324
Well, no, no, no, because when you stand up wordpress certain ways it just,

566
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,564
you log in as admin then set the password and everything

567
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:52,064
and

568
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:54,244
the attacker could get in and kind of.

569
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:57,334
-- Well, yeah, I mean, you'd know
-- if that happened though because you can't log in.

570
00:23:57,454 --> 00:23:59,564
-- So,
-- but if they had a script to automate it and

571
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:00,944
you know, whatever.

572
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:03,844
But the point is with all this, I think this is actually a good thing.

573
00:24:03,854 --> 00:24:06,765
I actually kind of wish they would provide the data set because

574
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:09,405
in my mind, if it's an open source tool

575
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:10,285
there,

576
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,589
like not doing anything kind of magic or special,

577
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,500
they're just running it from these two IP S

578
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:16,500
right? OK.

579
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,339
So you got to where I was hoping we would go and I love it when you do it without,

580
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:22,060
without me.

581
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,790
I am hopeful we will see this data

582
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,430
end up in something like threat intelligence feeds.

583
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,189
Eventually.

584
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:33,699
When we look at the way threat, intelligence and threat sharing happened today,

585
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,469
we're trying to get companies to do it and it's a huge

586
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:39,760
struggle because obviously no one wants to air out their dirty laundry.

587
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,589
No one wants to admit. Oh, I got popped and here's what happened.

588
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,989
I mean, there's some orgs that do it but not a lot do it. Right.

589
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,339
-- And there's like, well,
-- I mean, the,

590
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:48,989
the CS A participates in this and there's anonym organization of it.

591
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,469
And there's

592
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,500
what's interesting is like when,

593
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,500
what seems to work well is when you have

594
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,630
companies of roughly the same sort of size and stature

595
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,030
and then they sort of, they're big enough to understand that.

596
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,939
Like, no, this is how the game works.

597
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:03,939
Like these are the rules and we'll play by it and not

598
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,010
try to use this to, you know, gain an advantage that we use to hurt the opponent,

599
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,569
but to gain an advantage to protect ourselves.

600
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,920
And so I think that maturity piece is growing, but it's, it's,

601
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,060
it's also just really hard, technologically.

602
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:20,199
It is. And I think this is actually one of the places a government

603
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,239
naturally can get involved and provide some of this data because they don't have

604
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:26,319
in the game,

605
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:28,270
this is a census.

606
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,949
It, it, it is a census. That's a really good way to look at it, I think. And,

607
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,270
and it's additionally important because

608
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:38,089
if we look at, think about, I mean, census data is I, I think a great example is

609
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,229
there's not a lot of economic viability to census data.

610
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:45,310
Like if you had a private company with the data and they tried to sell it

611
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:48,869
like there is value, but it's probably not very high.

612
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:50,739
-- So
-- I'm gonna have to disagree with you.

613
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,189
Uh things like choice point and all those data

614
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:56,150
collection agencies in the US that sell marketing data.

615
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:58,040
That's true.

616
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:59,369
That's the problem is

617
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,189
um

618
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:03,109
the problem is they're collecting like marketing data.

619
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,739
And well, great example,

620
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,199
actually locally the city of Edmonton just halted their annual or not annual,

621
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:08,510
but they,

622
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,160
they've halted the census taking activities and a lot of

623
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,560
agencies and nonprofits are complaining because they need that data,

624
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:19,119
like they need that data to provide services to know where to go to, to function.

625
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,239
And it's absolutely not economical for them

626
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,119
to collect it themselves.

627
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,949
-- Right.
-- Of course, exactly.

628
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,260
Like that's impossible

629
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,109
and it's not even economical for them to, you know,

630
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:32,069
to pay somebody like choice point for it.

631
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,099
Like it's just not

632
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:33,780
and

633
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,949
like a road network, this is a public good.

634
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,849
The point is we need this data because nobody can collect it uh efficiently.

635
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,410
-- Like it's, it's being reproduced. It's expensive
-- and look, it needs to be free.

636
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,270
-- Right. Like your point about
-- free and unencumbered.

637
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,810
Right. Right. Exactly.

638
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,810
Because I think your point about, you know, charities or,

639
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:57,050
or services or agencies or whatever, wanting data and not,

640
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,430
not being willing to pay for it.

641
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:01,209
I think if you think about a lot of the threat intelligence feeds,

642
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,400
it's a similar situation where they're not cheap

643
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,569
and so a lot of people don't use them because they don't

644
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:07,819
have the budget for them and they don't understand it's important.

645
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:09,459
Whereas if it's free,

646
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,670
I think it changes the dynamic.

647
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,739
I can at least look at it because like, I'll be honest,

648
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,859
I've actually worked for Threat Intelligence feed companies for like

649
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,260
half of my career

650
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,160
and I've, I've never bought one, I've never said we should buy one. I've never

651
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:23,989
like,

652
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:25,579
and part of it is because I cheat and I

653
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:27,449
put everything in the cloud and it's Google's problem.

654
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,119
I mean, we, we had one at elastic when I was there.

655
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,180
It was, it was a cool service but it wasn't particularly cheap.

656
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,869
-- At least for the good ones.
-- Well, and more to the point.

657
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,400
I'm always kind of like, well, action.

658
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,569
What do I do with it?

659
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,130
-- Uh,
-- there's a lot you can do with it.

660
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,459
I mean, you tied into a SIM and then you use the signals from it. There's to that.

661
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,979
And I mean, this is also part of the challenge is

662
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:49,189
there's a narrow swath of the population that

663
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,859
truly understands what this state is good for.

664
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,079
I mean, you're, you're not dumb and you don't know what to do with it. So that says

665
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:57,170
it's not that I don't know what to do with it. I'm just like, I don't see

666
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,170
enough to make it worthwhile

667
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,030
and I've never had anybody like, demo it or show it to me in a way that makes it

668
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,650
-- compelling.
-- It has value.

669
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:08,500
And, and so anyway, but again, we don't, we're just speculating,

670
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,859
we don't even know if this is going to happen.

671
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:10,540
It's conceivable.

672
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,359
We've just waited the last five minutes talking about sharing data

673
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,920
and the UK has no intention of doing that. Which would be a shame if they, if they did.

674
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,579
-- I suspect
-- they

675
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,530
won't because the

676
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:21,910
-- Queen's copyright maybe,
-- maybe we'll see. We'll see.

677
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:24,189
But all we need to take this one home,

678
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,449
I guess all in all it's just your typical,

679
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:30,609
let's make a spectacle of nothing because why not?

680
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:34,150
Well, it is a new behavior and it is interesting because, you know,

681
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,709
people are worried about the thin end of the wedge.

682
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:38,729
Like what if the next step is we start testing for vulnerabilities?

683
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:39,550
I mean,

684
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:44,989
that's a fair question and I don't want to, that's even like crazier speculation,

685
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,989
obviously, but

686
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,199
it, it,

687
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,469
I think you will,

688
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,670
if you start testing for vulnerabilities,

689
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,959
you're going to crash services and crashing services creates,

690
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,310
-- we'll say problems.
-- Do you remember Oh, I cannot remember the guy's name.

691
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,040
He did all the D

692
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,219
DOS

693
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,699
work originally out of University of Washington. Uh,

694
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,609
David.

695
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:04,609
Oh,

696
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:05,300
what's that?

697
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:08,329
He would basically scan the University of Washington

698
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:09,780
Network and find IP S that were like,

699
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,869
running horrifically vulnerable software or like public, oh,

700
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,319
public smb writeable shares.

701
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:17,849
Are you going to tell us he crashed an MRI machine?

702
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:20,280
No. Yeah, it's like an MRI machine or something,

703
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,199
you know.

704
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:22,750
And yeah, like,

705
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,300
and, and maybe, and that's part of this I think would also be, for example,

706
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,099
they can take this scanning data

707
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,060
and they can

708
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:32,619
then go to their, for example, any energy regulator and say like

709
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:36,540
get an IP address of every energy management system

710
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:37,770
in the UK.

711
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,619
Let's marry them and see like what do those systems look like?

712
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,099
So that in future if we are like stumble across a random IP,

713
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:48,180
can we bucket it as like it's a web server or it's like controlling a power plant?

714
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,060
That, that,

715
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,079
yeah, you see that all the time where on show Dan

716
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,540
there's pictures of, you know,

717
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,359
because Shonan will take a snap a picture of like the desktop.

718
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,670
Yeah.

719
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:57,560
And yeah,

720
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:58,939
you get that where there's like industrial

721
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:00,979
control systems just sitting on the internet

722
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,400
and you can connect to them and mess with them and

723
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,000
it is what it is. And you know, I guess if

724
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:10,300
that would be an interesting number is seeing if,

725
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,219
if efforts like this take the number of publicly

726
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:16,790
available things like RDP SESSIONS and decreases them.

727
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,349
That would be hugely successful, I think.

728
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,310
But we will, we will have to see.

729
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,349
I mean, we,

730
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:25,829
we've seen that happen with Elastic and Mongo where you can't

731
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,630
put on public on password protected instance online anymore because it'll get

732
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,140
slacked in a couple of hours.

733
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,310
But that was market pressure,

734
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:35,530
not the government.

735
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:36,290
Well, no, no, no.

736
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,160
-- But what I mean is the attacks got so bad that the market went like,
-- well,

737
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:40,819
that's the thing though.

738
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:42,689
These other attacks aren't that bad yet.

739
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:44,410
And so this is, I think where some government

740
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,189
like, let's push them down the hill and, and hopefully it'll get there. So, anyway.

741
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,969
All right, I'm calling on this. Thank you, everyone.

742
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,180
I, I don't remember how to end the podcast anymore. My brain just kept working.

743
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,550
Thank you. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you, everyone.
