Hello and welcome to episode 42 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:10,420
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,310
and my partner in crime. Josh Bresser

3
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:15,729
42. We all know what that means. Right. Kurt.

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:16,360
How

5
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,200
will they? That's right. Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy,

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:20,479
which

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:20,600
I,

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,629
I was thinking about this and I, I it needs no intro because let's face it.

9
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:27,250
If you're listening to the show, you don't hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy,

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,450
it's just like, shame on you.

11
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:31,010
Right? Like go just shame. That's all I have to say.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,970
I there's no excuse and, and yeah, there's nothing else to say about that. Just

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,959
so. Anyway, episode 42 we naturally thought it would be fun to do something.

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,840
Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy related. So, what do we do, Kurt?

15
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:47,720
Well, I guess we could sort of dissect the film and its various security related.

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,139
No, you don't guess that's what we better do because that's what I prepared for.

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,740
Like,

18
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:55,959
well, well, well, anyway, so,

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,680
so for those of you who missed the end of the last episode when we,

20
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,330
we kind of told you what was going on is

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,720
when we realized episode 42 is coming.

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,669
Kurt said we should do something about Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,959
And I thought, yeah, we should read the book

24
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:09,739
and then look for security things.

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,949
And, uh, yeah, it's a really long book.

26
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,440
So we decided that the next best thing would be to watch the movie because that only

27
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:22,239
will eat an hour and a half of my life instead of probably a week of reading.

28
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,360
So, yeah. Yeah, that's good.

29
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,209
And, and I guess for those of you who don't know and not everyone knows this, I don't,

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,889
I don't remember if you knew this before I told you, but there's also a radio show

31
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,930
and the radio show in all seriousness is my favorite of the three formats.

32
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,610
I love the radio show.

33
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:38,639
Juan, just to be clear,

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,040
I have not heard the radio show and speaking of the three formats,

35
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,650
-- there's then also the TV
-- series from.

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,029
That's right. That terrible TV show.

37
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,690
It was

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,760
terrible. It was,

39
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:47,480
that's

40
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,879
true.

41
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:51,470
That's true. It crosses that line. It has like that integer overflow,

42
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:52,410
right?

43
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,800
It was like the doctor who special effects team from the BBC,

44
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,830
the way they did.

45
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,250
Zap's head is a par cage. I

46
00:01:59,470 --> 00:01:59,500
was

47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,080
like

48
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:00,639
paper mache.

49
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,790
It was so

50
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:03,489
cool. It was clearly fake.

51
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,269
That's the best part is like they, they obviously didn't even try to make it real,

52
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:07,790
you know.

53
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:09,050
Anyway.

54
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,258
So

55
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,339
yeah, we opted for the shortest sort of most up to date form.

56
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:16,059
At the same time and also I guess, be uh

57
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:19,619
-- be accessible to our viewers.
-- So that's actually something else you bring up.

58
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,059
And this is an important point is

59
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,044
when I watched this movie, I, I get annoyed by it for a variety of reasons,

60
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:29,154
but I know one of the intentions Douglas Adams always had

61
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:30,125
was that

62
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:33,604
his story isn't set in stone at one time.

63
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:36,725
And so like he helped write the screenplay, you know,

64
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:39,845
this isn't just some crazy Hollywood screenwriter that went nuts

65
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:43,764
and he wanted it updated to match the times he

66
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:45,725
didn't want it to take place back in what,

67
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:48,664
the seventies or sixties or whenever the original happened.

68
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:49,434
And so

69
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,330
as much as I get annoyed by some of the things,

70
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,039
I'm very sympathetic to the fact that they updated the story,

71
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:56,660
like Arthur has a cell phone,

72
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,270
you know, that, that's cool.

73
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:02,520
And which, which is even funny though because it's not like an iphone or anything.

74
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:02,919
I'm like,

75
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,440
he's got an old crappy phone

76
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,300
but I kind of like that. They at least, yeah, it's a smartphone, at least.

77
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:12,419
Although if you'd had a flip phone, it would have just looked ridiculous.

78
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,539
Was it a smartphone? I thought it was just a candy.

79
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,240
Well, it was, it was a candy bar phone but it wasn't like a flip phone or anything

80
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,029
and it kind of had like graphics on it and stuff and, you know.

81
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:24,990
Right. Anyway,

82
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,029
anyway,

83
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,949
so

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,429
let let, let's dive in, man, let's dive in.

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,190
I'm gonna start with, with that dolphin song.

86
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,779
I, I hate that song. I'm not even going to pretend like I, I hate that song.

87
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:40,179
That song revolts me when I hear it and I don't have a good reason for it.

88
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,509
It's just,

89
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,029
I hate that intro and I think that sets me up for failure for the rest of this movie.

90
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,029
Well, I mean, I have six year old so I get to hear, uh Baby Shark 10 times a day.

91
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,529
I do remember those days. And in fact, my daughter was,

92
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,240
what was she about? Six? I think when, when frozen came out and that song let it go.

93
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,000
I heard that at least 10 times a day for months.

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,020
And my one son does that song and it's hilarious because he's just,

95
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,610
he only does like the few sort of highlights

96
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,740
and he literally stands there with his hands in his pockets

97
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,220
and like, do a twirl on his heels. He'll do like the hair sweep gestures

98
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,809
and like, just occasionally belt out that

99
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,739
go, you know, like sort of off key.

100
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm glad you, you did an escape. You let it go crazy. So, anyway, anyway,

101
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,190
I

102
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:33,589
don't think there's any legitimate security topics or nuance

103
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,200
theme. What's a huge one? Well, they did say they,

104
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,390
communication.

105
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,230
Yeah. How many, how many times has a firm been warned of

106
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,549
a, not even a potential hack but an actual real hack, like a hack going on

107
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,239
and just been like herb dip

108
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,769
or how many times has a security researcher

109
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:52,429
tried to report a vulnerability to a company?

110
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,850
Only to be shuffled to, like, tech support.

111
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,690
Who's like, oh, you don't have a contract with us. We can't listen to you.

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,570
Uh,

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,220
yeah, I, I think that's, but that,

114
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,899
that's an overarching theme to the whole story of the fact

115
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,079
that there are many warnings in many places for many reasons

116
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,459
and they are almost universally ignored and

117
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,380
it's, it's less so in the movie.

118
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,980
But in the, in the book, obviously,

119
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:18,239
like Marvin warns these guys countless times of

120
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,140
their peril and they never listen to him

121
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,769
-- and they usually yell at him and tell him to show
-- if they did though,

122
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,299
the story wouldn't have advanced,

123
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:26,529
which I think is also an important because sometimes you have to be

124
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:26,695
that,

125
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:28,065
that is true.

126
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:33,665
So anyway, anyway, let's ignore the movie and we can open up on Arthur Dent's house.

127
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:34,084
And

128
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:37,165
so whatever the, the plans are in the cellar.

129
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,725
-- Oh, no,
-- no, no. It's worse than that.

130
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:44,045
The 1st 30 seconds of the film, he smashes his head on that stairway overhang.

131
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:46,154
Apparently every single damn morning,

132
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:48,075
why didn't he put some padding on it or

133
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:48,545
a welding

134
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:48,875
sign?

135
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,725
Ok. So they, they miss this in the,

136
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,839
the movie, but in the book and the radio show,

137
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,959
they kind of covered the point that he is hungover.

138
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,970
But that's my point. Right. He should fix, he should deal with that issue.

139
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:02,750
It

140
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,859
does, like he's gonna smash his head every single day.

141
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,049
Normal humans will smash their head every day and they will never do anything about

142
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,920
it. And that's, and that parallels

143
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,809
our whole security industry.

144
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:18,529
-- And this is where I actually have
-- to do this on my parents cabin.

145
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,209
There's a stair case and the way it comes down

146
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,329
it's like an inch and a half shorter than me.

147
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,769
And did, did you pat it?

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,970
-- I'm actually, I didn't do that last year, but this year I am padding it.
-- You say

149
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,910
I'm gonna, I'm gonna check on you next year and see if you've padded it.

150
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,750
-- It's on my to do list.
-- I, I bet there's a 50% chance of you not doing it.

151
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,519
-- I'm doing it actually,
-- next

152
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,850
-- week
-- now you will to prove me wrong. But, uh,

153
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,869
anyway,

154
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:43,640
and

155
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,760
smashing my head

156
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:46,420
hurt.

157
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,929
But, but anyway, so the first thing I realized is

158
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:50,820
in when,

159
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,630
when Arthur Dent is talking to Mr Prosser,

160
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,299
who is the gentleman with the briefcase who works for the government.

161
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,059
And he tells him that the plans have been on display in the planning department

162
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,790
for, you know, the last six months or a year or whatever it was. And

163
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,109
it occurs to me that

164
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,869
this is how security rules work in most organizations we like, yeah,

165
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,480
we've got all these rules but, you know, like,

166
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:13,329
they're literally in the basement in a locked filing cabinet, you know, and just

167
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,850
use lavatory with the sign says Beware Leopard. Like that is basically how it works.

168
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:18,910
Vendors,

169
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,619
how many vendors have a security page where like,

170
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:26,549
you either know the keywords to find it in Google or you bookmarked it because

171
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:28,859
you know, some vendors you go blah,

172
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:31,769
blah slash security and it just works and there's a security page there

173
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,859
but a lot of vendors you do that and it's like nothing.

174
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:34,130
Yeah.

175
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,980
Right. I mean, that, that's totally true.

176
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:40,089
Is it, it's very much that when you are dealing with bureaucracy,

177
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,010
if you know the combination to kind of get through all the doors of bureaucracy,

178
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:44,630
you're fine.

179
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,825
But if you're a normal person you're screwed because there is no

180
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,505
way you're going to figure out what you need to do.

181
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:52,644
Which, which as soon as I saw that I thought of security

182
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:54,524
where if you know the security,

183
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:58,744
magic words and you know how to talk and to the industry and the people you're fine.

184
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:00,704
Right. No big deal. You can get anywhere you need to go.

185
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:03,505
But if you're a normal person who kind of just shows up,

186
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:06,595
you're doomed, you, you have no hope. And

187
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:07,945
I mean,

188
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:15,084
-- is that a bad thing necessarily because yes and
-- no, I, I think we, we do miss the, see,

189
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,695
I think it does lead to false,

190
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,369
uh, negatives in that stuff that really should be reported isn't, or,

191
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:21,809
and, I mean,

192
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,649
how many cases of researchers finding something and giving up have happened?

193
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,880
-- Well, we, we literally by definition don't know.
-- Yeah. I mean,

194
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,049
that, that, yes, exactly. But at the same time

195
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,489
you also can't have your security team inundated with pointless requests.

196
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:40,969
So it, I don't know, I think there's a balance you have to find and, and I think that we,

197
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,570
we tend to fall more on the kind of bureaucratic,

198
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,489
let's keep everyone outside except those who know the secret knock.

199
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,659
Part of what I've been doing with the DWF is, I mean, that, that's why, you know,

200
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:54,979
you have to use your email address so we can contact you and also

201
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,140
so long term it's like, oh, that's Tavis Ormandy or? Oh, that's Josh Bresser's.

202
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,700
Yeah, I will deal with him right away because I know it's not going to be very painful

203
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,020
and it's probably real versus, you know, like,

204
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:09,179
you know, looking at the CV requests. I mean, some of them are just

205
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,809
the terrible, like, just so poorly formatted or the information is so sketchy.

206
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,409
I'm like, I'm not going to spend two hours,

207
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:19,109
-- you know, trying to figure this out. Yeah,
-- I, I'm familiar with that.

208
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:22,900
I, I remember getting some of those but, but I must say, uh, if Tavis shows up,

209
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,799
you've got a lot of work to do.

210
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:25,489
Yeah.

211
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:28,820
Yeah. Especially if he shows up at like Friday at four o'clock.

212
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,440
-- You know, you're really up the creek,
-- right?

213
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,330
Your weekend is ruined.

214
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:36,900
But, uh, well, and even simple instructions, like I, you know,

215
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,440
you have to put in a working email address for me to, you know, be able to contact you

216
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:44,929
to be able to agree to the terms of use, for example. And like people fail to do that.

217
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,729
-- I mean,
-- it seems totally reasonable anyway.

218
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:49,679
Anyway, let's, let's keep on track because we've got a lot of movie to cover.

219
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:53,640
Uh So, so the next thing I want to talk about is the Vogons

220
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,440
are an A PT attack

221
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,239
where there is literally nothing you can do

222
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,789
and even trying to plan for

223
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,179
the

224
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:04,549
time in the A PT attack. It's the uh

225
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:07,580
well, spoiler alert here, it's, you know, it's the um

226
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:07,960
need to

227
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,770
say spoiler alert. We've ruined, we're gonna ruin this

228
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,150
movie.

229
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:13,260
What is

230
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,820
-- the
-- lady

231
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:15,760
Trisha?

232
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,369
No, not Trisha,

233
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,520
the lady that was the assistant or whatever to

234
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,809
the president and is like orchestrating this whole thing,

235
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,869
you know, the darker lady,

236
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,849
I don't think she's

237
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,669
does she not have, yeah, maybe

238
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:27,359
she does,

239
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,580
but she's the actual attacker. She's the one that engineered this whole thing.

240
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,900
The Volga

241
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,940
are just the tool,

242
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:36,479
right? They're just following the paperwork like literally,

243
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,750
you know, there's a destruction order that Zao

244
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,780
-- signed off on. Ok. But,
-- but regardless of who sent them,

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,250
the point is that the earth cannot stop the

246
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:48,059
Vogons no matter what they do.

247
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,539
And basically, unless you are in another, a PT organization,

248
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,619
you cannot stop these people no matter what you do

249
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,309
-- it. And I guess that's part of what, what makes me
-- think

250
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:00,929
you're going to have some employee that will take a $10,000 bribe

251
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:02,359
guaranteed.

252
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,169
That's my whole point. Right. That is the point is

253
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,940
anyone who has a PT is part of their threat model, like that's ridiculous.

254
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,630
It's like saying that, that, you know,

255
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,030
-- aliens attacking us is part of your threat model and you're going to defend
-- it as

256
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:17,369
part of your threat model.

257
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,890
But maybe you either assume the risk or for example,

258
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,450
you have compensating measures like, oh,

259
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,359
we're just going to log the heck out of everything.

260
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:26,090
So in hindsight, we can figure out what happened or, you know,

261
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,289
roll back transactions if needed,

262
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:31,280
you know, or chase the money down or whatever, right?

263
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:35,150
You know, banks are a good example of that, right? You can attack banks

264
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:39,010
and in many cases they have been attacked and compromised and then they just,

265
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,369
you know, basically, like claw back the money,

266
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,760
you know, undue like a great example, Ethereum, right?

267
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,599
The Ethereum uh Bitcoin style currency, right? They had that

268
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:52,609
situation where a guy found a flaw and like, you know,

269
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:53,840
uh

270
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,429
scored several, was it millions or tens of millions of dollars equivalency?

271
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,809
And they just essentially went, yep. No Mulligan do over,

272
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,349
right.

273
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,520
You know, we promised we'd never do this,

274
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,159
but we're doing it, you know,

275
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,419
uh revoking transactions or whatever. But um

276
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,390
yeah, and I think even more to the point though, it's,

277
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,049
it's the whole point of the bypasses is like, why do we do security?

278
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:20,159
Security has to be done. You have to build security into your product and your,

279
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,500
-- and your company?
-- That's true.

280
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,989
That's

281
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,929
-- true. You've got to build bypasses. This bypass is going to be built.
-- How

282
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,710
many places

283
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:30,320
like if you literally went up to them and said, like,

284
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,270
why are you doing security would have a sensible answer other than like, well,

285
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,359
because we have to or PC I compliance or, you know, some other form of because,

286
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,510
-- uh,
-- yeah, and, and, you know, actually that's one thing that I talk about a lot is

287
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,750
compliance is a reasonable driver of security.

288
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,950
There's nothing to be ashamed of to say. I'm only doing this for compliance.

289
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:56,489
Well, and like, as a vendor, for example, we have to do security otherwise, you know,

290
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,830
people won't buy our product.

291
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,859
I mean, that's the whole point,

292
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:03,599
right is when I'm writing up security features for products,

293
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,409
I will, I, I'm, I'm quite clear, I'm like, look, we're doing this for compliance.

294
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,169
There's no other reason. This isn't about goodwill.

295
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,640
This isn't about because it's the right thing to do what, blah, blah, no compliance.

296
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,210
We're doing it because compliance and then people relate to that though too.

297
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:17,010
Like, all right, we have to do this because if we don't,

298
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,669
you know, people can't buy a product

299
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:19,809
and that makes sense.

300
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,640
Whereas it's like, ok,

301
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,539
this is hard to do and I don't want to do

302
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,530
it and it's really just for the good of humanity.

303
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:27,669
So let's put that down farther on the list. Right.

304
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,239
I mean, that's what happens.

305
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,909
Well, that's what gets me about the whole A PT thing. Right.

306
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,239
Like by definition, you look at any piece of software,

307
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,340
they all have security flaws, they all have new security flaws, by definition.

308
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,789
Any piece of software you look at

309
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,390
is going to have security flaws,

310
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:41,289
you know,

311
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,090
and what gets me is like even like really dumb stuff,

312
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,539
like you should probably remove code that is no longer active.

313
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,679
Like that is one of the fundamentals of security coding, right?

314
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,219
Like get rid of dead code

315
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,679
and I mean, even open SSH got this wrong. Oh,

316
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:54,710
yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I

317
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,750
know. You know, and to the point of key disclosure, like that's

318
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:00,969
like they literally made a rookie mistake that resulted in a terrible,

319
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:01,659
terrible flaw.

320
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:01,929
I

321
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,239
know. I know. Anyway, now let's keep going. Uh, do,

322
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:07,390
do you have any notes before we move on from?

323
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,840
Well, just, yeah, that sort of that whole security notification process

324
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,950
and you know what it really reminds me of is like,

325
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:15,380
they, well, in this case,

326
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,119
they sort of intentionally made the notification

327
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,630
process difficult so nobody would kick up

328
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,969
a fuss but like how many vendors do that and it just costs everybody like

329
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:25,809
an enormous amount of pain. Like, that's one thing I love

330
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,330
with the open source world is, you know,

331
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,109
we're going to be moving to a model where every single flaw,

332
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,849
hopefully in the open source world gets a CV E and

333
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:37,940
that CV gets published in the official, you know, CV, database that mir like

334
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,500
the second or the minute or the hour it goes public either, like,

335
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,419
if it's public to begin with or, you know, once it's an embargoed.

336
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,880
So that, that notification thing

337
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,820
is trivial, you know,

338
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,219
and especially, like, because I just,

339
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,530
I know

340
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:55,455
what people spend and how much time and effort it takes now to, like,

341
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:57,864
monitor all of these open source providers

342
00:14:58,684 --> 00:14:59,015
and stuff.

343
00:14:59,585 --> 00:14:59,974
And it's,

344
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:02,945
you know, like when I found out, like, one of the firms I was working at charged, like,

345
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:06,034
you know, $250,000 a year for a basic threat feed.

346
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,244
I'm like, well, you know, wait a minute.

347
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,054
That's like two full time people,

348
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:11,135
two full time people can't monitor all of this.

349
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:11,835
Right.

350
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,854
You know. So it's just, it's,

351
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:17,885
you know, we're talking thousands of projects now, you know,

352
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:20,895
probably a core of several 100 that really matter everywhere.

353
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,469
But, I mean, yeah, these things are, you know, and there's a, like you look at the,

354
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,919
well, the Linux kernel is always my favorite because it's like, you know,

355
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:31,739
can you imagine reading every commit how big of a team you would be.

356
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,489
Uh one really smart person could do it

357
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,799
just sand.

358
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:37,489
I

359
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:37,820
know it's,

360
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,059
it's,

361
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,669
you know, that's, and anyways. Yeah.

362
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,229
So, I mean, it's, I just, I wish people would have more transparency and more,

363
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:45,609
you know,

364
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,609
better data structured, data collected data, you know,

365
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,349
that, that whole data curation,

366
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,239
it'll, it'll get there.

367
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,340
Well, we,

368
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,450
no one's really in charge of that and I think you

369
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,700
pushing with the DWF will have hopefully some fantastic outcomes.

370
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,020
All right. So the, the one other thing I wanna point out

371
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,799
in,

372
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,179
in, in the beginning

373
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,109
is

374
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:12,039
when Arthur is at the party talking to Trillion for the first time.

375
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,140
Uh they have a record player there and he bumps

376
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,859
on white like who freaking uses record players at parties?

377
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:17,630
Come on guys.

378
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,890
That's not believable.

379
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:20,309
Uh

380
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:21,750
I don't know. No

381
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:21,919
way,

382
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,520
no

383
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:22,859
way.

384
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,690
Were out.

385
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,849
Not in 2005 like,

386
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,119
well, true. Yeah, it was definitely going down the

387
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:30,340
toilet.

388
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:31,960
I don't believe it. No way. I

389
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,969
-- mean,
-- it's just one of those movie tropes, you know, I

390
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:34,340
-- know,
-- I

391
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,090
-- know
-- it's a guy at a party,

392
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,330
it bumps the record just as he says something.

393
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:39,770
I understand

394
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:40,979
that. I'm just saying.

395
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,630
Uh

396
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,599
Yeah. Anyway, anyway,

397
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,349
let's keep

398
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,570
one minor point.

399
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:47,960
So like do you have a plan for the end of the world

400
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:49,969
or even a plan to deal with your house being knocked down?

401
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:51,890
Or can you even find your towel?

402
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:54,109
Most people can't even find their towel.

403
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:54,419
I

404
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,359
won't have a plan.

405
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:59,119
-- I
-- look if my house gets knocked down, like, whatever,

406
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,440
the least of my worries is gonna be

407
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:02,599
anything

408
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:04,839
but the horrific event that caused that to happen,

409
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:07,479
which will probably be something outside of the realm of sanity.

410
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:09,280
Funny story.

411
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,829
Housing demolition companies have been known to get the address wrong.

412
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:13,310
I

413
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:13,719
know.

414
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,939
And you google that and it's like, are you kidding me? Like,

415
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,529
but I guess, you know, you're a housing and, and these guys literally are like, yeah,

416
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,108
we started knocking down the house and then we noticed it was full of stuff, but hey,

417
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,468
you know, whatever, we had the paperwork.

418
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:28,178
I know, but

419
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:32,409
I, ok, you actually bring up a great point is do I have a plan for my house?

420
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:33,568
And I don't know,

421
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:38,409
why would I me spending time on that is ridiculous because the odds of it actually,

422
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:38,649
I mean,

423
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,348
I might as well plan for winning the lottery

424
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,578
because I suspect there are two very similar events

425
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:44,338
and

426
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,298
granted,

427
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:48,149
I know there are people who plan on what they're going to do when they win the lottery,

428
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:50,538
but practically speaking, like they're wasting their time too,

429
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,568
although their time doesn't have a lot of value, I imagine.

430
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:54,838
So they're probably not wasting very much

431
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,219
and security falls into this trap is we have to plan

432
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,459
things that matter in ways that matter.

433
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:05,540
Because if you're doing pie in the sky security planning,

434
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,219
you're wasting your time.

435
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:10,790
And when you're at a, at a, you know, at a company you're wasting money.

436
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,420
If you're wasting time, let's face it.

437
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:14,400
Well, yeah, it comes back to that whole, you know,

438
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,589
why are you doing security and most places are not going to present, you know,

439
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,810
a report with, you know, what we're putting in what we're getting out.

440
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:22,510
-- Most don't even
-- know

441
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:23,449
is

442
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,209
most don't even know. Let's face it. Most of them have no idea.

443
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:28,739
I mean, that's the reality of it.

444
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,880
Uh Anyway, anyway, let's keep going. All right, they get on the heart of gold.

445
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:36,099
And do you know what the first thing I realized

446
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,219
when I started watching that scene this time?

447
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:41,150
And I guess I, I don't remember this from the last time I watched it is

448
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,750
they say the letter Z

449
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,319
instead of Z

450
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:49,479
because in all the other media I've consumed

451
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:51,219
around Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is,

452
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:52,000
it's

453
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,079
right.

454
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,670
ZZ nine plural Z

455
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:56,229
alpha,

456
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,359
which is the,

457
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,599
the, I guess coordinates of the earth

458
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
in the Hitchhiker Universe.

459
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,160
But because this was a Hollywood movie, they say ZZ nine plural Z alpha.

460
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,099
And I remember I'm watching it, I'm thinking this is crazy.

461
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:10,680
They don't say Z, they say Z

462
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,920
so, yeah, that's funny. I'm not totally not security related but

463
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,040
yeah, yeah,

464
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,020
that was stuck with me.

465
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,530
Oh, actually I did have one thing going back to the beginning, but

466
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,449
here's the thing, it's not so much. Do you have a plan if all the dolphins vanish?

467
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:26,630
But would you even notice?

468
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,829
I would not notice because I don't live anywhere near the water.

469
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,229
Well, and by that, I mean, like, you know, how many times have there been, like,

470
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,189
situations where people are, like, oh, yeah,

471
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,709
the I DS or the ID P went silent like a week ago

472
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:40,859
happens all the time.

473
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,400
Yeah.

474
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:46,109
-- Yes.
-- You know, I, I feel like that should maybe be something people like, check into.

475
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,140
I, well, no, people, people shouldn't do this.

476
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,119
You should have a system in place capable of finding these problems.

477
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,349
Like, if the ID doesn't check in for an hour, you know,

478
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,770
something's wrong and you should be triggering emails

479
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,180
and text messages telling someone something is broken.

480
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:01,900
Right?

481
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,280
Yeah. People can't do that.

482
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,719
It has to be machines.

483
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,270
So, anyway, anyway,

484
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,099
uh,

485
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,510
the other thing I loved about the heart of gold is the knife that makes toast.

486
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,069
Right. How did they get that past the TS a man? Like for real?

487
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,349
Well, the concern I have though is one side of your toast would be nice and well,

488
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,719
toasty hot and the other side would be cold.

489
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:22,910
You,

490
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,989
you'd have to cut a slice and then discard the cold piece and then cut a

491
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,630
new slice and then you'd have two very warm sides of one piece of toast.

492
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,849
So it needs to be like, sort of like the Doth Mall, the Darth Maul Saber,

493
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,390
like where it needs to be like two knives.

494
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:41,020
So when you cut it, you get both sides nice and warm and toasted. But on the flip side,

495
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:44,069
here's the cool thing for making peanut butter sandwiches.

496
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,800
You would have the side that's cold that you could put peanut butter on and

497
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,369
the side that's hot that like you could hold and put in your mouth.

498
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,689
So you get that like still nicely toasted bread warmth thing going on or

499
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,839
about that nasty melted peanut butter.

500
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,430
Ok.

501
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,949
Have you not ever put peanut butter on a hot piece of toast? Right?

502
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,910
It gets instantly super gross and runny and like dribbles at the side.

503
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,750
I have a handful of, let's say personality quirks

504
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,900
and

505
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,910
one of my personality quirks is that I refuse to eat peanut butter on toast.

506
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,780
And I have never had peanut butter on toast. And the idea of eating it revolts me.

507
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,040
So I will never eat Peter

508
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,349
peanut butter on bread.

509
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:25,569
I love it. I love it on bread. I eat it on cracker skirt. I eat it with pretzels.

510
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:26,599
But for some reason

511
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:29,619
my brain will not let me eat peanut butter. I

512
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,219
want,

513
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,010
I want

514
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,619
now II I, this is terrible twist

515
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:34,439
but now

516
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,319
I'm imagining some sort of like saw movie plot that

517
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,949
involves you eating toast with peanut butter on it.

518
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,479
Yes. That doesn't sound weird at all

519
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,670
anyway. No, I, I don't know. I've never put peanut butter on warm toast

520
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,609
and, and I

521
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:50,189
get

522
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:50,729
it,

523
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,260
I

524
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:52,199
can imagine

525
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:52,699
a

526
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:56,430
war peanut butter it melts. That, that's fair. Anyway. Anyway,

527
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,949
regardless

528
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,500
you're talking about peanut butter.

529
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm, I'm complaining about the TS A, letting me take my toaster knife onto now.

530
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,719
Which would be

531
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,810
-- the question.
-- It's a private

532
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,760
aircraft.

533
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,660
Spacecraft. Yeah, I guess it is. That's true. Well, was it who owned it?

534
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:12,469
Well, the government, but

535
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,550
it wasn't like a public transport thing. It was

536
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,209
-- ok.
-- Yeah. Well,

537
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,229
yeah, I guess it's true because you figure if you got, say a naval vessel,

538
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:25,890
I'm sure they aren't running all the, the sailors through metal detectors on their

539
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:26,119
way

540
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,979
stories where, um,

541
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,160
for example,

542
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:34,760
uh, where military units are being transported with all their gear.

543
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,319
And so these guys are carrying, you know, granted,

544
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,020
they don't have the ammunition with them but they're carrying things like,

545
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,670
you know, bayonets and knives.

546
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,400
But, and they were literally

547
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,880
confiscating like fingernail clippers.

548
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,280
This is way back in the day, like right after 911 when things were kind of insane,

549
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:50,560
uh, that,

550
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,489
but that's, that's all bogus,

551
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,260
that's all bogus

552
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,849
where

553
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:59,010
you have your insane list of rules and you're going to follow them no matter what.

554
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:03,290
And it doesn't have to make sense. You're just gonna follow the rules and,

555
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,890
I mean, unfortunately when you end up in security situations,

556
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,489
that's what happens because

557
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,510
it's dangerous and if you screw up, you're like, I, I followed the rules now, I felt.

558
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:12,930
Right.

559
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:13,729
Well,

560
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:15,109
but I also wonder because sometimes you can't

561
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,410
tell people why the rule exists like that

562
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,930
whole laptop thing in the Middle East on

563
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,900
the airlines that we discussed last episode.

564
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,329
Right. Like,

565
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,589
they can't tell us kind of,

566
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:26,150
or apparently they can't tell us what the real reason of it,

567
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,119
you know, for a variety of security reasons, you know,

568
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,619
maybe they don't want to disclose the source or whatever.

569
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,479
Ok. Ok. Yes. But let's face it.

570
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:37,020
If you have soldiers bringing real weapons onto

571
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,400
airplanes and you take away their fingernail clippers,

572
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,699
you're a fool.

573
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,859
Right? I mean, for real,

574
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,900
they don't need a nail clippers. They have a band,

575
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:48,310
I mean. Right.

576
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,319
But anyway, anyway, whatever

577
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,760
it, it, it is what it is.

578
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:56,079
Uh, the other thing I loved from kind of that, that whole scene

579
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,130
is the heart of gold flees the Vogons chasing them.

580
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,530
And one of the Vogons says, bring me the request to pursue fugitive form

581
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,489
like that. That is so great. I love the obscene bureaucracy.

582
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,900
They give the Vogons and that's the one thing actually in the movie,

583
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,310
I think they did really well,

584
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,170
is the

585
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,810
Vogons are way more bureaucratic in the movie than

586
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:18,560
they are in the book or the radio show?

587
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,959
Well, and see that leads

588
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:22,709
to, um,

589
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,170
sort of one of the questions or points I have where,

590
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:30,250
you know, they actually have a process in place for that.

591
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:32,569
You're like, no,

592
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,599
OK. No, no. But it's a, it's a made up story

593
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,119
and obviously they just make the Vogons overly bureaucratic in every possible way.

594
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,459
I mean, it's like later on when they're trying to free Trillion

595
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:44,540
and they bring

596
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:44,859
the,

597
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:46,910
the regular prisoner release form and they

598
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,569
needed the presidential prison release form,

599
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:49,280
which is blue.

600
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,099
Yeah, which they actually have a copy of I,

601
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:56,530
-- I made a specific note of that but that small office,
-- of course they do because,

602
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,520
because it's a made up show man,

603
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,640
they can have anything they want

604
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,069
as much as you can hate on the Vogons.

605
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,900
They did think through like pretty much every eventuality and have a form for it

606
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:14,079
except the the where Arthur goes to get the document, there's like 12 slots, right?

607
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:18,329
They clearly whatever, it's a movie, right? It's fun. It's fun and funny.

608
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:23,400
And, and anyway, the so, so also uh the next thing I'm gonna bring up is, is 42

609
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,430
where

610
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,260
I, I realize watching this when they cut to the scene where they show deep thought,

611
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,239
give the answer of 42 is

612
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,170
the answer of 42 is technically correct

613
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,050
because they asked a question and deep thought

614
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,660
gave them the answer to their question.

615
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:40,829
They didn't ask a question so much.

616
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,530
They did ask a question, they asked the wrong question

617
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,469
-- and well, they asked an overly broad
-- question, but but here's my point is

618
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,969
people come to security folks like us,

619
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,599
they ask us questions

620
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,449
and,

621
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,209
and I,

622
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:58,209
now I'll say these days I try really hard to ask follow up questions and be helpful.

623
00:25:58,459 --> 00:25:59,979
But I remember there was a day when I

624
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:02,119
would give them the answer that was technically correct.

625
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,880
It wasn't useful in any way.

626
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,579
And they were usually too embarrassed to ask a follow up question or

627
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:09,380
ask for proper help and they'd leave and I knew they'd leave,

628
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,359
which is why I did that.

629
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:14,810
And I think that's very common in, I mean, in the computer industry in general,

630
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,520
but especially in security where we're, we're technically correct all the time.

631
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,560
-- It's not helpful
-- any technical field.

632
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:25,550
Is that the correct technical answer also has a lot of nuance. Typically,

633
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:26,170
uh,

634
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,329
you

635
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:27,520
can

636
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,459
have a really, if you don't have that deep knowledge,

637
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:32,939
you don't get that nuance.

638
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,040
That is true. I won't just

639
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:35,589
with that.

640
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:38,770
So, you know, I do the same thing too now where somebody asks me a question.

641
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,589
I'm like, wait, what, what, like, what's really going on?

642
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,979
Like, what are you really trying to ask? What's the problem?

643
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:44,540
Yeah.

644
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,150
Like I hear the question you formulated,

645
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,089
but I've heard that question before and I know how this conversation ends.

646
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:50,640
So let's try something different.

647
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,209
Now, actually, you know,

648
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,349
it's really funny is I'm having a lot of conversations like

649
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,750
that now where I'll talk to certain customers and whatnot.

650
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,319
And let's say

651
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:56,939
I need Kos

652
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:57,979
authentication.

653
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,619
And the first thing I say is Kos

654
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:03,859
is rarely the right answer to any question. What are you actually trying to do?

655
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,569
And it turns out they need active directory

656
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:07,349
support and they found it like it works with

657
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:10,280
Kos. I'm like, ok, there's better ways to do this. Like

658
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,819
Kos is terrible. We don't want to use that if we can avoid it.

659
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:15,040
So

660
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:16,500
anyway,

661
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:19,449
that, and that's one of the things I love.

662
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:21,410
Uh, so going back a bit, you know,

663
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,569
is the whole hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy book because we

664
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,400
sort of skipped them going on to the Vogon ship.

665
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,349
-- I think we should cover that a bit.
-- Is there anything?

666
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:31,369
-- But the thing is in the movie, they basically show up,
-- well,

667
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,069
the fact that they pick up Hitchhikers and don't

668
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,650
know they have people who boarded the ship.

669
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,310
-- They don't
-- though.

670
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,250
The Den Tracy did it in, in the book and the radio show, but they don't like,

671
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,689
they cover nothing of value in the movie.

672
00:27:41,699 --> 00:27:42,969
They, they get on the ship,

673
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:46,229
they get captured, the terrible poetry is read to them.

674
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:46,949
And

675
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,660
in fact, even on the, once you see the Vogon,

676
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,079
he's sitting on the deer that the Vogon said,

677
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:54,089
I forget the name of it and he's crushing the crabs.

678
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,290
And there is zero explanation of that in the movie.

679
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:58,849
But if you obviously read the book,

680
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:01,800
you understand that what happened on vogues sphere is the vogons of all.

681
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,150
First.

682
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,119
And the planet felt bad and made all these beautiful

683
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,030
other creatures that the Vogons just continue to murder and,

684
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,790
and kill

685
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:09,589
because that's what they do.

686
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:13,550
-- And, but
-- anyways, the, the thing I love about the Checkers guide to the galaxy

687
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,439
is, do you remember why

688
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,680
-- it sold so well?
-- Because it is slightly less cheaper than the,

689
00:28:19,939 --> 00:28:21,969
uh, uh, the encyclopedia Galactica.

690
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:26,319
And it has the words don't panic written in large friendly letters on the cover.

691
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,750
Exactly. So it's not us technically correct,

692
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,060
-- but it's actually somewhat useful.
-- It's not useful.

693
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:36,780
It just is cheaper and has don't panic written on the cover,

694
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,520
which in fact Arthur says at one point,

695
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,699
that's the first useful thing anyone said all day.

696
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:41,599
Exactly.

697
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:44,959
How often have we been in security situations where, like,

698
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:47,000
literally the first thing is like, don't panic.

699
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,329
You know what's really funny about?

700
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:51,800
That is a million years ago, one of the first jobs they ever had.

701
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,800
I worked with this guy who was, I mean, he was an old dude and this was in the,

702
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,530
the mid to early nineties

703
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,979
and this guy was already fairly old. So, like, he'd, he'd been around

704
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,250
and I'll never forget that like,

705
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,550
a server would crash or the network would go down or something crazy would go on

706
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:08,510
and I'd like, run into his office and be like,

707
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,689
hey Pete, it's like,

708
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,849
you know, he'd be like, hey, dude, sit in that chair right there.

709
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,459
You just need to chill out for a minute. I'm like, but, but

710
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:18,170
nothing works and he's like, it's OK.

711
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,209
We can sit here for two minutes and nothing's gonna break and I'm like,

712
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,250
it's already broke and he's like, then it's fine.

713
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,530
Right?

714
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,910
And I remember at the time I'm like, this old guy is crazy,

715
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,670
but now I'm like,

716
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,640
he got it. Like, you can't, if you panic, you fail.

717
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,810
Like, period, you end up like,

718
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:36,959
-- deleting the whole file server because you went crazy and type
-- like that

719
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,900
classic, uh, what was it? Git lab

720
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,000
where they, like, just, they had a small problem and they made it much, much worse.

721
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,229
-- They
-- deleted
-- all

722
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,640
of a snapshot.

723
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,319
-- That was a few hours old. Otherwise they would have lost like a day or two.
-- Yeah. Yeah.

724
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, that's crazy. It, it happens. Oh, man, I mean, I get it right.

725
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,339
I get why it happens

726
00:29:58,449 --> 00:29:59,260
anyway.

727
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,150
All right.

728
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,709
What else you got?

729
00:30:01,949 --> 00:30:06,300
-- Any
-- other? Well, 11 thing that was never really covered in the book or anywhere was

730
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,359
so, apparently the Vogons

731
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,520
are immune to Vogan

732
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,369
poetry.

733
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:11,510
They write the Vogan poetry.

734
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,640
Well, I could get the author not being affected by it but other Vogons,

735
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:15,400
other Vogons

736
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,910
are unsympathetic bureaucratic creatures.

737
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,270
Why would they be affected by Vogan poetry? They probably enjoy it.

738
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,150
-- So,
-- I guess, uh, what that kind of leads to is, I mean,

739
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,790
do we have any security measures that we can use to essentially punish back

740
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,270
guys or make their lives more miserable that we are immune to.

741
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,390
Because every time I've seen the security measure

742
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,020
they almost always involve some trade off of usability.

743
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,750
I mean, there's that classic thing of, you know,

744
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:42,040
like you have to have trade offs for security. I mean, that's the old trope.

745
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,790
Right. No, no, no,

746
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,630
there are no tradeoffs. Security loses and a story.

747
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,660
Well, exactly. Right. And that's the thing, you know. So,

748
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:53,170
you know, that old trope of, well, you can't have security without, you know,

749
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,369
somehow making it just horrible for people to use this, you know,

750
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,800
which doesn't work.

751
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,020
Um, I'm just, yeah, I kind of was thinking about that, you know, what can we do

752
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,609
to make security better?

753
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:06,180
That doesn't, you know, hurt anybody other than the bad guys

754
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,589
today. I don't think we can answer that.

755
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:09,890
Well,

756
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,989
a great example would be like gray listing for email servers right where it's just,

757
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,469
I'm gonna delay you sending the email by a few minutes

758
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,069
because a legit email server will then retry.

759
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,880
-- But like a spammer won't the spammers
-- just,

760
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,770
but that stopped the spammers for a while.

761
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,270
But now the spammers just use like legitimate mail servers to send the mail.

762
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:25,714
I

763
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:26,604
mean, they got around

764
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:29,905
-- it,
-- you know, that cut down on the drive by.

765
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:30,895
It did. Oh, it did.

766
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:34,005
And it was hugely effective at one point and I remember when the gray listing

767
00:31:34,015 --> 00:31:35,844
stopped working is when I stopped running my

768
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,255
own mail server because I thought there's,

769
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,685
I, I give up like you win.

770
00:31:38,694 --> 00:31:39,785
Spammers, you win

771
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:41,425
anyway. Anyway.

772
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:42,015
All right.

773
00:31:42,145 --> 00:31:42,875
So

774
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:46,329
if, if we continue on with the story, we end up on uh

775
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:46,479
wit

776
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:46,819
Woodle

777
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:47,760
Six,

778
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,530
which is the, I guess planet of Huma

779
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,979
Kula, which is the leader of, I forget the name of his religion,

780
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:55,119
but they worshiped the Great Arkels.

781
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,319
They're waiting for the time of the Great

782
00:31:58,479 --> 00:31:59,680
handkerchief. Is it

783
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:00,449
-- in the
-- world

784
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,920
-- of the Great Handkerchief? Because the universe was created by a sneeze.
-- Right.

785
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,920
Right. And they actually touch on this a little bit

786
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,800
at the end, on the restaurant at the end of the universe.

787
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,099
But they obviously don't, that, that's not part of the movie.

788
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,479
But, but anyway, this part I found really bizarre because

789
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:18,560
it, this, this story arc isn't in the book or the radio show

790
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,390
and they, like, show up with this planet and

791
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,050
like,

792
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,079
kind of goes crazy and they go down to the planet and

793
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:26,010
it's a bit ridiculous and it doesn't really fit in any way.

794
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,859
And I don't feel like it even adds to the story. Um,

795
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:33,939
-- I don't know, it's debatable.
-- The, the only, I mean, iii I don't, I don't like it.

796
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:37,719
This is one of the, the things I really hate about this movie is this particular,

797
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:40,619
I suspect they were trying to maybe do some character development.

798
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:41,589
I don't know.

799
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,079
The one thing I wrote, the one note I wrote from this whole event,

800
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,069
other than it being ridiculous is that the Bogans are worse,

801
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,670
worse shots than storm troopers

802
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,540
because they're shooting.

803
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,989
But then actually later on in the movie, uh, towards the end, let me,

804
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,069
let me find the note Marvin at one point says

805
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:57,280
Bogans

806
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,430
are the No, no. He says,

807
00:32:59,550 --> 00:32:59,560
I

808
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:00,900
don't know what you guys are worried about.

809
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,880
Bogans are the worst marksmen marksmen in the galaxy and then he

810
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,750
gets shot in the back of the head by the bo guns.

811
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:07,619
-- Well, that's how Murphy's
-- law

812
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,060
-- works.
-- I

813
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:08,469
know

814
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:11,829
it's Marvin. Marvin, the robot. Uh It's awesome. Uh

815
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:14,260
-- Anyway, anyway,
-- oh, actually,

816
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:19,180
so one thing I was wondering is um the background checks they did on Zaho,

817
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:20,229
right?

818
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:23,099
Because they can't become a president of the galaxy without background checks

819
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,949
and apparently brain scans because he had to cut out parts of his brain.

820
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,709
-- Remember
-- that's what they say in the,

821
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:32,670
the, the movie and in the book,

822
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,199
he wipes his memory or something like that and he

823
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:39,229
buried certain thoughts very deep and that's why he,

824
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:39,709
and,

825
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:42,709
and that actually ties into the total perspective vortex plot

826
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:45,189
arc as well later on a bunch of other things.

827
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,270
-- Yeah, that was missing from the film.
-- Well, it, it comes way later though.

828
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,109
Well, I guess maybe that was sort of the, the gun was replacing that.

829
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,589
Yeah,

830
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,479
that's true. The gun is, I think meant to be the total perspective vortex.

831
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,229
But you got to remember too, the hitchhiker got to the Galaxy. The book

832
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:02,234
is really like five or six stories,

833
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:03,755
five books of

834
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:04,795
alone.

835
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:05,244
So, yeah.

836
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:06,114
Right. Right.

837
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:06,515
And,

838
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:08,475
and so in the radio show actually does it

839
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:11,485
the last season of the radio show number five,

840
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:13,995
I think it is, they kind of go off the rails a little bit.

841
00:34:14,004 --> 00:34:16,475
But other than that, they stick to the book pretty well and they,

842
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:19,185
they rearrange a couple of things, but for the most part, they get it all.

843
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:20,175
But,

844
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:23,833
but anyway, anyway, uh the Vogons capture trillion, which

845
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,764
yeah, whatever, not, not, not a whole lot of crazy security going on there.

846
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:27,955
But I will say that.

847
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,020
So then they go to Vogue sphere

848
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,800
and this is where I think things get kind of,

849
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,208
I I feel like the story starts to pick up and,

850
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:38,879
and from the security theme perspective, there's all kinds of crazy stuff.

851
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:39,149
And

852
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:45,159
one of the things I love is the spatula things that hit you when you think

853
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:46,510
that

854
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:47,219
that's

855
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:50,489
-- feeding off the mind energy if memory serves,
-- right?

856
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,429
And the beauty of that though in this like

857
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,290
I

858
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:56,810
can so relate to this kind of from the standpoint of security is

859
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,469
when you're dealing with a ton of bureaucracy and crazy rules like

860
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,810
thinking is obviously not a part of that, right?

861
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,600
You you're expected you follow the rules

862
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,280
because you're supposed to follow the rules

863
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,530
and don't think about

864
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:08,909
it.

865
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,149
I

866
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,659
can't help but think some of our security stuff is

867
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:14,659
totally like that where we have these rules about,

868
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:16,250
oh, change your password every 30 days.

869
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,419
Why? Well, because change your password every 30 days. Granted.

870
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:22,330
Now I know n is, is change of guidance on that. You kind of get the idea.

871
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,780
-- It's
-- the pro part of it is, you know,

872
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:27,465
these rules may have been valid 30 years ago when they were

873
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:31,655
formulated for a specific subset of situations for which they were validated.

874
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:34,544
But then the problem is like PC I compliance, everybody's like, oh,

875
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:37,495
we're going to require PC I compliance even though you, like,

876
00:35:37,504 --> 00:35:39,304
don't process credit cards or whatever.

877
00:35:39,314 --> 00:35:41,584
Well, a great example, the European cookie rules, right?

878
00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:44,274
You have to notify people, you're using cookies on your website.

879
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:47,705
Well, of course, you're using cookies. It's a website, that's how that works.

880
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,074
So every single bloody website has that stupid warning now that takes

881
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:52,705
up like a big chunk of the screen and you got to,

882
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:53,574
like, get rid of it.

883
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:55,389
And then the best part is if you actually do

884
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,979
clear cookies and stuff every once in a while,

885
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,550
then you get it again and again and again and

886
00:35:58,669 --> 00:35:59,010
again,

887
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:02,379
-- you know, and it's just so annoying. Right.
-- Right.

888
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:06,600
And, and this is very, I feel like a lot of security rules are like this or,

889
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,370
or my favorite now.

890
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:07,620
Is, uh,

891
00:36:07,629 --> 00:36:09,659
everyone needs to run antivirus and this

892
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:11,959
is basically every compliance thing in the world

893
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,110
says you need antivirus on your servers

894
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:15,500
and let's face it.

895
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,219
I think Tavis has shown us like antivirus is potentially

896
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,159
worse than what it's trying to protect us from.

897
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:20,449
I

898
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,399
mean, for sure,

899
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,110
the

900
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:24,689
lower end level, which is basically all of it. I mean,

901
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,929
the biggest thing II I always come back to is, you know, when you ask people like, why,

902
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:28,810
why are you doing this?

903
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,810
Why should we do this?

904
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,340
And you know? Yeah, I mean,

905
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,659
because,

906
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,929
yeah, exactly

907
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,560
because I mean,

908
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,419
I is there actually can you actually even get antivirus for mobile devices?

909
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:40,169
I think there is. Yeah.

910
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,429
-- Yeah,
-- you can get these

911
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,489
terrible apps and they like kill

912
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:47,550
your performance and they don't really work because they don't, well,

913
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,939
you can get some things that will run his route if you let them don't

914
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,540
and all the other stuff just, it's, it's, it's garbage. I mean, I'm not gonna lie.

915
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,280
It's kind of garbage and it's the sort of thing people who use it are ticking boxes,

916
00:36:59,290 --> 00:36:59,939
let's face it.

917
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,000
They're not doing it because they need it.

918
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,620
And,

919
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,780
but I feel like there's, there's a fair bit of security like that, you know, this is,

920
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,090
but this is always going to be a challenge is

921
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,899
you will always have security,

922
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:16,129
compliance and security rules that were put in place probably for a good reason.

923
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,199
A long time ago.

924
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:19,040
But getting any of this to change

925
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,889
is very difficult. Like here's a great example is

926
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,600
I, I watched a TED talk one time from this guy who basically

927
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:26,969
he, he, you know,

928
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:30,169
he was complaining about car seats because people with small Children,

929
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,689
like the vast majority of them install their car seats incorrectly

930
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:36,989
and it's actually more dangerous at that point because the seat has

931
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,429
the risk of like your child flinging out of it in an,

932
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:40,179
in an accident.

933
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,310
So anyway,

934
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:44,350
what he did is he took like the crash test dummy of a two year old,

935
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:49,310
put it in various car seats and crashed, right? Got the data off the dummy.

936
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:52,969
Then he put the kid in a seatbelt, like literally just a seatbelt in the seat,

937
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,969
crashed it

938
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,969
and he brings all his findings to

939
00:37:56,169 --> 00:37:59,000
and it was some like safety organization that specializes

940
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,969
in this and he shows it to him.

941
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:01,939
They're like, yeah, all this all looks great, you know,

942
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,290
whatever these would all pass.

943
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,330
He's like that last one there. That's just a seatbelt

944
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,550
and they said, ok, that's fine.

945
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,300
And, and then he's like, what do you think of that?

946
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:12,989
They're like, look man, we know putting a two year old in a seatbelt is just fine.

947
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,479
But he said,

948
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,879
where are you gonna find any lawmaker that's gonna

949
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:17,699
be willing to talk about changing these rules?

950
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,899
Because you know, the first kid who dies in a car accident

951
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,969
in a seatbelt,

952
00:38:22,129 --> 00:38:23,860
people are gonna lose it.

953
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:25,889
Well, it's like the whole self driving cars,

954
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:28,800
we're holding them to a much higher standard than we hold human drivers.

955
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,459
They're still gonna win because they

956
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,570
much higher

957
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:34,800
-- standard.
-- We have these like self driving car crashes where it's like

958
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,879
the self driving car is just mos along and, like, gets t boned,

959
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,929
like, you know, somebody blows around

960
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:40,669
or,

961
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,949
you know, and, and people are like up in arms about it. And I like,

962
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:44,909
you know,

963
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,169
at least, like in theory,

964
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:49,919
at least the self-driving car has a chance of avoiding this, you know,

965
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:50,659
where does it can drive?

966
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,110
I've seen plenty of instances where the self-driving

967
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,949
car actually avoided a bunch of problems.

968
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,040
One of my favorite is there's a video I saw where there was a bicycler coming.

969
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,560
It was like a, an, an intersection, a kind of a four way stop sort of deal

970
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,550
and there was a truck next to the self-driving car,

971
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,260
but as the self driving car was pulling up to the stop,

972
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:13,340
it saw a biker way off on the left.

973
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,179
And so it knew there was a biker basically coming, pulls up and it waited longer than

974
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,139
it should have at this stop

975
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,179
as the biker drives past it because you couldn't see the biker because the truck

976
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:26,679
was next to it and it's like a human would have hit that dude,

977
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,100
right?

978
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,020
Like, let's face it.

979
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:31,489
But the car knew it was there and like, that's awesome. Right.

980
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,969
And if,

981
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:35,649
if I had to guess there are probably 10 to 1 instances

982
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:39,520
of self driving cars doing something better than a human versus them,

983
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,520
maybe making some sort of minor mistake.

984
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,570
And much more importantly, you know,

985
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,169
once they identify the cause of the accident,

986
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:48,949
they can hopefully create some sort of software fix or something and then, you know,

987
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:49,770
update the fleet,

988
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:52,790
you know, because it reminds me of like all these airline accidents,

989
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,780
I'm reading about where

990
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:57,919
something terrible happens. So they come up with a corrective action and apply it,

991
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,959
you know, and when they don't, it's, you know,

992
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:02,330
because there's this one classic air crash,

993
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,739
I forget the model plane but like the door would fall off from the cargo hatch,

994
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,100
you know, and of course the thing would depressurize and everybody dies if the,

995
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,939
you know, pilots really not on the ball.

996
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,129
Um,

997
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,639
and then it happens again three years later and it's the same,

998
00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:17,250
it's like the same investigator.

999
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,820
He's like, he basically, his response is like, God damn it like,

1000
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,669
yeah. Uh I, I know what happened here.

1001
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:25,209
I, you know, and like they were supposed to fix this and, you know,

1002
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:28,429
that time around the FAA actually made it like, mandatory to fix

1003
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,580
as supposed to like, please fix this. We think you should,

1004
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,520
you know.

1005
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,219
Um

1006
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,300
And I mean, that's the biggest thing, right? Because like, how many times,

1007
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,129
uh well, the fact that we have red light cameras in like a lot of cities.

1008
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,610
You know what I mean? Like

1009
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:46,649
that, that alone should tell you that people suck at driving.

1010
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:51,199
The fact that they can't obey a red light typically at a busy intersection.

1011
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:51,909
It's not like some,

1012
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,770
you know, I could see it like some rural intersection where there's like,

1013
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,610
no traffic,

1014
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,189
there'd be no economic value to putting it there because let's face it.

1015
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,270
The purpose of red light cameras is to make money.

1016
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,909
It's not to make anyone safer of any sort. Right.

1017
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:08,709
Uh, I, I would disagree a bit because, I mean, they do here.

1018
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,989
Well, maybe it's different in the US than it is in Canada with

1019
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,790
the, with the, the fine structures and how that money is allocated.

1020
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,000
Um,

1021
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,479
but the point is like here, I mean, there's red light cameras and speed cameras,

1022
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,580
they, and they publish where the locations are, like,

1023
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,719
they have to legally publish the locations even for the ones where it's like,

1024
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,719
um,

1025
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,000
you know, where it's the mobile speed enforcement, like the photo radar trucks

1026
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,820
and like, we know all the locations,

1027
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,750
like it's behind the stonehouse on the white mud and like on the pull

1028
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,310
off, you know, pull off on the,

1029
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,340
you know, on the whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1030
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:42,060
And yet people still, you know, get nailed by these things constantly.

1031
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:42,699
Uh,

1032
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:43,729
ok, maybe

1033
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,050
so.

1034
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:45,010
But the

1035
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,419
point is basically humans can't obey red lights and basic.

1036
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,229
Right.

1037
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:50,590
Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Right.

1038
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:50,850
And

1039
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,770
the red light thing, especially that, that matters. So,

1040
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:58,709
let's stay on this topic of self driving cars and when the

1041
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,600
heart of gold gets to me,

1042
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,280
they have IOT controlled missiles launched at the ship.

1043
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:05,959
Now,

1044
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:08,399
this is a terrible idea.

1045
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,719
If, if you

1046
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:13,159
have missiles, please don't make them auto.

1047
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,340
You, you

1048
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:17,419
kind of have to, to some degree because it's

1049
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:22,179
no, no, no, no reaction times are incredibly small in some situations.

1050
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:25,389
So you have to have automated systems that can just, you know,

1051
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:27,189
take care of the situation because

1052
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:31,310
I mean, what happens when you only have 10 or 20 seconds, like, you know, I mean,

1053
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,050
the classic example of this is the US

1054
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,189
S Finns shooting down a civilian airliner

1055
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,229
because they basically just, they didn't have the room to maneuver.

1056
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,629
So they're like, well, crap, we have no other option. Shoot it down.

1057
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:46,060
Right. They only had like tens of seconds to deal with the situation,

1058
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,820
which was a major part of the problem. Right. They were under that time pressure.

1059
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,820
And do you think an autonomous system would have done something different?

1060
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:56,709
Uh, well,

1061
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,560
I, I, well, it depends on how it's programmed.

1062
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,189
I mean, part of it would be the economist system in theory.

1063
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,989
Well, no part of the reason they shot it down, they got the time zones mixed up,

1064
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,110
-- didn't
-- we just talk about how bad software is?

1065
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,340
-- Oh, ok. Ok.
-- They had actual

1066
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,965
data that there was that flight coming out of that airport at that time,

1067
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:15,854
but because of the way the time zones were all screwed

1068
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:17,975
up because there were like three different time zones involved,

1069
00:43:17,985 --> 00:43:20,054
like where it was taking off from where it was going

1070
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,705
to and then like the time zone of the US S fins

1071
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:22,324
or something,

1072
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,004
they, like,

1073
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:27,165
basically messed that up and didn't recognize it as a scheduled civilian airliner.

1074
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,360
Ok. Ok.

1075
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:29,820
Uh

1076
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,439
You know,

1077
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:33,639
and also the transponder code, what happened is the,

1078
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:35,800
the military was flying jets out of the same thing.

1079
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:40,199
And so the guy initially picked up a transponder code from a military flight

1080
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,899
and that got attached apparently or something to the, like

1081
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,820
the civilian, you know, radar track.

1082
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,510
So again, I mean,

1083
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,000
potentially an autonomous system would have

1084
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,419
identified it correctly and been like,

1085
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:52,830
nope,

1086
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,750
-- that's a civilian airliner taking off on time.
-- Maybe I,

1087
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:02,709
you, ok. I don't know, I don't know, I still feel like autonomous missiles are bad.

1088
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:04,310
Well, the reality is, you know,

1089
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,669
weapon systems of the future are going to be more and more autonomous.

1090
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,219
Um, and, and again, part of it is that reaction time, you know,

1091
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,100
how are you as a human being going to deal with a drone

1092
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,610
coming in at you with a couple 100 ft

1093
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:17,489
away from you.

1094
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,129
You, you've ruined my ot joke.

1095
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,340
So that's fine. That's fine.

1096
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,310
And

1097
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:27,399
I mean, I, I'm not generally in favor of, like, automated responses because then,

1098
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:28,629
you know, we almost had World War three.

1099
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,370
What was it in like 1983 when the Russian, you know, launch detection system

1100
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:34,610
-- was like,
-- right. Right. It picked

1101
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,540
-- up something else and
-- thought it

1102
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:37,159
was, I think it was

1103
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:37,669
a,

1104
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:40,379
it was something ridiculous and,

1105
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,560
and luckily that, you know, Soviet General guy was like, I don't think this is real.

1106
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:48,340
-- Let's just wait a few seconds and minutes and see what happens. I love
-- it.

1107
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,459
So, so the next thing

1108
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,939
while they're being attacked by missiles is

1109
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,419
they're, they're freaking out and trying to escape.

1110
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,919
And Arthur says, why doesn't someone just push that button?

1111
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,100
And everyone's like, oh, we can't do that

1112
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,560
and no one knows why though. And he says, well, why not?

1113
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,169
And I feel like

1114
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,689
this comes back to our kind of compliance based security

1115
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:12,429
advice or rather just old security advice maybe is,

1116
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:15,610
you know, people will say things like,

1117
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,199
well, you need to change your password every 30 days or 60 days.

1118
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:20,729
And you could say, well, well, why?

1119
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,050
And they don't know, right. They, they don't know. And

1120
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:26,139
I guess the

1121
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:29,689
attacker is gonna sniff your password and then, like,

1122
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,929
wait for 90 days to use it.

1123
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,449
Well, they're gonna use it, like, right away,

1124
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:37,010
the bigger problem is just that people change your password a lot.

1125
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,850
They either pick a really, really bad password or they,

1126
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,139
or they make other foolish choices around it.

1127
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:46,830
Versus anyway, the idea is we have lots of security advice where you're like, oh,

1128
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,870
you can't do that and then they'll be like, well, well, why not?

1129
00:45:49,879 --> 00:45:53,050
And we're like, uh, I don't know.

1130
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:53,949
And, I mean, this,

1131
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,780
this comes back to a lot of the discussions

1132
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,310
we have where we try to talk about security from

1133
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,229
a very practical standpoint and there's a lot of security

1134
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,209
people that will disagree with the things we say,

1135
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,899
but they probably can't back up their ideas with any sort of rhyme or reason. Right.

1136
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:13,290
Yeah. No, it's, I mean, well, even I, you know, I've stopped running antivirus.

1137
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,770
Um, and I do occasionally reinstall it, scan my entire system and I'm like, well,

1138
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,959
either I've got like, uh, you know, uh,

1139
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:25,360
like a root kit installed that is avoiding it or I don't have any viruses

1140
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,139
and based on the fact that I sold money in my bank account,

1141
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:28,800
you know,

1142
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:33,459
it would appear that, yeah, you don't, well, and, you know, more to the point, like,

1143
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:34,649
especially with on Linux,

1144
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,120
like,

1145
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,919
I know there are some Linux viruses but they're so rare.

1146
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:41,260
Like they're literally, you know,

1147
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:43,429
you know, what's really funny about that

1148
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:44,110
is

1149
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:44,350
I,

1150
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,330
I read a story about Os X last week showing that

1151
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,290
the number of Os X malware detections went up by,

1152
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,110
by like 1000% or something.

1153
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,590
Uh, last year.

1154
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:55,979
And

1155
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:59,189
the, the researcher who found this basically said look,

1156
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:03,229
I know this looks really bad but we're still only at like tens of thousands.

1157
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,590
And you got to remember like the Windows World is in the tens of millions.

1158
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,510
-- Like this is,
-- you cannot run Java, you cannot run,

1159
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:11,270
you cannot run.

1160
00:47:11,439 --> 00:47:11,620
These are

1161
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:11,810
such

1162
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:12,530
drastic

1163
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,669
Microsoft office again, Microsoft Office.

1164
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:15,560
I

1165
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:15,800
know,

1166
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:20,040
-- you know, if you're not running in protected mode, your bones,
-- well,

1167
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,620
shouldn't we all just be using like office 365 now?

1168
00:47:22,629 --> 00:47:23,909
And then it's Microsoft's problem

1169
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,310
-- uh that still installs like the clients on your
-- machine

1170
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:29,110
really

1171
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,780
haven't used

1172
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:30,969
it.

1173
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:33,750
I had to edit some slides for RS A and keynote,

1174
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,979
their keynote templates were just like screwed up.

1175
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,899
So I ended up having to use a powerpoint

1176
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:40,179
and yeah, it installs.

1177
00:47:40,189 --> 00:47:42,729
But what's interesting is for example, like when you do a file, convert it,

1178
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:45,469
like ships it off to Microsoft to convert the file and then ships

1179
00:47:45,479 --> 00:47:47,679
it back to you like it doesn't do it on the local system.

1180
00:47:47,689 --> 00:47:48,189
And I'm like,

1181
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:49,780
all right then.

1182
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,389
So there's a local client and it does some stuff in the

1183
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,020
-- why not just do like
-- Google?

1184
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,060
And when I say a local client, like, you know,

1185
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,139
it's still like a couple 100 megabytes of installed stuff,

1186
00:48:01,399 --> 00:48:04,139
right? But there's a lot of stuff that goes on in the cloud that seems

1187
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:04,959
bonkers.

1188
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:08,530
Well, it makes sense because you wanna be able to have, I mean, here's the problem,

1189
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:08,649
right?

1190
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:12,709
People will, is still need or want but maybe need even

1191
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,070
that full offline working experience.

1192
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,350
Yeah, but like you can still do that. I mean Google Docs has offline mode,

1193
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,050
right? But we're talking about stuff like Excel and powerpoint where you have like

1194
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,919
97 billion features of which like,

1195
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,050
you know, a 0.03% of people use that feature.

1196
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,409
But it's like, you know, all the different people use

1197
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:32,800
may

1198
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,060
maybe that's fair.

1199
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:35,399
I,

1200
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:37,250
I admit that's one of the things I love about the Google

1201
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,530
Docs experience is it doesn't have very many features because I,

1202
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:44,129
-- I like, I'm really bad at word and I, I use
-- like three things

1203
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:47,409
and I look at the rest of the interface and I'm like, I don't even know what that does.

1204
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:50,229
You know, like I know how to use like drop down filters and like,

1205
00:48:51,149 --> 00:48:51,939
you know, you know,

1206
00:48:51,949 --> 00:48:55,530
what's actually really funny about that is my wife is really good at spreadsheets.

1207
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:55,850
She,

1208
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,570
she got all this training in college and she took all

1209
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,320
these classes and stuff and it was like a huge deal

1210
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:02,330
and

1211
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,110
every now and then I'll ask her for help.

1212
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,129
But like, usually I just write a pearl script, it does whatever I need it to do it,

1213
00:49:09,189 --> 00:49:11,129
it like reads in a CS V file,

1214
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:12,760
it does what I need done and then it outputs

1215
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,149
a CS V file and then I just reimport that file

1216
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,979
and it's really funny because every now and then she'd be like, how do you know how,

1217
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,139
how, how do you have to set up to calculate that?

1218
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:22,149
I'm like, I wrote a Python script

1219
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,449
and I do the

1220
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:25,070
same with, like

1221
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:26,479
Ain said, and cutting

1222
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:27,179
her. Like,

1223
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:29,219
how did you make Excel do this?

1224
00:49:29,229 --> 00:49:31,439
And I'm like, I have no idea how that would work in Excel.

1225
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,939
I know the feeling. I know exactly what you mean. Uh You gotta love it.

1226
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:38,929
It, it, it's ridiculous. But anyway, anyway, all right. Uh,

1227
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,409
so

1228
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:41,320
the Mariia

1229
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,399
scene is also bizarre because it kind of magically shifts from Mariia

1230
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:46,340
to Earth

1231
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:47,530
because their

1232
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:48,340
real

1233
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:48,479
s

1234
00:49:48,939 --> 00:49:49,320
Bart

1235
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:51,370
Fasts threats thing was like,

1236
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:52,979
hi.

1237
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:56,840
No. Ok. You need to listen to the radio show and listen to Sy

1238
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,300
Bart

1239
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,810
Fasts, uh, conversation with Arthur and it's fantastic.

1240
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,929
They, they really screwed up the conversation

1241
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:09,264
in, in the movie, but on the radio show it's to die for. It's one of my favorite scenes.

1242
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:13,155
Actually, the way he kind of threatens Arthur with the late, the late Arthur D.

1243
00:50:13,274 --> 00:50:15,574
It's, it's very good and the voice is very funny

1244
00:50:15,784 --> 00:50:17,455
and just the whole thing is great.

1245
00:50:17,465 --> 00:50:17,645
So,

1246
00:50:17,655 --> 00:50:21,245
so find the radio show and listen to it and you won't be disappointed in that scene.

1247
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,209
So anyway, I can ignore that just because I, I have the,

1248
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:27,169
the happy memory of the radio show.

1249
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:28,810
But then, so, so they're on mega

1250
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:29,399
thea

1251
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,330
and nothing overly exciting happens and then they go to the earth

1252
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:35,330
because they're, they're making a new earth, which is insane,

1253
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:36,129
whatever.

1254
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:37,070
Uh And then they're

1255
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:37,250
gonna

1256
00:50:37,479 --> 00:50:37,850
finish the,

1257
00:50:38,729 --> 00:50:39,090
but

1258
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,689
that, that's actually like a huge point actually is

1259
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,850
in the original story,

1260
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:47,830
they were going to rebuild the earth,

1261
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,919
but it would have to run again for like 10 million years.

1262
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,149
And that's when,

1263
00:50:53,139 --> 00:50:55,030
that's when they thought, wait, we'll just, uh,

1264
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,010
Arthur Dent has the answer in his brain.

1265
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,729
We'll just give him a bunch of money if he gives it to us is kind of where that ended and,

1266
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:02,090
and, well,

1267
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,159
whatever

1268
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,239
and

1269
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,409
they, they kind of go back to earth

1270
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:09,729
and Arthur brutally murders the mice, which

1271
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,199
I don't feel too bad about it.

1272
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:16,050
-- But it's like,
-- well, they're just a manifestation of that. What is it like 13 to 30

1273
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:18,639
-- entity or whatever?
-- So, are they dead though?

1274
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:21,969
You think they get mad and like kill you or something? Right?

1275
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,899
-- Like, I mean, seriously,
-- maybe they're more forgiving than us.

1276
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:27,370
They were going to cut out Arthur's brain.

1277
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:30,060
Yeah. But that was just a purely practical thing.

1278
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,179
And remember they remember from the book, it was like,

1279
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,550
we're just going to replace you with like a whatever, a little script that says like,

1280
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,000
what?

1281
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,560
No, I don't, let's have tea,

1282
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:42,020
you know, and then, and that's basically like 90% of what he says. So, yeah. OK.

1283
00:51:42,149 --> 00:51:42,600
I mean,

1284
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:46,489
really, how many people could we replace with like 10 lines of dialogue?

1285
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,679
We're not judging by the fact that we have interactive voice response

1286
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,139
on

1287
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:51,800
phones. Now,

1288
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:55,260
I don't think we should discuss this because I think there's many

1289
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:59,739
layers of nuance and misappropriation that could come into play here.

1290
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,600
So we're just going to move on.

1291
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:05,860
Uh So anyway, we, we eventually get to the scene where the vo guns are shooting.

1292
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:07,399
Everyone. Marvin says

1293
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,659
Gans are the worst marksmen in the galaxy, which I love because

1294
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:16,750
if you had a group of terrible marksmen, why would you make them your, I guess,

1295
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,669
physical security,

1296
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:18,889
right.

1297
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,530
-- It's, uh, you know, the lowest bidder on the contract
-- maybe. I don't know. It, it,

1298
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:28,600
you, you'd think if you were over bureaucratic, like the bogus

1299
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:29,250
you

1300
00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:32,209
think about, I mean, haven't you read about like those, you know, these stories,

1301
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,800
like I know locally there's been, you know,

1302
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,340
there's a variety of officer involved shootings and like there's been cases where,

1303
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,290
you know, they trade gunfire with somebody and there's like, you know,

1304
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,709
50 or 100 shots fired and they, like

1305
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,510
the guy is not critically injured.

1306
00:52:44,149 --> 00:52:45,929
Well, ok, so

1307
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,310
that's a different problem.

1308
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,879
-- Well,
-- no, no shooting at anything is surprisingly difficult to do.

1309
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:54,530
Especially in a very high pressure.

1310
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:57,679
Well, actually you and I were just talking about this before the show is I shot,

1311
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,479
I, I was,

1312
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:02,260
we, we were talking about firearms and I, I shot competitively when I was younger.

1313
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,260
Like I've shot like millions of rounds probably because I was like, I,

1314
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:10,899
I was in AAA team that we would shoot 22 rifles at targets.

1315
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,850
And like, I, I've got a box full of trophies. Actually, I was really good at it.

1316
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,510
But anyway, uh,

1317
00:53:16,729 --> 00:53:17,590
the deal is though,

1318
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,590
one of the things you have to learn to do is how to basically calm yourself.

1319
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,709
So your heart's beating very slowly because obviously, if your heart beats,

1320
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:24,530
you can't shoot

1321
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:28,419
and you got to think when you're in a situation like that where things are crazy,

1322
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:29,780
your heart's going nuts,

1323
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,280
you can't shoot straight and honestly hitting a

1324
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:35,300
moving target is insanely difficult to do.

1325
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:38,159
Even if you're like fully prepared and rested.

1326
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,000
Now add in chaos, I get it right. I

1327
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:41,770
-- understand
-- shooting

1328
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:42,889
back at you.

1329
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:43,620
Well,

1330
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:47,030
that's true. I, I've never been in that situation. Right. I've only ever shot a cave.

1331
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,439
So,

1332
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:52,699
so anyway, iii I can, I can forgive that. Right. But,

1333
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,350
uh, anyway, anyway, Bogans are terrible.

1334
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,979
Uh, I love the part where Marvin shoots all the vo

1335
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,290
guns with the prospective gun

1336
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:01,610
and they are like start

1337
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:01,949
point

1338
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,489
of on the ground,

1339
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:04,469
-- the
-- point,

1340
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:04,610
the point of

1341
00:54:04,929 --> 00:54:04,959
view,

1342
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:05,830
not

1343
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,540
that

1344
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:06,979
I was

1345
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,550
going to say we need the point of view gun,

1346
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,209
not so much because we need to make people see security,

1347
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:13,050
-- but
-- we need to understand them.

1348
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:14,800
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah, exactly.

1349
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,290
Like,

1350
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,270
-- seriously
-- we need like normal people to shoot

1351
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,340
the whole security industry with the point of

1352
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:24,120
view gun so we can grasp their frustrations with us and what the actual problems are.

1353
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:25,260
Uh,

1354
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:29,739
yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I love that, that part I actually did enjoy

1355
00:54:29,879 --> 00:54:30,350
and,

1356
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:31,790
and I must say that

1357
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:34,310
Ellen Rickman doing Marvin's voice is awesome.

1358
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,840
I love Ellen Rickman and I love Marvin. And

1359
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:37,590
again,

1360
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,610
not that I, I feel that, that I keep bringing this up, but the

1361
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,550
Marvin in the radio show is

1362
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:45,969
unbelievably awesome. He makes the radio show

1363
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,229
and in the movie, he was kind of minor, honestly.

1364
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,189
Well, he plays a reasonably big role.

1365
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:54,300
I mean, without him, they, they wouldn't have gotten anywhere.

1366
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,899
I mean, he's a much better driver.

1367
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,800
You remember in the escape pod

1368
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:00,780
and, you know, with his hand and all that. But, um,

1369
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:03,399
the other thing, uh, going back to that scene where, you know,

1370
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:05,620
Marvin shoots all of the, uh, the

1371
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,709
Vogons just before it, remember there was a group of

1372
00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:09,149
Vogons coming around the back

1373
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,689
and, um, yes,

1374
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,389
uh, Ford Prefect charges them with his towels doing his little war cry.

1375
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:15,360
And I mean,

1376
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,489
and I think that's a really important point is like

1377
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,429
you have to be able to actually identify real threats,

1378
00:55:20,439 --> 00:55:20,580
you know?

1379
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,070
Not. Oh my God. Oh, what was it? Oh, yeah, he's got a towel run away.

1380
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,229
Now, realistically speaking, if you actually read the books,

1381
00:55:27,649 --> 00:55:31,479
the towels can have some pretty significant powers, you know, like his,

1382
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:32,979
for example, has it soaked in my,

1383
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:36,770
for nutrients and it's got some wires threaded into it for strength and some other,

1384
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,570
you know, things and

1385
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:41,129
you can apparently buy specialty towels with, you know, various other things.

1386
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:43,300
So, you know, I think

1387
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,010
that

1388
00:55:44,209 --> 00:55:47,020
the towel could be a realistic threat in that universe.

1389
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:52,870
But, um, that's one thing I look at, you know, in our infosec is like people, you know,

1390
00:55:52,879 --> 00:55:53,919
a perfect example.

1391
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:55,010
Oh, here's a great example

1392
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:59,659
tying back to passwords. Uh, do you remember a few weeks ago or two weeks ago?

1393
00:55:59,669 --> 00:56:02,310
Somebody threatened to, like, wipe a Bajillion Apple

1394
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:04,580
account if they weren't paid a ransom.

1395
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:07,790
And did you hear what the real deal on that is?

1396
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:08,949
I did not.

1397
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:16,270
So they have a password dump from like a bunch of other stuff of which some are valid

1398
00:56:16,429 --> 00:56:17,290
icloud accounts

1399
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:18,199
of

1400
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:18,419
which

1401
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,080
reused

1402
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:24,790
their password and of those. Oh, certainly. Like, if you've reused your password

1403
00:56:25,229 --> 00:56:27,649
and it's been dumped elsewhere for sure. Yeah, somebody can get into your

1404
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:28,330
icloud and like

1405
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,239
from orbit,

1406
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,010
assuming you don't have two fa enabled which, you know,

1407
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:34,479
Apple is becoming more and more aggressive about,

1408
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,209
you know, like I just set up a new ipad for my son

1409
00:56:37,629 --> 00:56:40,250
and it, like, make, like, I don't want to use two fa on it. Right.

1410
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,620
Because he's, you know, it would just be frustrating for him.

1411
00:56:42,629 --> 00:56:44,449
Um, and you know, his kids' ipad,

1412
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,679
uh, you know, and I had to make sure, you know, that thing didn't get enabled and,

1413
00:56:48,979 --> 00:56:49,540
um,

1414
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,469
you know, that's the thing and, and, and then the guy pointed out, you know,

1415
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,360
that Apple too has this list of

1416
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,800
accounts and apparently they're taking proactive measures,

1417
00:56:56,979 --> 00:56:57,500
you know,

1418
00:56:57,669 --> 00:57:00,679
maybe making people change their accounts or whatever.

1419
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,639
Um,

1420
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,959
but yeah, I mean, and that's the thing that really gets me is, you know,

1421
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:07,820
how often do we correctly identify the real threats?

1422
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:08,179
You know,

1423
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:10,969
just what always gets me about PC I compliance is every

1424
00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:13,800
time there's been a major data breach of credit card info,

1425
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,139
they've always been at places that were PC I certified.

1426
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,360
Yeah. I mean, that's everywhere with credit cards is generally certified.

1427
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:22,879
It's,

1428
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:25,540
it's complicated how it all works together and I

1429
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,139
don't think it's a huge surprise to anyone that

1430
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,239
PC I compliance isn't a magic bullet.

1431
00:57:31,429 --> 00:57:34,100
Now, the one thing I would, I would say though is

1432
00:57:34,419 --> 00:57:37,590
imagine what a lot of these organizations would look like if they

1433
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,080
didn't have a PC I auditor demanding they make certain changes.

1434
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,469
It would be a total train wreck.

1435
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,189
Yeah.

1436
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:47,689
Well, like back to that, what was it? Uh, the Dutch one, I wanna say, digi

1437
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:49,840
Notar where they had like the viruses on their, you know,

1438
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:52,800
that certificate authority was like a workstation on the internet

1439
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:52,949
and

1440
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:53,719
stuff.

1441
00:57:53,729 --> 00:57:58,239
I mean, how many, how many times have you heard about, like flash drives or other gear

1442
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,919
that ship the viruses on it?

1443
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,939
Because they're using literally someone's computer

1444
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,159
to provision the software. It's crazy.

1445
00:58:06,669 --> 00:58:10,820
Well, yeah, the manufactures those digital picture frames that ship to the virus.

1446
00:58:11,379 --> 00:58:14,959
Well, no, the phones now that are shipping the Android phones that are shipping with

1447
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:16,429
pre

1448
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,020
installed.

1449
00:58:17,169 --> 00:58:17,179
I

1450
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,260
-- know. Yeah,
-- like that

1451
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,610
was a couple of weeks ago and it's,

1452
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,719
they still haven't pinpointed where in the supply chain that's happening

1453
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:23,500
to

1454
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:24,560
me. I mean,

1455
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:25,520
I,

1456
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:26,929
I own

1457
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,719
one of the phone.

1458
00:58:27,729 --> 00:58:29,860
The phone I have isn't on the list,

1459
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:33,540
but it's part of that supply chain which is like horrifying to me.

1460
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:34,870
Yeah.

1461
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,300
-- No, it's um, II, I can't tell you like,
-- you

1462
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,199
-- know
-- what this reminds me of.

1463
00:58:39,209 --> 00:58:42,689
I don't remember if I've ever told this story before on the podcast and if I haven't,

1464
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:43,969
I'm sure I'll tell it again

1465
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:44,840
is

1466
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:45,929
long ago

1467
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,229
I worked tech support in ISP and when someone would need the installed discs,

1468
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,899
we just literally made the discs off of the

1469
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:55,360
local laptop that the tech support guys used.

1470
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,020
And every now and then someone would call up and say, hey,

1471
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:00,320
uh my virus program says your disks have a virus.

1472
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:03,139
We'd be like, oh yeah, that's a false positive. That's nothing to worry about.

1473
00:59:03,149 --> 00:59:03,469
Right.

1474
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,290
And then one day, uh

1475
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:10,419
I was working on a Saturday, it was a slow day and I thought I'm gonna virus scan the,

1476
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:13,100
the computer here because I don't think we've done it in a long time.

1477
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,620
And I wonder if the people calling are calling because there's really a virus

1478
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:18,689
and there was really a virus.

1479
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:22,570
And so we, we basically infected like everyone's computer

1480
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,929
and, and I remember I went to the boss. Like, what do we do?

1481
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,929
We, we've been, we've infected almost all of our customers

1482
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:29,699
and

1483
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,520
we know this and, and the guy was like,

1484
00:59:32,899 --> 00:59:33,399
nothing.

1485
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:34,439
We're gonna do nothing.

1486
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:37,469
Just don't talk about this. I don't want you to tell anyone about this.

1487
00:59:37,479 --> 00:59:40,399
If anyone calls and ask you, send it to me. Don't, don't worry about it.

1488
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:42,489
-- And I have
-- to assume this is one of the reasons, you know,

1489
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,520
a lot of I SPS now offer a security package which is typically like a rebranded

1490
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:46,870
scanner

1491
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:51,669
from whoever, you know. Well, not specifically this but just in general, it's like

1492
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:52,729
now you can be

1493
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:53,040
great

1494
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:54,679
USS. We,

1495
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,179
-- we offered something.
-- It's,

1496
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:57,840
yeah, that's probably part of it.

1497
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:00,620
But I mean, man, I just, I remember that it was, it was madness

1498
01:00:00,879 --> 01:00:05,129
anyway. Anyway. Uh and that, that basically brings us to the end of the movie, right?

1499
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:08,620
Is there any, any other points you want to hit on before we kind of sum this up here?

1500
01:00:09,379 --> 01:00:13,000
Uh Well, uh back in the middle of the film, the one of the scenes I most enjoyed

1501
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:16,350
was the authentication scene between Zaho

1502
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:17,580
and Ford.

1503
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,550
Remember when they get on the

1504
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:20,840
handshake

1505
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:21,409
thing with the

1506
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,000
-- feet,
-- you know,

1507
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:24,459
the whole little handshake, that little authentication

1508
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,659
-- dance they go through,
-- you know,

1509
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,590
I mean, the world has had secret handshakes for a long time. Is it a secret handshake?

1510
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,659
I don't know. Is it a movie? Maybe whatever?

1511
01:00:33,669 --> 01:00:35,689
But you, you have, you have a valid point is

1512
01:00:36,189 --> 01:00:40,780
that, that would not be unreasonable to have secret handshakes and whatnot in,

1513
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,850
in an environment where you,

1514
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,770
I, I guess I had lots of crazy people, lots of silly things going on.

1515
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:47,469
So anyway,

1516
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:52,449
so anyway, here is II, I wrote a little summary here for the very end is

1517
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:54,780
so as,

1518
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,959
as I'm sure anyone has figured out at this point that I'm not a huge fan of this movie,

1519
01:00:57,969 --> 01:00:59,260
but I love the story

1520
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,919
and I suspect a part of that is

1521
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:06,500
uh a, a movie can't capture a lot of the nuance that a book can.

1522
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,679
And the reason the radio show captured some of it

1523
01:01:08,689 --> 01:01:11,610
is because the radio show is like 23 hours long,

1524
01:01:11,899 --> 01:01:12,419
right?

1525
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,929
-- They just like the
-- original, the BBC

1526
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:15,310
TV.

1527
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:15,899
And that's really,

1528
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:17,340
it's like eight hours, right?

1529
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:22,540
-- There was a lot of
-- content and that's true and that's true. And, and so anyway, but

1530
01:01:22,669 --> 01:01:25,620
the, the thing I kept thinking of as I was writing down my notes and,

1531
01:01:25,629 --> 01:01:28,620
and re evaluating what I saw and what was going on is

1532
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:33,270
I, I feel like security has the same problem

1533
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:37,860
where we have a book sized nuance

1534
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,659
as to how things work together and how we explain everything,

1535
01:01:41,669 --> 01:01:44,580
but we only have the amount of time of a movie to explain it.

1536
01:01:45,399 --> 01:01:45,969
And this is,

1537
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:49,360
it does. And this is one of our struggles is

1538
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,830
we can't distill a lifetime's worth of security knowledge

1539
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,949
into a one hour class or a one page

1540
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:01,070
like uh a little diagram or something like that. And

1541
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:05,820
this is what I feel like is one of the challenges that, that we have to figure out.

1542
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:09,629
And I'm not saying this is optional, we have to figure out how to

1543
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,989
tell people what they need to know how they need to know it.

1544
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:16,350
And I feel like in the example of this movie,

1545
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:17,850
they failed

1546
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:21,149
now, I it might be impossible. I don't know

1547
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:26,030
uh if I had to guess it's not, I think you just need someone who's capable

1548
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:27,780
of telling the right story.

1549
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:30,229
And in additionally, Douglas Adams is not a screenwriter.

1550
01:02:30,899 --> 01:02:32,550
So he might be the reason

1551
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:33,959
this wasn't very good.

1552
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:36,040
Lord forbid, right?

1553
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:39,040
But anyway, you kind of get the idea right? And

1554
01:02:39,179 --> 01:02:44,290
-- you're
-- also
-- going up against um you know, the, the the books just have, it's like the,

1555
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,870
you know, it reminds me of Lord of the Rings.

1556
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:49,469
Um But basically I think what it boils down to is apple pie.

1557
01:02:49,659 --> 01:02:50,929
Um I knew this baker

1558
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,050
who would not make apple pie

1559
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,050
just wouldn't make it.

1560
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,389
He makes Saskatoon pie, he'd make peach pie, he'd make all the other

1561
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,169
-- Saskatoon
-- pie.

1562
01:02:58,949 --> 01:02:59,750
Saskatoon berries

1563
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,090
berry to see

1564
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:05,189
you just gave me the technically correct answer.

1565
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:07,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

1566
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:10,270
Yeah, it's, it's much better than a blueberry anyways. Google

1567
01:03:10,379 --> 01:03:10,929
Saskatoon berries.

1568
01:03:10,939 --> 01:03:14,550
But the point is he would not make apple pie under any circumstances.

1569
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,449
The reason being is everybody was like,

1570
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,449
this isn't as good as my mom's apple pie and then bitch about it.

1571
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:20,479
So he's like, you know what?

1572
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:23,000
No, I'm just, I'm not competing with your childhood memories

1573
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:24,600
-- and
-- he's not wrong.

1574
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:29,969
This is a huge problem people have is they remember what they want to from the past

1575
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,260
-- and even security people
-- do that and even if it's corrected, it might not be correct.

1576
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:35,879
You know, this whole thing of like, oh, you know,

1577
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:37,699
don't let the Attackers into your network.

1578
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:40,399
Well, yeah, now we have this thing called platform as a service

1579
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:43,419
and we're gonna sell them access for four cents an hour.

1580
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:46,000
It's true. Right.

1581
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,209
You know, it's, it's,

1582
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,909
I like almost everything I've written uh at the meta level in the Linux

1583
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:53,100
Administrative security guide 20 some years ago

1584
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:57,310
is now wrong. Like it's literally now the business case is no, do exactly that.

1585
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:57,959
Like, yeah,

1586
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:01,449
let people install the software they want and run it as route if they want.

1587
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:04,110
Like who cares that they're paying us? Sure.

1588
01:04:04,429 --> 01:04:06,699
You know, let them have access to hardware.

1589
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,649
I remember Google talking about PC I fuzzing because it's like, well, wait,

1590
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:10,010
you know,

1591
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,389
we're selling access to GP US and somebody might hack one of those GP US

1592
01:04:13,399 --> 01:04:15,969
and then use that GP U to attack the rest of the hardware system.

1593
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:16,750
Yes.

1594
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:17,889
Yeah.

1595
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:21,570
And now, I mean, they're, they're overly altruistic compared to most,

1596
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,909
or maybe they're not altruistic.

1597
01:04:22,919 --> 01:04:24,379
They just have different problems. But

1598
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:25,840
you get the idea. Uh,

1599
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,600
II, I looked at these Saskatoon berries and they don't grow anywhere near me,

1600
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,560
which is probably why I've never heard of them before.

1601
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,959
I think it's only a Canadian thing as far. It's

1602
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:33,679
very,

1603
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,020
it does swoop down into portions of the US.

1604
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:40,639
But, but for the most part, it looks like it's kind of to the northwestern

1605
01:04:40,879 --> 01:04:42,340
region of North America,

1606
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:45,199
it looks like Alaska gets them too lucky. Alaska.

1607
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,129
Um, anyway, anyway, we've been,

1608
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:49,459
we've been going on and on about this movie for quite some time.

1609
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,520
Uh, fundamentally,

1610
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,449
it, it's,

1611
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:52,810
I won't complain. Right.

1612
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:52,850
I,

1613
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,159
I don't feel like I wasted an hour and a half of my life re-watching this

1614
01:04:56,169 --> 01:04:58,530
to take notes and talk about a security

1615
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,610
episode based on Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

1616
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,399
I'm not gonna lie.

1617
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:02,729
I probably would have more fun with the book,

1618
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:05,929
but it would have also been a 6.5 hour long podcast episode.

1619
01:05:06,229 --> 01:05:06,889
So

1620
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:11,250
there's that benefit as well. I mean, you figure we're over an hour now.

1621
01:05:11,479 --> 01:05:12,870
It's like the Lord of the Rings, right. You know,

1622
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:13,939
I,

1623
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,489
I could, I could go on about that one too, but

1624
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:18,209
other security themes today,

1625
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,290
there's probably some, I don't think there's a ton.

1626
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,250
It's complicated.

1627
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:24,979
No, we're not doing this is that

1628
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:27,110
-- you
-- go to, I think that's your new go to.

1629
01:05:27,389 --> 01:05:31,370
It's a very easy way to stop a conversation. It's complicated

1630
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,370
and people generally are willing to accept that as an answer I found.

1631
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,149
And so it's kind of one of those, uh, magic weapons, right.

1632
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:40,949
Where, where it's, it's, it's not unlike again, we,

1633
01:05:40,959 --> 01:05:44,260
we talked about navigating bureaucracy or navigating people.

1634
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,689
You can tell them it's complicated and more often than not,

1635
01:05:46,699 --> 01:05:47,830
they'll accept that as an answer.

1636
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:48,659
So

1637
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:51,510
there we go. There we go, everybody. It's complicated.

1638
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,469
-- Uh All
-- right, man. And it keeps changing.

1639
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,350
It does. I know it does.

1640
01:05:56,959 --> 01:05:59,540
That's what gets me like bank security is gone. It's complicated.

1641
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:02,780
But they've gotten to the point now where, you know, just bank robberies are not

1642
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:04,080
that big of a deal.

1643
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,260
You know, people would rather rob et MS

1644
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:08,169
-- for the bad
-- guy.

1645
01:06:08,729 --> 01:06:11,790
All right. I think, I think it's said to call it curry. I'm going to bring it home now.

1646
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,139
All right, folks. Thank you so much for listening.

1647
01:06:14,389 --> 01:06:15,570
You can go to open

1648
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:17,270
source Security podcast.com

1649
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:18,350
and see

1650
01:06:18,929 --> 01:06:20,919
there will be no links for this show because

1651
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,080
it's just about the movie.

1652
01:06:23,429 --> 01:06:27,050
But you can look at past episodes for example and get the show links on that.

1653
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,449
We will have links over to Twitter and Facebook

1654
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:31,489
where you can connect with Kurt and I

1655
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:33,330
and send us various notes Uh

1656
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:36,929
I'm sure many of you will have opinions about this episode.

1657
01:06:37,149 --> 01:06:39,409
Please let us know, especially Kurt.

1658
01:06:39,419 --> 01:06:42,219
He loves feedback and you can yell at him all you want

1659
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:44,459
and we will probably respond

1660
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,350
and I guess nothing else. Thank you so much for listening.

1661
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:52,489
Until next time folks take care and Kurt, you have a fantastic day. You too.
