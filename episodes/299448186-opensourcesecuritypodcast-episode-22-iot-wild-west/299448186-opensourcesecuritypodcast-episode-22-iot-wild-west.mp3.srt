Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 22 with myself,

1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,880
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:12,909
-- Hey, Kurt,
-- how are you doing?

3
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,600
-- I am doing
-- excellent.

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,469
-- So,
-- fresh coffee, fresh

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:19,100
coffee that it doesn't get much better than that. Right.

6
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:20,840
Can you imagine

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,440
being the guy that

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,360
discovered, you could grind these beans up, roast them,

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,159
run hot water through them and then drink it.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,930
So I read a story about that once about a,

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,029
I guess there was a farmer in the Middle

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,680
East or something and he noticed his goats would

13
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:39,400
act particularly odd after they were eating a bean

14
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,799
off of a tree or a bush or something.

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,090
And, and that's right.

16
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:45,759
And then obviously he did some investigation into

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,619
this because obviously these goats were getting,

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,400
you know, like hopped up on caffeine

19
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,349
and apparently that's how coffee was discovered, which

20
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,639
love altering their brain state with chemicals.

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,959
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:00,720
And,

23
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,639
and funny enough, I mean,

24
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,610
I've, I've heard it suggested,

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,650
I don't know how true this is and I've never done a ton of research into it, but

26
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:12,480
they believe that a significant amount of the,

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,959
um, I guess cultural progression

28
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:18,139
that happened kind of in the, the 17

29
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,260
1800 ish time period

30
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,040
was

31
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,040
attributed to coffee because

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:23,949
to that

33
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,129
people would drink beer

34
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,809
or alcohol was

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,930
right. That's also a depressant. So if you're all sitting around drinking alcohol,

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,569
you probably aren't having the live well, you're gonna have a lively conversation,

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,250
but it's about ridiculous things like, you know,

38
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,919
I bet I can jump out of that window and land in that bucket of water underneath it.

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,419
Right. As opposed to when you're drinking coffee, which stimulates the mind

40
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:53,370
and creates these obviously very, I guess intellectual discussions, we'll say

41
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,019
-- I can buy that.
-- I,

42
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,169
that I can't say one way or the other.

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,650
It's something I should probably read about at some point.

44
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,330
Speaking of lively conversations that are gonna stimulate people,

45
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,129
I think we have an awesome topic.

46
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:07,720
Right?

47
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:10,877
Do you wanna, do you wanna tell

48
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:11,158
people

49
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,708
-- about this?
-- Well, this is, this is related to, was it episode 20?

50
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,468
I think we discussed the idea of planned

51
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,578
obsolescence with IOT devices because the issue was,

52
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,699
you know, so, so some organizations, some manufacturers know

53
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:29,248
that a certain device they've created

54
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:31,218
is going to end of life.

55
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:31,899
And

56
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,839
a handful of organizations have done this like Google did this with a

57
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,399
uh what was it, was a nest

58
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,460
gateway or something like that?

59
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,850
And they basically bricked them all and people lost it,

60
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,059
right? People were, were very upset

61
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,300
that their devices were destroyed.

62
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:51,029
And so what this really got us thinking about is the fact that

63
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:56,789
manufacturers have a concept called Planned Obsolescence where they know

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,610
how long one of their products is going to last

65
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,440
when you buy a washing machine,

66
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,410
they know how long it will sit in your basement and work because

67
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,199
it has certain parts on it

68
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,639
that have certain lifetimes. And so

69
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,679
that also got me thinking then is

70
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,710
if, if a manufacturer of a, a

71
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,350
physical good

72
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,339
knows how long something is gonna last.

73
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,070
Now, granted, they don't know, to the day they know kind of like,

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,509
well, some might,

75
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:24,520
some might,

76
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:25,050
but

77
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,910
we'll say they generally speaking, don't,

78
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,449
-- but they know about, you know, this will last four years or
-- more or less

79
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,789
once they build it, they can't

80
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,070
change it

81
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:35,869
in,

82
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:36,059
in many

83
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,949
instances we'll say yes. Right.

84
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,990
But then they got me thinking. So, is that any different than an organization

85
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,869
bricking all of their

86
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,570
un, I guess, end of life. Gateways

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,470
one day.

88
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:53,389
See, and this gets into that. Do you actually own the device or are you licensing it?

89
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,070
That's a whole, you know, legal thing right there. Right.

90
00:03:56,279 --> 00:04:00,360
-- So
-- let's ignore that for the time being because

91
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,750
when we think about say a toaster,

92
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,720
you own your toaster, no one's going to argue about that.

93
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:10,710
But at the same time, the manufacturer knows after two years of use

94
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,580
or

95
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,979
your toaster is going to stop working or maybe

96
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,108
a better example here is is light bulbs.

97
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,220
Because as part of my research into this, I found out that

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:20,649
a

99
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,459
long time ago, this was back in the early 19 hundreds, basically,

100
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,570
light bulb manufacturers were doing an amazing job

101
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:30,130
and these bulbs were lasting like forever,

102
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:31,369
literally forever.

103
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,239
And basically, all of the light bulb manufacturers came together.

104
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,029
They created a cartel and they decided light bulbs will have a 1000 hour lifetime.

105
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,839
That is a spec we will build them to.

106
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,350
And so practically speaking,

107
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,970
they could build light bulbs that last forever,

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,380
but they don't because they want them to burn

109
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,619
out because they want to sell more light bulbs.

110
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,000
And I mean,

111
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,339
that was totally the intent and I don't know if

112
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,989
they were sneaky about it when they did it,

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,459
but it's very clear

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,829
that's how it works today.

115
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,380
So why aren't we all losing our minds over

116
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,329
the fact that our light bulbs are artificially constrained?

117
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,390
Is that the case of led ones? Because the ones I'm buying are like, I think $30,000.

118
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,709
Well, well, this is obviously old light bulbs. I'm sure the led s

119
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,940
they claim they're

120
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:14,109
having

121
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:14,269
to

122
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,529
change.

123
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:18,510
Are they going to actually be 30,000 hours or is that just

124
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,769
something they put on the box to make you feel special?

125
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:21,320
Well,

126
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,049
one thing I've noticed is I remember as a kid and

127
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:25,970
a young adult changing light bulbs was something you just,

128
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,250
you at least once a month you had to go change dead light bulb

129
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,250
right in your house. It's just,

130
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:34,250
that's just something that you did. Right. Like taking out the trash.

131
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,809
And what I've really noticed is when I went to CFC si, went to CF CS early on and,

132
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
yeah, they weren't very good.

133
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,899
Some of them were a little bit brown and hard when I pulled them out. And,

134
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,820
uh, yeah, I got rid of those ones.

135
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:49,179
Um, but I've gone to Led Lights now, um,

136
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,820
through my entire house

137
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,660
and

138
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:56,829
I don't think I've ever had to rep. No, that's not true. I've had to replace one,

139
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,980
one bulb. I've had to replace in

140
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:01,459
23 years.

141
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,500
I admit I don't have any led s but the,

142
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,750
the compact fluorescence these days are pretty solid.

143
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,500
I have quite a few in my house that have been here for many, many years.

144
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,470
I found one thing I found especially nice with Led s

145
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,760
they work really well at cold temperatures. So, my unheated garage,

146
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,649
you know, because like we had about what, three weeks of minus 20 °C weather

147
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,209
and CF CS

148
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,250
would take several seconds to

149
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,790
come

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,279
in

151
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:31,079
the cold.

152
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:31,679
In fact, it's been,

153
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,529
it's been very cold here for the last couple of days and I have automatic lights

154
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:40,570
on my garage that when it gets dark they turn on and they're compact fluorescence and

155
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:42,410
they look sad.

156
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,510
I use, I still use the halogens for my outdoor lights because out here, you know,

157
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,660
well, uh

158
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,570
Friday night, we had a cold weather advisor, you know, minus 40 plus a wind chill.

159
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,079
And, yeah. So anyways,

160
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,410
yeah, so this, this idea what, what's interesting to me is

161
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:03,369
this kind of incentivizes manufacturers to actually build a working

162
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,809
update system that can push updates out to their devices

163
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:10,649
because it gives them now the option. Should they choose

164
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,649
to brick these devices or to downgrade them simply maybe

165
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,809
not even brick them but to downgrade their functionality.

166
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,410
And then say, like, look, you want that new functionality, go get a newer device.

167
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:22,769
Is that an incentive? I mean, what's the incentive there?

168
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,609
Well, from the manufacturer's perspective, they can now

169
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,209
-- forcibly make you replace your device.
-- That is true.

170
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,010
But people will lose their minds if the manufacturers are

171
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:38,010
-- purposely bricking their devices, right? For
-- now.

172
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,660
I mean, this is already happening with the Samsung seven.

173
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,440
So we've uh the galaxy, what is it?

174
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,320
-- Sorry, the Galaxy Note Seven,
-- the Galaxy Note Seven.

175
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,470
And in fact, when we recorded our episode,

176
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,029
I said Verizon wasn't going to brick them and

177
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,480
like the next day

178
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,899
they changed their mind. So,

179
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,040
so apparently yes,

180
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:59,440
all of the Galaxy Note Sevens on the planet should stop working very soon.

181
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,160
See, and there's a good example, I'm guessing Verizon was, you know,

182
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,899
did their lawyers, for example, tell them, look,

183
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,880
you've been made specifically aware of a problem that can cause

184
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,850
lost to our customers even, you know,

185
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:10,859
kill them

186
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,899
and we could have taken action to prevent it and we didn't.

187
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,500
And if this happens,

188
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,100
you know, I'm guessing some lawyers probably talked and

189
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,380
I'm, I'm guessing that was part of the decision.

190
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,640
-- Well,
-- here's the deal too with, with the Galaxy Note Seven, though,

191
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:30,220
this is a device that is actually causing harm, people can get hurt from this.

192
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,058
It's one thing when it's, that, it's another thing when it's,

193
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,969
let's say I've got a, a media player plugged into my TV, that,

194
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,960
that Roku one day decides it's time for this to die.

195
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,119
Well, see,

196
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,869
and there's a good example is can I prove harm while I lost the function of the device?

197
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,278
So

198
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:51,268
instead of just breaking it, for example, um the Pebble watch is a good example,

199
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:51,379
right?

200
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:54,448
Pebble got bought out and they sent out an email saying essentially, you know,

201
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,028
we're gonna be turning servers off.

202
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,429
So your Pebble watch is going to lose functionality.

203
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:03,119
It'll like, for example, I'm assuming it'll still tell time at a minimum,

204
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,890
but for example,

205
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,460
maybe it won't show the weather or do your text messages or whatever stuff it does,

206
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:09,809
right?

207
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,760
And as a consumer, you know, depending on what you signed or what you bought,

208
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,599
what the user license agreement was and so on and so forth, you know,

209
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,400
because there's a part of the challenge is when you

210
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:21,200
buy a toaster going back to your early example,

211
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,580
when you buy a toaster, it, it just does toast.

212
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,919
Right? And that's not,

213
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,770
it's simple to understand and it's not something you need like a cloud service for.

214
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,400
But let's say I buy a smart watch.

215
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,200
Well, it'll tell time on its own. Sure. But

216
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,000
for example, displaying the weather, well, obviously to display the weather,

217
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,760
it needs to have a backend service.

218
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,559
So what if the company is providing that,

219
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,440
you know, so that line between

220
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,229
that line of functionality that's kind of based on the

221
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:48,390
device and based on back end services really gets blurred.

222
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,510
Yes. But now we come to the point of

223
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,669
if there's a device just like this Pebble watch,

224
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,809
I is

225
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:04,320
it, is it ok for the manufacturer to brick it on purpose?

226
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,219
-- And
-- I would say it depends on the circumstances if these things are catching fire

227
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,780
like the seven, you know, then yeah, there's a,

228
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:14,299
there's a strong compelling case for it.

229
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,380
What about your IOT camera?

230
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,299
That's now part of a botnet is, should the manufacturer be bricking? Those?

231
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,559
I would say it also depends on what is the remediation after bricking, you know.

232
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,960
So in theory with the Galaxy Note seven,

233
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,599
they brick these things, then you bring them in and you get a new phone,

234
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:32,869
right?

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,099
You're made whole like your, your loss is the phone and you're made whole, in theory,

236
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:38,159
by getting a new phone.

237
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:41,130
I'm guessing most of these IOT manufacturers won't break

238
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,799
these devices and offer you a new one.

239
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,830
-- But I don't
-- get a new toaster when my toaster quits working

240
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,239
well, but it quit working due to, you know,

241
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:52,169
um, planned obsolescence or whatever not.

242
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,030
There's, it's, you know, we're basically going into the trolley problem area.

243
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,359
Right. Is it better to take an overt action that does less harm

244
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,479
or to

245
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,280
be passive? You,

246
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:02,729
-- you
-- have

247
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:03,809
the

248
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,400
problem, I mean, there's a million variations on it, but fundamentally, the

249
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:07,580
only

250
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,659
problem is, is a, is a, is a,

251
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,020
what's the English expression?

252
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,710
It's a, it's a mind exercise to explore morals and ethics and

253
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,969
you know, these uh issues

254
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,510
and the problem basically states you have a train

255
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,429
track that uh splits into two different train tracks.

256
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,239
Uh And it's currently for the sake of argument, the,

257
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,750
the switch setting is set to go to the right and on the right track there is a

258
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:34,359
group of say five people

259
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,809
on the tracks that are gonna get run over by the trolley. Now you can throw the switch

260
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,909
to the left

261
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,390
and it's only gonna run over one guy.

262
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,320
So what do you do? Right?

263
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,809
Do you take, do you take an overt action of making this choice,

264
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,570
switching the track and you know,

265
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,570
being

266
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,320
directly leading to the death of a person or

267
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,210
do you take a passive action and not get involved

268
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,969
and allow five people to die?

269
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:58,590
But legally,

270
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:02,169
you're probably not in as much trouble because you didn't take an overt action.

271
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:03,250
You know, because

272
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,320
let's face it, most legal jurisdictions have the concept of,

273
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:10,020
if you take a direct action that causes somebody to die, you know.

274
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:12,890
Um, depending on what the circumstances are, you could be charged with murder,

275
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,260
you could be

276
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:14,820
charged with manslaughter.

277
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,640
You could be charged with reckless endangerment, you know, things like that.

278
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,539
But very few legal jurisdictions have a very strong framework for a passive action,

279
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,469
you know, outside of certain circumstances, right?

280
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:29,650
Like certain people have a duty of care like doctors and police

281
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,340
where they have to take an action or do something.

282
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,859
But, you know, as a normal bystander you and I,

283
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:38,369
we're not required to run into a burning building to save a baby.

284
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:39,729
We are not.

285
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,289
And I don't know if this is necessarily correct though because

286
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:50,539
this is closer to maybe an automobile recall where if they don't take action,

287
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,650
they're actually more liable than taking an action.

288
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:54,609
Right. True.

289
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,000
But what if they're, they're breaking the devices because

290
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:01,239
either there is no specific harm,

291
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,869
but there's the potential for harm because this device is known to be flawed and

292
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,929
Attackers can get into it and use it for a botnet,

293
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,349
-- but your device is not yet part of a botnet,
-- right?

294
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:10,679
And so here's,

295
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,729
here's my thought on this and I see this as having two parts

296
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,119
is there is if I buy a toaster

297
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,210
and it breaks in a week,

298
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,979
I'm gonna get a new one because of the warranty.

299
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:27,539
And so I think there's a certain amount of implied

300
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,140
life to every product

301
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,940
in many jurisdictions.

302
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,729
-- It's
-- quite, it is, it's very explicit in many

303
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,239
places. Exactly. And so

304
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,619
I think

305
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,109
there's that aspect of it and I think even if you buy an IOT device and it

306
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:48,700
stops working or even if they would break it in the short span of a warranty period,

307
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,940
it would be expected you get a new one.

308
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,580
But now when my one,

309
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,849
these things are also reliant on back end services, so I could give you all the,

310
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:58,049
all the toasters you want.

311
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,869
It's still not gonna display the weather.

312
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,830
I wonder if I can buy a toaster that displays the weather

313
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,859
probably we should look into, if not, I'm going to build one.

314
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,239
But anyway, so

315
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,809
the weather toaster.

316
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,929
Uh anyway, anyway,

317
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:18,700
so what happens though when we reach the effective end of the life of a product?

318
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:24,479
And this is where like you're talking about, backends, stop working or, or even

319
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,789
even less direct than that because obviously,

320
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,979
if the backend service stops working, you've effectively bricked a product.

321
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:30,419
Ok.

322
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,289
When you reduce the functionality or in some cases, like with the nest thermostats,

323
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,119
yeah, you've,

324
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:36,109
let's just,

325
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,179
let's assume, let's, let's keep it simple. Right? Let's not worry about edge cases.

326
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,039
Let's just say backend service goes away. Product is bricked. Ok.

327
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:48,090
So that's an easy case. But what happens when I have a product that

328
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,330
doesn't necessarily rely on a back end.

329
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,780
It may be like a video camera is a great example here where it records video

330
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,260
and then I connect to it and I can see the video. Right.

331
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,809
But now it's, it's five years old, it's 10 years old at some age.

332
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,169
It's still technically working,

333
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:08,549
but it has become a threat because it's joining botnets

334
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,219
and it hasn't had security updates in forever and whatnot.

335
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:11,409
And,

336
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,690
and in this instance, this is kind of where

337
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:18,789
a typical manufacturer would have their planned obsolescence kick in

338
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,340
and a gear in the thing that's made of plastic

339
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:24,309
would have broken and now the camera is broke,

340
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,070
but in this case,

341
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,770
it's all electronic and this stuff is gonna last for 50 years if you just let it run.

342
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,429
But at the same time,

343
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,799
it needs to die because it is harming society. Right.

344
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:35,960
Well,

345
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,789
there's definitely the potential harm society and I would say we'd probably

346
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,039
have to look at what happened to the auto industry because they,

347
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:43,419
they went through the exact same problem, you know, with, for example,

348
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:44,320
tire recalls,

349
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:47,940
not all of these tires are going to burst and cause a roll over and kill people.

350
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,255
A certain percentage will.

351
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,945
And I think that's part of the problem is

352
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:56,635
we don't have, you know what percentage of these devices are now part of a botnet.

353
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:59,335
Is it like 100% of the internet connected ones

354
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:03,215
without a firewall or is it, you know, some subset like 1%

355
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:04,315
50

356
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,070
I, it is conceivable that 100% of a certain device without a firewall is part of a bo,

357
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:16,099
I mean, I think you could make that assumption and be pretty darn spot on.

358
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,580
However, however,

359
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,340
here's the problem comparing it to the auto industry is when cars fail,

360
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:28,450
people die and people get hurt when your IOT camera fails, nothing happens.

361
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:32,700
Well, I mean, if it's part of a botnet, it could cause harm.

362
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,320
-- It does
-- cause harm but not to you, you don't see it.

363
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:38,400
-- That's the economic problem.
-- Right.

364
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,039
-- Exactly.
-- It's a network externality.

365
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,880
Exactly.

366
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:45,369
And so this is, I mean, so this is kind of the trolley problem of,

367
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,520
you don't know what the trolley is going to hit, but if you pull the switch it hits you.

368
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,400
Right.

369
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:51,719
I mean,

370
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:54,109
that's basically what this trolley problem is and

371
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,080
no one is going to flip that switch.

372
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:57,750
It's a, obviously,

373
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,359
you know, people are very

374
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,159
well, even basic it security. Like applying patches.

375
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,000
Most sites still don't do that very well.

376
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,520
You know, we're not asking them to buy all new

377
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,319
it every five years. We're just asking them to apply vendor

378
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,760
supplied patches on a regular basis, like Microsoft Tuesday

379
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,829
and how many sites don't even do that because that costs time and money.

380
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:18,839
Right.

381
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,719
That's,

382
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,319
you know, so we, we,

383
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:23,540
we provably have a situation where a lot

384
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,199
of people won't do the right thing either because

385
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,719
they don't want to or they don't even know what the right thing is.

386
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,349
You know, and this is, I hate to say this is one of the,

387
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,209
I think this is the biggest argument for

388
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,280
automatic updates is because the,

389
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,250
the vast majority of people don't

390
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,890
honestly know that they should be updated

391
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:39,520
-- to update.
-- Here's what,

392
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,260
this is such a weird problem. We've already wandered off the reservation

393
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:47,005
into planned updates. Let's make the assumption.

394
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:50,535
Let's just make sure we're very clear. Let's say you have a device,

395
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,364
it gets automatic updates.

396
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:57,055
The vendor provides automatic updates and five years from now,

397
00:17:57,064 --> 00:18:00,295
the vendor says we're sick of updating this device and

398
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:02,834
now we reach the point where if they brick it,

399
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,099
they are the bad guy and the villain and

400
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:07,680
everyone will hate them if they don't break it.

401
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:08,060
Now,

402
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,280
there are insecure devices on the internet that will say

403
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,300
join botnets and make the world a better place.

404
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,140
And so here's our trolley problem.

405
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:18,219
They flip the switch, they,

406
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:21,939
their customers hate them because they've just run over all the customers.

407
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:25,099
They don't flip the switch and now the trolley

408
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,660
goes off and ruins the internet for everybody.

409
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,449
Right.

410
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,589
My take on this would be

411
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,089
ideally there would be some sort of redress for

412
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,250
losing your device or it would be made very explicitly

413
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,280
clear at the start, this device will be supported by the manufacturer for five years

414
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,369
and then we'll say give you a six month or a one year grace period

415
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:51,010
and then it will be disabled at this date at midnight.

416
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:53,859
I think that is

417
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,089
a

418
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,650
-- right thing to do. But now
-- the problem is the companies that don't do this,

419
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,550
we have an advantage,

420
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,010
but hey, our stuff lasts forever because we never updated

421
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:05,449
it

422
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:06,630
right. Because I'm gonna go

423
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:06,859
in,

424
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,770
I'm gonna go to the store and now we have the,

425
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:13,569
the we'll say responsible company brand Iot Camera that

426
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,800
says it's going to quit working in five years.

427
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,329
And then I look and there's, you know, shady company incorporated

428
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,530
that has no such thing. And I'm like, well, I'm gonna buy the one that's $20 less

429
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:27,089
and will last longer because it's, you know, the buying, that's not my problem.

430
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,400
And this goes back exactly to what I said

431
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,530
last episode with around the used cars and consumers

432
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,239
knowing or not knowing that they have a good

433
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,719
quality product and being able to differentiate them.

434
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:37,829
You know,

435
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,180
the problem is the things that you

436
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:42,630
can typically actually see and differentiate are not

437
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,459
sort of the security properties or not those sort of fundamental low level things,

438
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:47,569
right?

439
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:50,619
It's more of the feature set. Hey, this camera is black and white.

440
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,270
This camera is color, right? Very clear differentiation, very easy to understand.

441
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,369
You know, this camera has more storage or less storage. This camera

442
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:57,780
uh

443
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,780
has an app that I can use on my phone to remotely view it.

444
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,040
Well, you know what that now means,

445
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,040
your camera is probably attached directly to the internet

446
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,099
-- and you know that that app is totally secure, right?
-- Yeah.

447
00:20:08,469 --> 00:20:10,180
You know, so that's the thing. I mean,

448
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:11,339
um,

449
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,459
do we possibly need some form of, uh,

450
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:17,760
I don't wanna say warning label but like a basic information label that says,

451
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:18,560
you know,

452
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:23,829
this device uses a backend service and loses x amount of functionality without it.

453
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,839
Or this device requires, you know,

454
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:30,239
not to not be firewalled from the internet needs raw internet access for whatever

455
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:33,199
that reminds me of Kurt is, this is totally like

456
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,939
one of those instances where when you watch an adult themed TV show,

457
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:39,880
it tells you like what all the naughty bits are that you're about to see.

458
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:40,369
Right.

459
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:42,839
That's exactly it.

460
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:44,069
And, but again,

461
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,880
it comes back to the companies that do this initially

462
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,989
will be sort of at a disadvantage because they'll have to

463
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,910
spend money and time on doing this.

464
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,020
And then, you know, they'll, their competitors will be like our product is perfect.

465
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:57,880
-- Ok.
-- So

466
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,290
until

467
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:58,640
we get

468
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,130
regulation,

469
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,760
-- let's
-- explore that

470
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:01,560
is

471
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,300
without any sort of mandated regulation and rules.

472
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,599
Do we think anyone would actually do this voluntarily?

473
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:14,920
It's tough because it's hard. I, I just,

474
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,849
I can't see there being enough of a market for a quote

475
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:21,630
unquote premium product with good security for that to actually be enough

476
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,550
of a business differentiator

477
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,270
for it to be worth doing. I would agree completely.

478
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,390
I would say

479
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,750
that this could be part of a brand,

480
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,170
for example, like the Google Nest brand or the Apple brand or whoever, you know,

481
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,829
these guys that are making hardware now and have, you know,

482
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,589
brands that are recognizable versus

483
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,209
brands that are not recognizable because I've, you know, they're,

484
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,530
they're new to America or the US or whatever.

485
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:46,530
Um,

486
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,560
what I would like to see is more, you know, consumer reports, crash test ratings,

487
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,349
right?

488
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,329
But is that something that, you know,

489
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:58,010
can realistically be done because even when you think about it, right,

490
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,790
the cost of taking a car and crashing it.

491
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,689
Yeah, it's expensive 4050 grand.

492
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,089
But the cost of paying somebody to audit a product

493
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:07,140
-- for security properties is easily that much
-- or more.

494
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,130
It's even more than that though. I mean,

495
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:14,430
even if consumer reports conducted a security audit on a product,

496
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,969
what happens in five years

497
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,380
when the manufacturer decides to shut down the back end?

498
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,030
I mean, let's use your, your nest smoke alarms are a great example of this.

499
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:24,949
Do you know,

500
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:28,319
are those going to self destruct some day because the

501
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:31,640
hardware inside is deemed unworthy of detecting a fire?

502
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:31,949
Well,

503
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:35,280
Google could definitely break them but there you actually have a device

504
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,939
where losing its functionality does put me at actual significant risk.

505
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:39,599
It does.

506
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,329
And do you know what happens because like they always say, you know,

507
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:43,969
you should have replaced your smoke detector

508
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:46,199
every five years or every 10 years or whatever.

509
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:46,780
And

510
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,040
there's a reason for that. Right. Because it has actual radioactive material in it

511
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,130
that decays and it becomes less effective after a certain period of time.

512
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,180
Yeah.

513
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,420
Yeah. No. Um,

514
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,800
one thing they could do, I, well, I mean,

515
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,650
and the thing is there's ways to break a device without actually breaking it.

516
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,880
Right. You could, for example, have an alarm every five minutes

517
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,640
and it's gonna be so annoying. People are gonna, no, but, you know,

518
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,400
so people replace it because it gets so annoying.

519
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,790
Um, you know, it starts, for example,

520
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,790
you just have the product send out an alert and speak every five minutes saying,

521
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,680
you know, beep, beep, beep.

522
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,650
This product is now obsolete. Please replace me.

523
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:23,010
And

524
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,550
in, in, in the case of a smoke alarm, I would totally do that in a second.

525
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,780
But now

526
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,890
if we have an IOT camera

527
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:35,170
it, we come back to that argument where product A

528
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,930
will, will annoy you until you replace it.

529
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:40,599
And product B just continues running forever as part of.

530
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,239
Exactly.

531
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,859
I think it's gonna be a lot like the car industry and pollution and that these are

532
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,900
the, the, the problems are largely externalities in that.

533
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,770
Yeah, it costs me a little bit of maybe time and hassle, but really not that much.

534
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,719
But being part of a botnet causes somebody else a huge amount of pain,

535
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,010
but I don't care like much like pollution

536
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,819
and I think we're going to need regulation and,

537
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,060
you know, part of me wishes that, you know,

538
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,949
these large companies would actually kind of lobby for some of these, you know,

539
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,609
sort of product labeling laws and stuff.

540
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,890
But I also fear then that by adding all this legislation and requirements that,

541
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,989
you know, are we going to lose

542
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,270
the new stuff?

543
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,150
You know, the cutting edge stuff that maybe isn't, you know,

544
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,260
funded by a company that can guarantee that they're back end will run for

545
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,050
more than a year or five years or whatever the legally mandated minimum is.

546
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,770
Right.

547
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,530
Yes, I think the answer to that is yes, it

548
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:33,989
regulation

549
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:41,339
-- rarely encourages innovation.
-- Well, on the flip side back to, again, to Steven, uh

550
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,160
you know, he's, he's talking about these fa uh what is it called in America?

551
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,050
The, uh the, the medical FDA.

552
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:50,229
-- Is it the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration that does the medical
-- devices?

553
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,550
He handled medical devices.

554
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:56,030
Um, you know, and, and that is a super heavy regulated environment

555
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,839
with really high entry costs and, you know,

556
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,400
but, but, and there's a lot of innovation

557
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,739
for what it's worth and this is something we should,

558
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,359
we should get Steve Christie on this show someday to talk about this

559
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,910
because I thought the medical device industry was very much an established player,

560
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,099
huge company sort of thing.

561
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,699
And it turns out that

562
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,890
the vast majority of medical device manufacturers have, like,

563
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,369
less than 30 employees and are super tiny.

564
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,250
Yeah. Right. Exactly. And so

565
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,589
how are these, how are these companies operating in? What?

566
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:34,510
Well, I, I guess what, what is, or should be

567
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:36,869
a heavily regulated environment?

568
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,150
Well,

569
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,969
you can have a lot of regulations and they don't necessarily incur a lot of costs

570
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,180
and, and in this case, they must not because,

571
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,469
you know, I, I'm familiar with things like common criteria and fis and those are,

572
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:55,329
those are, those are standards that incur massive cost to get through them.

573
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:55,589
I mean,

574
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:59,930
ignoring just the, the financial cost of getting it done in the first place,

575
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:03,140
there's all the development and everything else going on around it

576
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,939
that is significant.

577
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,920
Yeah. No, I think fundamentally things will have to get worse before they get

578
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:15,109
bad enough that people take notice because quite honestly,

579
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,359
you know, those, those denial of service attacks,

580
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,400
there's been a couple more that haven't even made the news.

581
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:24,530
-- Yeah, they just does it really matter.
-- Well, and that might be

582
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,290
the, the long term answer to this is rather than trying to fix the devices,

583
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:32,099
they just denial of service is,

584
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:34,989
is not a problem because there's enough bandwidth and

585
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,400
the infrastructure is built in such a way that

586
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,599
too bad, you know, you're not attacking the infrastructure in this way anymore.

587
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,199
Yeah, I also can't help but wonder, you know,

588
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
people breaking into these devices uh currently

589
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,500
are monetizing them by for example,

590
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,829
using them as part of botnets to do denial of service, right?

591
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,050
That's a relatively easy way to monetize things.

592
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,449
You don't have to be technologically sophisticated. You literally can go to github

593
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,410
and download

594
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:01,369
the, how do you pronounce it?

595
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,160
Mirror

596
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,959
botnet code and just like start using it,

597
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:07,150
you know, plug and play.

598
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:09,599
Um even even better than that man,

599
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:12,819
you can go on the dark web and rent a freaking botnet.

600
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:17,280
Exactly. So it's a very clear, simple path to monetization and

601
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,160
part of me can help but wonder and this is a show

602
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,400
we'll have to do is this whole cyber deterrence piece with,

603
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,589
you know, strike back capabilities.

604
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,800
So for example, if, if I'm getting denial of service and they're not spoofing the IP S

605
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:30,469
and I realize like say

606
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,599
80% of the attack is coming from this one brand of IP camera

607
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:36,380
that has an own flaw that I can use to break the camera,

608
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:41,410
you know, can I do that? Yes. Should I do it? I don't know ethically

609
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:42,760
legally.

610
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,869
No,

611
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,890
we I'm not getting into that

612
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,810
today though. It's the answer is

613
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:51,050
-- no,
-- can't hack back, hack back is

614
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,849
not OK.

615
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,479
I'm not talking so much about hack back,

616
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:57,089
but a very limited target engagement of this device.

617
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:58,890
And I'm just gonna say, for example,

618
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,319
turn it off or maybe break it or something along those lines, you know, I don't know.

619
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,189
Justice,

620
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:04,540
isn't

621
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:05,069
it?

622
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:05,880
It's

623
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:06,339
a,

624
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:10,650
well, but, ah, do we need justice or do I just want the problem to go away?

625
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,609
Isn't that the same thing?

626
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:14,290
No, this is

627
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,800
I,

628
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,890
if I can, if I can say, for example, like with

629
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,160
a

630
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:21,959
Mi,

631
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:22,790
how did you pronounce

632
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:23,410
it?

633
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,420
So, with the

634
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:26,130
Mira

635
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,270
Botnet, for example,

636
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,329
if I could say break into 80% of these devices and turn them off or whatever

637
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,369
and stop the

638
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:35,050
DDOS for an hour or a day or permanently by breaking them.

639
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,859
I'm, you know, I'm now happy because the D

640
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:42,119
-- OS stopped,
-- but you just broke into a 10,000.

641
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,060
Consult

642
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:47,530
-- someone else owns,
-- but these people obviously aren't taking care of them.

643
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,839
If, if, if your neighbor doesn't feed his dog,

644
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:53,369
should you break into your neighbor's house to feed his dog?

645
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,989
Uh

646
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:56,530
You, you'd

647
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,449
be in less trouble. Well, but the point is that

648
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,790
the reality is breaking into these uncared for devices

649
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,030
is very unlikely to result in harm to you,

650
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,329
right.

651
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:09,329
It's already been done. They've already been broken into

652
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:14,224
running an insecure device is gonna result in no harm to me as well.

653
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:15,574
So it's

654
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:16,125
the

655
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:16,974
ethical, I think part

656
00:29:17,074 --> 00:29:19,944
of the challenge is, but it's, it's chances are it's going,

657
00:29:19,954 --> 00:29:22,285
I think it's going to have to start happening at some

658
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:24,454
point because somebody in some country is going to get do

659
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:26,015
and they're going to be in a country that

660
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:28,464
doesn't really care about American law or whatever,

661
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:29,979
you know,

662
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:31,829
some Russian dude gets, you know, de

663
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,069
dosed from America

664
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,750
by another Russian dude.

665
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,099
You know, he's not going to be worried about working all these devices.

666
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:42,790
What happens when you hack some Russian guy's IOT camera and he calls his friend in,

667
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,569
in New York who drives up to Edmonton to sh

668
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:46,089
you.

669
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,849
Right.

670
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,790
Well, I would use, you know,

671
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:52,530
the reality though is I think a lot of these things, you know,

672
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,369
they're,

673
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,780
it's that sort of industrialized petty crime, right?

674
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,650
Even if a device gets bricked, you know, how many,

675
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,890
how many wireless routers have you had to throw it off over the

676
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,140
years because they just die after one or two or three years.

677
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,760
Well, that's just what they do.

678
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,270
I mean, that's part of the plan.

679
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:09,180
-- If you
-- brick these devices would people even,

680
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:13,219
and, and some of them they wouldn't. And that's actually where I think

681
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,650
some of these device manufacturers should just put like

682
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,349
a counter on the inside that says after,

683
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,079
after two years and random days between zero and 100 just

684
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,099
don't work. Right. Just stop working.

685
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:28,979
Blink, blink the red light that says something's wrong

686
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,060
and just never work again.

687
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:31,869
And,

688
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,869
and I mean, that

689
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,709
here's the thing though is if you tell people it does this, they lose their mind.

690
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,670
But if it just stops working because it broke,

691
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,760
that's fine. And in reality it's

692
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:42,979
the

693
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:43,949
-- same
-- thing,

694
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,219
printer cartridges

695
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,170
that's why I bought a laser jet printer.

696
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,510
Yeah,

697
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:48,760
me

698
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,079
too.

699
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:51,829
I'm just thinking about it. Wasn't there a printer manufacturer?

700
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,119
A big one that basically had cartridges that

701
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,089
expired

702
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,550
expiry date? All

703
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:00,979
of them do this. Well, no, but that was enforced by the cryptographic chips in them.

704
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,130
I, I'm pretty sure they all do that.

705
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:06,390
Yeah. So we've already crossed that limit and people,

706
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,430
and people hate them for it. I bought a freaking

707
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:09,819
laser

708
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,390
jet just because of this.

709
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:15,089
Well, the people who know, hate it and the people who don't know whatever,

710
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:17,040
they just keep buying the crappy printers.

711
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:19,949
Well, why wouldn't that work for this situation?

712
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:21,729
You're

713
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,040
maybe right.

714
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:24,319
It is.

715
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:26,520
See, the problem with,

716
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:30,150
is with these economic based issues is kind of whatever works for

717
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,859
a lot of people is what is going to end up happening,

718
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:36,560
whether we like it or not, unless we, like, regulate the heck out of it.

719
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:38,959
And I don't see regulations for this coming any time soon.

720
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,680
Part of it being is that any regulations for this would be so, you know,

721
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:44,079
good intentions

722
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,430
and any, you know,

723
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:48,469
loopholes or whatever that can be exploited are going to be exploited.

724
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,510
-- So,
-- here's the reality of it is un,

725
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,530
unless IOT cameras become sentient in certain murders,

726
00:31:53,655 --> 00:31:54,185
people,

727
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:58,665
they're never going to get regulated and that's just the reality of it because from,

728
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:02,925
from everything I've looked at in the history of humans and giving a

729
00:32:02,935 --> 00:32:06,574
crap about what's going on until a lot of people start to die.

730
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,545
Nobody can.

731
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:10,104
-- I mean, cigarettes still aren't even illegal.
-- That's true.

732
00:32:10,114 --> 00:32:13,204
And even when a lot of people die, sometimes nobody cares.

733
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:17,770
You know, uh, cars kill how many people every year in America in Canada.

734
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,119
-- Uh,
-- almost as many as mosquitoes do.

735
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:21,300
Seriously.

736
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Um, I believe mosquitoes are still the single largest killer of humans throughout.

737
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,369
I, I would, I would bet cars are a close second

738
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,449
and

739
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:33,349
in reality

740
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,969
-- reasons.
-- Right. Right.

741
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:39,099
In reality, we should be losing our minds over how, like,

742
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:41,589
just grossly unsafe cars are to society.

743
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,089
But instead we're worried about, you know, like sharks.

744
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:44,800
Yeah.

745
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,459
But it, it's humans are weird.

746
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,300
It is,

747
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,099
this is why this is why we need the machines

748
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,260
to take over because they will be a logical,

749
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,939
reasonable creatures unlike us.

750
00:32:57,449 --> 00:32:57,829
Yeah.

751
00:32:58,069 --> 00:33:00,500
So I think what we should do is at some point

752
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:06,199
discuss all the hack backing cyber deterrents that whole issue and,

753
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:09,160
and just to put it clearly, I'm not 100% in favor.

754
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:10,239
We should

755
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:11,859
realistically, I

756
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,099
think,

757
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:17,209
but I think realistically part of it is it's going, it's already happening. Right.

758
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:19,250
We're already having people hack each other. So,

759
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,099
you know,

760
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,469
should that be part of the stance? Should that be part of what we legislate?

761
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:25,890
I don't know. You know, and,

762
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,939
but the reality is it's already going on whether we like it or not. I feel. How do we

763
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,229
-- deal with
-- hacking back is vigilante justice and I'm going to draw a hard line. Right.

764
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:34,619
Like,

765
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,050
if my neighbor

766
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,939
takes my garden hose, I can't go break into his house and take his TV.

767
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:44,660
Like, it's just that doesn't work. You cannot have vigil anti justice,

768
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,140
period. Ok.

769
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,300
Ok. So then part of the concern I would have is,

770
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,369
you know, we're kind of,

771
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,800
the internet really is sort of the wild west in many ways

772
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,410
and that we don't have very good legal frameworks for dealing with some

773
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,810
dude's equipment in China, attacking me or denial of servicing me or whatever,

774
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,420
you know, and quite frankly,

775
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,930
I don't think we ever will because the cost of it is so low,

776
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,489
it's fixing, it is not worth it,

777
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:11,889
which I think the right solution here

778
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,020
and this is me just making crap up on the spot is I

779
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:22,370
view this as the kind of security flaw versus sandbox application universe where

780
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,409
we will never fix all the security flaws. So the answer is to sandbox application.

781
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,129
So security flaws don't matter,

782
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,668
just as we're never going to fix all of this internet gear.

783
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,330
So the answer is making sure we have an internet

784
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,250
and an infrastructure that is resilient enough that it

785
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,870
doesn't matter if it's full of rogue devices,

786
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,929
it just, it still works.

787
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,790
I would tend to agree, you know, much like the real world.

788
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,389
We, it's illegal to break into people's houses and we all have deadbolts

789
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:51,759
Right.

790
00:34:51,928 --> 00:34:52,658
Exactly.

791
00:34:53,438 --> 00:34:54,648
Uh, so, yeah.

792
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:58,118
No, it's, it's a, it's, I, what I'm really curious too is, uh,

793
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,968
over the next week and a half.

794
00:34:59,979 --> 00:35:02,218
How much is the IOT going to grow

795
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:03,559
with Christmas?

796
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:08,009
You know, it's gonna grow a ton. I'm trying to think. Did I get my kids any IOT crap?

797
00:35:08,468 --> 00:35:10,079
I don't think I did.

798
00:35:10,229 --> 00:35:12,849
I'm not sure I'm comfortable.

799
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:19,339
Well, I'm trying to think, I mean, I'm pretty sure none of it is iot

800
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:23,360
enabled. Did I buy anything for anyone?

801
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,280
I don't believe so.

802
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,469
Yeah, I'm, I'm comfortable saying I did not purchase any,

803
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:33,110
any internet enabled devices for Christmas

804
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,510
that you're aware of.

805
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,379
You heard about those passive Wi Fi chips that are powered from the Wi Fi

806
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,149
radio signals themselves.

807
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:44,629
I did not hear of this, but that sounds

808
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,469
interesting.

809
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,590
Well, essentially it's, it's a Wi Fi chip set that is low power enough

810
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,100
that it, it can be powered by other wifi signals.

811
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:57,379
It's got a little antenna to pick up the signals, convert them to electricity and,

812
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,699
and then it's,

813
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:02,219
well, and then so it can power itself so it doesn't need batteries or anything.

814
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,020
It's a Wi Fi chip set.

815
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,689
So essentially what we're getting to the

816
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:08,550
point where we can passively harvest enough energy

817
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:09,570
from Wi

818
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,429
Fi signals, you know,

819
00:36:11,729 --> 00:36:15,320
-- to actually power a device that can do something that's not
-- new man.

820
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,290
-- You got, you remember the old school AM Crystal
-- radios? Well, yeah, exactly.

821
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:22,050
Um Except now that it's running, you know,

822
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,510
software, maybe a microphone, maybe a camera, maybe internet capability,

823
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:27,840
you know.

824
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,500
So in theory, you could have, for example, hardware bugs, you know,

825
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,479
video and sound that are passively powered,

826
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:38,469
you know, by and just by virtue of being there. So

827
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,399
you Sprinkle these on people

828
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:43,409
when they're out at lunch, you know, they walk back to their office,

829
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:44,360
have a board meeting.

830
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,040
There was uh

831
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:47,550
you know, I remember I read about this,

832
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,389
I was reading an espionage book once and there were these, these bugs that I,

833
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:53,639
I wanna say the Russians use them,

834
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,969
but they'd, they'd implant the bug into a location.

835
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,919
-- Obviously, the one in the US embassy in the Eagle
-- is, is that,

836
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:02,360
is that the one that was the passive where, where it,

837
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,709
it, it, it, it didn't,

838
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,479
well, how am I, what am I saying? Here? Words are hard,

839
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:08,810
right?

840
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,989
So essentially this thing didn't give off any radio signals until

841
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,159
someone basically focused a radio signal at it to power it.

842
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,090
And so they do their bug sweeps come up clean

843
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,810
and then the,

844
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:27,409
the, the spies would essentially power this remotely and then it would, you know,

845
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:30,689
send across the signals and whatnot and, and that kind of stuff is,

846
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:35,219
-- it's fascinating and horrifying at the same time. And
-- I think I,

847
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,830
one of my best childhood memories was when they had to

848
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,169
build three stories on top of the US Embassy in Russia.

849
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:40,870
In Moscow

850
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,510
because the thing was so full of bugs, they couldn't,

851
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:47,510
they couldn't fix it, they couldn't remediate it. And so they brought in

852
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:50,729
American workers and they brought in American materials,

853
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,989
like steel and concrete and rebar and everything

854
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:58,120
and they had, they added three stories to it that were now, like, secure and bug free.

855
00:37:58,129 --> 00:37:58,780
Right.

856
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:01,139
And it was funny because I remember very specifically

857
00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:03,219
on CBS evening news because they were using,

858
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,320
they were having meetings and instead of talking or writing anything down,

859
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,159
they remember those old wax pads with the saran wrap on the front

860
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:12,919
and you would write on it and then peel it up and put it back down and write on it again.

861
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,439
-- They were using those meetings to communicate.
-- That's hilarious.

862
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,649
-- You know, I've not heard that there's got to be a book about it from the
-- eighties.

863
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:22,870
It's, I remember when I was a little kid, I mean,

864
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,830
but yeah, it was just, it was, it was so bad that they, yeah, they had to, you know,

865
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:30,419
to do it securely, they had to import all the materials, workers, everything,

866
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:32,550
add three stories to the top of this building

867
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,350
and just, you know,

868
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,090
have everybody agree not to talk about anything interesting on the,

869
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:39,870
in the rest of the building. Right.

870
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,679
Oh, man.

871
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,139
But here, so here's the thing. Right. Here's the thing too.

872
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:45,840
There's

873
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:48,939
that stories like this

874
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:51,459
are when you have an active adversary.

875
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,280
But

876
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:54,810
from the iot angle where we're talking

877
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,639
about these cameras and toasters and whatever

878
00:38:56,649 --> 00:39:01,320
else like this is purely passive badness and it's already out of control.

879
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,060
What happens if there were like active Attackers in this space, it would be

880
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,840
a total disaster.

881
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,449
It certainly wouldn't be pretty,

882
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,870
we're

883
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:11,939
doomed.

884
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,179
It's, well,

885
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:18,520
the economics are such that we're in a new area and we haven't figured this out yet,

886
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,219
you know, and,

887
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:22,540
and quite frankly, so far we've been willing to eat the cost just like, you know,

888
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,250
car desks have come down, especially when you look over all, like,

889
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,340
per passenger model, they've really come down

890
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,889
and we've deemed that they're acceptable.

891
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,989
Yeah,

892
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,379
I, I guess so. That and, and maybe that's exactly what this is. We are going to decide

893
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,649
that

894
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,929
in iot Wild West on the internet is acceptable.

895
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,550
I

896
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,040
do

897
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:46,270
have

898
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:46,469
a

899
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:46,780
choice.

900
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:49,080
-- No,
-- we don't. We really don't because, I mean, this is

901
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,300
unfixable.

902
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:53,659
I mean, we've, we, we talked about this,

903
00:39:53,669 --> 00:39:57,780
this is the trolley problem where you don't throw the switch and

904
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,850
the trolley rolls away. You do throw the switch, it runs you over. Right.

905
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,530
Like, that's a pretty clear option.

906
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,649
There is nobody on the planet who would be like,

907
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:08,969
I'm going to throw the switch and murder myself instead of the

908
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:11,659
trolley just careening off down the street and maybe hitting someone,

909
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:12,129
maybe not.

910
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:14,489
Who knows. It doesn't matter to me.

911
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,520
Yeah. Yeah.

912
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:21,199
No, it's, um, and I mean, I SPS especially don't want to get involved in this because,

913
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:23,600
you know, common carrier status and all that and whatever.

914
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:26,090
I mean, there's no such thing as common carrier status anymore

915
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,570
that annoys me to no end.

916
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,389
Well. True.

917
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:31,969
But it's at the point where they don't have to actually spend money fixing it,

918
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,090
which is what they want.

919
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,419
Oh, my goodness. Whatever this is,

920
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:37,739
uh,

921
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,219
I know,

922
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,419
that's why I don't buy home automation equipment and I will not

923
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:46,050
-- for the foreseeable future.
-- I know what you mean, man, I,

924
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:47,500
every now and then

925
00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:51,139
I'll walk through the store and I see some of this clever stuff where

926
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:55,260
you've got these like magic doorbells or these crazy lights with the apps or,

927
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,800
or what not.

928
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,580
I'm like, wow, that'd be fun to have them. No, don't do that.

929
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,939
You know what's gonna happen.

930
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah. And I,

931
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,040
it's not, you know, you know,

932
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,129
what's gonna end up happening is someday I'm probably gonna get some

933
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:08,479
and I'm gonna end up building like a secondary internet with,

934
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:10,479
with its own dedicated connection

935
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:14,280
from another provider or something. Completely ridiculous.

936
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,550
And I'm gonna be spending hundreds of dollars a

937
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,820
month to secure like a $4 light bulb I bought

938
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:23,439
totally justified.

939
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:26,870
Yeah. No, it's, I, I don't know. I mean,

940
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,290
the reality is it's happening and

941
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,639
so

942
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,709
we started out talking about planned obsolescence and

943
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:37,070
I guess let's bring it back there

944
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,280
to, to kind of wrap it all up is I think

945
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:43,929
maybe that's going to be the answer is

946
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,479
we have a sort of forced obsolescence in the iot universe where

947
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,919
this stuff self destructs on purpose after a set amount of time.

948
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:55,639
But

949
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:55,959
I,

950
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:59,100
I guess initially you're going to have to trick people into not

951
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,919
thinking that's real because they will lose their minds if they do.

952
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,620
But I imagine this would be like almost anything else where eventually

953
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:11,620
in time it will be an expected reality where you

954
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:15,729
will buy devices and they will have a very specific

955
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,820
lifespan.

956
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:19,219
And when that's done it's done

957
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,780
well. And part of it too is, I mean, I look at TV.

958
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,979
S and they've come down in price ridiculously, you know, a $500 TV now is

959
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,629
60 or 70 inches.

960
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,520
You know, they're ridiculously huge and cheap

961
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,129
and, and part of it is like,

962
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,030
you know, well, light bulbs back to light bulbs.

963
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,449
Did I get angry whenever I had to swap out an incandescent light bulb? Not really.

964
00:42:38,459 --> 00:42:39,939
It was just, that was how life was,

965
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,040
but

966
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:42,360
it's right.

967
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:46,530
It, it, it is what it was, but they also didn't say this light bulb will stop,

968
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:48,330
stop working on December 27th

969
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,530
print.

970
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:53,080
It's not, I'm sure it's not in any print. I mean, the light bulbs are pretty clear.

971
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,290
1000 hour lifespan.

972
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:54,870
Right.

973
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,969
Well, no, but what I mean is if they do have to announce it,

974
00:42:57,979 --> 00:42:59,600
they'll put in the fine print, people won't read it,

975
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,459
it'll break and some people may complain, lose their minds.

976
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:03,909
But by and large, I think

977
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,320
when I look at all these, you know, products that have,

978
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,199
uh,

979
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,120
pieces that, you know, intentionally or, well,

980
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:12,719
they intentionally fail at a certain time.

981
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:17,209
Uh, you know, people have largely accepted that. Um,

982
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,330
yeah. Yes.

983
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,959
It, well, but there's the illusion of control

984
00:43:24,189 --> 00:43:26,560
where if it's breaking

985
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:31,060
you don't know the day or the hour and you think that

986
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,179
maybe I'll get lucky and it'll last extra long or maybe

987
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:38,120
I'll take really good care of this thing or whatever.

988
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,100
But if it's in a purely electronic device

989
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,409
-- there is, but
-- people throw their wi fi routers out all the time.

990
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:47,639
I've probably been through over two dozen in the last two decades.

991
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:50,199
I only throw them away when they die.

992
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:55,870
Well, my, I kill mine a lot though too. It's for, for whatever reason. I, I don't know.

993
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:57,149
-- I have bad luck with
-- routers.

994
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:57,979
Well, for example, I, you know,

995
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:00,409
I've thrown out all but one or two of my 2.4

996
00:44:00,419 --> 00:44:03,810
gigahertz one because quite frankly five gigahertz works so much better,

997
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,820
you know, things like that.

998
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,540
And, you know, and, and part of it too, is that a

999
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:10,510
device that costs five or $10

1000
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,770
-- versus something that costs $500?
-- Right.

1001
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,149
Well, and I mean, I don't know about you, but I'm buying routers in the,

1002
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,110
like 1 to $200 range typically.

1003
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,909
So

1004
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,050
I,

1005
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,340
if I paid $200 for something

1006
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:25,340
and

1007
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,979
I knew the day it was going to die,

1008
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:33,459
I might be hesitant to purchase it, even if I knew it wasn't the right thing to do.

1009
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,379
Right.

1010
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:34,969
I

1011
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,520
would agree.

1012
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,300
Whereas if it, if it's $5 I'd probably be like, yeah, whatever. I don't care.

1013
00:44:40,149 --> 00:44:40,270
Oh,

1014
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,629
I think what will happen to you is there's other

1015
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:44,360
ways to give the illusion of control or to ideally,

1016
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:44,540
you know,

1017
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,939
make your product so sexy that people want to upgrade to the new shiny version.

1018
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,310
And there's always, I mean, cell phones are kind of like that

1019
00:44:53,379 --> 00:44:54,100
but

1020
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:58,300
it's certain things, I mean, a light, a light bulb just gives off light.

1021
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,659
How are you gonna make that?

1022
00:44:59,939 --> 00:45:03,110
-- They
-- also play music now and they do different colors.

1023
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:04,360
Who wants a light bulb?

1024
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,219
Plays music?

1025
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,399
The senha are

1026
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:07,709
ones, they actually look pretty cool.

1027
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:09,780
I almost bought some but then again, I was like, no bad.

1028
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,280
Don't buy these, but

1029
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:14,550
you should get them and tell me how they work. I'm super interested in this.

1030
00:45:15,729 --> 00:45:16,590
They have a blue,

1031
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,709
I want like a demo

1032
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:20,280
go buy

1033
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,659
expensive. How much?

1034
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,780
Like I, when I looked they were over 100 bucks each. That's a

1035
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:27,110
lot. But that was like two years ago.

1036
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,419
You should

1037
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:27,639
play

1038
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,600
music. It

1039
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,159
-- has, it plays music and does mood lighting.
-- You know, you want

1040
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,229
one. You should go look again.

1041
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,510
Do you know you do?

1042
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,989
Yeah. So

1043
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,649
-- we should set up a Kickstarter campaign to uh get Kurt some IOT
-- devices.

1044
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,600
Lord. No.

1045
00:45:42,399 --> 00:45:44,379
Oh, my kids would probably love it.

1046
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,550
Yeah. Yeah, they would. But you would hate it

1047
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,669
and you'd still do it because it's free IOT devices.

1048
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,100
So,

1049
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,409
in summary,

1050
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,840
we have no idea.

1051
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:01,239
-- Yeah, I doubt the industry does either.
-- Everything is terrible.

1052
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,679
Uh Yeah, let's just end it there and acknowledge that this is,

1053
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:09,120
this is a crazy problem that clearly has no

1054
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:12,300
good solution today and we'll keep thinking about it.

1055
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,139
I'm certain we'll discuss it again.

1056
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,280
So in the meantime,

1057
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:19,050
if you have thoughts or questions or wanna tell us how ridiculous we are,
