Hello and welcome to episode 69 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,199
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,039
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,010
If I was a less mature person,

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,020
I would make up some silly jokes right now. But, but I will hesitate from doing that.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,739
Right.

6
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:25,059
So I guess the, the big question for you, Kurt

7
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:25,879
is,

8
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:31,329
do you want to let Amazon break into your house to deliver packages someday?

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,409
-- Uh
-- Probably. Yeah,

10
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:37,889
which blows my mind. Like, why would you let them do that?

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,790
Um, well, it's the thing to remember and here's the best part.

12
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,299
It's not just Amazon having the ability to

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,330
come in and deliver packages inside your house,

14
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,540
but you can then use that to give other people access to your house, like,

15
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,950
say your cleaning service

16
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,659
or, you know, a repairman or whatever.

17
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:58,229
And honestly, for some people with certain lifestyles, that would make sense.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,459
I mean, I work from home so it makes less sense for me

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,380
because I'm here and I can just let them in.

20
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:04,989
But for a lot of people, you know,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,860
especially if you have like a one or two hour commute.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,470
I mean, can you imagine? I mean, there's services.

23
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,919
What was that service in the US where you basically hire somebody to, like,

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,019
sit at your house and wait for packages to be delivered.

25
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,019
Is that a thing?

26
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:16,819
Yeah,

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,519
it's crazy.

28
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,599
Um, or they could, like, check your, on your pets or Task Rabbit.

29
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,160
That's the one and Task Rabbit got bought by IKEA. Not too long ago. Interesting.

30
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:30,010
But, uh, anyways, you know, Task Rabbit would literally be something like

31
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,300
you'd pay somebody to like,

32
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:34,559
sit at your house and wait for a package delivery or wait for a repairman or whatever.

33
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:34,879
I mean,

34
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,099
because how many times have you had, like,

35
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,790
how many people have had to take half a

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,569
working day off so they can get their cable installed

37
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,660
or get their phone fixed.

38
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:45,620
Those are the worst too where they, you know,

39
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,500
we'll be there between the hours of 8 a.m. and midnight and, and, you know,

40
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,500
the only time they come is for the five minutes you step away into the restroom.

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,339
It's, it's great.

42
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,900
I mean, the meme is those ups, you know, messages where it's like,

43
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,800
please knock loudly.

44
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:00,419
We're home,

45
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,019
-- dude.
-- They never do.

46
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,500
You know, I had

47
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,690
so many instances where a package was to be delivered and

48
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:09,580
I go look outside and there's a note on the door

49
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,190
and I have a doorbell. I'm at home. There's no noise, I can

50
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,100
hear them. I can even hear them knock on the door. And like,

51
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,339
you clearly did not knock or anything. You just stuck that sticker up and left.

52
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,869
I remember at my old house,

53
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,600
I was actually sitting on the couch and the couch backed onto a large window

54
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,669
and outside that window was the front steps and porch to the house.

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,479
And like, literally, I was watching TV, heard a strange noise,

56
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,550
didn't think much of it, then went outside and checked and yeah,

57
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,880
ups delivery notice.

58
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,389
You gotta love it, man. You know.

59
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,309
So, yeah, from this perspective,

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,009
I can totally see people wanting this because I've also had packages that say like,

61
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,570
uh, signature required and it's like it's been delivered and I'm like,

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,050
I don't remember receiving it or signing for it

63
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,820
and then, you know, I'm hunting around my porch and then the back porch for like

64
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,949
the box.

65
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,690
So no, I can totally see this.

66
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,770
I mean, the Amazon video shows essentially those,

67
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:04,669
those two main use cases of like somebody dropping off a package and,

68
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,369
you know, having a cleaning service come by to, to clean the apartment, you know,

69
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,860
and, and honestly, I mean, if somebody has a one or two hour commute,

70
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,270
-- this is going to save them half a day at a time every time they use
-- it,

71
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,199
I suppose it can depend where you live also because

72
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:21,320
-- we,
-- we

73
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,339
-- supported in some major urban centers in the US right now.
-- Right. Right.

74
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,210
But even ignoring that, I mean,

75
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,070
let's say major urban centers are a great example where there

76
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,029
are very nice places and there are much less nice places.

77
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,440
Right.

78
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,880
Where, where there are certain places you could live that you would never ever

79
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:42,979
want to, like, leave your door open, for example, or, or anything like that,

80
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,100
or trust the package laying on your stoop because it's going to get stolen.

81
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,139
Right.

82
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,699
And,

83
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,429
and I guess I'm slightly less sensitive to that because

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,100
I've had packages on my front porch for a week

85
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,429
and nobody took them

86
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,339
and I don't think anybody ever will.

87
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:01,449
Well, part of it too is, it's, it's, I mean,

88
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,250
I just,

89
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,729
over the weekend I was using Amazon to buy stuff with next day delivery because I just

90
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,690
literally,

91
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,630
it was cold outside and I didn't want to spend

92
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,630
the 10 minutes driving to a store to get the,

93
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,919
you know, a 3.5 millimeter male female audio cable that was 6 ft long, right.

94
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:18,970
Bought one on Amazon for 10 bucks and it shows up the next day, free shipping

95
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,048
versus spending, you know, going,

96
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:26,859
it was like minus 10 Â°C and blowing kind of miserable for the one day on the weekend.

97
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:28,089
And yeah, like literally

98
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:32,029
it's just, it's getting easier to buy stuff on Amazon than it is to

99
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:36,390
-- go to a nearby store.
-- It's not getting easier. It's significantly easier, man.

100
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:40,880
-- I
-- mean, well, I mean, more and more stuff has the free next day shipping and you know,

101
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,950
like, it's more and more products that I want are literally, if I buy it online,

102
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,869
it will be there

103
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,940
in, like, one business day or less.

104
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,019
It's almost like they have data on people's buying habits.

105
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,309
It's weird using that to their advantage. Right.

106
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,279
Yeah.

107
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:56,519
Well,

108
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,630
and I assume most of their logistics keep getting better

109
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,760
and better because Amazon just recently bought some planes.

110
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,239
Remember?

111
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,200
Yes.

112
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:03,359
Yes. That's,

113
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,320
that's awesome.

114
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,070
Good

115
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,369
for them.

116
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,369
Yeah.

117
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,079
And I mean, and when you think about the efficiency from an economic point of view,

118
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:09,269
right?

119
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,760
Like, ok, you know, 100 guys with shovels versus one guy with a bulldozer,

120
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:14,640
right?

121
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:16,339
And this is a great example of

122
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,760
the, the economic cost of like,

123
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,769
somebody having to take a half a day off to

124
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,309
wait at home for the phone installer or whatever or

125
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,679
slightly better. They, they hire Task Rabbit who hires somebody, you know, who

126
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,170
obviously has.

127
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:30,410
I,

128
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,510
I assume they don't have a lot of other

129
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,760
options for work if they're working for Task rabbit,

130
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,450
you know, doing this sort of, um,

131
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,829
sort of piece work. And

132
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,100
so that's, you know, a bit less inefficient, right?

133
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,029
You have somebody who's maybe not a phd waiting at home for half a day.

134
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,380
But fundamentally, you know, you replace all that with a smart lock,

135
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,630
a camera and a little bit of software magic

136
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,100
and all of a sudden, you know, the, the repairman can let himself in

137
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:57,420
do the thing that needs to be done whenever and, and leave.

138
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:58,059
Right.

139
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,910
Right.

140
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:00,029
I

141
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,390
mean, yeah, it's,

142
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,390
I imagine if every single package being delivered had to be signed for.

143
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,299
It used to be like that

144
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,279
and it was horrendously expensive and

145
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,679
inefficient.

146
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,739
And it also reminds me of the, the days of checking baggage

147
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,750
where people would, like, make sure it was actually your bag

148
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,619
and,

149
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,829
you know, there's, there's a good security lesson there as well where

150
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,049
yes, people are going to steal bags. But the number is like so insignificantly low

151
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,769
-- that it's, it's just easier and better to replace stolen bags.
-- Well, the

152
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,290
overall cost is lower. Yeah.

153
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,769
Well, same thing with packages. Right.

154
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:39,890
How many packages actually get stolen versus how many more packages get delivered

155
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,000
because we just don't really care about the security of these packages.

156
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:43,369
And

157
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,339
there's, there's a lot, a lot of that which, which this reminds me of

158
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,679
you sent me the video of that guy who had packages stolen off of his,

159
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,359
his front porch and he, like, put a shotgun shell in it.

160
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:57,959
So when somebody grabbed the package, like it exploded, it didn't hurt them.

161
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,440
It just made a lot of noise.

162
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:02,480
-- I took the shot out. So it was just like a giant fire
-- crack

163
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:02,519
that

164
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:02,700
was

165
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,079
illegal

166
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,200
in most places

167
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,359
and it's got to be illegal everywhere for the most part. Right.

168
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:14,170
Well, I mean, the potential for shrapnel hit somebody is there and just that alone.

169
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:15,140
I mean, anyways.

170
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,609
But uh yeah, and I mean, I get that because if, if you live in a bad area and like,

171
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:20,279
you know,

172
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,880
like literally you,

173
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:23,320
you can't

174
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,140
get people to ship you stuff with like signature

175
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,440
required or like face to face delivery required,

176
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,299
even if you wanted to.

177
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:30,459
Because most of these places are like,

178
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,660
we're just not set up for that.

179
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,059
Like we, we do the lowest common denominator, which is like

180
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,700
some Rando basically throws the package at your front door.

181
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:39,559
You know,

182
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,279
like I've seen, that's one of my favorite.

183
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,690
I see those videos where like you see the UPS driver,

184
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,450
you know,

185
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,369
like literally pull up and like a package comes flying out the side

186
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,119
of the truck and like bounces a few times and you know,

187
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,690
honestly

188
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,709
I'm ok with that because again, you know, packages get delivered faster.

189
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,630
And have you ever seen the videos of

190
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,950
the sorting facilities where these packages get processed?

191
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,959
I've never seen a video but I've known people

192
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,630
who worked in them and I've heard stories.

193
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,029
Well,

194
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,529
you have these giant bumpers like whacking the package

195
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,309
onto the right conveyor belt or you know,

196
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,089
it falls like two or 3 ft onto another

197
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,630
-- conveyor belt
-- that like the people who handle them,

198
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,630
I guess often we say entertain themselves

199
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,750
by seeing like who can throw the package the farthest.

200
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,079
Oh, that's fragile. Let me

201
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:25,589
that on the ground.

202
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:26,779
I went to Home Depot,

203
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,320
the other day and they have a whole pile of fridges and freezers out in the front,

204
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:31,869
you know, for clearance or whatever.

205
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,989
And half of them are labeled do not drop.

206
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,020
Are we supposed to be dropping certain models of fridge and freezer?

207
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,500
I, I imagine like a lawyer made them put that on the side or something.

208
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,150
Well, did you ever see when they ship certain high

209
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,460
sensitive scientific equipment?

210
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,619
They have those, those little

211
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:54,960
G

212
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:57,349
shock and the tip sensors, basically,

213
00:08:57,359 --> 00:09:00,409
it'll tell you how much it's tipped and how many G's it's encountered.

214
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,489
Which, which obviously,

215
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,289
like if you're shipping an electron microscope across the country,

216
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,200
that's

217
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,710
a huge deal. Right? Like your refrigerator. Probably less so.

218
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:12,059
But still, I'm sure you don't want it, like, dropped off the back of a truck, right.

219
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,909
Yeah, I remember looking into those and they're not cheap.

220
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,289
They're like a few bucks each and again,

221
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:19,109
just for the majority of packages that do arrive.

222
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:19,599
Ok.

223
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:20,900
You know,

224
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,619
I don't want the whole industry spending like

225
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,109
an extra five bucks on every single package

226
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,969
to save like 1% of them.

227
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,450
-- Unless it is like high value in your, you're gonna be insuring it.
-- Right.

228
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,409
I mean, I'm sure an electron microscope is what, a couple million dollars?

229
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:35,969
Probably not anymore.

230
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,450
I, I'm guessing you could probably, I mean,

231
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,570
that's what gets me about some of the scientific equipment, right?

232
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,719
Is like, or like CNC milling machines, right?

233
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,380
I was looking at them a while back and it's like,

234
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,169
they used to be a half a million bucks and now they're like,

235
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,880
five grand for a really nice one.

236
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,890
Not like an industrial one that'll run 24 7 for like, 10 years. But, you know,

237
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,159
something with like five access computer control. The whole shenanigan.

238
00:09:57,409 --> 00:09:59,869
Just get, just get a 3D printer now right there.

239
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,739
I was looking at getting a 3D printer and a

240
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,039
milling machine so I could do additive and subtractive manufacturer.

241
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,940
There's nothing you couldn't build then.

242
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,059
Pretty much. No,

243
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,799
I just don't have the time to actually learn how to use this stuff properly.

244
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,159
I know the feeling.

245
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:13,989
I know exactly.

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,859
Although the beauty of 3D printing is there's the thing burse so you can go

247
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:22,039
to thing Burt and download plans for nearly anything you can imagine at this point,

248
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:23,909
which is awesome.

249
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,289
-- So, so,
-- yeah, just got to get feed stock.

250
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,030
Right. Right.

251
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:29,219
And, well, that's cheap. Right. Let's face it.

252
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:31,369
Yeah.

253
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,929
But back to the Amazon key.

254
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,489
I mean, the fundamental thing is they're not forcing this on people.

255
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:37,609
Um,

256
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:42,280
and yeah, for a certain group of people, this will make their life a lot easier.

257
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,679
And just from an efficiency point of view, I,

258
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,179
I mean, the reality is whoever is coming into your house is going to have to be like,

259
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,159
registered.

260
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,159
They have to like, you have to, ok, opening the door for them

261
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,669
and there's gonna be that video record of them.

262
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,469
Like you get a camera from Amazon that uploads straight to the cloud.

263
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,950
So there's like that entry and exit record.

264
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,650
And I mean,

265
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:08,520
the reality is if somebody wants to break into your house,

266
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,150
they're just going to boot your front door or use a pry bar

267
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,590
or a door jack to spread the frame and just open the door.

268
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:17,799
The thing I always think of in situations like this is,

269
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,510
it's kind of like the lock in general

270
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,309
of

271
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,099
it. It exists to keep the honest people honest and, and I think that's going to be

272
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,669
kind of the next great challenge is

273
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,929
and, and here's, here's my example, right?

274
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,619
Is because I, I've dealt with some of this kind of stuff before in the past is

275
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:37,059
so let's say you have a delivery person come to your house

276
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:38,409
and

277
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:40,349
you come home from work at night

278
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,429
and you notice that, you know, the some, some antique is missing from the captain or,

279
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,030
or whatever, pick something, right?

280
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,710
I, I have no idea.

281
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:52,030
Then you think the delivery person took my stuff,

282
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:52,630
right?

283
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:56,429
And, and the reality is no, the, uh, you know, your cleaning lady moved it,

284
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,190
you know, two days before and you didn't notice until this.

285
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:00,010
And so like,

286
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,000
that's one of the tricks and that's one of the things that

287
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,299
makes it really difficult when you have situations like this is,

288
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,280
is now what do you do?

289
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:08,460
Do you accuse the delivery person of taking it and they're of course going to be like,

290
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:09,260
nope, not me.

291
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,380
And then it,

292
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,419
it messes with your head. Right.

293
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,669
And this is like, uh,

294
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,469
I forget, I forget what it is. I, I, I've dealt with this,

295
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,729
I'm just going to point out at this point

296
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,599
this is first world person problems because like,

297
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,590
my cleaning service, like, uh,

298
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,679
must be nice.

299
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,479
Right.

300
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,359
And, and, well, that, that part of it and I'm not even saying this is bad.

301
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:32,919
This is just, this is the kind of stuff we need to always think about is the fact that

302
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,239
when you let someone into your house and then

303
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,280
you can notice something missing or whatnot and it becomes difficult to enter,

304
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,500
you know, how do I,

305
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,809
how do I put this together? Do I accuse this person of stealing?

306
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,380
Which they, let's say they didn't do,

307
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,679
you've probably now made them lose their job and they're gonna have a rough time,

308
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:49,950
right?

309
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,859
Because of something they maybe didn't do.

310
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,169
And, and how's Amazon gonna deal with this?

311
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:56,909
Are they going to say, ok, if someone reports a theft, just

312
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,219
screw this guy.

313
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,960
If you read the fine print on their thing,

314
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:02,340
they have a package delivery happy guarantee.

315
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,500
Like it's literally called the happy package guarantee or some stupid thing.

316
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,979
And it guarantees that if you're not satisfied with how the package is delivered,

317
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:09,659
blah, blah, blah.

318
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,989
But they, I, I looked through and you know,

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,469
hit control fa couple of times looking for.

320
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:18,710
Kind of, yeah, what happens if stuff gets stolen or broken?

321
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,190
Right?

322
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,559
Like what happens if the guy delivering your package kind of pops

323
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,630
it in the front door and knocks the vase off the table?

324
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,119
I'm sure

325
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,820
-- that will happen.
-- I mean,

326
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:32,070
and worse yet, what happens when something happens? That's off camera

327
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,299
and you don't have that

328
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,659
use of proof, right? Like if you have the proof of, like the guy,

329
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,820
you know, you see a hand reach a packing bumps, the table. Vaz

330
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,440
falls off, door closes.

331
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,539
It's like, ok, that was the Amazon delivery guy knocking that off the table,

332
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:48,580
right? And I imagine, you know, Amazon would pay you off just to make it go away. But

333
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,890
when it happens off camera or, you know, there's, there's like no solid proof,

334
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:55,239
you know, how do you know the cat didn't do it?

335
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,880
Right.

336
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,409
Yes.

337
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,320
Yes. That's,

338
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,780
there's lots of youtube videos of cats being jerks and shoving stuff off shells.

339
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,030
It's great. They are jerks.

340
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:03,900
Yes.

341
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:05,150
Although,

342
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,619
so I have a puppy now

343
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:11,619
and, and it is funny because like, cats are jerks but like, dogs are just dumb

344
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,619
and so

345
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:15,719
it's, it's two sides of the same coin, right?

346
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,299
They, they ruin everything just for very different reasons.

347
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,859
Yeah. No, I mean, it is a major change in

348
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,049
sort of houses used to be really private spaces

349
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,070
unless you specifically invited people over and like,

350
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,280
unlock the door and let them in.

351
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,130
You know, like you really had control over who kind of came and went from your house.

352
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,770
-- You still do today. I
-- mean,

353
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,739
it's not like, for example, I have repairman coming by and it's like, yeah,

354
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,409
he looks like,

355
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,929
I mean, because for example, like the local cable, you uh, shop, you know, they,

356
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,250
most of the guys don't have work fans,

357
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,289
they were a private vehicle with like a sticker on the side,

358
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,169
you know, they got rid of the big Shaw vans a long time ago.

359
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:59,179
And so these guys are wearing like a shaw ID, like,

360
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,340
I don't know what a Shaw ID is supposed to look like,

361
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:03,090
you know, like

362
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,400
the gas guy like, yeah, he's got an Atco

363
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,719
Gas ID lanyard. I'm like,

364
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,080
that's great. Like,

365
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,239
did you print that yourself? Like, I don't know.

366
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:13,340
Right.

367
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,559
And I'm just letting this complete stranger into my house

368
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,719
and he's poking around my furnace and it's like I,

369
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,460
did you

370
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:22,429
call, you know what you're doing? Did you call and ask them? See,

371
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,299
-- and that's different, right? If you ask someone to come and a guy shows
-- you

372
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:27,400
-- meter
-- readers

373
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,880
that is different and those

374
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,559
I don't think exist pretty much anywhere anymore.

375
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,159
They're phasing them out like they pretty much locally.

376
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:38,719
I know all the meters now have been replaced by the electronically readable ones.

377
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:39,289
Yes.

378
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,840
And you know, and that was a huge

379
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:41,780
because for example,

380
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:44,869
the electric commuters were being replaced by people who were not electricians.

381
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,590
It was actually outsourced to a company in North Carolina.

382
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:50,789
I actually, I just had my water meter replaced

383
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,989
and I was talking to the person who did it and she was not a plumber.

384
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:59,049
She was just a, a person who took some training courses, I guess.

385
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,239
And in fairness if everything goes, ok,

386
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,219
99% of the replacements are going to be

387
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,359
literally like unscrew this bolt unscrew that bolt,

388
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,419
pop the old one off, pop the new one on, tighten the bolts.

389
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:08,429
And like,

390
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,270
actually I was talking to her about this is because so,

391
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,429
so all of my water hookups are brand new because I had some work done down there.

392
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,619
And so like, it's funny because they gave me a water meter and no lie like a year later,

393
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,349
they replaced it,

394
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,750
which I was like, this is crazy. Why don't you just

395
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,510
like, and that's the first thing I said, I, like I said,

396
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,489
how long have you been installing these meters?

397
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,830
And she said, oh, for the last two years. So I'm thinking

398
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:34,469
they knew this would happen.

399
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,400
But instead, well, my,

400
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,799
my guess is they probably are replacing the whole neighborhood at

401
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,969
the same time and it just wasn't my turn yet.

402
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,030
So they were, you know, dealing anyway. Anyway,

403
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:45,190
I, I asked her, I'm like, ok,

404
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
so you come into someone's house and obviously I live in an old neighborhood.

405
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,789
And I said,

406
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,210
what happens if, if like, you know, everything's corroded and nothing works.

407
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:56,450
And she basically said, like I give it one twist with the wrench.

408
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,260
If it doesn't work, I tell people

409
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:01,440
you have to bring in a plumber, get this fixed, call me in a month.

410
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,900
And like that,

411
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,089
honestly,

412
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,380
they

413
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,900
just outsource the cost onto the

414
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,780
right. It's not their problem.

415
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,260
Like if it needs to be fixed, it's my problem. I would have to call the

416
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:16,280
in and the plumber would basically have to tear my internal plumbing apart to,

417
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,219
to take care of it

418
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,020
anyway. We, we're in the weeds.

419
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,160
-- We're talking about
-- water

420
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,405
fundamentally.

421
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:27,354
Well, I think the real concern that kind of is nagging in the back of our heads. Right?

422
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:30,714
Is like, what if this thing just fails catastrophically for everybody using it?

423
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:32,795
It isn't going to fail catastrophically.

424
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:34,875
Well, there was those bricked door locks, you know,

425
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:36,314
those smart locks that got bricked by an

426
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:38,074
update and nobody could get into their house,

427
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:41,354
but these, these locks appear to have keys on them.

428
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:42,609
Well, no, no, no.

429
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:43,069
The, the,

430
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,540
the deal is you can buy one of a several

431
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,400
set of approved smart locks or there's this one like

432
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,000
lock that kind of goes on to the back of your lock and uses the knob to turn it.

433
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:53,989
Um, so essentially you're,

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,260
you're given a choice of which smart lock you can buy and use with this system

435
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,739
and I don't know if you can, like, mechanically,

436
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,050
like if the lock decides to go bonkers or whatever,

437
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,260
if you can mechanically override it with a key.

438
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,479
Like

439
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:06,459
if there's like a

440
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:11,849
look though, man, at the same time, if you have a, a purely electric door lock

441
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,119
and you have no like backup means of entering your, your property,

442
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,900
-- you're an idiot.
-- Right? But if you're a condo or whatever, you wouldn't have that

443
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,599
you have a door to the hallway and what are you going to do?

444
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,239
Climb the building and go on your balcony?

445
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,410
You, you make sure it has a key hole on it

446
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,069
and you have a key somewhere,

447
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,010
right?

448
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,060
I, I don't know, I, I've not,

449
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,060
I've been avoiding electronic locks mostly because

450
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:37,319
they just don't solve a problem.

451
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:37,869
I have.

452
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,069
Um,

453
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,400
but I know looking at a lot of safes, like looking at all the electronic safes.

454
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,410
Uh, I was kind of wondering about that.

455
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,910
I'm like, what if the batteries in this thing die?

456
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,510
Like you pay a locksmith to cut it open? Like how does that work?

457
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,609
No, the answer is most of them.

458
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:49,770
You,

459
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,579
you like the keypad physically prize off and then you're presented with a keyhole.

460
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,530
-- Yes,
-- I've, I've seen those before and, and like,

461
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,660
that's the only right way to do this is you need,

462
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,630
you need an alternative means of entry,

463
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:03,339
right?

464
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:06,890
It just has to be that way because someday the battery is going to die,

465
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,349
the electronic lock is going to fail.

466
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,430
And we're just not at the point today

467
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:14,300
where we have enough resiliency built into the circuitry

468
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,819
that we can, we can call them

469
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,089
batteries die.

470
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,949
It doesn't matter how much resilience you build the thing of the batteries. I

471
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:26,060
mean, look, if, if the battery is replaceable or you have a way to like

472
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,670
something

473
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,750
from the outside of the door.

474
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,660
Right. And, and that's part of the trick. Right.

475
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,119
And, and it, it is conceivable that electronic locks

476
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,530
will just never be a thing on a residential scale that's reliable enough. Right?

477
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,709
To be, to exist without like a keyhole.

478
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:44,609
Yeah.

479
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,069
Well, you'd also have to have them feel safe in like a fire event or something as well.

480
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,750
Right. Like,

481
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,780
they are purely electronic and like,

482
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,660
the purely electronics tend to be centrally controlled.

483
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:58,770
I would hope they have at least like a knob on the inside.

484
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,180
So, if the battery does die, you can at least exit the building

485
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,130
code. You're required to have a tool as way of getting that door open

486
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,229
and, and

487
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,099
push bar or whatever.

488
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,369
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

489
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:11,530
I,

490
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,880
I honestly think the Amazon key thing is awesome because it

491
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,869
will save everybody involved a ton of time and pain.

492
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,910
And, I mean, it's, it reminds me of the self driving car thing in that

493
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:24,060
self driving cars are cool, but at the same time it's suddenly, you know,

494
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,790
things like self driving school buses.

495
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,530
Just your kid goes on the school bus

496
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:30,680
and you can have like micro buses that hold six kids.

497
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:36,060
So kids that are like in a small town can now go to AAA larger regional school,

498
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:36,729
for example,

499
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,849
with less hassle,

500
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,050
things like that. You know, it's, it,

501
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,959
it gives people options that just

502
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:43,579
like,

503
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,739
I think of all the blind and disabled people, right?

504
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,270
And just all of a sudden, boom, they're,

505
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,920
they're on the same equal playing field as the rest of us for transport.

506
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,319
You know.

507
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:54,560
Um, because my, like, I know people that, you know,

508
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,199
they volunteer and they basically want some of the things they do is like,

509
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,270
just go with a blind person to help them with their errands.

510
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,089
That's,

511
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,500
and,

512
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,680
you know, going to the bank. Right.

513
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:09,099
And so I, I think this is part of that inevitable march forwards of,

514
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,079
you know,

515
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:15,150
-- ease of use and convenience.
-- Yeah. Well, and I guess part of it too is

516
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:19,439
we love to complain about all the ways things can fail.

517
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:20,599
I mean, that's kind of what we do,

518
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,199
you know,

519
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:24,569
it's, but anyway, the point is it,

520
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,500
it's going to be good enough often enough that it won't matter.

521
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,689
Right.

522
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:30,449
Like, yeah, the, the locks will fail occasionally, but big deal,

523
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,329
it'll be good enough

524
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,650
and, and that's just kind of the right way to look at it.

525
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,969
It, it's never going to be perfect

526
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:36,890
but it will be good enough, I'm sure.

527
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:37,530
Yeah.

528
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,640
Well, and my other thought too was though the concerns for privacy because,

529
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,739
you know, have a company with, you know,

530
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,739
interior footage of your front door who's coming and going facial rec

531
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,050
can they,

532
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,449
are they allowed to use facial recognition to profile you and see what you're doing?

533
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,839
You know, what happens if the cops, uh, ask for that data under warrant?

534
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,369
Because that's already happened with, uh, what was it with the, um,

535
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:57,760
with the

536
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:58,290
Amazon?

537
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,630
The

538
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,000
Alexis

539
00:21:59,790 --> 00:21:59,839
did?

540
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,280
Yeah. And I don't, I think they got it but they, well, no, I, I remember what it was.

541
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:08,530
The police wanted the recordings without a warrant and Amazon basically said no,

542
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,510
go away, you know, go get a warrant.

543
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,829
And I, I don't know if they did get the warrant or not. My suspicion is they did.

544
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:18,189
But I mean, I think that's pretty common is law enforcement is gonna, you know,

545
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,750
they're going to pick the easy way first

546
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:20,319
and,

547
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:21,719
well, I mean, it doesn't hurt to ask.

548
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:23,670
Certainly not. They might say yes.

549
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:24,770
Right.

550
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,270
Right. II, I kind of get it and,

551
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,709
yeah, and I don't know, man, I, I wonder the privacy is tricky. Uh, no GDPR

552
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,819
in the US to keep us safe.

553
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,670
Yeah. Interesting. In the Alexa

554
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,660
case, apparently the suspect okayed handing over of the logs.

555
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:41,780
Interesting.

556
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:43,459
Um, so anyways, yeah, but I mean,

557
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:46,449
the reality is eventually they will start getting warrants for the stuff because,

558
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:49,380
like, from a crime point of view, oh, somebody got murdered.

559
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,410
Oh, a company has video of their front door people coming in and out. Yeah.

560
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,339
No, I'm sorry. That's, we're definitely gonna want to see that.

561
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:57,550
Right.

562
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,770
And, and I would imagine in an instance like that you could easily justify a warrant.

563
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:06,630
But at the same time if, if, you know, some cop decided, like,

564
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,140
I don't like this curt guy.

565
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,380
He, he looked at me funny yesterday, I'm gonna see if I can't find something on him.

566
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:13,219
Right.

567
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:14,930
And, and that's an instance where, no,

568
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:17,569
you do not want that person to have access to your footage

569
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,180
and recordings and entry, exit data. And,

570
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:21,599
well, well, that, that's true too.

571
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,819
If you have an electronic lock,

572
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:26,180
they're gonna probably know whenever you go in and out of your house.

573
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:26,599
Right.

574
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,910
I don't know that most of those locks are smart enough to keep a log.

575
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:34,510
Like if we're talking to just the simple home ones that are like 100 200 bucks.

576
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,719
I doubt that they keep a long,

577
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,260
although they have the recording so the video will do.

578
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,579
Yeah.

579
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,229
But, uh, no, I mean, it's, it's part of this March forwards because, uh,

580
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:46,050
you know,

581
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,489
I, I just, I can see for a lot of people this being a very huge time saver. Right.

582
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,660
Every time you've ever had to wait at home for something that's suddenly gone.

583
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:56,900
Yeah.

584
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,630
No, I get it, man. I get it. All right. All right,

585
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,170
-- cool. So,
-- and just, and just to, maybe we'll put show notes.

586
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,079
But I, there's this guy called the lock picking lawyer and he shows how easy these,

587
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,369
like, high security locks are to defeat if you know what you're doing.

588
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,464
Like, he's picking things in under 30 seconds. It's crazy.

589
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:18,425
Every lock is terrible locks, locks don't keep people out. I mean, that's just

590
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:18,714
a

591
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:19,675
couple of decent ones.

592
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:24,314
There's, that are like, pretty crazy. Hard to pick. But now we're talking like 2 $300

593
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:24,645
you know,

594
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:25,015
locks

595
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,015
and here's the thing.

596
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,324
All right. So you have a lock that can't be picked.

597
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:31,444
My guess is, is a good swift kick to that door

598
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:31,834
is

599
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:33,805
gonna get you in.

600
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:34,729
Well,

601
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,300
unless you have like a security door with

602
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,859
a security door frame because that's the thing.

603
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:39,189
You can have a high security door.

604
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:42,010
And the classic thing is you just put a carjack

605
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,939
-- and push the frame open and, oh, pops the lash.
-- Yes.

606
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,030
Or,

607
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:49,469
or the other favorite I've seen is

608
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,969
most people don't know this,

609
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:55,229
but the vast majority of houses built in like the last probably 3040 years,

610
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,910
the walls, you can basically, like, just stab through them with a crow bar

611
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:03,760
-- and then stick your arm around and unlock the door.
-- Right.

612
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,400
Yeah.

613
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,979
Yeah, I actually saw the De Walt had a new,

614
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,930
it was a really cool blade for a

615
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:12,229
Sawzall that could cut through plywood without needing a pilot hole.

616
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:15,780
And the way they accomplished this is they just cut out one or two of the front teeth.

617
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,119
So there was like a little hook at the front and then a little blank space in the teeth.

618
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,390
And you could literally kind of basically you could stab a

619
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,170
hole into the plywood and then cut a hole through it.

620
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,359
And

621
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,329
yeah, like you said, most

622
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,920
North American construction is like half inch or what is it?

623
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,969
3/8 plywood on two by fours and

624
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:31,660
a

625
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:33,790
battery powered saws all with the right blade.

626
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,579
And you can just cut a man sized hole inside of the house

627
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,439
-- in five minutes.
-- I've seen houses built without plywood on the outside.

628
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:41,650
How, what,

629
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:43,530
how

630
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,250
-- does it not fall down because
-- they put a metal cross brace

631
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,290
on the frame?

632
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:53,199
Ok. So what, how? Ok. So by definition, a wall has to be

633
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:56,739
like not air. So you've got your two by four framing and some cross,

634
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,839
we've got like a foam insulation board on it,

635
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:04,839
which is not like you could kick through it with a foot and then you put the, the,

636
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:06,800
the siding on the outside of that

637
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,469
and the drive

638
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,020
drive

639
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,760
on the other side, insulation in the middle.

640
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,420
Yeah, for real, man.

641
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,319
It's crazy.

642
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:14,040
I I

643
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,939
I'm literally speechless because I'm just thinking

644
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,420
if your neighbor's house ever catches fire,

645
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,030
your house is going to go up in like seconds.

646
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:25,849
Most of these buildings I've seen are in the, we'll say, not high end neighborhoods

647
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,050
-- and, and my suspicion
-- is

648
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,699
it's like Grenfell Tower then it's ok to

649
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:31,630
poor people's buildings on fire.

650
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,430
Ok. Awesome.

651
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:36,689
Again, I mean, it's, it, that's incredibly efficient.

652
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,359
That saves a ton of wooden trees

653
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,959
as a traditional person who lives in a house that has walls that are

654
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,180
made out of thin plywood. Still. That

655
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,750
I, it would.

656
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,140
-- Oh, man. Yeah, that, I just, I don't know that I could get my head around that.
-- I would,

657
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,060
I would not live in one of those houses. We'll just say that.

658
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:53,780
Right.

659
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:55,780
Just, no, I mean, you think you could,

660
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,119
you could break into that house with a baseball bat, right?

661
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,930
Just like, hit, hit the wall.

662
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,869
Yeah, pretty much.

663
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:04,880
But I doubt that happens because most people, you know,

664
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:08,589
-- it
-- doesn't happen. That's just it. Right. It has nothing to do with security.

665
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:13,270
Let's face it. It, it's, we, we love talking about Doom and Gloom,

666
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,790
but

667
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,930
none of this stuff really happens very often.

668
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:19,920
-- I think
-- that's part of the problem is, you know, online to even just sort of do like a,

669
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,430
sort of

670
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,989
just a simple attack without really targeting somebody. You still have to

671
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,680
target them in the sense of it's not like you're walking by a house,

672
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,750
you see the door ajar, you pop in and swipe whatever you can grab,

673
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,359
you know, which just happened to me.

674
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:36,260
I left my garage door open and then we were moving and it's like, where's, you know,

675
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,270
where's one of the bicycles is missing?

676
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,020
And then we realized, like, ok, like, we used the bike last week and now it's gone so

677
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,250
great, it got stolen,

678
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:44,910
got

679
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:45,319
you,

680
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,339
you know,

681
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,099
and they just took whatever was, you know, easy to grab and,

682
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:55,300
-- and sell for 20 bucks. Right.
-- Well, you know, that's actually a really good point

683
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,569
is

684
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,979
if somebody wants to target you,

685
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:01,670
you're going to lose. Right.

686
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:01,890
If,

687
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,069
if somebody says I'm going to break into Kurt's house and I'm going to steal his TV.

688
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,410
And like, that's their goal,

689
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,170
they will find a way to do that.

690
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,380
But as opposed to people, you know, walking down the street being like,

691
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,479
that's a nice bike I see in that garage.

692
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:15,920
Right.

693
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,780
Like, like there's, there's, and this is true in cybersecurity,

694
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,030
there's kind of the targets and there's opportunistic

695
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,680
and you will never stop the targeted people,

696
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:28,010
but you can stop the opportunistic people by obviously doing certain clever

697
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,869
things like shutting your garage door and locking your front door.

698
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,439
Right.

699
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,729
Yeah. My new security system has a garage door sensor

700
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,530
and it's not to prevent people from breaking in.

701
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,310
It's to prevent me from forgetting to close it.

702
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,329
Right. You know, I don't have that and

703
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,420
I

704
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,699
II, I bought all this stuff and I keep meaning to, like, hook something up so,

705
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:51,339
so I can, I can figure something out because,

706
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,819
well, the real reason is I have a heated garage

707
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,189
and at least at least once a year, at least once a year,

708
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:01,699
we forget to shut the door for a couple of hours and

709
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,719
you know, when it happens, because all the snow on the roof has melted

710
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:07,479
in the front of the garage door.

711
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,410
So, yes,

712
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,569
and that's what gets me is,

713
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:14,589
is honestly the main reason I'm buying a security system is

714
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,420
for things like to prevent me from leaving my garage

715
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,109
door open and also to have like a log of,

716
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,109
or being able to see my front door so I can see if a package got delivered or not.

717
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:30,510
You're right. It's, I'm, it's like 20% for security, 80% for convenience.

718
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,510
Yeah, that's probably fair. Well, let's face it, man. I mean, again,

719
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,609
the,

720
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,719
something like that can help prevent opportunistic crime but targeted crime,

721
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,920
it doesn't matter how good your security system is, they're, they're gonna get in

722
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,329
like, you know, none of these security systems are that good

723
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,739
that they're going to stop even a, a mildly competent thief.

724
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,089
-- And granted, I'm sure eventually they'll get caught by the police. But it
-- doesn't

725
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:54,250
matter.

726
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,290
The problem with a lot of the online stuff too is that, you know,

727
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,369
these alarm systems won't stop somebody.

728
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,819
What they'll do is alert somebody who will

729
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:03,400
hopefully eventually alert somebody who comes by and,

730
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,930
you know, ultimately the cops come by and can enforce,

731
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,050
you know, the law,

732
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:11,020
uh, through physical force. And that's ii, I

733
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,520
see a lot of companies where it's like, oh, yeah, we, our, our,

734
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:18,150
our security system notified us that we were broken into, but we never, like,

735
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,270
dealt with it properly,

736
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:23,859
you know, and, and that's like the Equifax breach, the Home Depot breach,

737
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,660
like all these breaches where it turns out they

738
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,540
knew about this stuff for weeks or months and,

739
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,130
and just didn't properly deal with it.

740
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,060
Uh,

741
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,229
yeah. Yeah,

742
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,260
-- that, that is true.
-- I mean,

743
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,050
and that's the thing, right?

744
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,920
If you, if you have, you can have the world's best alarm system. But,

745
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,609
uh, well, like that giant diamond heist in, what was it? Amsterdam or something?

746
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:42,540
And they literally,

747
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,890
the guards apparently were like, yeah, stupid alarms going off. And literally

748
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
the one guy basically said that,

749
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:52,050
ok, so the vault alarm went off.

750
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,359
That means somebody is in the vault and I'm not paid enough to die.

751
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:57,239
So I'm not going to go deal with that.

752
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:00,449
That's

753
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,949
great. Like, you know, I'll have to find that.

754
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:05,660
Uh, but as I remember reading the interview with this guy,

755
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,439
that's basically what he said.

756
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,369
And it was like, honestly, you know,

757
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,930
yeah, you can't ask a human being making, like,

758
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:15,479
near minimum wage to put their life on the line for some random company.

759
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:18,500
Yeah, I would agree with that. I,

760
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,739
yeah, I, I totally wouldn't go into and, and my guess is because it's Europe,

761
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,439
they probably didn't have guns.

762
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:25,900
Right.

763
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,260
-- Like, just,
-- no,

764
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,589
they, it was like the, oh, here we go. The Antwerp Diamond. He,

765
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:31,939
that's the one.

766
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,609
And, yeah, apparently they screwed up because the classic thing, like the guy,

767
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,310
they left garbage or something somewhere, whatever, you know.

768
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:40,819
Well,

769
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:44,489
but I guess at the same time my assumption is the security guard called the police.

770
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:44,869
Right.

771
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:45,430
I

772
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:50,099
would hope so. And let's face it. Like that's kind of the point is

773
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,650
you're really not there, you're there to stop the opportunistic crime

774
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,469
or call the police if there's like a legitimate crime taking place. Right?

775
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,520
Like that's the job of a security guard job.

776
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,680
The security guard isn't to go into the vault and start a gunfight with,

777
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:03,750
with the thieves.

778
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:08,030
You know, contrary to what the movies tell us

779
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,609
that is not the way it works.

780
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:12,839
Not unless you have exceptionally well paid security guards

781
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,040
and those people exist

782
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:15,819
like

783
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,099
they're, they're real and, and they do stuff,

784
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:23,729
but, but in this case that probably wasn't them. And again, opportunistic, right?

785
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:26,239
Which actually let's use that to bring up.

786
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,979
The next thing I wanted to talk about, which is actionable advice,

787
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,209
which is something that came up for me.

788
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:35,359
Actually, last week I was at, uh, De Ops Day Madison last week

789
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:39,050
and I gave a talk to nonsecurity people about why

790
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,239
basically, like, let's treat security like a minimum viable product.

791
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,930
And I gave them three things to do.

792
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,479
And

793
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:50,500
uh I took the oas top 10 list and I broke it down into basically saying uh number one,

794
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,800
use a framework,

795
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:56,619
right? Because like that will take away a significant amount of the oas top 10.

796
00:32:57,569 --> 00:33:00,859
Number two was, don't roll your own off just like let Google do it right.

797
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:02,030
You're gonna screw it up.

798
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,869
It's, you know, don't roll your own crypto people get that now, like,

799
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,859
don't roll your own off is the next one.

800
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,500
And then number three was

801
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:09,989
when you do your deployments, you know,

802
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,189
you don't use like answerable or containers or, or chef or,

803
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:17,349
or whatever, right? Like, don't, don't do artisan deployment.

804
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,790
That, that is just a bad idea.

805
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,359
And,

806
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,619
and so anyway, this really kind of,

807
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,959
it was funny because I showed this to some security people.

808
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:29,380
They're like, dude, you can't turn the Os top 10 into three and I said I just did,

809
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,760
right.

810
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,229
And they're like, no, it doesn't work like that.

811
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:33,790
And I said, well, what would you suggest? Right. And there,

812
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:37,040
of course they said, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever, whatever, whatever.

813
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,469
And of course, I recognize this podcast is targeted towards security people.

814
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:41,540
So, you know,

815
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:45,329
-- but,
-- well, I, I think it's, it's hard because it's part of it is admitting

816
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:49,520
it's not that we're wrong so much as that we've been looking at this wrong because

817
00:33:49,689 --> 00:33:50,739
I'm beginning. Ok?

818
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:52,459
No, man, I'm gonna stop you right there.

819
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,000
The oas

820
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:53,449
do

821
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:56,819
10, basically hasn't changed in the last 10 years.

822
00:33:56,849 --> 00:34:01,319
Like we clearly are doing something wrong because if we were giving advice,

823
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:03,839
it would be a different list every couple of years.

824
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:04,670
Well,

825
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,010
the thing is you can give good advice but people

826
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,080
ignore it or people keep building their own stuff.

827
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,770
And I think this is one of the strengths of open sources. Ideally,

828
00:34:11,938 --> 00:34:14,739
you can get a good framework, you can get good crypto libraries,

829
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,168
you can get good off libraries

830
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:18,949
and if you use them correctly, and that's the other challenge, right?

831
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:22,000
You can still use frameworks and use them wrong,

832
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,300
right?

833
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,659
I mean, it's getting some of them are making it harder and harder,

834
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:26,899
which I think is really good.

835
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,969
But a lot of frameworks unfortunately take the the idea of like, well,

836
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:33,770
we're just a framework, we're not going to enforce policy or security,

837
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,560
that's kind of up to the end user, right?

838
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:37,280
And so, for example,

839
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,458
they might, you know, make it a lot easier to say,

840
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,840
turn off session tokens than it should be,

841
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,520
right?

842
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:43,820
Um

843
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,978
But I think that's one of the benefits of this open source, you know,

844
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:50,370
world we live in is that we have access to these frameworks like say Ruby on rails,

845
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:50,478
right?

846
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,929
If you use Ruby on rails

847
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,250
even remotely correct,

848
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,159
it's like all of a sudden most of your like cross site

849
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:58,280
request forgery and like cross site

850
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,659
scripting vulnerabilities just magically go away

851
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:05,770
you know, things like authentication and session handling,

852
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,669
just magic, it happens, right? You, you can still mess it up

853
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,510
but it, it becomes,

854
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:15,870
you, you have to definitely make more of a mistake than like, oops, we made a typo,

855
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,629
you know,

856
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,669
and I think that's what I kind of find most frustrating about.

857
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,360
A lot of security flaws is a lot of them are not

858
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:25,250
like some giant chain of complicated events and, you know,

859
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,669
everything aligned just right.

860
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:29,750
Typically it's like a bunch of really simplistic mistakes,

861
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,629
you know, any one of which really probably should not have been made.

862
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,510
Yeah, but look man, I mean,

863
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,919
what you described is not wrong.

864
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:41,100
What kind of advice are we giving people that they can use?

865
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,550
Like my favorite example is

866
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,290
people will say, you know, don't, don't click on links, pay attention to links,

867
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:47,820
you click on it.

868
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,290
That's the dumbest

869
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:50,510
advice in

870
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,510
-- the world. And
-- how do you implement it?

871
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,540
Because for example, every single link on Twitter is t.co or whatever,

872
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,010
some some URL shortener.

873
00:35:58,879 --> 00:35:59,939
So I don't know where it goes.

874
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,540
I can't until I,

875
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:03,669
-- you
-- know what

876
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,739
this is, this is just pushing responsibility onto someone else.

877
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,739
So you can say, oh no, I'm the security guy. I told them pay attention to the

878
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,370
link you click on, right? Not my fault.

879
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,429
And it's like

880
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:18,030
no like you failed in countless other ways.

881
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,810
And now you're blaming the user for, for not listening to your terrible advice.

882
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:25,610
Well, I mean, this goes back to the classic, you know, usability versus security

883
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,010
and I think where security got it wrong is that we sort of made

884
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,620
security is so hard in most cases that you had to give up usability and

885
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,780
the reality is you can have

886
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:40,179
-- no good security without having to give up usability.
-- We, we thought

887
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,889
that was an option

888
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,540
and the reality is

889
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,760
usability wins every time it's not security or usability, it's usability.

890
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,510
And that's what I mean is you have to

891
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,760
have security that does not impact the usability.

892
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,830
And as it turns out there is actually a lot of good

893
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,479
security stuff you can do that really doesn't impact usability that much.

894
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,229
You know, the problem is most of those things take

895
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:06,350
a lot more effort on the back end and a lot more cleverness,

896
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,060
you know, things like like a great example is Apple's Face ID, right?

897
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,739
That is not at all a simple thing to do,

898
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:15,949
right? That is a horrendously complex thing to build.

899
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,590
But once you've built it and it works,

900
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:19,709
all your users are like, yeah, I just,

901
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:24,209
well, basically I just hold my phone and then it magically says, yeah, that's you,

902
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:25,090
you can use me

903
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:26,030
and you know,

904
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,989
and there's been all these articles about people wearing hats and

905
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,080
scarves and makeup and trying to fool it and blah,

906
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,610
blah, blah,

907
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,489
you know, and it apparently works quite well.

908
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,590
And so I

909
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,409
think that's maybe part of the problem is traditionally, you know,

910
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,969
to build these like two factor authentication systems

911
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:43,370
used to be horrendously complicated to build,

912
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,870
right? So most people are like, well, you have user name and password. Good luck.

913
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,810
Yes. You know.

914
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:53,610
Um and, but now we have, you know, these frameworks, these, you know,

915
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,750
you can or you should be able to easily enable most things for single sign on

916
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,229
with whatever, you know, back end it is that you prefer active directory,

917
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,580
Kos LDA whatever, right?

918
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,489
But that basically means that your,

919
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:10,040
your ops team and your admin team and your security team are

920
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,800
gonna have to do some extra work to benefit the users,

921
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,129
right? And a lot of these people

922
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,229
uh well, I mean, I've, you know, not all it shops are good and caring about their use.

923
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,229
-- But again,
-- we're gonna, I mean, we, we,

924
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,679
so II I think we're proving the point here is we've already

925
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:30,370
devolved into talking about solutions when we started on actionable advice.

926
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:31,330
But like

927
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:36,449
talking about a is a great example where look at, look at password advice.

928
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,989
Oh, use it, use a strong password, change your password all the time.

929
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,189
And,

930
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,429
and we think we have all this stuff and the reality is

931
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:45,510
it didn't work and we weren't telling people anything useful and,

932
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,909
and there's people still telling this to him,

933
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,429
right?

934
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,489
-- It's,
-- well, I, one of the biggest problems I have is

935
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:56,580
all the people that want autocomplete equals off on password fields in web apps.

936
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,459
And I'm like, no, that's wrong now because

937
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,840
you need to let people use password managers

938
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:04,320
and they're like, oh, what about brute force attacks? And I'm like, yeah.

939
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:09,709
-- No, that doesn't.
-- What? Right. It's, no, I, yes, I agree completely. And again,

940
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:15,149
this is one of those places we're not giving out good advice. Right.

941
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,800
It's, it's very difficult for people to grasp what's going on. And I mean, like,

942
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,840
or, or I'm gonna pick on training.

943
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,699
I, I

944
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:24,280
hear people keep saying, oh, you know, train your staff.

945
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:28,000
Just, just if, if, if you have, if you have security training it'll,

946
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,020
-- it'll reduce your number of incidents and I
-- keep

947
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:30,419
the

948
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:31,590
training.

949
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
Yeah, like, like,

950
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:34,620
right. And I keep thinking,

951
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,790
where is the data

952
00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:37,939
that shows this work?

953
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:41,110
And of course, people never show me data when I ask them for it because I,

954
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,169
I suspect it doesn't exist and I'm pretty sure this training doesn't work

955
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:47,899
-- and, and,
-- well, you'd have to do, like, a double blind study. You'd have to properly,

956
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:50,010
you know, you'd have to spend some good money on this and,

957
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,310
and more to the point, like,

958
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,739
you've always read those things where people send

959
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,669
out fishing links in emails and it's like

960
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:58,110
it, well, from every single article I've ever read about it,

961
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,699
it seems like the vast majority end up clicking on it.

962
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,209
Yeah. Even the security people do Right.

963
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:05,270
Well, not only that I remember

964
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:08,260
taking, like, the, the corporate ethics training every year

965
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:09,270
and,

966
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,379
and there were,

967
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:13,989
there were a bunch of people like the game was who could get through it the fastest.

968
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,399
Right.

969
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:14,830
Like,

970
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,340
we're not learning anything from that training and if

971
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,750
you have security training that's what's going to happen.

972
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:23,360
No one's actually going to learn anything from it and in some cases

973
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,510
it might make it worse because today they're probably giving out advice like,

974
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,590
oh, use a strong password, you know,

975
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,000
and change it every seven days and no, just don't, don't do any of that stuff.

976
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:33,909
Yeah, I mean,

977
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:37,639
a part of the problem is it's to design experiments to properly test this and

978
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:40,770
then execute those experiments would be extremely costly

979
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,810
and who's going to pay for that?

980
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,989
Uh Well, let's turn it on its head

981
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:44,989
and say,

982
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,260
prove the training works

983
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:50,659
versus proving it doesn't because proving a negative is,

984
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:52,250
is obviously like impossible.

985
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:52,840
True.

986
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,659
Part of the challenge there though is you,

987
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:57,860
you're going against what is considered the established.

988
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,919
Like, of course it works. We know this, these rocks keep tigers away

989
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,540
-- because there's no tigers around here.
-- That's exactly right.

990
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,610
And, and this is where we come back to our advice. Then of

991
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:12,090
we, you know, we'll just tell people, oh, don't click on links, you know, good job.

992
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,649
I, I did my work today

993
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,629
and it's, it's madness, man.

994
00:41:15,979 --> 00:41:17,080
Well, like, you know,

995
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,689
the biggest thing I see is I want my web

996
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:21,090
browser just to be able to handle like there's no

997
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,090
content I loaded my web browser in a normal way.

998
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,389
That is to say clicking a link that should result in my computer being on,

999
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:29,610
I think

1000
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,449
just flat out and same with email that should just not happen.

1001
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:34,040
Those are reasonable requirements.

1002
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:34,750
Yeah.

1003
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:35,520
You know,

1004
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,639
um

1005
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:39,550
because there's no way I can control my web browser

1006
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,860
encounters online because I have to go to websites,

1007
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,719
I don't control,

1008
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,790
you know, I go to cnn.com now and I'm noticing they have those sponsored content,

1009
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,120
weird stuff at the bottom for like

1010
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,250
really dodgy looking, fraudulent type stuff,

1011
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,370
you know, like diet, like literally

1012
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,189
like this diet you'll never believe. Right? And it's like this is cnn.com.

1013
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,820
This is supposed to be a reputable news site.

1014
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,439
I hear it's not fake news now, Kurt. Right? Like, yeah,

1015
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:08,120
yeah, sad, fake news, very dying media.

1016
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,489
But I mean, that's the thing, right? Is

1017
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:11,929
all these websites that I'm, you know, are

1018
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,790
supposed to be relatively trustworthy organizations.

1019
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,000
They're like loading content from. Lord knows where.

1020
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,159
Uh Yeah, because they want to sell their ads

1021
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,179
and, and you know,

1022
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:25,110
this is actually one of the places that I think the the sites that are now like Mining

1023
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:25,800
Monaro

1024
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,989
with my, with my web browser.

1025
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,639
I would rather every website on the planet Mine

1026
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:36,719
Monaro with, with my browser than showing me an ad like any day.

1027
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:40,389
In fact, if you told me you were doing it, I would even hang out on your site for, like,

1028
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:41,479
five minutes.

1029
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,189
Well, we'll talk about that. We're going to be doing a Bitcoin episode.

1030
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,989
But, and we'll talk about that. But, yeah, it's,

1031
00:42:48,169 --> 00:42:49,500
I, I don't know, it's,

1032
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:54,070
I, I do know a lot of the traditional business models are definitely not working.

1033
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,649
We know they're not working. We just don't have any idea what to replace.

1034
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,919
It sounds like security, right? Like it's,

1035
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,550
it's, it's not working. We don't know what to do and, and

1036
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,139
yeah,

1037
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,629
well, I think, you know, I, I see a lot of stuff where we could, we could and do,

1038
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:07,070
do better.

1039
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,659
So, for example,

1040
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,239
making the assumption that people have smartphones all of a sudden, you know,

1041
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:11,219
you can push

1042
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,729
two factor authentication via applications or S MS or,

1043
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,419
you know, like the, the new Google one where it, it, well,

1044
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,219
same like the Apple one where it basically sends

1045
00:43:20,229 --> 00:43:21,629
you a message and the little app says,

1046
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,659
you know, hey, somebody's trying to access your account from like

1047
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,580
Uzbekistan. Is that cool?

1048
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,919
Like, is it you,

1049
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,860
and if you're ok with this, then, you know,

1050
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,719
we're going to display a six digit number that we're going to force you to poke in,

1051
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,229
um, to make sure that you really, you know,

1052
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,360
hopefully don't hose this up and like Google, you know, I, they just opened that, uh,

1053
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:40,979
program now for high security for, you know,

1054
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:43,479
at risk accounts of like human rights organizers and whatnot,

1055
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:47,669
where literally they do have state level actors trying to attack them.

1056
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,469
And Google's like, yeah, you know, we're, we're gonna protect you.

1057
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:52,570
It's gonna be kind of annoying because for example,

1058
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,110
we will not let non Google apps access your Google account.

1059
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,820
You're just gonna have to live without that. Right.

1060
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,469
And I mean, I'm assuming that right there

1061
00:43:59,629 --> 00:44:01,870
cuts out so many attacks.

1062
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:02,600
Yeah.

1063
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:06,790
Yeah. No, I get it. I get it and, and I guess this is

1064
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,409
going back to the beginning. We

1065
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,360
we'll tie it all up with this

1066
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:16,080
is there are certain people in certain situations

1067
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,399
that necessitate added security,

1068
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,139
but for the vast majority of people they don't need it,

1069
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,620
right? Like, like let's face it, you and I

1070
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,679
don't really worry about assassins breaking into our homes, right.

1071
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:31,110
That's, that's not really on my list of things that keep me up at night

1072
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:34,800
and, but there are people that it is on their list, right?

1073
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:35,909
And, and

1074
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,360
it's the same deal with like Google and Apt

1075
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,969
style attacks is there are users that could necessitate the added protections

1076
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:48,780
and it's awesome that they're doing that because again, this is like,

1077
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,300
oh, you know, hey, Mr President, don't click on links on Twitter, you know.

1078
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:56,040
No, that's, that's bad advice. Just don't, don't give that to them.

1079
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:58,850
That's someone you just protect in an extra special way

1080
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,659
and So,

1081
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:03,739
yeah. II, I think it's all tied together is

1082
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,530
there, there's always varying levels of security

1083
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:08,340
and there's varying levels of advice.

1084
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,590
And I think part of the trick is understanding, you know,

1085
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,889
what is my actual threat model and where do I fit in?

1086
00:45:13,899 --> 00:45:17,649
Because especially security people, we love to put our tinfoil hats on and,

1087
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:19,489
and make up things that are never going to happen,

1088
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:22,850
which means we're not focusing on the things that could happen,

1089
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,649
which is where we should be paying attention.

1090
00:45:24,899 --> 00:45:25,310
Right.

1091
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,050
Sweet.

1092
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,969
Yeah. No, I think, I think the

1093
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,899
security industry is starting to mature a bit in that.

1094
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:33,899
Like, I know my,

1095
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:37,340
my sort of view of security now is more wrapped around

1096
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,790
sort of quality of life rather than this sort of arbitrary,

1097
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,409
you know, like the, the traditional risk slash

1098
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,149
impact slash, you know, monetary value of such,

1099
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,770
you know, there's, there's,

1100
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,520
we need to start thinking about quality of life because for example,

1101
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,419
if somebody breaks a whole pile of door locks,

1102
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,320
you know, I'm less concerned about denial of service,

1103
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,409
I'm more concerned about a whole bunch of

1104
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:58,659
people standing outside in the cold in winter

1105
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,810
and, and from the security perspective,

1106
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,610
uh that's not how he would look at it traditionally.

1107
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:04,370
So,

1108
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:07,729
no, I agree. I agree, man. I, I think that might be the,

1109
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:11,570
the happy thought to, to end this one is,

1110
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,919
you know, making sure we keep things in context.

1111
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,719
I, I think you go a long, long way

1112
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,760
and, and we fail at that a lot. So

1113
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:21,040
thank you folks for listening.

you have a great rest of the day and

1119
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,739

uh, don't stare at the side.

1121
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,860
That is,

1122
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,229
that is very, very good advice.

1123
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:47,909
The.
