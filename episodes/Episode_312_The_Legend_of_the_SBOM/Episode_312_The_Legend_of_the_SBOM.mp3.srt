Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself. Kri

1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:08,890
Siefried

2
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:13,149
-- and my partner, not believing squirrels exist. Josh Pressers, they
-- exist.

3
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:16,700
Why would I? I hate them. I hate them so much if they don't exist.

4
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,700
-- I have all this misplaced
-- rage.

5
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,930
The government had them all killed a few years

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,510
back and replaced them with robots because they,

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,489
have you ever seen squirrel poop?

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,770
-- And the answer is no, you haven't.
-- No, I have

9
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:29,370
because they lived in my garage and trust me,

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,009
they use the toilet inside of the structure they're living in and it is

11
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:35,599
beyond disgusting.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,880
So, yes, I have seen vast quantities of squirrel poop and other squirrel

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,130
things we'll say.

14
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:45,389
And it's gross and terrible and the smell is

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,389
unbelievably bad.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,779
Interesting. I would have thought it was a little herbivores.

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,009
Their poop wouldn't be that offensive.

18
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,040
It is disgusting.

19
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:56,490
Well, the poop isn't, I don't think, are they herbivores? Are they omnivores?

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,130
-- I don't know. Actually, I thought they were
-- herbivores.

21
00:00:58,139 --> 00:00:59,810
I mean, they're awful small for omnivores.

22
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:03,729
I've seen pictures of squirrels eating like pizza in New York.

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,110
I mean, I don't, I don't know.

24
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,330
-- I don't know. That's
-- a good question.

25
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:09,019
But even like deer and horses will, you know,

26
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,779
there's that famous video of the horse just eats a baby chick on the ground.

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,449
It's just kind of like,

28
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:12,629
uh,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,180
I don't think I've seen that, but

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,809
I don't, I don't need to either.

31
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:17,150
Oh,

32
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,489
they are? Omnivores.

33
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,900
I mean, that, that was kind of my assumption.

34
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,550
Yeah. Eggs, eggs, insects. Oh, insects. I always forget about insects.

35
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,230
There's lots of bugs.

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,220
Yeah. Well, they'll even eat snakes. I mean,

37
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,430
I kind of like snakes so I'm ok with that.

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,540
I live in a place without poisonous snakes, so I'm not afraid of them, which I love.

39
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,349
They're interesting.

40
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,629
Anyway. Anyway, what,

41
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,349
so we're talking about the contents of stuff today?

42
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,230
Well, kind of. So

43
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,839
we're gonna talk about S

44
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,019
bombs and

45
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,269
this is a topic. I've been kind of kicking around for a long time.

46
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:52,699
It's something near and dear to my heart. Obviously I work at

47
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,690
Acor, we deal with S

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,449
bombs all the time. It's kind of one of our things we do

49
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,430
and

50
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:58,870
it, it finally,

51
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,879
I think has reached the point where it's time for

52
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:03,360
us to have a discussion about it because I feel like

53
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,819
everyone is talking about S bombs and

54
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:10,649
at first it was a very, oh, you need this, you need this, everyone needs to do this.

55
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,470
And now I think we finally hit the point where people are saying, wait a minute,

56
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,580
like what's actually going on here

57
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:19,789
and I'm seeing a lot of old man yells at cloud responses and it's like,

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,970
that's not very good either.

59
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:25,690
So I feel like this is a great opportunity for us to just kind of

60
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:27,889
explain what's happening.

61
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:31,160
-- No,
-- I think we're firmly going towards the trough of disillusionment where,

62
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:33,050
yeah, we, we passed the,

63
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:37,440
the S balm hype peak and it's kind of like not only well and what I love about

64
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,240
these hype cycles now is they're going so fast

65
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,160
that we're not even getting people to deploy them.

66
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,360
They're like,

67
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,869
basically like maybe one person in the industry is doing s

68
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:46,910
-- somewhat,
-- I,

69
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,190
I'm surprised if it's that high

70
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:50,389
and you know,

71
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,229
the rest are not even at the point of doing

72
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,320
it and they've already gone to the trough of disillusionment,

73
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:55,600
the trough of,

74
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,720
I can't even talk anyway.

75
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,169
Let's start out by explaining what an

76
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:01,259
bomb actually is.

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,100
I think

78
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:05,309
this isn't completely obvious all the time and

79
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,259
I hear a lot of different explanations.

80
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,220
Some people say, oh, it's an ingredients list.

81
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:12,350
And then there's some people saying, oh, it's not an ingredients list and whatever.

82
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,220
And it doesn't matter.

83
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,000
Fundamentally, all this thing is, it's a software bill of materials.

84
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,820
It's meant to be a list of all of the

85
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,860
stuff that makes up a particular piece of software.

86
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,270
Right?

87
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:24,250
And then you hear people talk about, oh, well,

88
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,220
maybe you only do one level of dependencies.

89
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:31,089
-- No, it's everything in the software full stop
-- the problem there becomes what if the

90
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,800
also depends on a service

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,080
-- that
-- is not something I'm aware of having a good solution for. And that's off topic.

92
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:39,419
-- So you're not, I'm not going to let you derail us.
-- OK?

93
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,000
So we're going to abstract away services because like literally

94
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,690
the great example would be Microsoft Office.

95
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,479
Microsoft Office depends on a license service run by Microsoft, which of course has

96
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,029
only God knows what Rube Goldberg contraption on the back.

97
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,919
Ignore that.

98
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:51,529
That's

99
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,660
so basically we're gonna abstract to actual bits that are sitting on my computer.

100
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,960
That's right. When you download the the zip file of whatever it is, you're doing

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,100
everything in that zip file.

102
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:07,199
-- That's what we're talking about
-- and, and I would point out so to skip away ahead.

103
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,020
But one of the aspects of

104
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,029
ssal is there's,

105
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,139
there's, well, two aspects either you get the SS bomb from the vendor

106
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,250
and or you generate the S bomb yourself and obviously you can

107
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:18,048
only generate an S bomb yourself on stuff that you have.

108
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,790
We're

109
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:19,130
a

110
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,209
service reliably.

111
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,855
Yeah, you can't, you can't s bomb services.

112
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,524
But that's an important I think point that I

113
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:28,674
hear a lot of people confusing about the the

114
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,135
acquiring an S bomb versus generating S bomb because

115
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:33,595
both those steps are important for different reasons.

116
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:38,904
So OK, so we have this document that's meant to be a list of all of the things

117
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:42,105
in your stuff. And there's

118
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,761
talking about 01 level deep in your dependencies, whatever.

119
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:49,212
No, that's all nonsense. You go everything in there. Literally everything.

120
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,471
I don't care if it's

121
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:53,231
100 dependencies deep. It makes the list.

122
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:54,951
-- Like,
-- dude, I remember at Red Hat,

123
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,462
like some of those jar files had stuff embedded in them with a zip.

124
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:01,291
Like I remember actually when uh what was it cloud forms triggered that clim.

125
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,342
A clim A V for some reason, had a stupid,

126
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,480
uh double zip file signature for a while where like if a zip was in a zip,

127
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:08,549
it would trigger cli maybe.

128
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,230
And I'm like

129
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,070
a,

130
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,320
that's actually a reasonably normal thing to have because

131
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,579
if you heard about Java and number two,

132
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,019
-- how like does any malware actually do that?
-- Like that?

133
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,149
Lots of malware does actually they like to hide themselves,

134
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,000
-- who cares
-- then just detect the malware?

135
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,940
-- Well, so it's complicated
-- though.

136
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,190
I know, but it's, it was a super false positive and, you know,

137
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,630
I had to write a knowledge piece article about

138
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,489
it because customers were freaking out and I'm like,

139
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:35,079
no, we're not infected with anyways. It's not a tumor.

140
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,019
Yes,

141
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,450
-- in my head is not a tumor.
-- Exactly. That.

142
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,570
And that's

143
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:40,130
a, well,

144
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,250
we can talk about that another time because there's a lot of weirdness to that.

145
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,970
What you're saying is you need to account for

146
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,899
literally every single bit in that piece of software.

147
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,019
Otherwise it's not an S balm it's a partial ss balm

148
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:54,290
and the partial s balm is like having

149
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,170
-- anything that's partial. It's worse may
-- contain nuts

150
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,250
if you're allergic to

151
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,970
something says may contain nuts. You're going to assume it does

152
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:03,570
and

153
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,160
may contain squirrels.

154
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,660
No, just, no,

155
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:07,540
they're all robots.

156
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:10,420
Now, remember anyway, that's why you don't want those sharp pieces.

157
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,570
So, anyway, right.

158
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:17,130
Like if, if you had a bag of chips that said may contain metal shards,

159
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,989
would you be like, I'll roll those dice.

160
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,450
No, you're not gonna roll those dice.

161
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:22,299
So anyway,

162
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,000
kind of, I, I guess

163
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,010
aspect number one of, of my talking point is the bomb has to be everything, right?

164
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,250
And now we're gonna get to kind of this,

165
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,089
there's also becoming a lot of talk around.

166
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:38,929
Should we have completely trusted environments generating

167
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,049
bombs? We need to

168
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,024
all of our s bombs we need to,

169
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:42,734
you know what I mean?

170
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:46,894
It's reminiscent of that very, if you're not doing it 100% perfect,

171
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:48,015
it's not worth doing at all,

172
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:52,054
which I think was a very common view in security a decade ago.

173
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:57,734
What this reminds me of is and I had to look this up back in November 22nd of 2016.

174
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,619
Uh episode 14,

175
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,369
we interviewed David A Wheeler about the ci I

176
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,250
badges and he pointed out a really good thing,

177
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,809
which was

178
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,750
you get a badge for having a testing framework,

179
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,309
even if there's no test because the testing framework with no test

180
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,790
is, gives you the possibility of plugging a test in

181
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,579
not having a testing framework means

182
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,350
you still have a blank page.

183
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,899
And I think in the context of this S bomb discussion,

184
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:23,100
it is

185
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,850
AAA an S bomb of questionable level of trust is better than no S bomb at all.

186
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:29,489
And now granted,

187
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,489
I would love to see like hermetic build environments with signatures

188
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,760
everywhere and whatever it's fully reproducible and all that jazz.

189
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:37,760
But we're not there yet.

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,450
And I think claiming S bombs are invalid somehow is that is red

191
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:43,363
point.

192
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,622
Well, more to the point, this is how we get there because

193
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:47,722
the other thing is for people to say

194
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:48,893
like,

195
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:51,173
well, I know uh uh remind me again,

196
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:53,282
which one is it gripe or sift that actually does the S bomb

197
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,852
-- uh
-- sift creates S bombs. That's one of

198
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:57,122
-- Acors
-- tools.

199
00:07:57,282 --> 00:08:00,243
There was that chart showing, you know, if you uh for the log for J thing,

200
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,572
like if you run a find command, it'll basically find

201
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,382
that was actually gripe

202
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:05,423
in that chart

203
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,632
anyways.

204
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:08,423
Well, the point was, you know,

205
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:11,083
there's like all these different sort of approaches to the technology.

206
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,675
-- Right. Right.
-- And part of it is, and I hate to say this, but doing S

207
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,776
bombs properly means

208
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:19,145
you need to understand a whole bunch of different file formats.

209
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:21,656
And some of these file formats are like docker containers.

210
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:24,705
They are not a simple zip file. Like it's Exactly.

211
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,496
Yeah. It's, it's like

212
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:27,786
a, it's complicated

213
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:32,716
and the way we get to a complete S bomb is by having incomplete S bombs along the way.

214
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:33,966
-- Right.
-- Right. Exactly.

215
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:37,806
And, and the tools get better with every iteration, which is hugely important. OK.

216
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:39,755
So there's kind of this aspect of trust

217
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:40,556
and

218
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,780
figuring out like, can I trust yes

219
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:43,150
bomb?

220
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,030
But then I think that now the next kind of thing that I think is really important is

221
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,010
there's also this concept of when should we scan our, our software? Like do we,

222
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,520
let's say the vendor gives me an S bomb? Am I done?

223
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,239
What about when I'm going to deploy a container? Should I scan it then?

224
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,349
And I'm done or what about during the build? Should I scan the build that I'm done?

225
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,359
And the actual answer is you should be scanned

226
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:05,405
for S bomb content

227
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,325
anytime anything happens if you're doing a code check and scan it,

228
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:12,344
if you're doing a build, scan it, if you're turning it into container, scan it,

229
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:15,085
if you're deploying the container, scan it, if it's Tuesday scan it,

230
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:15,674
you know what I mean?

231
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:19,635
You actually forgot one important case which is your S bomb tool improves

232
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,554
scan it.

233
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:25,125
Like you if your S bomb tool gets better rerun it all to get better results.

234
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,369
That's another important point is in theory, the SBA

235
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,650
is static, but it actually isn't because

236
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:33,039
one of the one of the other kind of myths.

237
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:33,059
I,

238
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,429
I hear is there seems to be this concept of expecting like a human being to build this.

239
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,729
No way.

240
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:44,280
There's, there is no software on the planet that a human can actually

241
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,679
manually deal with and understand what's in it. It's all too complicated.

242
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,559
Now, we need robots

243
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,619
-- and they can't do it reliably or
-- no, no, not at all.

244
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,919
They can't do it reliably or

245
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:54,359
inducive

246
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:55,359
or quickly.

247
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,179
And so what happens is so I might scan my container and I generate an S bomb, right?

248
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,700
And then a new, let's say, in six months,

249
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,770
there's like 10 revisions of the S bomb scanner that have been released.

250
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,880
I rescan it and now the S bomb scanner

251
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,909
can find some new things it couldn't find before,

252
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,260
right?

253
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,210
In theory that should be a static document. But the reality is it's not.

254
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:20,039
Well, I remember one software product, not at Red Hat. Thank goodness. But

255
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,700
the the software product actually shipped

256
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,960
with like a virtual file system that you then mounted locally on the file system,

257
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:30,130
like an iso file could be mounted, you know,

258
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,409
and then that's where it ran the software from.

259
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,039
-- I mean, that's basically how containers work,
-- right? But I mean, I like just

260
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,659
the there's a people really forget

261
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,859
that there are so

262
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,299
many complexities that people use

263
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:48,650
and they're not corner cases like they're not rare like a

264
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,820
Java inside a Java inside a container inside of a jet.

265
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,489
Like that's not actually as rare as you would like it to be. No, no, it's, it's not.

266
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,450
And I think that's what's going to be fascinating to me is

267
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,460
as we actually unpack all this,

268
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:03,570
because we've already kind of had this argument around

269
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,229
licensing where you have to know every everything,

270
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,130
every single thing you ship for licensing compliance,

271
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,429
especially in the open source world.

272
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,729
Right?

273
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,330
And in theory,

274
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,179
so like we should

275
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:17,065
already kind of have S bombs solved in the sense of if,

276
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,005
if you claim to have licensing compliance,

277
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:21,945
then you are also claiming to know every single bit in your software.

278
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:24,346
That's right. And now it should also be noted that

279
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:26,416
there are kind of two primary S

280
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:31,156
bomb formats. Right. Now, there's something called SPDX and cycle. And DXSPDX is a

281
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:34,935
branch of the Linux Foundation, Cyclin DX is part of OAP.

282
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:38,585
Now, SPDX started its life as

283
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:42,505
licensing where the intent was, this was a document format that was,

284
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:45,601
it's meant to capture open source components and their licenses.

285
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:47,122
And in fact, even today,

286
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:51,291
SPDX has a very like strict list of licenses you're allowed to put in.

287
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:53,132
Like if you don't use one of the licenses on their list,

288
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:55,481
you're technically not producing an SPDX document

289
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:55,651
that's

290
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:56,062
gonna have to

291
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:56,421
change,

292
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:56,572
it

293
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:57,851
creates some headaches.

294
00:11:57,861 --> 00:11:58,601
But well, I mean,

295
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,562
part of me understands why they do it because you also don't

296
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:04,702
want like you want one way to denote Apache two licenses,

297
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:07,221
you don't want some people putting spaces, some people not putting spaces,

298
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:08,531
some people capitalizing Apache.

299
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,831
You know what I mean? It creates a mess. But anyway, anyway,

300
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,159
like that is where that started. Its life was licenses. And

301
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,869
I mean, this is another thing that

302
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:18,330
like when you're doing S

303
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:18,929
bomb,

304
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:23,039
you can kind of get license management for free as part of this because

305
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,489
these S

306
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,780
bomb formats also capture licenses as part of their data set.

307
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,630
Well, yeah, that's kind of important.

308
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,219
Like it always blows my mind that people just for the longest time,

309
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:35,539
we just sort of all ignored licensing like it was basically

310
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:37,469
either commercial or open source and it was open source.

311
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:41,559
We just, everybody used it and did whatever with it and ignored the actual words.

312
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:46,299
No, I, I agree or, or people specifically avoided open source because they,

313
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,250
they heard about the new GP L and oh,

314
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,469
it's the license is viral and I'm going to have to

315
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,729
like give all my money to hippies if I use the software

316
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:53,299
or something.

317
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,210
Microsoft Open sources of cancer back in 2001.

318
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,549
-- Was it
-- open? Snow? Linux.

319
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,869
Linux is a cancer, right?

320
00:12:58,989 --> 00:12:59,700
Linux is a cancer.

321
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:02,390
Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember when,

322
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,159
when I worked at Progeny Linux systems way back in the early two thousands,

323
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:07,650
we had a poster we hung up.

324
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:11,349
That was, it was like, remember kids or remember kids when you're, when you're,

325
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,190
when you're using open

326
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,419
-- source, you're supporting communism and it
-- showed like in

327
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:16,099
the background,

328
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,989
it was such a good poster

329
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,989
and of course, we laughed at all this stuff and we thought it was great. But I mean,

330
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,190
man,

331
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,989
but, you know, and,

332
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,070
and now we've reached a point where I think there's a lot of lawyers who

333
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,469
understand this stuff and they're starting to recognize

334
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:34,229
that certain licenses come with certain requirements.

335
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,859
And so you just have to be mindful and it's not even about like,

336
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,520
oh you can or can't use this or whatever.

337
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,570
It's just let's make sure we're not, you know, violating any terms of our,

338
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,859
you

339
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,830
have to use it now because if you,

340
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:48,330
the time it takes to rewrite one of these components, your competitors,

341
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,219
your launch

342
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:53,049
right, right now. Now that also kind of brings up

343
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,059
another part of all this. I think that's really funny is

344
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:59,909
I see people that so they, they get their ass bomb.

345
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,500
They look at the list, they're horrified by what they see.

346
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,270
They're like, let's just write a bunch of this ourselves. It's like

347
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,349
that is,

348
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,510
that is a terrible idea.

349
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,250
This reminds me of in theory,

350
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,320
if you had a proper housing inspection where the guy like

351
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,789
drilled holes in your house and like stuck a Boer cam in

352
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,729
and you know, they would just find so many horrifying things.

353
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:20,250
Squirrels, squirrels every day.

354
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,979
Like this is one of the reasons whenever like

355
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:24,710
the last two houses I've lived in and bought

356
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,440
unfinished basements because I no longer trust finished basements.

357
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:30,250
Right.

358
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,700
Whatever, who cares?

359
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,239
Well, this one, the last, this one and the last one I had, you know,

360
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,059
cracks in the foundation and because they're exposed is

361
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:37,710
easy to deal with,

362
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,650
you know, and so this one here,

363
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:43,299
there was a minor crack where the forms anyways, the point is

364
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:44,530
like, I no longer,

365
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,570
I don't trust housing inspections because they miss stuff all the time.

366
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,190
Kind of like bad ass bomb tools.

367
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,090
But more to the point, the reality is all of this stuff. Like is

368
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,210
a horror show.

369
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:59,090
Like this is the food safety industry 50 years ago where it's like may contain

370
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,210
100 years ago. I think

371
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:01,849
we're still

372
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,090
lead in the tea

373
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,780
to make the leaves look fresh,

374
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,070
throw some chalk in that milk, it'll be fine.

375
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:12,489
OK? So I, we, we've just spent a lot of time and we, we oddly talked about it.

376
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,380
I think some of the setup here, but now I, I want to spend a little time as well about.

377
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,669
So there's all these weird myths around

378
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:18,929
eal

379
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,320
what it can do, what it can't do.

380
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,150
And

381
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,969
yeah, you hear a lot of people saying, oh, you need an S bomb, you need an S,

382
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:26,400
you need an S bomb. But then they're not like, well, why?

383
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,000
Like, why, what, what is the point?

384
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,239
Yeah. My favorite thing is, so you've got an ESB bomb Now what?

385
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,809
Yeah,

386
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,440
like how is this actionable? What are you going to do about it?

387
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,099
It feels like the South Park underpants know him

388
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,380
sometimes where it was like step one steel underpants,

389
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,320
step two question mark, step three profit.

390
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:44,599
And sometimes I think that's like the whole, that's, that's the s bomb story today

391
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,359
because

392
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,640
there's all these people saying you need an S bomb.

393
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:51,390
But there's remarkably few people saying why?

394
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:51,770
Right.

395
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,869
Well, there is, there, now,

396
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,700
there is the federal government in the United States is requiring them.

397
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,960
That's a pretty good why.

398
00:15:56,969 --> 00:16:00,539
But even even at some point, they're gonna say, why are we doing this?

399
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:04,830
I have a Google Drive with 10,000 est bombs in it. What now?

400
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,369
And this is where there's kind of this new branch of products

401
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,390
coming out that we'll call S bomb management or supply chain management.

402
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,590
Because fundamentally if you have a large number of S bombs, which you should,

403
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,330
if you're scanning your stuff many,

404
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,695
many times and you're getting s bombs from vendors.

405
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:24,575
Now you have a lot of these S bombs,

406
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:26,174
you need to do something with them.

407
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:29,505
-- It becomes a data management problem.
-- Well, that's the thing. All problems

408
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,994
essentially at scale become

409
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:36,934
-- data management. Logistics. I
-- mean, so II I have a funny story actually about that.

410
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:37,255
So

411
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:42,525
I was talking to a large software vendor the other day and the person says,

412
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:45,294
uh do we have an ND A in place because without one,

413
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,655
I can't tell you what I want to tell you.

414
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,429
Sorry,

415
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,619
-- I shouldn't laugh.
-- But it's true though. This happens all the time.

416
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,940
Right to all of us anyway. I'm like, hang on, let me go look, you know, call the lawyer

417
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:58,630
and I was like, oh, yeah, we got, we got ND A, it's right here and he hands it to me

418
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:01,250
and it has like an ND A number on the top

419
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,659
and it's in the millions.

420
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:03,869
And I'm thinking

421
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:08,989
this company probably has millions or tens of millions of NDAS in place.

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,410
How do you possibly manage that volume of documents? Right.

423
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,939
Like this isn't, you're not putting these in a Google Drive, you know what I mean?

424
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,069
Like that's, that's a crazy data problem.

425
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,979
I'm sure the lawyers have some database product.

426
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,229
Well. Right. Right.

427
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:25,189
Without question, there's some sort of database you're putting this stuff in.

428
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:27,435
But like you think about that, it's

429
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:31,844
like if you or I had to deal with NDAS, we just create a folder called NDAS. Right?

430
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:33,645
And we put like the four of them we have in it.

431
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:34,405
Whereas,

432
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:38,515
whereas when you're a giant software company or a giant company in general,

433
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,964
I'm sure you're gonna have, you know,

434
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:43,505
thousands to millions of these things and you have to do something with it.

435
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:46,925
And I think s bombs are kind of a similar story where if I have

436
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:47,344
one

437
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,875
-- enterprise loaner shipped with 8000 packages.
-- Yeah,

438
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:51,555
-- Right.
-- Right.

439
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,410
Like you're looking at those containers. Right.

440
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,910
There's like alpine Linux on the small end, like, literally on the small end with,

441
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,550
you know, it's tight, little small world

442
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,670
and then there's,

443
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:06,900
well, but everybody else, we just use ubuntu, like, pretty much a full stack because

444
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,670
-- we just wanted to jam the ruby on rails in there and make it work.
-- Right.

445
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,310
It's, it's easy. I mean. Exactly. Exactly.

446
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:14,150
And now, I mean, that,

447
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,140
that's a whole another problem and we'll talk about the actual content.

448
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,910
I'm just talking about the literal documents itself, right?

449
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:20,780
Because

450
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,430
if, if you're, let's say, generating an S bomb,

451
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,180
every step of your development process,

452
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:30,390
I think you could expect somewhere between 10 and 100 S bombs like per, per version.

453
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,280
In theory,

454
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,300
they'd be really amenable to storing them in something like git because there,

455
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:37,420
there should be relatively small changes between, you know,

456
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,459
runs or versions like you add something or they

457
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:42,040
tool gets better. So it shouldn't take up a huge amount of room.

458
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:45,449
Here's where I want to help educate because you just,

459
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,760
you just fell into the trap of,

460
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:50,369
I guess not managing your documents of

461
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,160
this isn't about tracking the latest version.

462
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,099
-- You, you obviously want the latest copy, but you also want
-- the, oh no,

463
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:58,839
I'm saying you have to track all of them forever.

464
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,699
-- But
-- no, no, you want to be able to look at the differences like here's a great example.

465
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:02,959
Is

466
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:05,609
when I was at a previous company,

467
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:11,479
they there was a version of a product that was released that used Ruby Bundler. OK.

468
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:14,060
And Ruby Bundler had a bug that accidentally

469
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,890
included all the developer dependencies in the release,

470
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,369
right?

471
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:20,650
So the number of dependencies doubled in one release, we didn't know it.

472
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,750
And then someone's like, why did your dependencies double?

473
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,849
And we're like, what now, how the heck do they double? Well, because

474
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,410
Boer normally doesn't include developer dependencies in the the tar ball,

475
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,709
but it had a bug and it did.

476
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:35,560
So now we had all the regular dependencies plus all the development dependencies

477
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,209
in the room.

478
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,650
So the number of dependencies doubled.

479
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,859
And this is where having like espo management

480
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,630
is a real thing because you're going to be able to look and be like, OK,

481
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,729
let me go back over time.

482
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:48,829
-- Holy cow. Why did the dependencies double right here this one time?
-- Sorry.

483
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,760
See in my mind,

484
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,040
the storage of the S bomb data is abstracted from

485
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,650
the actual manipulation and learning something from it because again,

486
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,420
that's going to be another set of tools that

487
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,640
will improve as time goes on because for example,

488
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,290
like I'm not gonna like,

489
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,630
what am I gonna look at ad file and somehow gain knowledge from that?

490
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,829
-- No,
-- you need tools to do this work for you. Absolutely.

491
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,979
And, and this is where that whole like s

492
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,939
a management piece comes from or

493
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,180
like another good example is, let's say

494
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,869
you've got a,

495
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,270
a relatively flat number of dependencies and all of a sudden you add it

496
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,790
to your container and now your dependency rate went up by 10 times like,

497
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,780
well, what did we just do?

498
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,900
And that actually happens.

499
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,150
I got a little demo I give of that where if you use the, the uh node

500
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,599
container,

501
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:33,609
it, first of all is full of vulnerabilities.

502
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:36,319
It has like 1000 vulnerabilities that, that's a different problem.

503
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:39,589
But it also includes like 1300 N PM packages in it,

504
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,530
right?

505
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:42,030
I mean,

506
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,410
it's one of those things. It does work. It totally works.

507
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:48,369
But you can see obviously if you use the alpine container,

508
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,719
you have no vulnerabilities.

509
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:54,689
And if you do no container, you have like 1100. And so it's a pretty easy demo.

510
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,760
I mean, it'll be a shame if they ever fix it because it,

511
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,250
it won't be as fun to watch.

512
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,839
But, you know, I mean, I mean, and,

513
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:04,199
and this is where I think you can start thinking kind of bigger picture about

514
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:07,890
what are these s bombs good for is you can start asking questions about like,

515
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,739
what am I doing?

516
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,719
What's in my software? How does it work?

517
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,680
You can feed them into vulnerability scanners to start getting a feel.

518
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,219
Now, now,

519
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,209
one of the other things that always comes up

520
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:18,780
is people scan their stuff for vulnerabilities and like,

521
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,989
oh, we have to fix them all

522
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:22,939
if you have a like no vulnerabilities in your scan

523
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,560
and 1000 vulnerabilities in your scan are equally bad.

524
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:26,199
Like

525
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,229
that's, that's how that works well, unless it's a scratch container.

526
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,069
But that's another story.

527
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:31,479
So anyway,

528
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:37,619
this is all just a very long and convoluted way of saying that why you need an S bomb is,

529
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,290
isn't there isn't one answer?

530
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,520
It's really about being able to take this data

531
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,670
and turn it into a data management problem.

532
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,439
And then you can start asking questions. You don't even know you have,

533
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:49,463
you know what I'm actually reminded of.

534
00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:54,052
This sounds a lot like the whole intrusion detection systems back in the day.

535
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,802
So this is before we actually had intrusion prevention systems

536
00:21:57,072 --> 00:21:59,642
and one person pointed out because I kind of asked, I'm like, well,

537
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:03,152
like this detection piece is kind of great, but like they've already broken in like,

538
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:04,473
how is this super helpful?

539
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:06,142
And he pointed out what you actually want to do

540
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:08,142
is you have your internet connection,

541
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:12,125
you have an I DS, then you have your firewall proxy scrubber or whatever machine.

542
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:13,666
Then you have another I DS

543
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:15,686
and you compare the delta between the two

544
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:18,436
and then you go to management and say we spent half a million dollars

545
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:22,105
on firewall and proxies and look it scrubbed out 95% of these attacks.

546
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:24,225
And part of it is

547
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:27,395
like, I think that's the kind of stage where we are with Ssal,

548
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:29,076
right? Now is where it's not going to be.

549
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,109
Well, by definition like, OK, great. You've got all these vulnerabilities. Yeah.

550
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,579
Now what?

551
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:36,660
Well, you have to go fix them in some way and, and at scale again,

552
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,699
you can't do this with humans.

553
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:38,459
It has to be

554
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,819
some automation

555
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:43,699
but now you at least know the scope and like the, the,

556
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,670
like the literal magnitude of your problem.

557
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,780
Is it 10, 100 1000 or 10,000?

558
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,459
Because those are very different problems.

559
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,540
Even trying to fix a lot of this with automation is a funny story because I mean,

560
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,390
there's things like depend

561
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:54,579
aot

562
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:55,010
in github

563
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:59,010
and if you turn on the automatic dependency fixes, all you do is

564
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,400
you pull up your tests like no, no, everyone turns it off, you turn it on,

565
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,680
everything explodes, you turn it off, you know what I mean?

566
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:09,170
And I'm not saying it'll never happen but like a a better solution.

567
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,239
Actually, what I see happening in a lot of we'll say well funded organizations

568
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,239
is

569
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:17,880
instead of letting developers just yank down like whatever container they want.

570
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:19,890
They're rolling these like golden images where

571
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,979
they're saying if you need like generic Linux

572
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:23,189
use this

573
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,060
container

574
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:25,180
and then

575
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:29,339
like any vulnerabilities found in the container image, not your problem.

576
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:32,060
Don't worry about it. We'll take care of it. And like that's

577
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,329
brilliant, right? Like that's really cool.

578
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,650
Well, and that's what it should be is abstracting. Like why is my developer

579
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,849
worrying about

580
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:41,660
the, the, the, the runtime environment

581
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:42,650
and

582
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:42,920
they

583
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,469
match it.

584
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:44,280
I don't know.

585
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,719
But what I'm saying is like, but they should, do, they build their own desk?

586
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:50,719
Do they run power for their computer at their desktop?

587
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,959
Do they build a coffee machine from scratch? No, you just

588
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,729
-- provide that. You outsource it.
-- That, that's a good point.

589
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:01,489
And I think run times are becoming commodities where you're not worried about,

590
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,699
you know, handcrafting it.

591
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,839
You're just like whatever, go buy a desk. I don't care.

592
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:06,540
We use Hiroko

593
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:07,520
at the CS A,

594
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,060
I believe it's some variant of ubuntu by default.

595
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,719
You don't care. Right. Exactly. Exactly.

596
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:17,359
Now, now I'll say even though you're using Heroku,

597
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,160
you're still running things on top of it.

598
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,310
And so this is where I think you also run

599
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,500
into this concept in Esma management where for example,

600
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,979
if you're rolling containers

601
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:28,449
there, there's an idea of like,

602
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:32,699
OK, so I want to look at all of the dependencies I picked up that aren't in the base

603
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:33,839
container image, right?

604
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,800
Like that's a valuable question to ask because now

605
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,280
you can throw all that stuff away and say,

606
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,619
what am I actually doing?

607
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,199
And again,

608
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:42,760
if we have a management system, we can say, OK, what is in my container,

609
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,560
what is in my development environment?

610
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:46,160
Why are they different? What just happened?

611
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,599
And like, I, I mean, another funny story I have there,

612
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:51,920
there was one time I think it was a bank showed up and was like, hey,

613
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,150
what's the deal with this, this Google Chrome included in your product?

614
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,729
And we're like,

615
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:57,920
what we don't include Google Chrome.

616
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,849
And they're like,

617
00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:02,250
yeah, you do. It's right here. And we're like, where did this come from?

618
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,150
And it was a, it was a headless chromium.

619
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,170
And we're like, how did this even get in here?

620
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,290
And it turned out one of the developers built it on their workstation,

621
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,500
uploaded it to Amazon S3 and was like, w getting it during container build.

622
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,180
And I'm like,

623
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:17,209
what, like, how did this even happen?

624
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:21,410
But you know, it's one of those situations where it's like, what do we do now?

625
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,250
And again,

626
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:26,500
this was before s bombs existed. So we had no insight into any of this stuff.

627
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,449
And it was, it's just,

628
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,660
it makes me chuckle. Sometimes.

629
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:33,140
I remember looking at RP MS from Red Hat and I found

630
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,420
one that had a build host of workstation and a number.

631
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,020
And I'm like,

632
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,680
that's not a build host man.

633
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:43,060
-- Like that's not what that's supposed to be. Look,
-- man.

634
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:47,250
When I worked at Progeny and I was rolling R PM updates for stuff.

635
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,689
There were many a times those got filled on my computer on my desk

636
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,089
that was in the early knots.

637
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,219
That would have been 2003 probably.

638
00:25:57,415 --> 00:25:58,614
But yes, it was,

639
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:01,824
I look back at all that stuff and it was, and the best part

640
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:04,494
is you'd build this stuff and, like,

641
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:06,244
there was no clean environments.

642
00:26:06,255 --> 00:26:06,935
It was just like,

643
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:10,084
whatever you'd have tons of garbage installed and sometimes weird

644
00:26:10,094 --> 00:26:12,385
things appeared in the RP MS and like it was,

645
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,324
that was just the way it worked.

646
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:14,959
Ah,

647
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,000
man. Oh, man.

648
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,300
It's a miracle. Anything worked back then.

649
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,189
As I remember, we spent a lot of time trying to make things work.

650
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:26,699
And it's really obvious to me in hindsight why Docker took off because, oh,

651
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,750
it's just you turn it on and it works like

652
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,900
no matter how much Janky stuff you jammed in there.

653
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,819
-- Sweet. Well,
-- exactly.

654
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:36,040
And I think this is not unlike just kind of the,

655
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,260
the story of development where it used to be like kitchen sink at all, right?

656
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,739
Like we don't care, make it work.

657
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,380
And then we started saying things like, no, no,

658
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,060
let's just include the dependencies we need,

659
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,859
let's make sure we're making things small.

660
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:46,420
Like, I mean,

661
00:26:46,865 --> 00:26:49,926
if you think about like R PM packages, right, I'll pick on them.

662
00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:53,656
The intent is that like every library gets its own R PM, right?

663
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,395
And then multiple RP MS can depend on one library.

664
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,115
Whereas there were, I mean, there were days back in the early days of like, so

665
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:00,135
os and stuff,

666
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,095
you just crammed everything and opt,

667
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:05,115
-- you know what I mean? Everything was statically linked, whatever
-- it works.

668
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,696
-- There's literally no other way to do it.
-- There wasn't, it was just different times.

669
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:11,215
And now I think with containers, it's kind of the same thing.

670
00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:13,326
Your container is just, oh, just put it all in opt.

671
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,625
And now we're starting to ask questions

672
00:27:14,942 --> 00:27:16,952
about, well, what's in it? What do we need in it?

673
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:19,452
Can we get rid of some of this stuff, like what's going on?

674
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:22,092
And I think this is how we start this journey.

675
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:25,521
Well, I think that's this classic thing of, you know, if I make it work, it works.

676
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:28,281
If it doesn't work, that's a clear and present problem.

677
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:32,052
-- Whereas a security problem is a kind of maybe sort of,
-- yes, I agree.

678
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:35,592
And that's another big part of the story I think is one of the

679
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:38,212
other challenges you see is so let's say I have an S bomb scanner,

680
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:39,631
let's say I'm telling developers.

681
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:42,732
All right, you need to get rid of this library. I didn't tell them

682
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:48,680
to necessarily fix the problem or, or whatever I told them, make this,

683
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:49,760
not show up on the SP

684
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,219
scan.

685
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:53,420
And those are two very different things, right?

686
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,739
And so I think that's one of the other challenges we need to

687
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,680
be mindful of is if you push too hard in your developers,

688
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:00,130
like they're really smart,

689
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,099
they know ways to trick your tools and the

690
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:03,660
intent is you don't want them tricking tools,

691
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,339
you want everyone kind of working together for a mutual good.

692
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,819
And that's always one of my fears is like

693
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,089
you say, oh, you can't use this dependency.

694
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:14,300
Well, I'll just copy and paste this into my tool.

695
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:16,040
It works good job for me.

696
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,119
Yeah.

697
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:18,650
Yep. Yep.

698
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,050
So, I,

699
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,770
I think the biggest thing though is we are

700
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,000
getting to the point of tooling becoming more standard.

701
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,890
Like it still blows my mind that there are people not using version control.

702
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,930
I don't think there's very many people not doing that anymore. Are there? No.

703
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:33,089
-- But the fact that there are any not using it is,
-- I mean, whatever,

704
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:34,680
there's always gonna be people like that.

705
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:38,079
I mean, you look at anything, Kurt, there's people who, who don't

706
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:43,880
-- adapt technology.
-- There is nobody in Edmonton using a horse to deliver stuff.

707
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,689
Are you sure

708
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:47,050
-- it's all trucks and cars?
-- Are you sure

709
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,410
in Edmonton?

710
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,739
I think this sounds like an opportunity for someone

711
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,410
to create a horse delivery service in Edmonton.

712
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,650
The only horses in use in Edmonton for moving

713
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,689
stuff around are at Christmas time for the slave

714
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,089
uh over on Candy Cane Lane and down by Fort Edmonton Park.

715
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:07,530
-- I mean,
-- I, I don't think, I don't think version control is quite as far into the,

716
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,290
the current.

717
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,439
Uh how do I say that, you know, like horses were a thing 100 years ago.

718
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:16,560
We're only like 20 years diversion control in a lot of cases. So I, I think

719
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:19,010
most people are doing it. If you're not, you should start.

720
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,550
But that one's a little different than using horses to deliver things, I think.

721
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,689
Well, what I'm trying to say is we're,

722
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:27,140
we're finally at the point where it's possible the tools exist.

723
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,810
The C I CD boiled pipelines exist, you know, as a server.

724
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:32,104
So like there's s bomb as a service and there should be right?

725
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:35,944
Like why should I have to build and buy all this tooling and care and feed for it

726
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:36,805
when? Well,

727
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:40,265
you know, I'm reminded of virus total. I'm not going to download and install.

728
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:43,045
What is it like a 60 or 80 virus scanners?

729
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:43,185
No,

730
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:45,125
I'm just going to throw this file literally

731
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:46,854
into Virus total.com and see what happened.

732
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:48,025
Well, there, there isn't s

733
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:49,734
bomb as a service yet. I think

734
00:29:49,864 --> 00:29:51,064
there are where

735
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:52,385
literally s

736
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:54,994
bomb as a service.

737
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:57,214
-- There's a whole bunch.
-- What does that even mean?

738
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,719
You give them a file and they give you an S

739
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,280
-- bomb? Well,
-- that's not s

740
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,479
bomb as a service.

741
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,760
That's boring.

742
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,619
-- Well, my point is like,
-- where, where are you finding this? I typed this into Google.

743
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,229
There's like nothing here,

744
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:11,449
whatever. You're full of crap

745
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:15,430
so well, but the point is basically, it's like the software signing, right?

746
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:20,790
I don't wanna make every single open source dev learn how to and do s bomb properly.

747
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,109
No, I absolutely, absolutely not. And this is actually um

748
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:28,280
so there's II I can put some links in the show notes but like there are, I mean,

749
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:30,910
Acor makes one, we we have a, a github

750
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,692
action that every time you do it build, it spits out in sp

751
00:30:34,062 --> 00:30:35,472
and it puts it in the repo, right?

752
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:37,472
Like there's a lot of tooling that does a lot

753
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,822
of this stuff and I think you're absolutely right.

754
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:42,271
We shouldn't expect any developers to be SBO

755
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:45,541
experts. This has to be comically easy to use.

756
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:49,182
You know, what we stopped doing is we stop making developers set up git servers.

757
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:52,362
-- Well, yeah, because that sucks.
-- And so does ES bomb.

758
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:55,062
-- So does everything.
-- No, I agree. I agree completely.

759
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,793
And that's, this is where I think like there's,

760
00:30:57,963 --> 00:30:58,734
I, I think SBO

761
00:30:58,864 --> 00:30:59,413
has value

762
00:30:59,553 --> 00:30:59,624
SBA

763
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:02,894
is gonna be wanted, especially by security teams. It does other stuff.

764
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:03,994
But you know what I mean?

765
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:05,913
And I think this is one of those instances

766
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:09,104
where there's a ton of opportunity in this space

767
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:10,713
to kind of get a lot of this, right?

768
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:12,034
And not only that, I think,

769
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:15,193
I think having the ability to know what's in your software is

770
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:18,124
it, it is becoming more and more important. And I think log for J

771
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,326
was like the poster child to push all of this down the hill

772
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:23,605
-- and I think the ball is starting to roll down for
-- sure.

773
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:25,635
I'm just thinking of all those people that had to spend

774
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,395
all this time trying to prove a negative of like,

775
00:31:27,406 --> 00:31:31,255
no, we don't have log for J or, or if we do have log for J we actually updated it or,

776
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:31,605
you know,

777
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,005
and just the amount of time spent on that.

778
00:31:34,515 --> 00:31:34,885
Whereas

779
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:35,355
if you have

780
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:36,936
one pooling it's like click

781
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:37,965
here you go.

782
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:38,975
-- Yeah,
-- I mean, I mean, so Acor

783
00:31:39,255 --> 00:31:40,306
has a customer

784
00:31:40,436 --> 00:31:40,965
that

785
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:43,130
all of their infrastructure, like one of their,

786
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,670
they have a hard rule of it has to go through Anchor's

787
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,890
product.

788
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,550
And so when log for J happened, they literally went to the search box,

789
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,260
They basically typed in log for J.

790
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,959
They're like, all right here it is, go fix your stuff and like that was it,

791
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,229
right? Versus

792
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,219
oh, we have to find all our computers and then we have to scan them all.

793
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:02,270
And then we have to figure out which ones have vulnerable versions,

794
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,339
then we'd figure out how to fix a ver, you know what I mean?

795
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:07,209
I know people that are still working on it like

796
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:12,493
it's, it's a big job. And I, and I think as we use more and more open source,

797
00:32:12,623 --> 00:32:18,213
as we continue to turn infrastructure into a commodity, like this is the tooling.

798
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:18,973
We need

799
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:20,983
to make sure we understand what's going on.

800
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:24,912
-- Is this not the whole point of it is to automate stuff.
-- I mean, it's supposed to be

801
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:25,713
right. My

802
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,152
thing of it was the whole point is we were supposed to automate stuff with computers

803
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:33,453
and then on a, that's on a technical level and on like sort of a business,

804
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:34,753
financial level

805
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,483
and

806
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,446
sort of specialized and outsource stuff because, like,

807
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,885
I don't want to run a global content delivery network.

808
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:45,465
-- I would much rather pay cloud floor 20 bucks a month.
-- Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.

809
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:47,306
All right. We should call this one. I love that.

810
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:50,135
I have all these notes and all these things that we wanted to talk about and, like,

811
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:51,135
I've checked two of them off.

812
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:51,855
I think it's,

813
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:55,375
it is part of the pleasure of doing this show.

814
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:58,595
I think it's knowing we get completely off track and it's lovely.

815
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:02,605
But anyway, it's, yeah, I, I guess kind of in summary, I think

816
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:06,099
this is one of those situations where I think S bombs are here.

817
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,829
I think people on both sides, there's people who are super pro S bomb,

818
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,839
people who are super anti

819
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:12,020
S bomb, like it's somewhere in the middle, right?

820
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,680
Like be mindful of who you're listening to understand what's going on.

821
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,780
It. It's, it's like any product, right?

822
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,425
Anytime there's any new product, you have to kind of ask some questions. It's

823
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:23,405
like, what's the angle here? What are they getting out of it because

824
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:25,135
there's people on each side, right.

825
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:26,385
-- So anyway,
-- well,

826
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:29,364
I think part of it too is there's just there's a lack of maturity because for example,

827
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,785
while we were talking earlier,

828
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:32,175
I was actually trying to find.

829
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:33,064
So for example,

830
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:35,125
cloud computing has like the classical mist

831
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:37,895
definition of cloud computing is like rapidly

832
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:40,104
scalable multi-tenant blah blah blah blah blah

833
00:33:40,344 --> 00:33:43,114
and I was looking for such a definition of sm and I couldn't find one.

834
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,925
I'd be shocked if there is one. I think it's way too new still.

835
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,619
So. Anyway.

836
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,979
All right, cool. I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
