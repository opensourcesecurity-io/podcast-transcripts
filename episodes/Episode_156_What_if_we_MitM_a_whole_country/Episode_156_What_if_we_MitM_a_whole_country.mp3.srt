Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 156 with myself,

1
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:11,819
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:12,760
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:14,020
-- What's
-- new man?

4
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,739
Not a lot? Just enjoying summer.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,139
-- It,
-- it is summer. I'm so, so I guess full disclosure today.

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:23,059
I am in my garage recording this podcast.

7
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:25,739
It's I can tell there's a little more echo than usual, but I'll,

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,700
I'll do my best to keep it down.

9
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:32,849
My house is ridiculous. Today I have workmen cutting holes in walls.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,659
I'm getting an air conditioner installed

11
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:38,659
and the police have been pulling people over in front of my house

12
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:43,799
all day long for speeding and not stopping for people crossing the street.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,380
So it's just sirens and saws are, is my morning. It's been, it's been awesome.

14
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:48,709
Yeah,

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,009
I've got road construction behind my house now

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,900
for the next one until the end of October

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,319
forever. Kurt, it will never end.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,029
That's how road construction always feels.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,439
And, and then, you know what I love though,

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,330
it looks like it's a total train wreck and

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,459
then two days later they're gone and it's perfect.

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,180
It always amazes me how fast that just like, last step goes

23
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,830
-- when they're doing that sort of work.
-- Yeah. Well, it's like a lot of things.

24
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,669
It's, you know, that final bit of tidy up and then it's, it's nice.

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,750
So, sort of, speaking of which, so Kazakhstan, similar situation,

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,989
they've made a bit of a mess of things, but

27
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,330
they just don't care because, well, they don't have to.

28
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,839
All right,

29
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:29,870
why don't you explain what's going on in Kazakhstan and then we'll go from there.

30
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,750
So Kazakhstan is one of those former

31
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:35,500
Soviet satellite states.

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,169
Kazakhstan is sort of in the southern middle bit next to uh well,

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,220
sort of sandwiched between Russia and

34
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:47,300
China basically like it, it's just next door to Mongolia.

35
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,500
So if you play a lot of hearts of iron for, you'll know where it is

36
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:52,540
the part with no roads.

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,379
And so like a lot of these former Soviet Republics, they have, let's say,

38
00:01:57,389 --> 00:02:01,930
not a strong set of democratic institutions.

39
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,669
I think it might be fair to say

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,389
that's a generous explanation from what I

41
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:13,020
so their most recent bit of shenanigans from the government is a, is an online safety

42
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,039
program system.

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,899
Let's not call it that because we all know it, it has nothing to do with safety.

44
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,820
-- It's not safety for the people.
-- No, no, no.

45
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,449
And um anyways, so they're, they're trying to man in the middle,

46
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,365
all of the HTTP S traffic in the country

47
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,994
by requiring people to install a new root certificate.

48
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,774
And, and actually this, this actually that alone,

49
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:38,434
I think shows a vast improvement in the last 10 years.

50
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:43,345
Is that to now man, in the middle of traffic, you actually have to touch the end point.

51
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:45,175
-- Whereas back in the day,
-- that is true,

52
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,604
there are all sorts of ways to get around this.

53
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:49,835
Now, let's let's start at the beginning though.

54
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:50,475
And

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,020
what does it mean

56
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:55,179
to install a man in the middle root certificate?

57
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,830
Because I, I have a suspicion,

58
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:59,839
this is something people soar to know about but not exactly.

59
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:00,860
So,

60
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:03,679
one of the fundamental ideas behind encryption is

61
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,529
that you encrypt your data so that other

62
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:09,369
people can't see it and that only the remote end you actually want to talk to can

63
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,020
crypt it and see it. Right?

64
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:14,250
So you have this magically secure tunnel between you and the remote ant

65
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,619
cool. Right.

66
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,020
And, and you know,

67
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:21,979
theoretically speaking, anybody can record the traffic that's always possible,

68
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,660
but they can't

69
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,479
see what it is. Right.

70
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,330
Right. Without the secret key and these keys are quite large,

71
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,000
you know, several like 2048 or 4096 bits, which means, you know,

72
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:34,919
brute forcing these things with current

73
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:37,929
computational reality is just not possible.

74
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,100
Like as like, I literally mean by the way we understand reality,

75
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,830
it's not that we don't have the technology for this.

76
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,850
It's the way we understand reality.

77
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:49,574
This is not really possible short of some absurd break in quantum computing.

78
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:53,095
And even then we have ways to deal with that back in the day,

79
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:57,485
man in the middle and traffic was actually pretty easy because you could just

80
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:01,184
go get a certificate authority that was installed in a browser by default,

81
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,100
that was willing to issue certificates for anything.

82
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,679
And so they were actually man in the middle, you know, hardware products,

83
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,410
-- uh sort of these in line machines uh
-- they still exist,

84
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,889
They do, they do

85
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,399
-- but you have to install like a corporate C
-- A Exactly. And that's,

86
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,600
yeah, because the, the browser is the cab form the certificate.

87
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,309
What does the cab forum stand for? Again?

88
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:23,940
I have

89
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,089
no

90
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:24,440
idea.

91
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,329
-- But we should also clarify the concept
-- of uh C A browser for.

92
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,869
There you go.

93
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,359
We should also clarify what a root certificate does.

94
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:38,269
Your browser has an insane number of root certificates in it

95
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,239
and

96
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:39,640
the

97
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,640
way it kind of works.

98
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,790
Yeah, I know that's,

99
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:44,589
-- that's another story
-- because there's root certificates

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,640
and there's intermediate certificates and we don't,

101
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,989
we actually don't know how many intermediate certificates

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
there are on the planet right now.

103
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:50,779
So

104
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,679
that is true.

105
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:56,320
And, but anyway, what basically happens is you'll have a certificate, you trust

106
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,640
that says I trust this certificate for everything.

107
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:03,260
And then that certificate will sign another certificate, let's say

108
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,709
open source security, podcast.com

109
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,760
and say

110
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:10,989
I verified this person is who they say they are using some means.

111
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,079
And then,

112
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,559
-- well this
-- domain name.

113
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,450
Well, yeah, I mean. Right. It's, it's not super

114
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,100
exciting,

115
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,500
but the point being

116
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,380
they do some level of verification.

117
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,279
And then you can essentially say, well,

118
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,059
this certificate authority I trust says I can trust this certificate over here.

119
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:29,839
Well, basically, certificates provide a mapping to

120
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:31,760
talk to a DNS end point.

121
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,950
And

122
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,149
to be clear, I'm talking about web browsers here.

123
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,980
So basically it allows you to talk to a DNS end point

124
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,170
and get a certificate for that DNS end point

125
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,130
that you can be reasonably certain that,

126
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,670
that DNS end point actually owns and controls that certificate.

127
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,709
Right. Exactly. And so for example, if I

128
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,339
try to man in the middle of you, when you go to google.com

129
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:55,709
and I don't have a valid google.com certificate,

130
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,470
the web browser will, you know, blink the flashing red lights and say, oh, no,

131
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,850
something's wrong, don't do this.

132
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:02,790
However,

133
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:05,149
if I have a certificate that pretends to

134
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,470
be google.com signed by a certificate authority,

135
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,880
your browser trusts,

136
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,109
I can do that.

137
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,940
And so in the past, this is a big problem because there was a bunch of certificate,

138
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,079
authorities that were just handing these things out to security companies

139
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,660
and allowing them, you know,

140
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,029
and this is what I'm talking about with these intermediate certificates.

141
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,500
So the root certificates typically sign an

142
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,839
intermediate certificate and the intermediate certificate is

143
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,619
actually what is used on sort of the daily basis to sign other certificates.

144
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:32,359
It's certificates, all the way down. Exactly.

145
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:35,320
And in theory, the root certificate is very heavily protected and blah, blah, blah,

146
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:35,519
but

147
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,190
they're not.

148
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,519
And so, yeah,

149
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,720
so these companies would be able to sign

150
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,350
a certificate for any domain that they wanted,

151
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,489
which meant the in line box would have one of these magical root certificates.

152
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:45,690
Uh,

153
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,950
well, one of these magical quasi

154
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,959
root certificates, you know, intermediate certificates installed on them.

155
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,899
And so when you went to google.com, you know, it would

156
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,779
intercept the

157
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,799
connection and create a certificate for google.com

158
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:01,309
and your browser would accept that.

159
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,260
And obviously, you know, this is kind of a big problem like because this is, well,

160
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,980
this is how man in the middle attacks work, especially with nation states,

161
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,209
right? Because they control the I SPS and they can put these machines in line.

162
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,950
They don't have to do like DNS hijacking shenanigans.

163
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,820
It's like we own all the internet connections to the country.

164
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,239
Like if you want to talk to anything outside the country, you got to go through us.

165
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,679
That's generally how I SPS work. So Kazakhstan created a certificate

166
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:28,149
and is trying to get people to install in their browser.

167
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,880
And like I said,

168
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,329
this is this is actually a vast improvement over how

169
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:32,600
things used to be because it used to be.

170
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,929
You didn't need to do that. Like you could just man in the middle people based on

171
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,079
at least one of the root certificates they trusted,

172
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,660
right? You didn't need any action by the end client

173
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:44,700
and the end client would typically have no idea

174
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,890
that they were being man in the middle.

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,510
Um So now we've got a bunch of new technologies like

176
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,290
certificate pinning.

177
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:54,820
And um what are those DNS records CAA records called,

178
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,269
where you basically declare which certificate authorities are

179
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,450
allowed to issue certificates for your domain.

180
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,220
And theoretically speaking, if any, you know, if you see a certificate

181
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,500
for that domain or,

182
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,459
or if somebody tries to issue a certificate for that domain using another

183
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,059
certificate, authority certificate, it should be blocked or, you know,

184
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,100
cause a ruckus.

185
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,950
So, yeah, I mean, at least I, I guess the good news here is,

186
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,420
is that users are going to be somewhat

187
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,410
aware that they're being manned in the middle because

188
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:23,779
their government is forcing them to install a new root certificate on the browser.

189
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,100
Right?

190
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:29,480
There's an interesting discussion in the Mozilla Foundation's bug tracker

191
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:33,909
and it looks like the ultimate decision was, well, they had a couple of options,

192
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,599
number one.

193
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,739
just it's not a problem, whatever who care.

194
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,020
Right. That, that's one way that, you know, and that's

195
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,599
honestly, that's probably what more than a few browsers will do outside of the big,

196
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,150
you know, three or four browsers.

197
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,500
There's,

198
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,000
there's actually what a couple of 100 browsers now,

199
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,599
I was looking on the mobile phone and there's, there's quite a few.

200
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:51,890
Yeah.

201
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,320
Oh yeah. Yeah, there's tons. Definitely.

202
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,340
So, yeah. Number one is just ignore it, whatever.

203
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:57,929
Let the government do what the government does.

204
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,039
Uh number two would be to actually block the certificate, right.

205
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:05,080
These certificates have a, you know, a serial number and, and identifiers

206
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,890
that you could just block, then, you know,

207
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,929
the users would be kind of making bigger codes here protected.

208
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:11,739
A

209
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,419
third option,

210
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:16,510
which I think is a bit more interesting and useful is

211
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,929
to accept like to allow the certificate not to block it,

212
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,750
but to present a warning

213
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,919
when it is

214
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,150
ultimately used.

215
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,820
So for example, when you go to google.com

216
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,679
and instead of getting the google.com signed with Google's certificate,

217
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,500
you get it signed with this, you know, government certificate

218
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,830
to put up a giant red bar at the top of the browser saying, you know,

219
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:39,919
you're at google.com cool. But

220
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,880
the connection is actually with, you know, the Kazakhstan government,

221
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,840
right? They're intercepting it actively like they are

222
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:49,239
and this isn't a fast thing like they are actively

223
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,150
intercepting and manipulating the data. They're basically,

224
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,130
you know, you're talking to the government, the government's talking to Google,

225
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,729
Google talks back to the government, the government talks back to you.

226
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,309
Exactly.

227
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,309
I don't know because on the one hand,

228
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,150
sovereignty and law,

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
there's lots of countries out there with laws I don't like

230
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,299
or agree with and conversely Canada where I live has laws

231
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,619
but other countries don't have and disagree with, you know, uh the drinking age,

232
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,250
for example, even in Canada, the drinking age varies from, uh, what is 18 and, uh,

233
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,739
in a couple of places it's 19

234
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,729
in other parts of the world. It's 1416, 1821. You know, who's to say what's right?

235
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:26,989
Like,

236
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,380
you know, I, if I were under 21 I can't legally go to most of the US and drink.

237
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:35,979
So do I just get to disagree with that and be like, well in my country.

238
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,080
So, on the one hand, you know, I, I think about the sovereignty of this

239
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,630
government and the, you know, they,

240
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,590
they get to make their own laws even if they're terrible.

241
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,869
But on the flip side, you know, there are certain laws that we've had in the past that

242
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,789
we got rid of because they were terrible laws.

243
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,919
This is a terrible law.

244
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,559
And so in this case, we, we enter into that area of, ok,

245
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,119
so it's the law it's been passed.

246
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,640
Is it moral and ethical?

247
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,460
I'm not going to get into if it's moral or ethical,

248
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,349
I'm going to say it's stupid.

249
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,989
Well, and that's the second set. Is it effective?

250
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:11,849
No, it won't be. Well, ok,

251
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,650
it might be for what they want it to be for because let's face it.

252
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,750
This is, this is a country with a regime in charge

253
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,320
that is not necessarily interested in the safety of its people.

254
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,270
It's almost certainly going to use this technology to quell dissent

255
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:31,830
and there are, there's a couple of things that are in my mind

256
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,630
that concerned me about all of this. Number one,

257
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,390
there are no doubt,

258
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,780
a nontrivial number of other countries on the bench waiting to see what happens.

259
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,909
And if they get away with this,

260
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,169
they're gonna, they're gonna stand up and they're going to say we want this too.

261
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:49,469
And the reality is that the technology must exist to some

262
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:52,219
degree to pull this off on a pretty wide scale level.

263
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:54,250
Now, at the same time, there's companies are working with that,

264
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,469
do this and shame on you companies for working with Kazakhstan to make this happen.

265
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,690
Because this is,

266
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,109
this is one of those things where history will judge you and you're doing it wrong

267
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,320
unquestionably. Now, secondly, there is the issue of

268
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:12,880
if you're installing this key on everyone's computer,

269
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,659
I guarantee they're not protecting it correctly and it's going to leak.

270
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,130
And now you are going to have an instance where

271
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,200
the government

272
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,590
and probably some will say less than admirable organizations,

273
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,950
probably organized crime to a degree

274
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,270
are going to also have access to this. And that's terrifying.

275
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,549
Well, I mean, one of the challenges is is in this type of country,

276
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,109
the difference between organized crime and the government is

277
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,159
fuzzy

278
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,190
sometimes.

279
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,070
And, and one of the challenges too though is that these,

280
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,400
these technologies do legitimately need to exist.

281
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:47,530
Because for example, in America, in the finance industry,

282
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,989
there's basically a requirement that these financial companies

283
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,469
need to know what's on their network.

284
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:55,039
Well, and they, by definition can't if it's all encrypted.

285
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,669
So these financial companies on their own

286
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,109
works with their own users and their own devices and hardware

287
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,150
are installing these men in the middle proxies,

288
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,130
installing the root certificates on the users, you know,

289
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:09,590
phone and laptop and whatever. How is that different than this? You know, and

290
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:12,150
I, I would say, well, you know, that's a private network,

291
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,429
it's not a public network and it's, you know, there's,

292
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,049
there's very much more the full disclosure of what's going on and,

293
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,619
and in many cases, even the actual hardware being used as being, you know,

294
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,960
it's owned by the company, it's not owned by the end user.

295
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:28,909
-- And, and
-- for the record, I think banks doing this is also stupid because

296
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,059
at

297
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:33,359
the end of the day it lowers security and I understand they have to, I,

298
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:37,599
I get that and I'm sure most of them don't want to, but it's not, it's not their choice.

299
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,520
I don't know it. To me it's a gray area. I, I actually

300
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:45,070
in some situations, especially like say banking or where you have other

301
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,229
very, very valuable and sensitive data.

302
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,890
I I'm ok with this because for preventing leak,

303
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,070
you know, data leaks and preventing exfiltration of data.

304
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,549
-- Yeah, I'm ok with this, whatever
-- man,

305
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,719
I guarantee this technology has never actually prevented any data leaks and if

306
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:04,260
anything it's probably caused them because now you have to protect this key,

307
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,830
protecting keys is hard to impossible.

308
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,190
Well, yes and no. If, if the technology is done right, where you have like

309
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:13,755
hardware security modules in each of the intercepting proxies and you,

310
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:14,234
you know,

311
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:18,434
use them to generate a certificate that then goes back to a master one to be signed it,

312
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:19,875
it can be done securely.

313
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:21,554
The problem is doing that is expensive.

314
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:24,594
So most places don't, they do it a little bit cheaper, let's say

315
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:25,914
right.

316
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,030
And, and that's, yeah, that's where you get your key leaks and whatnot.

317
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,349
Your optimism is inspiring.

318
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,390
Well, what I'm trying to point out is, is the technology can be done correctly.

319
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,460
The fact that it isn't, isn't the technology's fault.

320
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:40,059
That's just the economics of the situation. You know, people want to save the

321
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:40,729
two bucks.

322
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:45,940
This is like saying we could cure poverty. We just can't.

323
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,340
Well,

324
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,710
-- we choose not to,
-- we have the technology,

325
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,710
we just don't.

326
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:53,140
Well, like I tell my Children, we have this, you know,

327
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,609
we have the technology and the strength of will to watch something on Netflix.

328
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:58,580
But, you know, for other things, we don't have the strength.

329
00:14:59,690 --> 00:14:59,700
Oh

330
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,599
my goodness. So back to this. So

331
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,109
I think the problem is,

332
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,349
and I I tweeted this out probably a year or two ago that basically if your

333
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,909
information security strategy depends on behaving like a nation state attacker,

334
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:17,489
but it's probably going to fail longer term

335
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,630
because people like Google and Mozilla are,

336
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,789
well, they're trying to protect users from this because

337
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,200
that's what you do, right?

338
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,080
You want, we want to build it that protects users from attacks.

339
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,960
A nation state attack is hard to tell apart from like

340
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,090
a

341
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,239
ba a quote unquote bad guy attack.

342
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,320
Uh, in, in, in some cases, you could argue it's the same thing,

343
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:41,609
right? If, if another country is attacking me in

344
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,919
the United States,

345
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,219
that's a bad guy, right?

346
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,820
If the United States is attacking someone in another country,

347
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,700
we're the bad guy in that instance from their perspective, right?

348
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,289
Of course, everyone thinks that's a good guy in their own personal narrative.

349
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,409
But that's another, that's a topic for another day.

350
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,289
So what's interesting to me is there, there were a number of efforts

351
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:07,630
to deal with essentially this exact scenario. Http public key pinning.

352
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,210
So HPKP, it was a Google based I ETF standard

353
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:16,849
as I understand it, Google and others have backed off from this because

354
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:17,789
it,

355
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,690
how do we put it nicely?

356
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:23,429
If you make a mistake when you do this, you break everything

357
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,289
horribly and permanently.

358
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,630
So

359
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,929
a great example.

360
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,669
It's like SPF Records for uh Sender Protective Framework records for your email,

361
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,109
which basically are a fancy way of saying in DNS who's allowed

362
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,669
to send email for my domain and you have soft fail,

363
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,460
which is what almost everybody uses because

364
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,789
your SPF records sometimes aren't always up to date and

365
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:44,320
you don't want to actually block all your outgoing email.

366
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,070
Right.

367
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,710
You know, and that's,

368
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:48,359
and that's actually on my to do list this year for the CS A for example,

369
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:49,280
is to actually make sure

370
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,460
that all of our outgoing email is,

371
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:56,260
is covered by SPF and flip that tilda all to negative all and just tell the clients,

372
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,969
you know, if the

373
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,650
email didn't come from these servers or sites or whatever, block it,

374
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:01,510
you know, but that's,

375
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:03,440
it makes me a little nervous because you know,

376
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,239
what if we forgot something or password resets or whatever, right.

377
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,069
So,

378
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,089
you know, that's,

379
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,270
that's the problem with a lot of these

380
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,770
technologies designed to defeat this class of attack.

381
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,530
The chance of having a false positive and breaking everything is,

382
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,848
it's basically 100% like it's going to happen at some point is what I'm saying,

383
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,910
-- it will eventually happen.
-- Yes. Yeah. And it, and it

384
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,209
may take more than a few minutes or even hours or days to correct,

385
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:28,199
depending on what you did.

386
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,920
-- And
-- broke man. I remember doing that where back in the day when I managed my own DNS

387
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,869
where you'd before you touched anything,

388
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,829
you'd like the day before,

389
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,089
you'd always set the TT L the time to live to like five minutes.

390
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,109
If you did break something, it was only broken for five minutes.

391
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,400
Whereas the default TT L was like 24 hours or something. I think

392
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:52,479
the first time I ever broke a domain.

393
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,119
It took a day

394
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,699
to be fixed. I'm like, oh my goodness, this is terrible.

395
00:17:57,729 --> 00:18:02,430
So I once made the trade off between DNS reliability and, and DNS reliability.

396
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:02,910
In that

397
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,209
I realized rather cleverly when you register a domain

398
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,550
like c.org

399
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:08,709
you

400
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,780
get to then in the root servers specify two or more

401
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,650
DNS servers, right?

402
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,079
So most people have like DNS 01 dot blah, blah, blah, and DNS 02 dot blah blah blah.

403
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,140
And I was clever, I realized I could save time on DNS lookups

404
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,219
on my website by making my DNS server,

405
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:30,719
www.c.org and putting that IP address into my registrar record.

406
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:34,349
And then basically hoping that, you know, I never switch I SPS for hope

407
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:38,166
and, and it worked like it was stupid fast and if my DNS broke,

408
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:39,436
you could still get to my website.

409
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:42,465
But then when I had to swing change providers, it was like, oh man,

410
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:43,446
that was a nightmare,

411
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,406
right?

412
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:45,546
Well done.

413
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:46,086
Well done.

414
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:48,526
-- Yeah.
-- So that, that's, that's essentially, you know,

415
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:50,385
in solving some of these problems.

416
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,395
Sometimes the solutions have failure scenarios that are actually

417
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:57,362
worse than the failure scenarios of like an attack.

418
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,722
As far as I know all of these technologies for

419
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:03,241
http key pinning and everything have fallen by the wayside,

420
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:03,682
right?

421
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:06,432
Because they're all really hard and the cost benefit

422
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:10,631
analysis has been super skewed where generally speaking,

423
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:13,552
our existing C A infrastructure is kind of a tire fire

424
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:15,641
but it basically works good enough.

425
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:16,881
So we deal with it

426
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:19,729
and, and like this is even, you know, I'll pick on DNS

427
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,810
Sec where it always comes up as, oh, DNS SE can fix this.

428
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:26,040
It's like, yeah, but it's really hard to implement and nobody wants to.

429
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,709
So it's never going to win.

430
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I will politely disagree in that DNS SEC is a lot like http was 10 years ago.

431
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,969
Currently, it's very hard for you to implement.

432
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,930
But if you choose somebody like and not to name drop, but cloud flare in cloud flare,

433
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:40,660
you click a button.

434
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:44,930
Yeah, I mean, that's fair and to be real, that's kind of how HTTP S

435
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:51,250
you go with a provider that had a relationship with AC A or something or had the,

436
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,770
had used a platform like wordpress or something where

437
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,550
you could just plug in a certificate easily.

438
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,380
If you wanted to, for example,

439
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,170
build your own Apache server with your own certificate.

440
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,530
1520 years ago.

441
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,329
If you could do that, you could easily earn six figures a year.

442
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,449
-- I remember those days. It was
-- me too.

443
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:08,599
It was terrible.

444
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,050
And you had to buy,

445
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:11,430
you had to buy a

446
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,640
library

447
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:14,689
to, to do http.

448
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:16,930
I actually bought a copy of Red Hat

449
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,579
Stronghold server because it was the cheapest HTTP

450
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,020
server out there. It was a mere like four or 500 bucks.

451
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,250
And now I think literally every everything I have with a web server.

452
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,160
Has built an HTTP S because why not?

453
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,859
-- Like, I'm pretty sure my, my bathroom scale has an HTTP S web server.
-- I hope so.

454
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,260
But anyway, anyway, back to

455
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,729
the concept of a country

456
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,140
intercepting

457
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,420
all of the HTTP S traffic. The, the thing that keeps eating my brain about this

458
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:48,500
is

459
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,260
let's assume

460
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,739
they have

461
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,800
things deployed correctly where the key can't leak because it's all in

462
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,510
HS MS and ignoring the fact that most Hs MS are,

463
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,060
are hot garbage, it turns out.

464
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:03,219
So let, let's assume the technology is sound though.

465
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,140
Right

466
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:04,810
now,

467
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:10,170
we get into the issue of what does it mean for the people who have to use the internet.

468
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,459
And the thing that keeps coming to my mind is if I was a corporation

469
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,770
and I was looking to set a business somewhere,

470
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,380
I'd look at this and say no f and we are any of my computers sitting on this network,

471
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,699
I can't trust the data going in or out.

472
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,329
Nope. Just no.

473
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:28,250
And like from, from the perspective of trying to be, you know,

474
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,780
a functional country on the planet today,

475
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,699
that's

476
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:32,579
terrible.

477
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:37,339
Well, as far as I know, it's kind of weird is that Kazakhstan doesn't block VPN S.

478
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:42,219
Right. There are a lot of countries that try to block VPN S

479
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,599
for government sort of information control means or,

480
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,979
or my classic favorite is a bunch of Middle Eastern countries where they block VPN S

481
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,489
so that you have to pay for phone calls because, you know,

482
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,290
they have a state telco monopoly that wants to make money.

483
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:57,640
And let's face it. A great example. Right.

484
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:57,824
I

485
00:21:57,974 --> 00:22:01,055
called you on the phone the other day because the internet

486
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:03,704
connections with Skype and Slack and everything were so terrible.

487
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:05,675
And then I realized I didn't have long distance

488
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:07,525
on my phone anymore because this is the first

489
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:13,324
phone call I'd made with my phone in the US in probably two or three years, you know.

490
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:14,314
And I was like, oh, yeah,

491
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:17,594
-- here's
-- the other side of this. So if they're allowing VPN S,

492
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,290
that means the, the bad guys will put that in quotes

493
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,930
are just going to VPN,

494
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:23,479
right?

495
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:23,709
They're,

496
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,180
they're not going to use regular HTTP S now we're at a

497
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:29,540
point where basically who are you even catching in this dragnet,

498
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:29,790
right?

499
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,339
You're like,

500
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,300
you're catching people that have no idea what's going on.

501
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,810
And, and at that point, I mean, really, what's,

502
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,329
what is the point of that then?

503
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,010
Well, and I think that's,

504
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,560
that is the point of that is that you're catching people who are maybe

505
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,280
thinking about dissent or thinking about saying

506
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,800
bad things about the government but aren't

507
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,380
technologically clued in enough to not,

508
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,300
or to understand what putting the certificate on their machine means.

509
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,430
You know, it's like, oh, online safety,

510
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,859
I better do that because the government said

511
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,229
so I don't trust my government entirely.

512
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,739
But, hey, online safety is good. Right.

513
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,819
And, you know, they're probably like, let's,

514
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:01,500
let's face it how many normal people VPN

515
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:04,689
less than a percent zero,

516
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,160
-- zero is the number.
-- Yeah, it's essentially a rounding error.

517
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:11,689
As soon as you start using a VPN, you're no longer a normal person.

518
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,449
That's pretty much how it works.

519
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,650
And the other thing this has then is the,

520
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,180
not only does it allow them to sort of quell dissent by seeing what people are saying,

521
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:20,430
but for,

522
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:23,364
for example, the people who don't play ball, for example,

523
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,844
you can make that against the law and then now you have something to go arrest them on

524
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:29,604
-- for
-- you mean say making VPN S illegal.

525
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:35,005
Well, or requiring that the certificate be installed or for example, in the US,

526
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:38,834
you have wiretapping legislation and laws that require you

527
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:42,324
as a provider of telecommunication services to

528
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:44,964
provide lawful intercept capabilities,

529
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,280
which is why my understanding is signal telegram.

530
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,109
A couple of these other things are actually not based in the US,

531
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,719
right? Well, it's, it's, it gets complicated.

532
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,469
But you know, if, if you're like Skype,

533
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,300
my understanding is originally Skype had most of

534
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,560
their data centers in Canada to provide services

535
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,709
for the US because this allowed them to sort of get around it a bit.

536
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,920
It wouldn't surprise me. And

537
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:10,750
I mean,

538
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,270
I I won't get into that either because I think

539
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,969
the wiretapping laws are silly for a variety of reasons.

540
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:17,150
But

541
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:17,750
at

542
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,069
the very least

543
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,189
you can't just show up and say we need to wiretap this guy's phone.

544
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,699
You know, you're supposed to show up with a warrant and to get a warrant.

545
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,329
You have to go through some process

546
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,920
that, that justifies your activities.

547
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,310
Whereas when you have the government blanket man in the meddling you,

548
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,020
you know, there's no due process, there's no checks and balances.

549
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,609
Well, and, and I would point out even, you know, the US,

550
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:44,170
the NSA got caught doing this yet again after they were ordered not to.

551
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,609
So

552
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,130
the reality is even even in countries with

553
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,040
pretty strong democratic institutions and reasonably

554
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,810
well behaved security services and agencies.

555
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,849
Yeah, they, they just,

556
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:58,430
I, I guess the temptation is too great. I don't know, man.

557
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,750
Or they think they won't get caught. I have no idea.

558
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,829
It's probably all of the above.

559
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,589
Yeah.

560
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,540
And also people going to be people and do goofy stuff at

561
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,869
work that they really shouldn't do like wiretap the Western world.

562
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,910
But I think fundamentally what it boils down to is generally speaking,

563
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:16,224
the major browser providers of which I

564
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:18,944
will say basically we're talking Firefox chrome,

565
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:22,834
uh safari and maybe opera, generally speaking, they,

566
00:25:22,844 --> 00:25:24,974
they do a pretty good job of trying to protect their users.

567
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:29,194
-- Right. Right. Yeah. But user trust is huge in this space.
-- Exactly.

568
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:29,795
Yeah.

569
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:31,114
And so

570
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:35,155
I'm actually kind of glad Kazakhstan is doing this because it's, it's

571
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:36,349
to be blunt,

572
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,500
I think the browser vendors need a poke in the

573
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,439
eye once every year or two to remind them that

574
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,920
-- this isn't some hypothetical like this stuff does actually happen.
-- That's fair.

575
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,119
-- I mean, I'll agree with that because
-- we went through this about what, 5, 10 years ago,

576
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,650
with a whole bunch of this and then it sort of got quiet for a while and,

577
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:52,469
and for example,

578
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,310
one of the biggest things the browsers did was clean up the cab for him by,

579
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,609
you know, if basically we catch you

580
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,729
providing these certificates that can be used to sign

581
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:02,170
anything in these man in the middle proxies.

582
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:05,319
Yeah, we're going to bounce you out and a few were and you know,

583
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:08,810
several that were not very well behaved got bounced out and it, it actually,

584
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:12,709
yeah. No, it, it actually made things a bit better. And so hopefully with this,

585
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,209
I mean, and what I really love too is, I mean, TLS 1.3

586
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:20,050
specifically has a whole pile of protections

587
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,500
to make this kind of nation state

588
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,140
shenanigans much more difficult

589
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,189
as evidenced by the fact that they have to install us. Like

590
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,660
we need you to put the certificate on your client so we can look at your traffic.

591
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:35,280
-- That means this stuff is working.
-- Yeah. No, I, I agree. I agree

592
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:35,829
completely.

593
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,050
You know, it's basically this is rubber hose crypto at this point.

594
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,459
I'm going to beat you until you put the certificate on your machine.

595
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:41,380
There's no

596
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,760
easy technical attack for me to exploit.

597
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,939
That's great. That means the technology is working.

598
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:49,709
Yeah. No. And I agree with that. I, I do agree and I think that

599
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,010
that may be the silver lining

600
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,290
in the story,

601
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,849
even though I feel really bad for everyone in Kazakhstan because this is terrible.

602
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:02,209
I'm glad it's not some truly large government or,

603
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,040
you know, something essentially as bad as this is.

604
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,449
-- I hate to say it, it's not bad on a global scale.
-- Well, look, I mean,

605
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,689
the other thing I thought of here is

606
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:18,800
it can't be on a global scale. If you look at most of we'll say North America, right?

607
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,160
United States and Canada,

608
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:22,479
there is no way

609
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,319
you could capture all the internet traffic and do anything with it.

610
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,760
There is no way there's just like that amount of storage you would need to do that

611
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,020
probably only exists in one place today because they keep getting caught doing it,

612
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:36,410
right.

613
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,739
I mean, fundamentally speaking,

614
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,150
it's just, it's, it's not practical

615
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,810
and I think that's part of it also is Kazakhstan clearly

616
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:48,290
doesn't have a huge robust internet infrastructure because if they did,

617
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,290
they couldn't do this.

618
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm guessing that they're targeting

619
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,760
a few specific services.

620
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,550
So II I don't think we've done a show on this yet, but I was reading about how

621
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:00,540
these human rights groups have started doing things like, OK,

622
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,050
we don't do email attachments because yeah, email attachments,

623
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:06,290
it turns out they're kind of a security problem,

624
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
like who knew 30 years and we finally figured it out.

625
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:11,989
And so they're doing things like, you know, using Google Drive to share documents

626
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,530
and there's been now phishing attempts where, you know,

627
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,979
somebody sends you a link to kind of what looks like a Google Drive.

628
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,540
And the Google Drive document has some nasty virus in it, blah, blah, blah, blah,

629
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:19,739
blah.

630
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:20,910
So

631
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,170
the reality is these human rights groups are

632
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,560
uh, well, the how do I put this nicely?

633
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:30,550
The smart ones follow a couple of simple and effective best practices

634
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:33,160
and again, not to pump, pump a vendor,

635
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,400
but if you need to do secure email and document sharing,

636
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,199
go get yourself a gmail

637
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:38,819
full stop.

638
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,900
That's it. That, that is, that's the answer. And so

639
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:47,290
by monitoring, you know, certain people and their Google activity,

640
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,859
you know, they, they, the government will potentially get what they want.

641
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,939
But like I said, I can't help but think that

642
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,780
this is one of those cases where you can make a law that essentially

643
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,109
either you follow the law and you're kind of screwed or

644
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,189
you don't follow the law and now they have something to

645
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,619
quote, unquote, legitimately charge you with.

646
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,349
Yeah, I mean, that's fair,

647
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:09,890
you know. So the government wins, they got what they wanted

648
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,569
-- anyway.
-- We, we need to call this one.

649
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:15,060
I think, I guess we will have to wait and see how this all turns. Turns out.

650
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:19,300
I'm I'm very curious to see where we end up in a couple of months.

651
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,020
Once kind of all the, the newness and details have, have worked themselves out.

652
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,420
So, Kurt, any parting thoughts,

653
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:27,689
uh I guess for those of you working on the design of TLS

654
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,829
1.4 please pay attention to this and if you could fix it,

655
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,619
that would be awesome.

656
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:36,339
Seriously. Awesome. Wonderful. Well, well, thanks so much.
