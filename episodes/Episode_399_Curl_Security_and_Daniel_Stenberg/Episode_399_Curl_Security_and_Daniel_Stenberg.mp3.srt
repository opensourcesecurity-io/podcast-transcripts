Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:11,920
Kurt Siefried and my partner are not really understanding how the web works.

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,739
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:17,409
That's right. But luckily we have an expert with us today, Daniel Stenberg, the,

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,399
I guess the, the creator of curl. Would that be accurate?

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,450
I would say that is correct. Yeah.

6
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,399
All right. That's fair. Daniel. Welcome, man. We're so excited to have you here.

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,399
-- It's good to be here. Good to meet
-- you. All right.

8
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:33,900
So I'm just gonna start with the one question everyone has on their minds.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,520
Why don't you just rewrite Curl and Rust in a weekend

10
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:38,400
in three days?

11
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:43,900
So I get this question a lot about rewriting curl. Of course.

12
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:46,700
And, and for some reason, it's always rust.

13
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:47,619
But, but

14
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:49,700
that's such a big question.

15
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,610
But, but of course, first,

16
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:55,389
we created Curl a very long time before rust even existed or

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,139
there weren't really any

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,799
good options for the first few decades.

19
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,000
And

20
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,580
by now then it's,

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,080
it's a pretty big vehicle and everything works and it's quite

22
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:11,540
a big job to just consider a rewrite into anything.

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,919
And I also consider that one of the

24
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:18,819
one of the big good things with curly is that it runs and exists everywhere.

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,279
It sort of,

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,819
it sells it to the next platform and the next platform

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,580
so you can use the same API on pretty much anything.

28
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,489
And that's, I think that's a

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,209
-- good pitch for,
-- for. No, you're right. It's kind of like V I in that.

30
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:34,029
-- It's always there and it works.
-- Yeah. And even the library is like that.

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,120
So even if you write your application today on with the API in one platform, right?

32
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,129
And you can switch to another tomorrow and it's the same API is there big systems,

33
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:43,000
small systems?

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,819
So it's having that

35
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,389
you, so that it's

36
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,540
actually exists everywhere has been a huge benefit for all users.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,339
And that

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,220
has been a pretty big factories that is written in c

39
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,970
the most portable thing.

40
00:01:57,059 --> 00:02:01,930
So it has been a sort of a success factor but of course in the backside and yeah,

41
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,970
it's not memory safe.

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,889
So there is we have this bus load of unfortunate problems coming with it.

43
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,139
So sure, I, so the

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,820
I could imagine introducing more memory safe languages going forward,

45
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,660
but I'm not going to do that as one single rewrite take.

46
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:18,919
But

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,240
I could possibly consider, you know, replacing components and

48
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,509
using more third party libraries that are written in

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,119
rust rather than written in C if they exist.

50
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,750
And if they're good enough and if that is sort of what the

51
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:33,550
uh

52
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,740
the user community wants to go.

53
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,729
Uh A lot of people are sort of begging asking

54
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,690
saying we should all go to those libraries and,

55
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,500
but

56
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,279
um looking where the users are going today, they are not going with those choices,

57
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:47,539
right?

58
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,910
They exist and they're out there, they've been here now for years,

59
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,669
but that's not why I see where I see users going,

60
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,630
even if they, even when they exist as sort of

61
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,750
at least semi

62
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,979
decent alternatives like the TLS libraries and other things,

63
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:05,699
I want to, I want to pull that thread

64
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,350
because you have one of the most widely used applications on the

65
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,830
planet and off the planet for that matter because I mean,

66
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,800
curl is running literally everywhere

67
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,029
in space.

68
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:17,190
And

69
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,669
you mentioned about the users aren't going there with these various

70
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,389
memory safe libraries and languages in, in all this stuff. And

71
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:28,139
I think if you look at curl,

72
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,039
the

73
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,600
kind of user experience of it

74
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,759
has

75
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,279
it, it's phenomenal, right?

76
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,979
I mean, there's a command line application but it works very well.

77
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,639
The library is very easy to use

78
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
and I'm, I'm curious your thoughts on,

79
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:45,240
on how did you end up in a place where you

80
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,779
basically built an extremely user friendly command line application and library.

81
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,509
Suddenly

82
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,470
I've never considered myself sort of user friendly in that

83
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,500
I don't sort of work very much with users.

84
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,279
So it's,

85
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,309
I wouldn't say that it's by accident maybe. But

86
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,699
I think I had

87
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:11,794
a little bit of a fortunate or luck when I decided that

88
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:14,994
it would be oriented around URL S the way it is so that

89
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,964
you could sort of put different URL S and it doesn't really matter.

90
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,454
So you don't have to think about it. And

91
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:20,774
-- sorry,
-- stupid question.

92
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:24,595
But if you're writing a web library that gets stuff from the web,

93
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,950
how would you do it any other way than oriented around URL

94
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,579
S?

95
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:29,920
So

96
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:30,820
it just, it seems

97
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:31,179
to me

98
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,959
that that's a very good question. But um

99
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:34,279
uh

100
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,230
originally when I started making libraries, right,

101
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:41,220
the other libraries that existed, they were not really oriented around URL S,

102
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,769
they were more, you do an HTP oriented thing.

103
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,070
So you would sort of create it around the, the more

104
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:51,250
mechanics to the components within the HTP.

105
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:54,410
I'm just trying to remember having a flashback to like 25 years ago.

106
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,279
-- It was FTP. Kurt, it was all
-- FTP. No, but no, you're, you're, you're right in thought.

107
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,040
It was

108
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,390
essentially, yeah,

109
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:05,950
-- you had to construct the request yourself.
-- Exactly.

110
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,579
So they were more low level and more you would have to

111
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:12,119
understand or sort of at least work with the protocol more.

112
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,100
And I wanted to

113
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,600
avoid the use of having to know a lot about the protocol, but more talk about

114
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,070
uh well,

115
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,070
the end point and then sort of magically fix things for you

116
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,890
so that you could do different protocols pretty much without understanding the.

117
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,609
So then you could do an FTP URL and an HTP URL and it would get the data the same way,

118
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:34,660
even though you, the protocols are completely different underneath.

119
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,429
That's fair.

120
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:37,269
That's a good point.

121
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,200
So then, and then, and then my pretty early,

122
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:44,470
very early on realized that people really do not want things to change, right?

123
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,149
If you write a script today, you

124
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,239
don't want Carl to sort of, no, we changed a few options or change things.

125
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,910
So everything would break down the road, right? So we very quickly figured out

126
00:05:56,059 --> 00:06:00,480
-- we should just stick with everything, whatever we ship, keep it like that
-- forever.

127
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,799
I think it boils down to like Linna says, do not break user space.

128
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,160
Exactly.

129
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,239
Yeah. No, I, I really respect that.

130
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,940
One thing that drives me nuts is I wish

131
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,649
there was like more of a standard dash

132
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,359
I dash hole for input output files and stuff. But I get like once you pick something

133
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,649
that's it like it's, it has to stay that way.

134
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:18,890
-- Yeah.
-- Exactly.

135
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,130
Because then you get a trade off,

136
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,690
you sure you want to be compatible with other tools that also use the same kind of,

137
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,820
but you want to be compatible with yourself from the past as well.

138
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:30,410
So you have that weird situation. So

139
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:34,760
sure you want to be like the others, but you also don't want to break your other users.

140
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,029
So

141
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,609
mm and I,

142
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,950
when you've been around for a long time.

143
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,970
I decided all those early options very early.

144
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,549
That was, you know, basically 1997 times. So,

145
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,709
maybe a few of them were not very cleverly

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,679
chosen and maybe I should have done it differently.

147
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,029
But

148
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,720
-- that's long gone now. Right. So, it's too late.
-- The

149
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,239
thing is, I mean, in reality though,

150
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,380
you can't optimize a problem until you've solved it and used it for a while.

151
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,440
Like that's one thing I keep running into with

152
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,000
kind of, a lot of these tools is and their options is just, oh, we didn't, we,

153
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,440
it's not that we didn't know any better.

154
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,200
We could not have known any better.

155
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,029
Like, for example,

156
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,250
you're going to have options you're gonna need in five years with H TB version.

157
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,880
What is it now? Three or two, no, three quick.

158
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:20,350
Like, there's gonna be new stuff that you can even predict 10 years ago.

159
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,269
Exactly.

160
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,630
And a lot of those we did add back in

161
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,130
the days we don't need anymore because that's sort of,

162
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,869
that's how we did the internet 20 years ago.

163
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,869
Right. So now we have short options for things.

164
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,049
No one ever is going to use totally wasted. But we,

165
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:36,170
but yeah, that's exactly how it just turns out that way.

166
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,880
All right, I'm gonna steer this bus into the security lane because that's,

167
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,299
that's why we're here after all.

168
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,450
So, I'm curious, your thoughts,

169
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:47,070
Daniel on all of the security people complain nonstop.

170
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,399
How curl pipe to bash is like the most insecure thing ever in the history of the world

171
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:56,660
yet. It is probably the most popular way to install software ever. Yeah,

172
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,279
I would, I would, I mean, it amuses me to no end that everyone complains.

173
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,250
Everyone still uses it.

174
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,329
I'm, I'm curious your thoughts on this, just like,

175
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,890
when you hear security people complaining and whining that it's a horrible thing.

176
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,600
-- Yes.
-- I, in my view it's not that horrible.

177
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:14,929
I mean, it, it's not the best thing because it's sure

178
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,380
trusting something and you're just piping it to your,

179
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,640
to your shell.

180
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:19,739
I mean,

181
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,089
in the worst case as a pseudo and your shell like that,

182
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,989
but in most cases people are actually, I mean, there's some kind of trust to the site.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,359
You're, you're downloading that content from anyway, like,

184
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:32,489
when you're installing,

185
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:33,938
I don't know, I know

186
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,578
Homebrew or r they have that as documented ways to install it,

187
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:40,948
but you're downloading it from their official websites.

188
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:41,518
Right. You're,

189
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,508
you're there already. You're viewing the site, you trust it.

190
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:46,078
So

191
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,828
the difference from downloading that script and

192
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:51,598
running it or running it immediately,

193
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:58,169
it's a very subtle difference. Sure, you can do it in better ways. I agree. But

194
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:01,799
I often think that people actually are overreacting to that thing.

195
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:05,799
But of course, if you go with just a random site somewhere on the internet,

196
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:08,780
you can just run it then, yes, that's totally insecure.

197
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:09,039
But

198
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,650
that's rarely what people are doing when they do this.

199
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,130
That's also true of all those old shareware sites that were like, not two cows,

200
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,460
right?

201
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:15,890
Like,

202
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,409
you know, we download dot exes from

203
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,489
wherever.

204
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:19,830
Like I,

205
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,159
I literally bought a web camera and it said to get the

206
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:25,340
drivers go to this IP address slash something slash dot exe.

207
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:26,090
And I'm like,

208
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,289
I, I put it through virus total and it scanned clean and I'm like, ok,

209
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:33,450
but I, my only complaint about curl pipe to bash would be

210
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,159
you might get an error so it might not work. Right.

211
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,549
I, I can't like easily download it and keep it.

212
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,840
And number two is like, there's no versioning or what am I getting? Right?

213
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,820
And it's almost always the latest.

214
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,960
And I, so for me, I personally don't like it from a reliability perspective.

215
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,500
I don't, honestly, from a security perspective, I mean,

216
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,280
I'm downloading software from

217
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,070
repositories and II, I don't inspect it like

218
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,210
I don't have time for that.

219
00:09:58,729 --> 00:09:58,989
Yeah.

220
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,479
So, yeah.

221
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,289
Yeah.

222
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,969
As long as it's http si mean, if it's not http S then obviously

223
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,849
that's bad.

224
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,770
That's

225
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,609
exactly as long as it's htps

226
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:14,130
and you're downloading it from, from a place that you actually trust.

227
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,409
I mean,

228
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,840
it's one of those sites you actually want to not

229
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,880
just a random thing with a lot of digits somewhere.

230
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,369
Someone told you to download

231
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,909
it always amuses me when I see like the,

232
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:31,359
the, the old retro computer enthusiasts that are, like,

233
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:34,760
I found this executable on this website and it had the drivers for the thing.

234
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,710
And I'm like, oh, my goodness, like, this is my nightmare.

235
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,770
-- That
-- guy that wrote that made that USB card for TRS eighties

236
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,140
and got some drivers off of an old B BS mirror from,

237
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,609
like,

238
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:46,200
and it's just like that,

239
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,239
that's actually how we used to do this. Like, you'd go to a,

240
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:54,270
-- yeah, you just download stuff and make it work and security
-- for a very long time.

241
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,500
Exactly. We did that for a very long time.

242
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,030
I mean, I guess a lot of people are still doing it. So, yes,

243
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,270
-- I would
-- assume if I buy a smart fridge, that's what it's doing.

244
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:04,309
Yeah. Right. Right.

245
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,159
Oh, my goodness.

246
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,859
Ok. Let's talk about memory safety for a little bit because

247
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,520
you mentioned a little while ago how Curl isn't written in a memory safe language.

248
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,599
But I do want to comment for as widely used as Curl is

249
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:22,750
and no doubt as much attention as it receives from security researchers.

250
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,130
I feel like there are not very many security vulnerabilities

251
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,369
in

252
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:28,010
Curl. Like, is this

253
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:32,109
an accident? Is it on purpose? Are you mindful of the, the way it's written?

254
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:32,890
I

255
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:34,690
it is not, it's,

256
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:37,750
we're, we're doing a lot of work and making sure that we,

257
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,849
that we limit and, and limit down and,

258
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,630
and reduce the amount of security problems that we suffer from.

259
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,330
But sure we have our share of it.

260
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,969
Uh So yeah, we do everything we can to make sure that we, we do it as good as possible.

261
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:52,809
You know, all the tools and all the analyzers and fuzzing and

262
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,270
uh nonstop and we have a bag bounty.

263
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,599
So we pay researchers cash for the report security problems.

264
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,179
So that's um,

265
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:07,000
yeah, so I think we're doing pretty much as from an engineering

266
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,239
point of view. we're doing everything that we can.

267
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,960
There, there are really no silver bullets on how to do it, right.

268
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:14,320
You just have to do everything and, and then

269
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:15,320
do everything

270
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:19,539
slightly better all the time and maybe learn from your mistakes and do

271
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:22,460
-- it a little better next time when you've done a mistake once
-- so.

272
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:26,239
Well, my one suspicion was always and maybe this is wrong or right, but

273
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:30,599
curl talks to everything straight up everything, right? So

274
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:31,950
for it to work,

275
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,679
you have to basically support every corner case

276
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,479
and every bit of weirdness and every little strangeness

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,919
and I can't help but think that that essentially

278
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,609
forces you to write very robust code because you,

279
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,059
you can't make, basically you cannot make assumptions,

280
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,760
any assumption would be unsafe because there's

281
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,000
definitely a web developer out there.

282
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,479
That was like, no, I think that's a bad idea. I'm going to do it this way,

283
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:52,380
you know, and I,

284
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,479
is that the case?

285
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,190
Uh

286
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,239
um

287
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,599
Yes and no, I think,

288
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:04,200
I mean, yeah, that goes as far as you get all those corner cases from the valid,

289
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,489
uh, situations. Right. That could happen. I think

290
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,010
that's the tricky part is still when there's a malicious intent somewhere,

291
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,719
that sort of, you know,

292
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,929
finds that weird thing that nobody actually ever implemented

293
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,669
it this way because it would be crazy.

294
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,549
But, but when you do it, but someone can figure that out and, oh,

295
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,260
you could also have this really strange value into a

296
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,640
field somewhere and then we would treat it badly,

297
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,000
right?

298
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,469
Uh

299
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:30,299
So,

300
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,330
so yeah, sure it gets pretty good when we, we're,

301
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,260
we're working with all the edge cases, but

302
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:38,530
then we still have to

303
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,419
just apply a lot of common sense, read code review. And

304
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,659
of course, um

305
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,219
I would say just try to write code in a sensible way. That's

306
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,650
easy to understand, easy to debug and easy to spot those problems, you know,

307
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:53,000
the memory

308
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,489
overflows, the how to handle buffers and everything.

309
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,200
And over over there,

310
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,260
I would say maybe four or five

311
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,849
last year. So we've

312
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:07,059
also made an effort in a while ago. II, I guess it was maybe 566 years ago.

313
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,179
I,

314
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:13,270
I spotted that we had several security problems in a sort of related kind of code and I

315
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,909
figure out that I should really reduce this kind of thing so

316
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,380
that we don't accidentally slip in more of these kinds of problems.

317
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,539
So I sort of try to

318
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,479
introduce more helper functions into curl that we could use than to

319
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,289
reduce the sort of the risk that we would introduce this problem.

320
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:29,940
Again,

321
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,330
one of those things and one of those

322
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:37,789
I would say theoretical problems is that it's an integer overflow,

323
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,330
which is very common in like in C when you,

324
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,609
you do, for,

325
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,080
for example, you have a length of data and you add a number and then you malo

326
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,229
that size to get the data, right?

327
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,030
And then

328
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,880
we had several of those problems when someone figured out.

329
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,690
Oh, well, on a 32 bit system,

330
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,109
if you have this huge buffer and you enter that and we take,

331
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:02,500
you know the buffer multiply it by four and add something sure it could wrap

332
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,869
uh in memory and you would get a mao

333
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:09,260
of three bytes and copy four gigabytes and that would be bad, right?

334
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,020
So, but

335
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:15,859
OK, really, really, really hard to actually execute in in, in real world.

336
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:18,880
But maybe in some cases you could. So it was a security problem. But

337
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,840
like that, we make sure that we basically everywhere.

338
00:15:21,849 --> 00:15:26,429
Nowadays we limit the maximum string size you can pass into the library.

339
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:32,984
Why be why accept half a gigabyte when maybe eight megabytes? It's crazy big anyway.

340
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:38,125
So just limit it to that and things like that sort of put some artificial, well,

341
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:41,205
not artificial but some limits here and there to limit

342
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:44,044
the the the risk of us doing those mistakes.

343
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:45,125
Again, totally.

344
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:48,395
So that way, I think we slowly gradually actually improve or,

345
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,405
or we reduce the risk of introducing those same things trying

346
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:54,044
to learn from past mistakes and and not do them again.

347
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,380
Uh 11 question, do you like, do you share test cases with other web clients? Like

348
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,340
I was just looking at your test suite director and there's

349
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:05,159
like a bunch of profiles and a bunch of micro servers,

350
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:05,739
blah, blah blah.

351
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:10,929
But for example, do you and w get for the sake of argument, like say, you know,

352
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,580
here's a test case, here's a new one

353
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,330
and share them or is that a thing in the industry at all?

354
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,210
It's not.

355
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:23,179
Um I mean, it, it would be good. I mean, I think we could all benefit from that.

356
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,390
I, there are some

357
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,659
other projects that are reusing our test suites and,

358
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:33,429
and I know a proxy that is testing their stuff with our test suites.

359
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,380
So I think it's good.

360
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,500
Otherwise I think our test suite is very, very much crafted for,

361
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:42,280
for curl for our purposes and, and for our use, it's

362
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,859
might be a bit bit of work to, to generalize it, to be useful for others.

363
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:48,380
Of course, it,

364
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,250
it would have been good if we would have been

365
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,780
even more people to sort of help out and contribute to

366
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,820
um a common test suite. But that, that's not the case here.

367
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,119
Totally. All right. All right, let's, let's keep going down this road

368
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,640
you recently

369
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:08,560
got, I'll say a bit of attention for some CV E incidents

370
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:10,810
that you're quite vocal about. I'm,

371
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,160
and in fact, we did a whole show on this. I mean,

372
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,329
it was,

373
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,949
you, you're here, like, tell us your story.

374
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,410
Oh, yeah, there's been so much CBE recently, so, yeah. So,

375
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,380
yeah.

376
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:24,920
Yeah. Yeah.

377
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,880
Where to start.

378
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,910
Of course.

379
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:33,479
Yeah, I started the venture, of course, by complaining, uh,

380
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:38,760
the NVD always sort of inflating our, uh CV ES whenever they can

381
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,199
or, and, and they think that's a good thing.

382
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,239
So they tend to sort of

383
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:47,160
host our CV with a very high scores.

384
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,589
When, when I think that's completely wrong, I think it doesn't help anyone.

385
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,319
I think they're

386
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,089
scaremongering and,

387
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,290
and, and the effect of that since they sort of inflate everything

388
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:00,849
nowadays,

389
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:03,930
a lot of people seem to be using these scanners or

390
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:07,199
scanning for software and they use those scores for CBS.

391
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:10,130
So now suddenly I get a lot of feedback from users saying,

392
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,510
hey, I found these CV s in,

393
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,569
there's always on windows nowadays so they found a

394
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:21,109
curl on windows. It's vulnerable for this CB, you know, scored high as

395
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,599
a whatever,

396
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,609
what should I do?

397
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,630
And I tried to argue that, no, no, it's not that bad.

398
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,469
It's just, you know, it's just a medium or a low security problem because blah, blah,

399
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:30,709
blah,

400
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,869
but that's not what their scanners say.

401
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,630
And a lot of people now have these contracts when they say they're

402
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,300
obligated to fix their uh scanning warnings within these number of days.

403
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,130
So, what do they do?

404
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:48,859
-- Well, they, they email me and cry about it, but I can't do much about it so
-- well.

405
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:53,010
Ok. So first comment because this is something that comes up a lot. Uh So

406
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,569
just so viewers know the NVD is the

407
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,329
national vulnerability database and it is funded by

408
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:02,010
and run by the US government for the US government.

409
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,790
And what a lot of people forget is that these CV SS scores

410
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:06,349
are for the US government.

411
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:06,780
Now,

412
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,930
the problem is everybody else uses them because there's

413
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,489
no other freely available source of CV SS scores,

414
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,140
right?

415
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,020
And so the US government makes this like worst case assumption of like, well,

416
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,400
somebody could be using this curl thing in a stupid, crazy way

417
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,640
as root,

418
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,449
root, like grabbing random stuff from God knows where.

419
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,300
So that's the first comment is that the CV S scoring is wrong in the

420
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,189
sense of people are using it wrong because they're not the US government probably.

421
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,619
But the second thing I don't understand is

422
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:35,329
they're scanning their software,

423
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:40,380
they're finding a curl version that is out of date with a vulnerability.

424
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,010
Why are they talking to you? Like you already released the patch? No, I, I like I'm

425
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,079
serious. Like, what are you supposed to do?

426
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:49,119
It's like, well, here's the patch, like here's the new version we,

427
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,750
-- we did.
-- Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

428
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,630
But then there's this huge disconnect from the world who is using, they're using

429
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,255
but they have no idea how to actually get that

430
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,875
fix into their machines. So, yeah, why are they emailing me?

431
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:06,655
Because they find out that I'm behind curl.

432
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,555
Do you just send them the latest tar ball of curl and be like, here you go.

433
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:12,064
No, because what else are you like?

434
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:13,439
Yeah.

435
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,760
Well, yeah, what else can I do? I,

436
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,160
I really can't do anything.

437
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,810
And in, in the case of windows,

438
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:22,270
I can't do anything at all because you have to fix it with windows itself,

439
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,930
you have to do it with windows update.

440
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:25,760
Otherwise you break windows update.

441
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:27,640
So,

442
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:29,479
so what I can just say you,

443
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:33,359
you need to contact Microsoft about that or just wait until they fix it.

444
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,500
Um,

445
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,609
and that's not a really good message. No one likes that.

446
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,930
-- Ah,
-- this is so amusing and, and I don't,

447
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,660
do you still get the emails from people complaining about their cars?

448
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:47,579
I recall because your email was in like the back of car manuals.

449
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:52,010
-- People were emailing you about their cars. Yeah,
-- I get car questions every now

450
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,439
and then

451
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:53,510
I

452
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,949
actually get questions about pretty much everything

453
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,189
because people find my email address in,

454
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,430
in everything.

455
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,430
I sort of get that because by definition, these people, like,

456
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,689
they're flailing around and they find a name and an email address and so they hit it,

457
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:06,869
right.

458
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,189
Like,

459
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,180
we used to run an answer column

460
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,989
at the, at the, uh, security portal.com. This is like pre 2000.

461
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,750
And,

462
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,560
yeah, we would get people

463
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,949
with like crazy stories saying I need help.

464
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,310
My computer's been hacked, blah, blah, blah. And we're like, yeah, we can't help.

465
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,109
We're not gonna help, like, take it to a computer store.

466
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:23,709
Yeah.

467
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:26,969
And I'm pretty sure that in many times my

468
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:29,290
email sticks out because it's the current license.

469
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,900
So, so

470
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,780
do these open source collections.

471
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,959
That's my, my,

472
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:36,150
and I think in many other cases they don't have the email and the licenses.

473
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,369
So, you know,

474
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,729
we have to scroll through that list of 100 and 50

475
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:42,000
licenses and then somewhere in there that's an email address.

476
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,949
I'm gonna mail that guy and ask about my GPS problem and he's going to fix it for me.

477
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,849
Oh, my goodness.

478
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,969
Ok. How much, like random, weird email like that do you get?

479
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,800
It's got to be ridiculous.

480
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,719
Well,

481
00:21:56,989 --> 00:22:02,119
how much? Yeah, I, suddenly, every week I get some kind of email about,

482
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,650
there's,

483
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,160
they're often also about games because it seems to be fairly popular in games.

484
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,209
So I get a lot of games questions, you know, fixing

485
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,849
people's problems in how to solve games and game accounts and stuff like that.

486
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,609
Yeah, I get a lot of V PM questions.

487
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,069
It goes in waves suddenly sometimes, you know, when some app

488
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:28,569
in particular has a problem doing a particular phase or some bugs or whatever.

489
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:31,420
I can get a huge amount of emails for some particular product,

490
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,790
you know, out of the blues.

491
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,609
I have no idea what they're talking about,

492
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,520
but suddenly I get a sort of a flood of emails

493
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,449
and then they might go away or come back and,

494
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:39,750
yeah,

495
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,319
it's funny because it's not me.

496
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:50,000
I actually find it kind of curious in many times because it sort of reveals, oh,

497
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,839
curl is used by this little thing that they were emailing me about.

498
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:58,020
Oh, in that kitchen thing in that car, in that fridge, in that printer, you know,

499
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:01,859
but, but what else would they use? Like if I have to go get something from the web,

500
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:02,930
I'm

501
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,140
everybody knows curl like

502
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:06,250
yeah,

503
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:09,660
like literally there's curl and w get, what else would there be

504
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,780
like? I can't even think of anything off the top of my head,

505
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,630
right?

506
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,439
But if you would write an application on, on a, on a device somewhere,

507
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:20,910
there are alternatives and in particularly if you would do it on a mobile phone,

508
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,430
for example,

509
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,689
there are Android solutions that would do it or

510
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,640
I OS solutions that would do it differently.

511
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,219
So there are

512
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:29,819
definitely competitors and alternatives to use

513
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,500
because just back to the Microsoft thing, I've just actually ran curl and so yeah,

514
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,939
curls installed by default on windows since whatever version some long time ago.

515
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,890
But what's interesting is the hyphen version hyphen hyphen version.

516
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,920
None of that stuff works.

517
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,699
Like I'm trying to figure out what version of Curl do I actually have installed?

518
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:46,500
And I'm like,

519
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,579
I'll tell you why because you're not running Curl. When you type that,

520
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,979
it's an alias thing.

521
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah,

522
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,689
that's another sore point here. So you,

523
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,619
you stepped right into it.

524
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:05,339
Sorry. What, so what am I when I run Curl in powershell? What is it?

525
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:09,739
-- What is it actually
-- running? That's an alias for another powershell command.

526
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,890
So yeah, they did that before. They had the real curl.

527
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,180
They introduced an alias for another thing that's totally not curl at all.

528
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:18,689
Oh Invoke web request. OK.

529
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:21,859
Yeah, because I was like this does not look at all like curl or behave like curl.

530
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:25,800
-- So
-- if you, if you invoke it as curl dot xe, you get the

531
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,079
curl,

532
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,250
the real curl.

533
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,170
So I'm hearing Microsoft rewrote curl in a weekend. That's what I just heard.

534
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,469
Yeah. No, it just, it, it runs something called invoke web request,

535
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,819
which is a Powershell thing I'm assuming.

536
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,410
Lovely. I'm sure that doesn't break everything. Right.

537
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:44,020
-- Yeah,
-- exactly. So

538
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,260
-- we get questions about that too.
-- Yeah.

539
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,099
Yeah. Like because yeah, because when I ran it, I was like, what

540
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:50,020
some weird,

541
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:51,579
yeah, I've actually never

542
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,420
on windows before I realized

543
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,630
like never in my life.

544
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,339
Well, I have Linux

545
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:56,930
like

546
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,119
I'm not gonna run this on windows

547
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,500
until now. All right. All right. So let's back to the CV. E topic.

548
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:08,180
So you had all these difficulties with CV E and

549
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:11,010
your solution was to become AC N A

550
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,189
and I'm curious your thoughts on that whole

551
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,079
thing.

552
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,180
-- So,
-- ok, so,

553
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:20,219
so when I got this most recent bogus CV E that

554
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:25,560
someone filed against Carl 2020 19 909 or whatever it is,

555
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,849
which was clearly not a

556
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,469
security problem at all, whatever might recess about it.

557
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:34,189
Um,

558
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,280
because they, of course says that it is

559
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,530
-- well,
-- and again, I mean, I was on a CV board,

560
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,170
they don't

561
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,959
validate anything. They can't, right.

562
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:45,500
Like there's close source CV S like, I don't have a copy of

563
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,119
-- Hai's nuclear power plant controls
-- often.

564
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:52,560
But in this case, I, I submitted a rejection to them with a full motivation,

565
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:54,339
including all my information

566
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:58,324
about it, you know, source code links to the patches, everything and said

567
00:25:58,574 --> 00:26:00,175
this is not a security problem.

568
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,734
Look at the patches, here's the explanation, but they,

569
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:05,875
but they still insist that now it could have a security impact

570
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:10,935
without, you know, without going into how or why or anything. And it's just some

571
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:12,734
group email saying that

572
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:14,055
end of discussion.

573
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,089
So, ok, so they think it's a security problem but it's not.

574
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,630
And because they think it, it's a security problem,

575
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,849
it remains a CV E and then it remains.

576
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,189
And by uh NV DS

577
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:26,209
keeps it hosted and they,

578
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,550
but it's OK. My secondary thing was then to complain to NVD and say,

579
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,930
how can you score this as

580
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,780
whatever they scored it? Um

581
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:38,459
And you should just, yeah, they scored it 9.8 and then I,

582
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:42,050
I complained to them and it ended up as a 3.3 after my complaint

583
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,260
and again, back to NVD. Sure they, they do a worst case scenario.

584
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:50,599
But when the, the only information they have says, integrate overflow,

585
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,199
what is the worst case?

586
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,689
Probably pretty bad

587
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:57,229
because what kind of input do you do in integra overflow?

588
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:02,660
That could be really, really bad or it could be nothing. But anyway, so since II, I

589
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:05,780
don't like the situation, I think there's so many

590
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,489
bad steps along this way,

591
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,979
I think one of the ways I can limit the damage here is to

592
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:15,339
actually register as AC N A because then I can get a better say about

593
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:19,079
uh future CV S that concerns products that I am sort of

594
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:23,569
in my scope as AC N A which then becomes curl products, curl and lib

595
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,900
-- pretty much
-- well and again to history for the viewers. So

596
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,770
how do I put this nicely? The CV program was a great thing 25 years ago.

597
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:37,369
And unfortunately, it's still basically the same thing and

598
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,810
the world has changed.

599
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,349
And number two is even as a board member,

600
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,579
like I kind of tried to find out how CV E actually works within Miter

601
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,380
and I was unable to

602
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:51,109
like for example, who is doing that work,

603
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,410
like the actual names of the human beings doing that work.

604
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,689
II, I don't know.

605
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:58,949
Right. And I was a board member for what, like, 67 years, something like that.

606
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,369
Um, so

607
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:03,770
-- that's all I got.
-- So,

608
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:06,349
I guess your frustration is totally expected

609
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,270
-- and, and no one knows what to do
-- and,

610
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,739
and the solution of you have to become

611
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,589
a CV numbering authority and jump through those hoops

612
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,920
so that you can have that sort of first rate of refusal is in my opinion,

613
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,310
utterly, utterly ridiculous because

614
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:19,250
like I get that

615
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,920
it just doesn't scale.

616
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:23,040
No, it's totally ridiculous.

617
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,599
And I also feel a little bit selfish for doing this because

618
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:31,609
we can, everyone can't do this. It's not, it doesn't scale. It's a crazy thing.

619
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,829
So I, I understand that it's really not a long term solution for anyone.

620
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,619
It's rather a short term solution for me,

621
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,170
but that's also

622
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,380
sure.

623
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,540
So, but yeah, I'm doing it anyway and it seems to,

624
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,619
I'm actually not accepted there yet.

625
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,689
So sort of we're in the process. So we,

626
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,520
we're a few weeks off here because I've had all the interviews.

627
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,140
I've done all the things.

628
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:57,650
So it's just a few more steps in the dance to become accepted there.

629
00:28:57,699 --> 00:29:00,869
But it seems to be a rather low administration for us.

630
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,979
So I think it's not going to be a big hurdle for us. It's very limited to only our CV ES.

631
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:06,630
Yeah.

632
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,959
Well, I mean, and the dirty, the dirty secret is, there's a lot of CNAs that have, uh,

633
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:11,849
one of my favorite ones.

634
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,640
They've done six CV ES over the course of their

635
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,339
entire career and they all point at marketing pages now.

636
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,449
Right. So, there's like, there's a lot of CNAs that shouldn't be CNAs and there's,

637
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,329
well, I mean, I think we can all agree if, like,

638
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:27,880
something like curl should be somehow involved in this process better.

639
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,349
You know, there's a lot of software like that, like,

640
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,540
yeah.

641
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,900
Yeah. I don't know.

642
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,060
I don't know what to say.

643
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,849
That's one of the reasons I quit the board.

644
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,989
Exactly.

645
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,420
I don't know what to say. That's a sort of a comment.

646
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:42,180
All right. All right.

647
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:47,390
So, I wanna, I wanna bring this one home with the kind of community angle to curl.

648
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,739
I, I just looked on Mastodon and a couple of days ago you had

649
00:29:50,949 --> 00:29:54,790
you, every time you have a new committer to curl you, like, put a little blur.

650
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:59,060
But, which I think is phenomenal. Like, that's amazing. And it was number what, 1209

651
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:03,329
1000, 209 contributors to Curl, which is

652
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,619
bananas and, and I'm sure it's more than that by now, probably.

653
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,959
And by the time this comes out it'll be far more.

654
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:14,959
-- It's actually,
-- exactly by the time this comes out, but it's actually 1209. Exactly.

655
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:15,439
Right now.

656
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,880
Well, you said that two days ago. So,

657
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:21,530
so, so

658
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,520
I think it cannot be understated

659
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,859
that the community of people you have constructed around this tool

660
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,699
is phenomenal and gigantic and without question,

661
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,420
contributes to part of that success.

662
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,069
And so the question I have is obviously on one hand,

663
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,560
there's like managing a community and building a community.

664
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,430
But then also I feel like

665
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,449
how do you get all this done in a day?

666
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,170
You, I mean, you're, you're all over the place, right?

667
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,890
You're managing a community, you're building an application, you're,

668
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,949
you're doing security work with,

669
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:55,599
with CV E and miter and every and it's just like

670
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:58,050
I look at you and I feel like I am pathetic.

671
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,780
Well, what can I say? Iii I do my best.

672
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:09,130
I try to, to, to be effective at doing the things I do and I need to do and of course,

673
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,079
when it comes to the sort of the community and a lot of contributors around it,

674
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:13,969
it's

675
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:16,630
I try to just keep,

676
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,839
uh treat everyone fair in the same way and just make

677
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:23,170
sure that I thank everyone and accept their contributions and I,

678
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,790
you know, put the feedback cycle back

679
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,550
the way I would have wanted it to be. And I think the way it,

680
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:34,079
the more curl is used and the better it has succeeded and the more it's used,

681
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:35,290
it sort of it feeds back.

682
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,290
So more people are actually interested in fixing

683
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,800
things because more people are using it.

684
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,359
So it's a positive spin in that regard

685
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:42,560
and

686
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,910
then how to do it.

687
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,810
I, I have a lot of people helping out uh I mean,

688
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:50,359
more and then just providing uh pull request as well.

689
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,719
So we're, we're a whole team these days

690
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:53,650
and we

691
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:57,250
just try to do the best we can to make sure things are

692
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,719
progressing as it as they should.

693
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:02,459
Now you work for wolf SSL. Right.

694
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,189
Yes.

695
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,339
So

696
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,349
how many like staff do they have? Like essentially maintaining curl?

697
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,109
-- That's basically me.
-- OK. OK.

698
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,750
Which is, I mean, that's amazing.

699
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,040
Still like the fact that they're willing to invest in that I think is phenomenal.

700
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,709
I think that's actually healthier in some ways because it's

701
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:23,050
more sustainable to have the community actually supporting it.

702
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,369
And

703
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,239
I think this is one of the cases like the

704
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:26,310
kernel where like

705
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:29,510
the community should be able to do this because this is a slightly,

706
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,510
somewhat widely used piece of software.

707
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,140
Like, no, really. Like

708
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,510
this isn't some niche thing,

709
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:38,010
you know, and I, that, yeah,

710
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,619
that was always my concern with Red Hat when

711
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,280
Red Hat had all the developers working on it,

712
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,599
paying them and if Red Hat decides not to do it anymore.

713
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:44,849
-- Poof.
-- Yeah.

714
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,560
Right.

715
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:50,189
-- So that's the, that's the question I always get then what happens when I stop?
-- Yeah.

716
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,689
-- Like I would be sad if curl stopped working. Like,
-- yeah,

717
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:53,239
very,

718
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,680
very sad.

719
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,770
Well, I, I, even if I would stop. I don't think it would stop working. You know,

720
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,530
I don't plan to

721
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,630
and I don't plan to stop at working at curl anytime soon anyway.

722
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,630
So I, I plan on continuing this.

723
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:07,589
But I also,

724
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:14,069
I get this question quite a lot, so I'm not alone here and I also always make a really

725
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,109
strong effort to make sure that everything

726
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:17,880
we do is completely open.

727
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,420
You know, all the processes, all the code, everything is there.

728
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:24,069
So even if I would go on an extended vacation tomorrow, um,

729
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,180
it wouldn't really stop anything.

730
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:28,959
It wouldn't possibly make a little dent in the speed on

731
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:31,300
how to do things because I do quite a lot.

732
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:32,000
But

733
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:33,739
it's, it wouldn't be a,

734
00:33:33,989 --> 00:33:36,729
it wouldn't stop anything. It wouldn't be that big of a

735
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,589
problem

736
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,560
over time.

737
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,250
Awesome. Awesome. I mean, that's the dream, right?

738
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,109
You've, you've got,

739
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,550
you build your community and then the community becomes its own thing.

740
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,939
Oh, yeah. It's, it's certainly the dream. I mean,

741
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,010
I, I'm already living the dream here.

742
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,910
I'm, I'm working with my spare time project full time. Yeah. So.

743
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:55,479
Oh man.

744
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,199
So, ok. So let's end on that note.

745
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:00,280
Then you said working on my spare time project full time.

746
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:04,680
Obviously, you started doing curl part time in the nineties, obviously.

747
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:08,820
At what point did you realize? Like this is it, I'm, this is my job now.

748
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,840
This is what I'm doing.

749
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,379
Well, it took forever. I, I, um,

750
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,590
I started working with curl full time in 2019.

751
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,708
So, the 1st

752
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,060
21 years or so I did it on my spare time.

753
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:28,938
-- So, yeah, it took a long time until I actually got it to become my job.
-- Holy cow.

754
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,389
I didn't realize it was. That,

755
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:34,860
that, that's like, I guess late. Oh, my goodness. 2019.

756
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:40,219
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I'm soon celebrating my fifth year as full time curl.

757
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:40,870
Yeah. Wow.

758
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:45,780
-- Amazing. Holy cow.
-- It was also partly because it's, it's a difficult step.

759
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,040
How do you actually sort of

760
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:50,248
how do you, how do you make money from something like this?

761
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:53,958
And how do you do that from day one or? It's hard to ramp up and it's

762
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,799
me. Right. And where's the money? And blah, blah, blah.

763
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:58,789
There's a lot of things that have to sort of,

764
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:02,759
I have a lot of ducks that have to be in a row to this to work. So

765
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:08,310
it was a sort of, yeah, and that particular moment in time I just had the opportunity.

766
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,780
I took it and then I

767
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:10,709
worked with Wolf as

768
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:14,459
Os and they sort of believed in this and signed me up for this. So,

769
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,300
yeah,

770
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,659
just worked out fine.

771
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,020
That's fantastic.

772
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,620
Awesome. Awesome. Alright.

773
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,520
Alright, we come to the end, Daniel, I'll give you the last word on this one.

774
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,860
What do you want everyone to know

775
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,040
reduce Carl Moore?

776
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,620
You know what

777
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,810
I agree because I've seen people write their own Janky or use weird niche

778
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:41,250
web clients and it does not end well and well, no

779
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,040
ignoring security that just stuff breaks.

780
00:35:44,379 --> 00:35:46,120
That's a good point. Exactly.

781
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:48,939
They don't have the expertise to be like, oh, this

782
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:52,040
niche server that now is 6 million servers or,

783
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,300
or like Yahoo picks it and all of a sudden, like, 30% of the web is using this thing.

784
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:59,090
Like, that's the thing I keep running into with all these web clients is like,

785
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:01,679
yeah, like just stuff breaks.

786
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,409
You mentioned, you mentioned what else you would use instead of curl.

787
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:09,590
And I think exactly what you're mentioning, that's some often my main

788
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,159
biggest competitor, especially when I talked to uh companies who are you

789
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:14,689
smaller systems?

790
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,469
Because from a lot of uh development board providers, they might ship their own.

791
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:21,870
Here's a Sa Mle HDP client and, you know,

792
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,379
that's 45 lines and you don't, it's very small and you can just, you know,

793
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,070
you don't need that big old curl. It's too big and, you know, complicated.

794
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,330
Here's a little tiny thing and it also works. But then, then I have to have it.

795
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,110
Yeah, sure.

796
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,719
It might work for that particular use case for a short while while you try this out,

797
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:41,100
but it's not really, you know.

798
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:41,870
Yeah.

799
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,310
So you don't work in the lab.

800
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,189
Yeah, for a while maybe. Yeah.

801
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,060
And as much as I hate to see a software monoculture,

802
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:53,209
at least I'd rather see a well maintained healthy monoculture versus like,

803
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,189
yeah, a 45 line.

804
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,080
Yeah, like in my head, I'm just like, thinking, like,

805
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,100
can I even fit all the status code handling in 45 lines?

806
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,919
Usually not.

807
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:07,649
And usually you have to do a lot of weird assumptions or Presumptions or, you know,

808
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,419
crazy things for that to work.

809
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,979
-- You only need
-- two of those. It's fine.

810
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,699
-- 200 everything else.
-- That's right

811
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:19,100
that you happened to see just now when you tried it out. Yeah.

812
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,550
Oh my goodness. This has been, this has been an absolute treat, Daniel.

813
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,449
I want to thank you so much for joining us today.

814
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,840
