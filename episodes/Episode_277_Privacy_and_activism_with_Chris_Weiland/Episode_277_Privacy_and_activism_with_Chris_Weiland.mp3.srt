Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,579
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner and Thought Crime. Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,250
Today we're joined with Chris Wayland,

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,370
who's the co-chair of Restore the Fourth Minnesota.

4
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:18,440
Say hello, Chris.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,090
-- Hey,
-- awesome. Thanks for being here, man.

6
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:22,209
Thanks for having me.

7
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:25,790
And also thank you for constantly opening up your podcast with

8
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,690
a reference to one of my favorite books of all time.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,649
1994.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,580
-- So, well, my first question is ok, what is the fourth, the
-- fourth amendment?

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,740
That's right. You're Canadian, aren't you? So that doesn't apply?

12
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,939
Oh, I, I know most of your amendments in government,

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,959
we should clarify before we kind of get moving too much.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,909
About half of our audience is not in North America. Fascinating.

15
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:52,619
So we should make sure any, any references we have to, we'll say North

16
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,619
American political,

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,500
whatever we we we probably should make sure we clarify. That makes sense.

18
00:00:58,529 --> 00:00:58,549
Yeah,

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,799
and I'm extremely proud of that fact as

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,720
well because I think it's awesome having an audience

21
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:06,139
-- in all kinds of awesome places.
-- Indeed.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,470
And the it makes sense too because all of

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,099
our digital infrastructure makes it much easier to do

24
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,160
global activism type stuff with.

25
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,800
And uh so, yeah, for folks who aren't aware

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,669
of what the fourth amendment is.

27
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,389
The fourth amendment of the United States constitution

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,819
is what protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure

29
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,319
without a

30
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,760
affidavit or from,

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,290
you know,

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,419
without there being particularity and specificity involved with

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,739
law enforcement wanting to perform the search.

34
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,660
It's what makes it so that

35
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,139
law enforcement can't just willy nilly decide to say

36
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,620
tap everybody's phones or just read everybody's emails.

37
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:47,879
Yeah.

38
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,660
And our whole organization sort of got off the ground

39
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:54,620
after the snowden revelations revealed that NSA was doing pretty much

40
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:55,074
that

41
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:58,595
-- one
-- stupid question because I was watching some cops the other day

42
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:02,805
and there was an agricultural inspection station episode which the summary is,

43
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:04,864
you better stop for them and let them look in your car.

44
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,144
Otherwise the cops are gonna

45
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:07,144
do it for you.

46
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:10,184
But what defines law enforcement in America? Because

47
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,304
one thing I've noticed is in a lot of countries

48
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:17,304
like law enforcement, police is very, very clearly defined.

49
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,070
Like in Canada, we have, you know, peace officers

50
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,759
and we don't have, for example, bounty hunters,

51
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,009
we don't have, you know,

52
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,770
like there's a whole bunch of stuff that's specific to America

53
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:28,240
where I feel like there's,

54
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,559
are they law enforcement or not like bounty hunters or you know,

55
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,729
us agricultural inspection

56
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:37,630
agency employees? Because apparently they can look through your car for fruit.

57
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,910
Like, and like if you don't like it. That's too bad.

58
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:44,550
There's also ice and customs and border and,

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,029
ok,

60
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,710
what's ice is immigrations and customs enforcement and they're just one of a myriad

61
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,220
of thousands of different bureaucratic entities in the

62
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,389
United States that do quote unquote law enforcement.

63
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:56,220
And

64
00:02:56,899 --> 00:03:00,720
unfortunately, the judiciary, the judiciary has not kept pace with

65
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,839
the federal government's ability to utilize,

66
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,539
uh, technology and frankly ability to get subpoenas from,

67
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,919
get data from third parties like Amazon and private corporations

68
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,600
to sort of subvert the intent of the fourth amendment,

69
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,710
which was to protect us from sort of general warrants.

70
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,320
And there's a lot of interesting history there.

71
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:19,949
-- But,
-- well,

72
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,479
if there's one thing I've learned from reading the

73
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,919
US Constitution a bit and the history around it,

74
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,589
like, what's really fascinating to me is the order of the amendments, right?

75
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,410
Because the first amendment being the freedom of speech,

76
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,169
um, the second amendment, the right to keep and bear arms the third,

77
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,000
which is my favorite.

78
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:34,610
By the way, the,

79
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:36,350
you can't quarter soldiers in private

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,839
homes because everybody forgets that constantly.

81
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,660
And I, so I just love it because it's just, it's such an, like,

82
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,279
that must have been a problem if that's like the

83
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,100
-- thing they covered
-- it was, uh,

84
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,850
it's one of the things that caused the revolution in the first place was

85
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,169
the, you know, British soldiers needed lodging and just like, oh, well,

86
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:54,419
just lodge with the, with the colonists.

87
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,360
But the fourth, I find, well, I live in a country where, like,

88
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,699
we don't have 1/4 amendment.

89
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,539
I mean, we, we obviously, we have some protections but,

90
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:04,250
uh, you know, it's, it's complicated

91
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,889
and it's interesting to me that the US Constitution spells this out, like, very,

92
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,100
like, it's the fourth amendment.

93
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,089
It's, that's, and there's a specific reason behind that because

94
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:15,270
of what are called, um, writs of assistance

95
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,779
or these, or general warrants and what these are is

96
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,108
there's a lot of smuggling going on back

97
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,209
in the early days of the American revolution.

98
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,309
Um You know, Britain wanted to crack down on the smuggling.

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,440
So they gave these just general warrants to which enabled

100
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,679
inspections of basically anybody's house

101
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:37,660
and for not for even the slightest and oh, we're just gonna go door to door,

102
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,929
looking through people's houses.

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,140
And this sparked a great deal of resentment

104
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:45,970
because there was this long tradition of a man's home is supposed to be his castle.

105
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:46,769
There was

106
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,190
a long tradition in British common law around that notion.

107
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,959
And,

108
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:51,940
you know,

109
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,850
that's one of the things that cheesed off the

110
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,799
founding fathers so much that they wanted it.

111
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,760
They wanted to make sure that

112
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,130
that right was enumerated.

113
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,829
And in fact, a lot of the power,

114
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,320
a lot of the rights and protections in the bill of rights specifically tried to deal

115
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,040
with limiting the power of the federal government

116
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:07,799
when it comes to law enforcement stuff.

117
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,279
Um, you know, the Fifth amendment, things like that.

118
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,720
What is the Fifth Amendment self incrimination?

119
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
-- So, the right
-- to shut up.

120
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,079
Yeah.

121
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,140
Which means that you don't have to turn

122
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,119
over your passwords for your encrypted devices,

123
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,480
but they can touch your finger to your device

124
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,700
to unlock it.

125
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,130
That's not testimonial.

126
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,839
Which again,

127
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,250
I think harkens to your earlier comment about how the laws have

128
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,320
not kept up with technology in a lot of these instances.

129
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:34,079
Well, your, your comment was what the judiciary, right,

130
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,239
where that's the judges interpreting

131
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,470
the laws

132
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,809
and the constitution, I guess for that matter.

133
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,010
Yeah, I think that there is a pretty strong argument to make that the constitution

134
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,350
would and that the founding fathers would and what their

135
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:51,250
intent behind what the fourth amendment entails covers a lot of

136
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,619
what the federal government and what state

137
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,500
governments and what local police units are,

138
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:59,220
what they're doing with technology to sort of do.

139
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,309
I feel like the framers would be super cheesed off about that.

140
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,899
That's the judiciary. The judiciary could interpret the fourth amendment to cover

141
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:09,109
those technology uses like they did in

142
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,510
us V Carpenter,

143
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,000
which, um, was a supreme court case that I forget the name, the technical name of it,

144
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,089
but it's, uh, similar to ge offense warrants where they get data from cell towers,

145
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,130
cell tower dumps.

146
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,779
Um. Right. Right.

147
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,989
And they did that without a warrant and they said no,

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,320
you got to get a warrant for that data.

149
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:27,160
It's funny.

150
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,790
That you mentioned this because I literally just

151
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:31,279
yesterday were talking with our new password manager vendor

152
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,200
and they explicitly have a travel mode which locks you

153
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,600
out of like a whole pile of your password faults

154
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:40,024
until the like you basically call,

155
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:42,785
you literally call home and have the admin re enable it so that you

156
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:44,565
when you're at a border, right?

157
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:46,964
Because one of the challenges as I understand it is

158
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:48,904
most countries have laws that say at the border,

159
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:52,404
we have the right to search through your papers and your

160
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:53,765
goods, which

161
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,799
again, you know, back in the day when they made these laws, obviously,

162
00:06:56,809 --> 00:07:00,839
we didn't have phones, which are like a literal extension of people's brains.

163
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,630
You know, it's like your, your super personal life is in there like everything.

164
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:05,920
And um

165
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,200
so literally, they have a travel mode where you enable that and, you know,

166
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,920
until I get a call from Bob that he's safe in Germany or whatever

167
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,700
he doesn't have, he just,

168
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,899
he cannot have access to that stuff like it's out of his hands.

169
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,679
-- Now,
-- that's a great example of

170
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:20,910
one of the,

171
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:23,179
one of the ways that people can sort of fight back

172
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,589
against the encroachment of the surveillance state and against this like ever

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,299
increasing encroachment into privacy is we can use technology to sort of

174
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,640
grab back some of our privacy and grab back some of our

175
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,920
data autonomy.

176
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:37,570
Um And that's great and that's fantastic,

177
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,489
but

178
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,730
you know, there's a reason why I spend,

179
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,119
why I'm part of the store of the Fourth Minnesota and why I'm,

180
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,000
I get involved with the eff and the AC lu

181
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,589
and all these other political activism works because I think that

182
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,369
the ability of an individual or even some institutions to sort of

183
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,010
claw back some of their privacy from

184
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,720
uh large Silicon Valley corporations are from the federal government.

185
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
That's a losing battle for people on an individual basis.

186
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,309
The only, the only real way,

187
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,079
the only real way that we're going to get back our privacy is if we

188
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,160
convince politicians that

189
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:10,399
we deserve it.

190
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,420
And here's a question I've heard us before but I want to get your take on it.

191
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,519
Why is privacy important?

192
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,350
That's,

193
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,109
yeah, there are all kinds of py

194
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:20,279
responses to that like Snowden says,

195
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,450
you know, people who say you don't need to be private are like, what's that Pli

196
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,200
-- Snowden response? Uh
-- If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.

197
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,789
-- Saying
-- if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear is like

198
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,219
saying that you don't need freedom of speech because you have nothing to say,

199
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,150
everybody has something to hide.

200
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:40,898
Everybody has something to everybody has something to say.

201
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:42,938
And especially when you're dealing with

202
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:45,939
the number of federal laws on the books,

203
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:50,359
it is impossible to exist nowadays without accidentally breaking some kind of law.

204
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,258
Well, it's my understanding the actual,

205
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:55,818
the just the size of the US federal code is not known at this point.

206
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,880
Yep. Um, because I was trying to look something up and it, it basically came up.

207
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,229
It's not even that they don't know all the content of it.

208
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,489
They don't even have

209
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,299
the rough size estimate of it is gone at this point.

210
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:07,950
-- Like it's just gotten out of control.
-- Yeah.

211
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,229
And even if you somehow miraculously managed to avoid breaking,

212
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:16,119
not to avoid breaking all those laws, state and local federal.

213
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,429
It's amazing what kind of terrible story you can tell about an individual.

214
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,109
If you have access to all of their data,

215
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,140
like you can paint a terrible picture about people.

216
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,140
Well, and I mean, that's been, I think

217
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:33,460
something that the media has done for a long time is if they want you,

218
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:37,020
you can make a bad person look good and you can make a good person look bad, right?

219
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,940
I mean, that's been like the whole political smear industrial complex for, well,

220
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,770
hundreds of years.

221
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,020
Really? That's not new.

222
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,390
Yeah. And in fact, it's as old as carton

223
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,450
Richelieu.

224
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,809
OK. I want to reel this back a little bit

225
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,500
and kind of start from the beginning because as, as always,

226
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,669
we've gotten marvelously off topic, I think a little bit.

227
00:09:56,849 --> 00:10:00,210
So we brought you here because you reached out saying, you know,

228
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:02,429
I'm part of this privacy organization and,

229
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,210
and I'd really like to come talk to you guys and you're, in fact,

230
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,390
connecting us with some other groups like the eff which I'm

231
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,309
super excited about as well and that'll be in the future.

232
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,109
So it's no secret that Kurt and I are,

233
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,510
we'll say huge proponents of this whole concept

234
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,260
of like digital privacy and digital rights and,

235
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,080
and all of that.

236
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,469
And so explain to me what the Fourth Amendment Minnesota group is,

237
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:27,210
is kind of what is its purpose and what is it doing?

238
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,729
And then we can kind of work our way into, you know,

239
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:31,809
what can we do as people and how can we help?

240
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:33,869
Yeah, that's a great,

241
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:34,770
yeah, that's good.

242
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,390
So restore the Fourth Minnesota is the Minnesota

243
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,130
chapter of the Restore the Fourth National Organization.

244
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:46,409
-- OK. So this is something that exists all over the United States.
-- Yes. And in fact, if

245
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,750
I think we have 13 chapters

246
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,770
in the United States, and I think there's

247
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:54,059
one in the UK too, although it might be defunct.

248
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,739
But the whole idea of it is that we are,

249
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:59,260
you know, after the Snowden revelations,

250
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,989
there was a whole bunch, there was a subreddit,

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,599
more formed and there were a whole bunch of protests and

252
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,049
the people who started those protests sort

253
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,080
of coalesced into these local chapters that

254
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,429
fight for reform on the local level and then also work together with

255
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,659
as like collectively nationally to advocate for change at the federal level.

256
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,549
And so,

257
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,229
for example, in the, in the Minnesota chapter, for example, we recently,

258
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,500
just earlier this year

259
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,479
passed a facial recognition moratorium in the city of Minneapolis.

260
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,250
Our legislature is actually still in, in special session,

261
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,559
but we were able to convince

262
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,659
the, the governor asked for a whole bunch of money

263
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,479
to fund fusion centers,

264
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,960
which are these sort of,

265
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,840
you mentioned them during the last podcast.

266
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:43,409
Actually,

267
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,130
there's like these places where there's a lot of joined

268
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,260
up surveillance information gets coalesced from federal and local.

269
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,979
They were just going to throw a couple million

270
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,549
bucks at our local fusion center and as an anti

271
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,849
surveillance organization, we're not big fans of fusion centers.

272
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,320
And so we were able to get that

273
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,799
additional funding removed by saying, look, if you're gonna have,

274
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:02,179
if you're gonna give them all this extra money,

275
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,520
you should at least put on some guide rails and

276
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,789
some barriers and some enforce some transparency or something.

277
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,169
And

278
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:11,405
then we all we do things like trying to get better drone policies

279
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:14,734
and we're trying to get a face recognition band in Saint Paul.

280
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:16,534
We're big fans of what's called C Cops,

281
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:20,315
which is like this ordinance or idea pushed by the eclu that would

282
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:24,054
say any time a municipality wants to or like a law enforcement,

283
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:26,994
local law enforcement agency wants to use a piece of surveillance technology.

284
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:31,275
They have to get a affirmative vote from the city council before they can buy it

285
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:34,554
and then have some regular reporting around how often they use it.

286
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,094
You'd be amazed how often

287
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,299
local police departments and sheriff departments

288
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,309
just buy secretive surveillance tech

289
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,179
and then no one knows about it until there's some horror story that gets published.

290
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,340
-- Oh,
-- we just had that happen in Canada with the RC MP.

291
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:51,450
Use of the uh the clear view, you know,

292
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,059
it's that company that scraped all the social media globally.

293
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,880
Yeah, I love Clearview and yeah,

294
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,940
and then they provide facial recognition to name matching.

295
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,369
They're so nakedly evil that it makes doing my job a lot easier.

296
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,859
I can just point at them and say, look how nakedly evil they are.

297
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,979
Well, yeah, our, our,

298
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,869
our chief privacy or the privacy officer had some rather harsh words for them.

299
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,200
It's, it's funny when you say something like they're so nakedly evil,

300
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,239
but one of the arguments you always get out of these groups, there's, oh,

301
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,270
it's safety.

302
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,549
Oh, and think of the Children and oh, we're stopping bad people and whatever.

303
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,299
There's a million. How do you,

304
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,320
how do you comment? Like, how do you bring a coherent argument to that?

305
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,049
Because I often feel like you've got one side just spouting

306
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,200
this string of nonsensical words that are meant to scare people,

307
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:40,549
right?

308
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,609
And you've got the people that are like, oh my goodness, you know,

309
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:45,750
they're the bad people are going to come and blow us up or whatever.

310
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,349
And then there's, there's people like you trying to stand in the middle and I guess,

311
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,349
be coherent.

312
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:53,229
How do you, how do you do that? That's a really hard problem.

313
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:57,630
It is. You are absolutely right. It is very hard. It's just a, oh, that's right.

314
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,330
I don't need, I hopefully don't need to explain what Oan

315
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,190
is, but it's, you do your research ahead of time and you figure out

316
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,789
and you figure out what your messaging strategy ahead of time.

317
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,849
You just need to target your message towards the

318
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:11,520
particular when you know your audience and you know,

319
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,929
the politician, you're lobbying.

320
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,159
If they're, if they're more conservative leaning, you talk about how data,

321
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:20,340
how like, no matter how much you trust your local law enforcement agency,

322
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:23,400
this data is going to get taken by the feds and,

323
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:24,169
you know,

324
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,489
there's no, you know, we don't trust the feds

325
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,960
and you shouldn't trust the feds

326
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,799
and conservatives are more receptive to that argument.

327
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:34,929
And if you're, if you're liberal that you make the argument that a

328
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,900
lot of times it's about the racial

329
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,380
disparities inherent in the use of this technology

330
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,979
and how this technology is often now how

331
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:46,520
surveillance is often targeted towards minority communities.

332
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:48,429
That's, that's usually how you get more.

333
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,469
That's how, that's the argument that we used to sway the Minneapolis City Council,

334
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,320
for example, we were able to point to their,

335
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,780
I'm blanking on what they called it.

336
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:55,559
But like they have this whole,

337
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,159
they have this whole framework for racial justice and all that stuff.

338
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:01,000
And so it's just a matter of knowing your audience.

339
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,210
So OK, so you're targeting politicians primarily.

340
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,010
-- That's,
-- that's the goal

341
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,369
-- I like that.
-- Yeah, because,

342
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,440
and this is something that I would heavily encourage your audience to do as well.

343
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,760
And that's kind of why I was so excited to get the opportunity to talk here because

344
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:19,479
I feel like in the

345
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,460
people who are technologists and who work in it

346
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:24,799
and in particular people who work in

347
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:28,390
uh for for reasons that don't just relate to privacy,

348
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,309
but that relate to all of the ransomware expletive that has been going on in

349
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:36,489
recent history has I feel like it is

350
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,169
vitally important that technologists get more involved with

351
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,330
politics and policy because

352
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:43,809
because

353
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,450
society and

354
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,719
the lines between society and technology are

355
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:50,969
are blurring to the point of nonexistence

356
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,710
and I don't

357
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,700
exist, they're gone.

358
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,450
The idea that we can somehow

359
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,849
as engineers and as technologists who are building

360
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,510
this new reality that we are not going

361
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,549
to engage in the political system that governs that has a say over how it gets

362
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:11,570
like there will be bad laws passed. If we do not get involved in this,

363
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,750
there are bad laws now,

364
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:15,659
there will be worse laws

365
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,049
is

366
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,650
-- perhaps a better way of putting that
-- now that you say this. It's one of the

367
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:21,760
Yes, of course,

368
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,510
but I didn't kind of realize it before and I feel like being a child

369
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,719
of the nineties and then we'll say coming to age in the early two thousands.

370
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,390
I feel like there was this

371
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:38,580
pervasive attitude amongst technologists of we don't need laws. We got this and

372
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:42,500
I guess looking at everything you're describing, I feel like

373
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,549
we are seeing the results of that attitude now.

374
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,469
Yeah,

375
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:47,909
I mean,

376
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,700
we still have it in the Cryptocurrency space where they're like we're going

377
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,719
to build a Cryptocurrency and it's not going to be beholden to laws.

378
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,299
It turns out

379
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:58,289
when you have an asset that is worth money

380
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,500
and you resign a jurisdiction that likes to tax stuff.

381
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,760
Yeah, it, you have to listen to your government

382
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,760
or like the alternative, which is anarchy, which is, you know,

383
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,770
some folks are into that.

384
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,118
But personally, I'm not,

385
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:09,770
we,

386
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,709
we've all read Lord of the Flies, right? Like that's just not gonna work.

387
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,420
One thing that I would highly encourage folks to do is

388
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,079
another great book called Click Here To Kill Everybody by Bruce Schneier

389
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,790
who's actually a resident of Minneapolis as well. Oh, nice. Yeah.

390
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,209
And he has,

391
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:28,079
he also has a great defcon speech about how important

392
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,949
it is for pe for technologists to get it or

393
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,089
public interest technologists.

394
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:35,599
It is hard to understate the power and this is true more broadly,

395
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:39,319
but in particular of people who are engineers and who are technologists,

396
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,130
your experts in this field. If you go and talk to your city council member about

397
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,140
whatever issue that whatever technology related issue that you're concerned

398
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,030
about whether even if it's things like broadband access,

399
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,579
if you go and you can,

400
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,439
anyone can pick up the phone and get a meeting with your local council member,

401
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,420
with your local, with your local legislator with your,

402
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,260
their job is to get re-elected.

403
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,619
They're not just going to ignore you out of hand.

404
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:03,449
That's been my experience anyway.

405
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,849
And especially if you can get a group of people together

406
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,380
and get a group of like just

407
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,689
11 interesting

408
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,199
idea that was floated past me was get a bunch of friends together and

409
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:16,530
say, all right, we're going to do a letter writing party

410
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,609
and we're, we're gonna, we're gonna drink

411
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,770
and we're just gonna get progressively drunker as the night goes on.

412
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,010
But at the end of the night, we have to send this open letter.

413
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,569
I haven't actually tried that, but it does sound like a lot of fun.

414
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,479
Maybe. I mean, uh

415
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:34,089
-- that could go horribly wrong,
-- could actually

416
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:35,780
like,

417
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,890
or even just

418
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,050
um one of the best things that in Minnesota, for example,

419
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,250
we put together this whole coalition in partnership with the Eclu

420
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:47,050
and the Jewish Community Action and Council on

421
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,709
American Islamic Relations and a whole bunch of local

422
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,250
activist orgs who deal with

423
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:56,310
not surveillance or privacy issues, but just like local but other issues.

424
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,739
But who are still concerned about this.

425
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,569
Get together with them and we put together a website

426
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,609
and you know,

427
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:05,140
throwing together a website is fairly easy for folks in our group. And

428
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:07,449
that can be very persuasive

429
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,500
putting

430
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:10,270
visualize, having data,

431
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,119
visualized in a simple way and just bringing it to your representative and saying

432
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:17,099
this is what this is important, you need to pay attention to this.

433
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:20,770
Um And then also plug for the eff there's they have this great

434
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:23,500
network of organization of like

435
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,530
uh called the E FA the Electronic Frontier Alliance.

436
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,650
And if you put together a group of people, I would and you live in the United States,

437
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,810
I'm not actually sure if they do outside the United States, but

438
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,579
like you can, we're part of the electronic Interior Alliance and they have these,

439
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:42,380
it's a great way to get connected with experts and they have trainings and

440
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,319
um they have people, you know, you can, hey, is there any examples of

441
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:50,949
petitions or open letters or draft bills

442
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,760
if you're willing? The biggest, the biggest thing is just try it and get started.

443
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,020
There are resources out there.

444
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,869
And frankly,

445
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,609
you can reach out to me or anyone at the eff and we'll

446
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,709
get back to you and help you out with that because it's,

447
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,229
it's important that this stuff gets, gets done.

448
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,109
-- And,
-- and I would like to include

449
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:06,635
that

450
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:10,275
anyone listening joining the eff is a marvelous use of

451
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:13,114
money and you can get a t-shirt and like,

452
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,515
I'll do anything for a t-shirt.

453
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:15,795
So like I was in

454
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,244
so one question for you is

455
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,984
I'm just thinking how much of, uh sort of, how much of these bad laws would you say

456
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:25,574
are sort of less malicious and more

457
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:29,209
the lawmakers just really not understanding

458
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:33,089
the technology and thus not understanding, you know, the 2nd and 3rd order effects

459
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,050
of the laws that they're looking at passing or not passing.

460
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,050
Like how much of this is an education issue

461
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,390
more than, you know, they're out trying to actually create a surveillance state.

462
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,689
I think that

463
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,010
it is

464
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:51,369
partially a legislation or sorry, and it's partially an education issue,

465
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,449
but a big part of it is that

466
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,890
law enforcement

467
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,280
has a vested interest in

468
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,650
surveillance powers for an understandable reason. It helps them do their job.

469
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,569
Like it's, it's hard to,

470
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,560
you know,

471
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:06,969
if law enforcement could,

472
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:08,589
you know, send every,

473
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,829
just randomly search people's houses and randomly

474
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,270
pull people over and ask questions,

475
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:15,390
you could, you could probably argue that they'd be a lot better at solving crime.

476
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,829
But, you know, there's a reason why we draw that those lines

477
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,630
and,

478
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:23,189
but so they have a significant lobby and they have a significant amount of sway

479
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,109
and it's very hard to get up if you're a politician

480
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,400
and you want to make the changes that you wanna, you know,

481
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,750
your goal isn't just privacy and surveillance stuff.

482
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,319
You wanna,

483
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,900
you have a whole political agenda that you want to advance and you

484
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,540
want to get re-elected and it's hard to get re-elected if you're,

485
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,239
if you can be painted as anti law enforcement.

486
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,280
Um, and so it's not

487
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,260
just an education issue.

488
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,439
It's also, they're being lobbied really hard by law enforcement. And

489
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,979
on the other side of the, on the other side of the aisle,

490
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,800
on the other side of the scales,

491
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,099
you have a small,

492
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,400
like the, the voices of pro privacy and anti mass surveillance,

493
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:03,410
everybody kind of likes those, but it's, there's not a lot of heat behind it.

494
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,010
-- You know, the
-- thing I keep coming back to is for the pro privacy argument and groups,

495
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:11,795
like there's no money to be made there. So, yeah, it's kind of hard to,

496
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:13,755
to sustain it and hard to push it.

497
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,984
Whereas, you know, the, the anti privacy, well,

498
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:19,295
like Facebook being in one extreme example of

499
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,064
what happens when privacy goes out the window

500
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:23,555
and, you know, and they, they make obscene amounts of money,

501
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:27,074
you know, and same thing with the police, right? They want to do their job better.

502
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:28,015
They have funding

503
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:30,199
-- so they can afford to lobby.
-- Indeed.

504
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:32,390
Well, I mean, now the counter to that,

505
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,520
I think if we look at the current Apple advertising,

506
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,569
they, I mean,

507
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:39,819
I think they fell into this accidentally but they're like

508
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:43,119
privacy is their thing now where they're basically the,

509
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,469
you know, we aren't spying on every single thing you do.

510
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:49,900
So I think privacy is becoming a topic.

511
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,900
People are understanding, I think we have a long way to go but I feel like this is the,

512
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,920
the beginning.

513
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,329
I completely agree and

514
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:59,579
the proliferation of services like proton

515
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,329
Mail and um

516
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:03,630
next cloud and there's a whole bunch of

517
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,589
like third party services that cater and, you know, VPN S are

518
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,420
for

519
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,920
issues that I would, you know, you

520
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:13,479
are starting to be big business now.

521
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,310
And

522
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,719
I would argue somewhat in a somewhat shady fashion,

523
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,459
you know, uh putting on my 10 ft

524
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:19,869
hat, that would be very, I would be,

525
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,619
I would be not at all surprised if there were a whole

526
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,849
bunch of VPN companies that were founded by various intelligence agencies.

527
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,270
But we'll, we'll see how that, if that turns out

528
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:28,930
um

529
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,829
privacy is becoming something that people are willing to pay for

530
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,890
and that is a very good thing.

531
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:36,750
But at the same time,

532
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,099
it would be better if it would, it, it was just a default. And

533
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,780
I feel like given the,

534
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:48,780
I feel like given the opportunity costs and the amount of money that can be made

535
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,239
with from information and frankly the amount of

536
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,699
influence and power that comes from information,

537
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:58,479
if we don't start both engineering systems that have privacy as the default,

538
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:02,660
but also lobbying to ensure that also lobbying the government to ensure that those

539
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:05,209
that, that the, that privacy is a requirement.

540
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:06,739
I feel like we're pretty screwed.

541
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:07,369
I,

542
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,829
I agree. Right.

543
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:08,900
Well,

544
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,420
it's back to the topic of the technologists

545
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,449
can't solve this by ignoring the government.

546
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:14,410
So, ok,

547
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:21,800
I want to bring this all home kind of advice from you for anyone kind of interested in,

548
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:27,140
in getting involved in, in any of this. Because I think it is, it's easy to tell people

549
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:31,145
get involved, but that's, that doesn't mean anything, right? If I'm a person,

550
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,275
what can I actually do

551
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:34,334
to start

552
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:37,984
getting involved in this and trying to see real change happen?

553
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:42,665
Step one is decide if you want to start a new initiative

554
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:47,104
or join an existing one. There are pros and cons to both of those and

555
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,439
it's usually easier to partner or join

556
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:56,650
an existing group. And you can go, you can just Google Effe fa

557
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,030
and look for like, look for local organizations

558
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:05,385
in your or just look around for a local AC lu chapter or a local group and

559
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:07,645
volunteer and get involved with them.

560
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:11,744
Yeah, that's, that can be a great way of getting started. But another thing,

561
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:14,954
the o another option is if that either if that doesn't

562
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:17,464
interest you or if that isn't available to you just because

563
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:19,805
where you live there doesn't happen to be any group like that.

564
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:21,925
You can, you can and should

565
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:24,505
make a list of local politicians.

566
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:27,545
Make a list, figure out what your ask is

567
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:32,709
and reach out to them and say, hey, I am a constituent or I'm not a constituent.

568
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:33,530
I'm an expert.

569
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:34,939
This is the policy change.

570
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:35,770
I would like to say,

571
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,109
can we can do you have 2030 minutes where we can sit and chat about it?

572
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,160
Now, now this one I think is really important because

573
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,160
I feel like we are often tempted to send an email.

574
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,520
-- That's not enough.
-- Right.

575
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,589
Well, I can like,

576
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,760
I would never tell people not to send an email about something that like if you,

577
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,329
if you don't have capacity to have meetings, sending an email is useful,

578
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,219
retweeting things is useful.

579
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:03,969
It's useful in the way that a drop in the bucket is useful.

580
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:05,180
A

581
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:08,339
getting a meeting is what is should be,

582
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:11,369
is is what's really impactful getting a meeting with information

583
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:14,609
with draft language that you can share with infographics, you know,

584
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,000
fill the whole nine yards

585
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,410
getting that meeting and forcing that information in front of their faces.

586
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,130
Ok?

587
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,619
We were saying you were, you're talking about talking to local politicians,

588
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:25,209
what what else can we do?

589
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,689
There's talking to local politicians and then

590
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,010
if you can get a group of people together

591
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:33,670
and have a and especially other starting coalitions with

592
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,819
other local organizations doesn't necessarily have to be,

593
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,930
for example, a lot of the groups in our anti surveillance,

594
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:41,500
the safety not surveillance coalition in Minnesota.

595
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,359
A lot of them don't have like privacy and technology or as like their explicit goal

596
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:46,969
and

597
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,689
you, but just having

598
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:52,800
an open letter or a petition is a fantastic way of

599
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:54,709
getting local news or express.

600
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:55,239
For example,

601
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,199
we just signed on to an open letter

602
00:26:57,209 --> 00:27:01,479
yelling at paypal for uh essentially banning someone

603
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,430
from their account because they were funding a tour node.

604
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:08,119
Yeah, a whole bunch of uh civil society organization came together,

605
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,160
signed this open letter

606
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,920
and it got press and

607
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,609
that,

608
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,209
you know, that's an another example of getting open,

609
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,699
getting people to sign open letters and petitions

610
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:21,650
and showing it to a politician saying your constituency cares about this issue.

611
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:22,640
-- One
-- comment there.

612
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,040
So that's,

613
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,040
that's one of the few times I've heard

614
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,689
pri the importance of privacy explained which is

615
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,890
privacy is important because we need to have

616
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,969
speech that is unpopular and subversive and new

617
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,410
so that we can have change in society like letting women vote or, you know,

618
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,260
maybe slavery is not such a great thing and we should ban it.

619
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:40,949
And that's one thing that

620
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,569
I keep seeing with all these organizations pushing for societal changes.

621
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:49,119
You know, if you look at the history of, well, pretty much every country, right?

622
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,420
They've many governments have done their best to stomp out any quote unquote,

623
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,930
subversive activity which, you know, in hindsight,

624
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,979
well, the civil rights movement, you know, kind of was an important thing.

625
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,969
And so I think that's one thing I found

626
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:04,880
that helps people understand why privacy and why,

627
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,569
for example, the ability to meet and talk privately is so important.

628
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,219
Yes. And it, it is the realm of uh what is it?

629
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:16,469
Glenn Greenwald had a great ted talk on this topic about why privacy matters.

630
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:18,510
But it is this realm of privacy.

631
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,500
It is the zone of privacy that allows

632
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,010
these subversive talk that allows subversive planning,

633
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,729
subversive

634
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,680
communication, subversive politics that has to happen,

635
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,140
that has to happen in private

636
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,349
first before it can grow into a real movement. Yeah,

637
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:36,540
you, you've given me so much to think about Chris.

638
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,880
I I have to just personally thank you for that and,

639
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,099
and I have no doubt the audience has, has

640
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:46,219
found this to be an absolute treat. I will give you the floor for kind of the last word.

641
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,170
What do you, what do you want us to all know and remember?

642
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,380
Sure. Well,

643
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:52,660
if you're interested in learning more about us,

644
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,829
are you are you can check out our website.

645
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,369
-- It's at,
-- I will put,

646
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,780
I will put links in the show notes to all of the things you

647
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,550
you talked about or or will say in the next couple of minutes.

648
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,640
So no worries about trying to remember URL S and all that.

649
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,479
Well, actually, our URL is really easy to remember. I made sure to snack a

650
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,329
real simple one. But um

651
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:12,989
one of the things that technologist,

652
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,079
advantage technologists have over like radio activists is that

653
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,069
we know things like get a short domain name.

654
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:18,579
Damn it.

655
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:20,449
Yeah.

656
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:26,160
The last thing I'd say is it's not just privacy and surveillance, that's important.

657
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,550
The reasons to get involved in local politics is not just privacy and surveillance.

658
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,540
First Schneier's book,

659
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,540
click here to kill everything sort of really hit this home for me.

660
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,209
It's that

661
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:37,790
the more agency we give machines,

662
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:39,119
the more,

663
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,630
the more the lines become blurred between technology and society,

664
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,729
the harms that can come from,

665
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:48,569
the harms that can come from. This stuff is no longer

666
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:49,449
just,

667
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,180
you know, data breaches and money lost and eco economy, tanking and

668
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,930
pipeline shutting down.

669
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:03,900
We are fast approaching the world where we will have cars that can be ransom wared

670
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,010
while they're driving down the street where we

671
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,260
have infrastructure that can be exploded and people

672
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,660
and if we don't, it's not just

673
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,140
information,

674
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,560
that's the problem anymore. It's,

675
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:19,260
you know, people are gonna die if we don't get this stuff. Right?

676
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,949
And it's very rare in life that we can point to say, yeah,

677
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,989
pretty soon. If we don't start

678
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,550
really thinking about

679
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,750
these issues, people are gonna die.

680
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,949
So, yeah, that's what I would say is

681
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,439
privacy and anti surveillance stuff. Yes, that's all great.

682
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,689
Let's fight for that too. But don't forget like

683
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,199
the drones are coming for us all.

684
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,020
Oh, my goodness.

685
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,469
