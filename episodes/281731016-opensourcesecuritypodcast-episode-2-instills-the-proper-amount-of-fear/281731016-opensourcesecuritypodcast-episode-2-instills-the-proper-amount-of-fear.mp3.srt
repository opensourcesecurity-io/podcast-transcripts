00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,190
This is the open

1
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,340
source security podcast with myself, Kurt

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,279
Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,380
Hello.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,920
So today we're going to talk about what is open source security because that

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,719
seems to be a topic that comes up far more often than it should.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,979
And Kurt and I have been kind of buried in

7
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,860
the weeds here for longer than either of us can remember

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,780
doing open source security and,

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,610
and handling security flaws and kind of all that fun.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,500
And so why don't we start with you, Kurt,

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,680
why don't you tell us what is open source security?

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,819
What does that kind of mean to the common man, we'll say.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,400
So open source security really applies to sort of three main groups of people.

14
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:41,560
You got your researchers who are looking for security flaws,

15
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:46,189
you've got your developers who are dealing with the source code in some way,

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,099
either they're the actual upstream

17
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,900
or there's somebody consuming it.

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,369
And then you've got your end users, the people actually, you know,

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,169
getting work done with this stuff, right?

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,720
Because that's kind of the whole point of this.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,200
And so for open source,

22
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:04,750
what it means is the researchers and the developers and the end users

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,839
at a minimum have the ability to view the code.

24
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:10,510
And in my opinion, more importantly,

25
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,639
they have the ability to influence and change the code. Now.

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,800
Like most open source projects are run by pretty reasonably sane people.

27
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:21,849
I mean, there's obviously there's some exceptions and we all know who they are.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,889
But by and large, you know,

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,489
your average open source developer is a rational human being who

30
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:31,050
wants to ship good software.

31
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:36,650
And part of the beauty of that is, is about 99% of them will take good code patches,

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:36,819
right?

33
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,730
If you send somebody a code patch that says

34
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:41,169
it makes this improvement or fixes the spelling

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,089
error or it prevents the security flaw.

36
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,209
And there's no, you know, you haven't

37
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,319
significantly impacted performance or something,

38
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,989
they're going to accept that code patch.

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,669
And most importantly, they're gonna ship the new version

40
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:53,540
quickly.

41
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:55,849
And I think that's one of the biggest differences between open

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,480
source and closed source is the majority of open source software.

43
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,760
They ship updates typically on like a weekly basis or, you know, monthly.

44
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:06,599
Like there's very few projects I can think of that

45
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,000
are on like six month or yearly release cycles.

46
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,020
-- I,
-- I think that is terrifying to a certain group of people and we'll,

47
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,399
we'll come back to that because

48
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,679
I think there's some important lessons in there. But

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,710
let's start here. Then

50
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:19,580
let's say I'm a researcher

51
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,869
and I've not really done a lot of work with open source before.

52
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,750
What kind of, where does it start?

53
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:28,779
Let's say I've got a project, um, we could pick on maybe open SSL in this case,

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,490
let's say I find a security flaw in open SSL.

55
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,429
What does, what do I do? Right. What, what's next?

56
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,929
Well, hopefully the open SSL guys and

57
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:41,809
they have, in this case, they have an email address that you can contact them on.

58
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,449
Um The majority of projects typically have an email address.

59
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,410
Sometimes it's security specific

60
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,029
and sometimes it's just more general like bug

61
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:51,360
zut,

62
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,250
whatever domain name

63
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:57,270
and you can report the issue easily. That's another big thing, right?

64
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,309
With a lot of commercial vendors reporting a

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,179
software issue to them is a Byzantine process.

66
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:02,850
It's,

67
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,880
you know, I've dealt with vendors where I,

68
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,080
I couldn't even figure out how to contact them,

69
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:09,279
let alone how to contact them for a security flaw.

70
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:10,839
And with open source,

71
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,240
typically there's gonna be an easily found email address and if there isn't,

72
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,250
you know who the developers are,

73
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,720
right, you can literally either look at the change log or look at the get blame log

74
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,160
and you can see who wrote that code or sort of who the main developer is

75
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:29,000
and nine times out of 10, if you email them

76
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,119
and say, hey, I have a security issue,

77
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,949
they're gonna respond to you pretty quickly.

78
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,479
Yeah, that's fair. And actually I'm gonna use this opportunity to plug

79
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,369
David Wheeler's badges program as part of the CI I initiative.

80
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,869
We'll have to see about maybe getting him on the show someday. But

81
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,039
uh I'll put a, a note, a link in the show notes as to where to find that.

82
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,619
But then actually,

83
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,100
one of one of the things specified in the badgers program is that you have

84
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,809
a way to be contacted about security issues, which is obviously super important.

85
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,360
All right. So

86
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,529
let's say you're the researcher, you do get a hold of the developer,

87
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,979
what can you expect?

88
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,089
So that depends a lot typically on the size and maturity of the project.

89
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,089
I mean, there's a lot of projects out there that are literally just one guy.

90
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,479
Uh and some of them, you know,

91
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,470
these guys are really busy uh with

92
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,289
their personal lives and their professional lives.

93
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,669
So

94
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,890
all the way up to you have major projects with a full

95
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,549
security team with half a dozen people like the Open SSL project,

96
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,019
you know.

97
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,089
So in the case of the open SSL project,

98
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,059
you're gonna get a response from basically somebody

99
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,640
who does this kind of work full time

100
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,899
or used to do it full time not too long ago.

101
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,380
Uh And in the case of a smaller project,

102
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,380
you're basically gonna get a reply from the guy

103
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,519
that wrote it and he's probably gonna ask you,

104
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:43,299
you know, what, what exactly is going on and do you have a code patch. And if not,

105
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:44,589
uh so recently,

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,010
we had this happen with LIB Archive where there's been a couple of uh issues found

107
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,980
and we Red Hat reported the issue to the LIB Archive guy

108
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:57,309
and we worked on developing patches with them and, you know,

109
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,250
he was super happy because not only did we tell him the problem,

110
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,609
but we had the beginnings of a patch,

111
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,820
but as it turned out,

112
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,489
Ashley needed quite a bit of work because we

113
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,540
found some more cases that weren't covered by it.

114
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:09,850
Right? And that again is part of it.

115
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:13,850
You know, the beauty of it is rather than just patch one specific issue

116
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,130
and then do it again the next week when somebody else looks at it, you know,

117
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,970
we actually managed to find about a half dozen cases and fix them all at the same time.

118
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,670
So in the case of LIB archive, you know,

119
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:28,660
he's happy because we're helping him do an update, you know,

120
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,619
it's not just him working on it on his own.

121
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:33,700
And that I think is one of the biggest things is a lot of people.

122
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,920
You don't often see collaboration like that because

123
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,619
the end result of it will be a code commit from one guy,

124
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,089
right?

125
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,929
But the actual code was written by uh several people. Him, some people at Red Hat

126
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,970
and some, you know, whoever else was involved as well.

127
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:54,160
OK. So let's keep moving up then

128
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:59,230
let's say I am a developer using open source code in my project?

129
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:01,880
What kind of expectation should I have on

130
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,049
the projects where I'm getting that code from?

131
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,950
And kind of what do I need to watch out for?

132
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,359
And, and what are some of the advantages that, that I have in this instance?

133
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:12,160
So the majority of these projects

134
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,399
will get a CV number for the security flaw and they'll use that CV number,

135
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,200
for example,

136
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:17,739
uh

137
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,079
in the change log, uh many will now get it into the code commit itself.

138
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,540
So they'll request a CV

139
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,500
in advance of actually doing the code commit.

140
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,179
So that when they do the code commit to update it,

141
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,929
they also include the CV in the change

142
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:29,230
in

143
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:29,420
the

144
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:29,959
commit.

145
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,459
Let's say,

146
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,260
-- I don't know what a CV
-- E

147
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,089
uh sorry,

148
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,160
my apologies.

149
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,079
Uh CV is a common vulnerability and exposures database number and it's just

150
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:43,420
a fancy way of saying we assigned a number to a security flaw

151
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:45,579
so that we can catalog and track it.

152
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:49,920
Uh And the format is CD E hyphen the year.

153
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:54,540
So like 2016 hyphen and then a four digit or larger number.

154
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:59,100
And so the beauty of this basically is if you see a code commit or

155
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:02,839
a change log entry or an email announcement and it has a CV number in.

156
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,450
So you see CV hyphen 2016-1234

157
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,149
then, you know, pretty much

158
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,010
then, you know, pretty much for sure that, that was a security update.

159
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,440
So, what about heartbleed? Does Heartbleed? The CV ID?

160
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,450
Well, so some of these issues get a brand name.

161
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,410
Uh,

162
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,850
to be honest as we've all, as we all know, humans don't really run on numbers,

163
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:25,170
you know, we run on names.

164
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,260
Um, and of course a number isn't very sexy, you know, but a,

165
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,760
but a name like heartbleed or HTD

166
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,130
-- Epoxy
-- or

167
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,130
deals the proper amount of fear. Right?

168
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,239
Well, not always because Poodle,

169
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,350
you know, some of the names are not quite as fear inducing.

170
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:44,010
-- You
-- don't
-- like dogs then. That's terrifying. Right.

171
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,720
Yeah. Yeah. I'm not a big fan of Poodles myself

172
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:48,859
a

173
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:49,410
lot.

174
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,950
Uh Let's assume at this point, people understand what a CV is and I'm a developer and

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,359
I'm using open

176
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:57,320
source code

177
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,000
and I know

178
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,730
I need to start looking for CV E I DS.

179
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,429
What do you, what's the best way to do that as,

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,279
as a developer that maybe isn't involved in the project itself?

181
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:13,299
So the simplest thing is to watch their announce

182
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,709
uh mechanism, whatever that is typically,

183
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,670
uh a lot of these projects will announce new releases via email.

184
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,359
Um or, you know, they'll basically draw up a new release with a change log.

185
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:25,410
And personally,

186
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,720
I've been encouraging all of these upstream upstream that I deal with

187
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:29,839
to

188
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:34,859
at a minimum, have a change log, right? So that when you release version 1.2 0.3

189
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,260
there's a change log and the change log has entries.

190
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,840
Like, you know, we fix this spelling error,

191
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,409
we fix this CV security bug and we fix this thing.

192
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,309
Uh So at a minimum, there is hopefully a change log and, you know,

193
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,289
so you should be watching your upstream for new releases because you're

194
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,119
gonna need bug fixes anyways whether or not they're security related.

195
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,479
Ideally,

196
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:56,049
they also have an email announcement because you get push notifications that way.

197
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,719
Right. Email is the only push notification system we have that works.

198
00:08:58,729 --> 00:08:59,520
Unfortunately.

199
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,469
Um Some projects even, you know, they'll have a security web page

200
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,909
uh listing all the CV S currently available

201
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,150
and fixed.

202
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:13,020
Um And that's typically for the larger projects, you know, like,

203
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,320
say open stack elastic search that those kind of guys.

204
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,320
Um

205
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:16,950
Probably

206
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:21,340
saying too that some of those projects have not just a list of the CV E I DS,

207
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,239
but they'll have individual patches.

208
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,150
So you could just cherry pick that one security fix

209
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,960
if that's what you're looking for in your project.

210
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,489
Exactly.

211
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,770
Uh But I would say in general, you know,

212
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,750
if you're consuming open source code and you need to pay attention to it,

213
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,609
probably your best bet is to look for an announcement

214
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,669
mail list because almost all of them have this now.

215
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,210
-- And uh you know, just, well, I guess, read your email once in a while.
-- Sure. Sure.

216
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:45,549
Yeah,

217
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:46,510
and that's fair.

218
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,570
So, all right,

219
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,099
I'm my developer

220
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:54,549
I found a CV E ID announced on a mailing list that I care about.

221
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,140
What would you suggest I do next.

222
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,179
-- So
-- it depends sort of on how you consume the source code.

223
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,659
Uh Some places are into agile development so they can just, you know,

224
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,809
grab a new version and insert it

225
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,090
and run their testing suite,

226
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,419
you know, know that it works

227
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,349
and ship an update of their product.

228
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,140
Other places, you know,

229
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,450
they may have to extract the security patch and just import that code,

230
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,010
you know, because they might be

231
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:22,909
a good example being car manufacturers, right?

232
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,549
Like there was that recent posting by um, by Mudge showing, you know,

233
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,510
all the open source libraries that Mercedes ships and it's,

234
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,109
it's, I think about 100/100.

235
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,200
Uh and the reality is, you know,

236
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,750
car makers ship software that is relatively static and boring,

237
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,349
you know, they're not running agile development yet.

238
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,940
Uh So a company like that would most likely just extract the security related patch

239
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,340
and import that code into their, you know, system and then up and,

240
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:53,950
you know, and build a new version

241
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,229
-- or
-- I suppose the,

242
00:10:55,239 --> 00:11:00,190
the sad reality for many projects is they just never update the code ever.

243
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,340
Well, you know, unless

244
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,719
they're being actively attacked or their customers are being actively attacked.

245
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:08,010
Yeah, they're sadly probably not going to, um,

246
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,219
security is typically seen as a cost center by these companies

247
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:15,969
and they're certainly not going to do a lot of proactive work, uh,

248
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,460
unless they get caught out.

249
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,169
I mean, if you look at the state of most

250
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,809
commercial software, uh,

251
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,700
you know, you look for security updates,

252
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,210
there's very few vendors doing regular security updates

253
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,169
of the big ones.

254
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:29,969
Yes.

255
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,010
I, we've been saying for years that it's going to change

256
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,369
and, and someday

257
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:35,700
we might be. Right.

258
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:36,489
So,

259
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,210
we'll wait and see. Right.

260
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:42,080
I think part of the problem is, is uh even if we are right,

261
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,719
we have so much technical debt to deal with.

262
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,690
I would just keep getting that down the road. It, it's fine

263
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,530
next year,

264
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,570
next year, we'll fix it next year. Right.

265
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:51,710
That's,

266
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:56,440
I think, I think most of us have some interest built up on that,

267
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,049
that we don't even know what's going on.

268
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,359
But that, that's a story for another day, I think. All right.

269
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,010
So

270
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,539
I think this mostly makes sense if you're a developer,

271
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,359
but let's say you're an end user,

272
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:09,820
you're a guy running a piece of open source software.

273
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,960
You will probably download it off the internet.

274
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:16,210
What does that mean for me? Should I care about security in any way?

275
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:19,849
I mean, I hate to say it but it depends, um

276
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:20,950
I have

277
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:21,359
the

278
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,530
-- answer from security, right? It depends, maybe.
-- Well, you know, and it does really?

279
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:28,630
Because I, for example, I have uh

280
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:28,929
I

281
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:29,989
have a perfect example.

282
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,530
I have one of those little Hutu wireless media sharing devices.

283
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,299
Uh

284
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,789
As far as I know, the vendor doesn't ship

285
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,950
updates,

286
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,989
-- let alone security updates. You own one of these two, don't you? I do,
-- actually,

287
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:45,750
they do have updates. You can, they're hard to find

288
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,549
you, you have to locate them and you can install them. And in fact,

289
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:50,869
I was

290
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:56,270
somewhat annoyed at one point because the Hutu, let me tell Net into it,

291
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,190
which is totally a secure protocol, right?

292
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,900
But I could tell that in

293
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:04,320
and then I updated the firmware and then I couldn't tell it in anymore, which I,

294
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:08,320
I suspect is for the best because the only way I can

295
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,820
see that coming to a logical conclusion is me breaking the Hutu.

296
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,630
It was still one of those things that I was very

297
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,820
excited to be able to tell that into what is essentially,

298
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,780
you know, a little box.

299
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:23,039
But uh no, no, in that case. So let, let's go even farther away.

300
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,289
Let's say you have someone running

301
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,020
Mozilla

302
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,729
Firefox, which is an open source web browser

303
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,469
should do. They need to care about security.

304
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,229
Well, if they're browsing the web, then yes.

305
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,780
Uh the reality is especially on the modern web,

306
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:42,229
there's so many drive by attacks embedded in ad networks and on websites

307
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,679
that I hate to say it.

308
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,650
But if you're running an out of date web browser, you're, you're gonna get nailed.

309
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,929
Now, I think it's also worth pointing out though.

310
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,429
I mean, this, this is kind of a trick question

311
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:51,359
is that

312
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,080
in the case of Firefox,

313
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,559
they have automatic updates turned on

314
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,239
and you get them magically,

315
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,539
which I think is totally the right thing to do in that case because you're right.

316
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,239
If you're using an out of date web browser, you're just,

317
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,349
you're running around with scissors, right?

318
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:08,530
Don't do that. That's a bad idea. But I think we can look at,

319
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:12,989
uh let, let's pick on some, what's another pop, uh, maybe like Libra Office,

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,309
which seems relatively popular and I know they have an update mechanism to a degree.

321
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,799
But let's assume they,

322
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,950
you have to manually do that one. I don't,

323
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:25,479
it notifies you and then you have to update it

324
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,250
so

325
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:27,710
well.

326
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,289
And one challenge and something a lot of us conveniently ignore,

327
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:32,809
even with automated updates, like Mozilla

328
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,650
Firefox,

329
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,070
there's still people with bad internet.

330
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,070
You know, there's still people on dial up,

331
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,270
there's still people on satellite internet.

332
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:45,080
And the sad reality is modern software has gotten so big.

333
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:48,299
The majority of them, even if they want to be secure,

334
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,659
it's very difficult for them because, you know,

335
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:52,270
they have to download a half gig update.

336
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,200
Could you,

337
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:56,789
could you browse the internet today on dial up?

338
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,179
I mean,

339
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,440
ignoring the fact that there are probably people who are,

340
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,510
I want to try this. Can, I don't even know if I have a modem or a way to,

341
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:06,479
but

342
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:06,719
I

343
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,229
want to

344
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,340
have your Linux

345
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,789
box filter it but a

346
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,700
lot of the web pages,

347
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:15,260
the front page of cnn.com and youtube are all, a lot of these sites.

348
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,760
Now, the front page is a megabyte

349
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:20,869
-- which on dial up will take 10 minutes to download.
-- Right. Right. Oh, my goodness.

350
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,210
That's, that's terrifying. Well, I guess it's not right.

351
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,380
This would be like people riding their horse on the interstate.

352
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,900
It's just don't do that.

353
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:31,969
I mean, apart from being II, I assume it's illegal, I've actually never

354
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:32,659
looked into that

355
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,460
as it should be.

356
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,510
But I guess dial up can be kind of seen in that, that light where it's,

357
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:44,239
it's not only incredibly painful. It, it's dangerous because you're right.

358
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,219
You're never gonna get updates if you're on dial up because,

359
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,419
man, I bet, I mean,

360
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:52,239
installing updates to my operating system with a broadband connection takes

361
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,219
long enough and I'm impatient and it annoys me every time.

362
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:59,799
Oh, my goodness. This is terrifying to even think about my, my brain hurts.

363
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,000
-- Sad
-- reality.

364
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,590
I mean, it's,

365
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,929
and I think this is a reason there's still a lot

366
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,520
of insecure systems out there is for lack of bandwidth or

367
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:07,650
a

368
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,400
lot of, a lot of the systems don't have uh an administrator, you know,

369
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:12,760
they just have a guy using it

370
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,750
and he doesn't want to pay, you know, 100 bucks a month for a service contract.

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,739
Um,

372
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,309
you know, at least with open source, the,

373
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,359
the barrier to entry of having to pay for the updates is quite often removed, right?

374
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:30,539
You can just get it for free or if you want, you can choose to outsource it to somebody

375
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:34,789
-- who will handle a lot of it for you. You know,
-- this would be Linux distribution.

376
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,219
Do you talk about or something else?

377
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:40,020
Well, I mean, the, the common case would be a Linux distribution, you know,

378
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,380
and some of them are free, some of them charge uh for support

379
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,500
and ongoing maintenance.

380
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:46,580
Um

381
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,190
And then there's also, you know, professional consulting firms, many of which do

382
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,809
open source work, you know,

383
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,210
for the simple reason that there's a lot of people using this stuff.

384
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,070
Uh You know, a great example being web hosting, right,

385
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,099
how many people use wordpress and don't even know that you need to update wordpress,

386
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:03,280
wordpress.

387
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,949
I'm supposed to be updating my wordpress install,

388
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,858
although doesn't Wordpress have an automatic update mechanism

389
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:10,279
have made it

390
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:11,328
automated

391
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:15,048
um for wordpress but not for the plugins

392
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,628
and some plugins will update automatically.

393
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:18,038
And

394
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:21,948
there was just an incident wasn't there with, with wordpress plugins.

395
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,159
It was, I think it was one of the major leaks that happened recently.

396
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,368
It was, they were running

397
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:28,409
a very outdated plug in,

398
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,159
in their, in their wordpress install

399
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:31,269
the

400
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:32,379
Fonseca,

401
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:34,479
the

402
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:35,509
Panamanian law firm.

403
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:36,869
Right. Right. Those guys,

404
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,109
yeah, that's fair. That's

405
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:39,439
interesting.

406
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,689
So I, I guess

407
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,310
what, what I'm seeing us head towards here is

408
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:48,890
from the end user perspective, automatic updates are key.

409
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,270
So if, if you run a project and you're listening to us,

410
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,689
you should have automatic updates.

411
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,530
And if you don't,

412
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,369
you should figure out how to do that because

413
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,130
unquestionably it's important.

414
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,540
And here we approach the sort of the emacs singularity

415
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,359
where if you look at all the major programming languages, for example,

416
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,540
like Java Pearl,

417
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:09,180
whatever,

418
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,880
they've all ended up having to build and engineer

419
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,819
their own update mechanisms because they're running on platforms

420
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,599
that may not have an update mechanism, you know.

421
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,030
Uh I'm biased. Of course, I run Linux

422
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,839
Red hat and Fedora especially.

423
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,430
And at the OS level, there is an update mechanism,

424
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,060
not only for the Os but for all the stuff they ship,

425
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,459
you know, and you just run yum update and hit, enter,

426
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:32,770
you know,

427
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,119
and everything gets updated, right?

428
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,359
Like for example, in the windows world, if I install Pearl on Windows,

429
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,869
uh I'm not really clear on how you get updates, but I know it's not automated,

430
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,109
you know, I know Microsoft doesn't ship Pearl updates.

431
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:45,369
Sure. Well, I mean,

432
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,310
but you can't say

433
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:48,229
that

434
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:49,630
in the Linux Universe,

435
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,349
the distributions have this figured out because let's face it.

436
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,829
If you're doing anything interesting,

437
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,270
you are almost certainly using libraries and applications

438
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,869
outside of your walled garden of the distribution.

439
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,609
And so once you exit that universe

440
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,089
updates become a huge problem.

441
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,180
And I think basically where a lot of

442
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:13,020
that's headed is people using continuous integration systems,

443
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,069
you know, the whole agile C I

444
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:16,979
landscape of,

445
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:20,430
you know, we do an update daily or weekly

446
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:25,630
so you import the code, run your C I run your tests and ship an update.

447
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,319
And I think for a lot of people that can do that, that's how they do it.

448
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,979
And then for the people simply consuming this stuff, I hate to say it. But,

449
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,569
you know, if they had the expertise to do this properly,

450
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:40,510
they would uh but quite often they don't have the expertise to do this properly,

451
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:40,900
right?

452
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,119
And

453
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
there, you know,

454
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,439
I think the reality is you need to look at some form of outsourcing it, you know,

455
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:52,540
either using a web host that like, like for example, rather than buying a VPs,

456
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,170
a virtual private server and running your own web server,

457
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,349
you know, you go to say wordpress.com and just

458
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,489
pay whatever monthly fee it is to use wordpress and they

459
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,219
handle the whole experience and update everything,

460
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:06,219
you know, in

461
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,329
a situation where you can't do that,

462
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:09,729
then I mean,

463
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,410
you have to develop some in-house expertise

464
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,739
and the good news there is, it's actually it's quite easy to do.

465
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,969
You know, there's a lot of people

466
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,699
who have used open source

467
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:23,469
uh both as developers and administrators,

468
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,160
you know, quite commonly, a lot of comp sci

469
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,810
grads have had

470
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,290
some exposure to this.

471
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,959
And so the reality is finding it a men who can handle this is, is not super difficult.

472
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,449
OK.

473
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:38,989
So they might have experience using open source,

474
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,869
but do you think they actually understand

475
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,349
this problem of keeping things updated and watching for security issues?

476
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,709
And I mean, let's even face it man,

477
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,550
in a lot of projects,

478
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,900
they're full of open source code and people don't even know what's all in there.

479
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:59,439
Right. True. Um The reality is you don't really have to understand this in depth.

480
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,219
You know, I still run some wordpress blogs

481
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,719
and all I do is I,

482
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,790
I hit the update button and then I go and select

483
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,199
the thing that selects all the plugins and hit update all.

484
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,160
You know, that's the extent of essentially my expertise with wordpress nowadays.

485
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,290
I, you know, if one of those plugins breaks, I'm gonna,

486
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,750
I'm just gonna roll back the version or I'm gonna, you know,

487
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,569
check the upstream to see if they're aware that it

488
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,839
broke and make sure they're gonna ship an update soon.

489
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:25,239
And, you know, because I honestly, I don't wanna be a Wordpress expert.

490
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,739
I just wanna have my blog run.

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,609
Right. Right.

492
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,310
You know, that's,

493
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,030
I, I suspect that's,

494
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,430
that's what most people want.

495
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:37,229
Nobody is in business to be an open source library expert.

496
00:21:37,449 --> 00:21:43,099
They have a product or a goal in mind and open source is one of the many tools

497
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:44,670
that's going to help them get there.

498
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:46,030
And, and I think

499
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,030
that's one of the things especially like you and I forget

500
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,390
of we live in our bizarre security universe and we just

501
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,979
expect everyone else should be security experts because why not?

502
00:21:56,989 --> 00:22:00,359
Right. Everyone I know is a security expert. I don't see why you're not.

503
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:00,910
Yeah.

504
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:01,530
No.

505
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,709
And the good news there is a lot of the more modern programming languages like, uh,

506
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,520
Rails, you know, N PM,

507
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,369
they actually have security efforts.

508
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,449
Um, so I know for Rails and N PM they both have a module you can import into your project

509
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,050
that will then look at all the modules you're using and consuming

510
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,800
and warn you when they're out of date for security issues.

511
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,040
And we will tell you which ones you wanna update to.

512
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,510
That is fantastic.

513
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:24,959
We should,

514
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,079
we'll put a link to that in the show notes because that is an awesome feature

515
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,959
that in all seriousness, every project should have.

516
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:35,119
So if you're a project owner and you don't have something like that, uh shame on you

517
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:35,880
work on it.

518
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,069
So

519
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,829
uh I, I think the last thing I wanna bring up is

520
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:43,020
there is an article I sent you from CSO online,

521
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,150
which is kind of talking about open source projects and,

522
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,229
and how people are using them.

523
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:47,469
And,

524
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,329
and here's the thing that I guess is my, my soapbox commentary for the day is

525
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:54,790
you read this article and it sounds like

526
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,880
open source is a choice

527
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,199
where you can

528
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,689
use it if you want. And the thing I, that just blows my mind still is.

529
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,310
There's all these people who,

530
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,089
who talk like this, when

531
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,920
in reality you're already using it.

532
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,489
You either know you are.

533
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,599
And so you, you have your kind of, you know, you're known, unknown so to speak

534
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,640
or you don't know

535
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,819
and you should,

536
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,319
so you really need to look around and figure that out and,

537
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,689
and that's the thing that just,

538
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,079
I don't know, it,

539
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:27,489
maybe it's just the universe we exist in where this is so blatantly obvious.

540
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:27,800
But,

541
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,800
but I sometimes feel like, you know, we're, we're, I,

542
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:33,219
I forget the movies but you know where it, it's,

543
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:38,109
everyone seems insane and there's only that one person who isn't crazy in the movie

544
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:40,329
and that's kind of what I feel like sometimes around this,

545
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:42,599
it's like this isn't a conversation anymore.

546
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:47,750
-- You are using open source if you don't know that. Well, that's shame on you.
-- Right.

547
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,670
I think part of this is because of

548
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,319
open

549
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:53,859
source, not only one, but it's matured to the point where it's like elevators,

550
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:56,420
it, it's just there and it works

551
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,109
and you,

552
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,709
you don't even think about

553
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,170
stuff like elevators or revolving doors or

554
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,369
you know, your car, it just, you get in your car, you turn the key

555
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:06,949
and

556
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,829
it starts and you go

557
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:11,890
and that's fair and, and that's kind of what you could call it,

558
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,589
infrastructure or commodity or, I mean, there's various terms for that.

559
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:15,790
But,

560
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:18,369
but yeah, I, I turn on my faucet water comes out.

561
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:21,800
That's just the way it is. In fact, actually I had my water shut off.

562
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,239
They were doing construction outside my house about three weeks ago. Give or take.

563
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,209
And

564
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,209
it is

565
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,599
unsettling to turn the faucet on and nothing comes out

566
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,839
and I kept forgetting this was the case and,

567
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:36,170
you know, I, I, I'm at home and I just kept going to it and turning it on

568
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,630
and at, at first it was the, the, oh, crap, I forgot it's off.

569
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,260
And then after a while I'm like, come on, when's this coming back? Like, let's go.

570
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,160
And I kept turning it on and I guess in hindsight I should have just turned

571
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,849
it on and left it on and I would have heard the noise but for some reason

572
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,729
I felt better getting up periodically turning it on

573
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,359
and having no water come out and then

574
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:54,890
being disappointed and then grumbling to myself and,

575
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,979
and going back to work.

576
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:58,089
Well, you know, it's, I mean, during a power outage,

577
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,040
how often have you been wandering around the house?

578
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,329
And you, you walk into a room and hit a light switch

579
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:05,290
because that's what you do when you walk into a dark room.

580
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:07,569
That's true. You don't think about it. You just,

581
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,010
it's unsettling. I, I hate power outages. They bother me.

582
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,229
Well,

583
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:14,640
actually the worst though is an internet outage because

584
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,699
I think all I do is keep running ping

585
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,329
against hosts that that are public waiting for the internet to come back

586
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:21,410
and

587
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:22,369
it's,

588
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,199
it's a total waste of my time. But,

589
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,319
yeah, you gotta love it.

590
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,609
Well, I mean, and that's, you know,

591
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:32,849
that's part of the beauty of this is 99% of the stuff works so well that

592
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,030
people don't even know they're using it.

593
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,319
Uh, you know. Ok. So that's,

594
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,479
I, I think the logical conclusion, we, we're gonna take ourselves to,

595
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,000
if we start down this path and you're right

596
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,560
in, in, in the context of open source, it works well enough until it doesn't.

597
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:50,760
But the problem, I think from the security aspect is

598
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,140
when you're using unknown open source, when it fails,

599
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,839
it is probably going to fail spectacularly.

600
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:00,849
I think heartbleed is a great example of this where there were probably

601
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,560
people who didn't even know they had open SSL in their projects.

602
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,540
And then one day someone was like, hey,

603
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:10,339
this heartbleed scan is failing on your device or your, you know,

604
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,260
application or whatever it happened to be.

605
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:15,810
And I bet they were like, well, what the heck, where did that thing come from? Right.

606
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,449
Well, and I think a lot of this, I mean,

607
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,520
if you look at the software industry in general,

608
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,030
especially the commercial side of it,

609
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,829
the majority of software projects fail

610
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:27,819
miserably, you know, they don't deliver on budget or on time. Right?

611
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,310
And so I think part of the challenge is the software industry as a whole is still

612
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:35,050
not mature.

613
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,380
I mean, compared to like, you know,

614
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,930
engineering bridges where there's seven kinds of bridges.

615
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:40,329
End of story, you

616
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,670
pick which one you want to build and then you pick the materials and then you're done,

617
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:44,609
you know,

618
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,459
um, with software, you know, we,

619
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,300
I've been in this thing for 20 years now and had, like,

620
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,680
basically everything I learned up until e everything I knew

621
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:57,060
that's less than five years old is so laughably obsolete.

622
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:59,209
-- You know.
-- That's

623
00:26:59,489 --> 00:26:59,520
true.

624
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,839
Now, I'm gonna come back against you though here and,

625
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:05,709
and I agree with you that bridges are a fine example of engineering done.

626
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:08,579
Right. Where in general, bridges don't fall down. Ok.

627
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,109
But we've also

628
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:09,800
been building

629
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:10,030
for

630
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:12,900
-- 5000 years.
-- Right. Right. Well, that's my point. Right.

631
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,459
I can build,

632
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,380
or rather

633
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,329
I can't build a bridge in my garage,

634
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:21,300
can build software in my garage.

635
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:24,260
And so I think that's one of the great challenges here is

636
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,250
when you have an industry

637
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,219
that is

638
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:29,680
very difficult to enter into,

639
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:33,000
such as building buildings or bridges or something like that.

640
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,130
The bar is already really high, but it's like my, I could teach my kid.

641
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,079
In fact, he's learning to write software because he thinks it's neat

642
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,069
and

643
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,800
he's, he's 10.

644
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,839
I mean, there's no licensing there.

645
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:47,800
There's, he's gonna screw it up and it's gonna be a mess and whatever.

646
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,839
I mean, it's part of learning. Right.

647
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:51,189
It's not unlike building a popsicle stick bridge.

648
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,260
But now

649
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,469
this would be like, I built a popsicle stick bridge and someone says, oh,

650
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:56,109
that's neat.

651
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,890
And they took it and they went and put it, you know, in production somewhere and,

652
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,010
and it's like, wait, no, that, that's made of popsicle sticks don't use that.

653
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,810
And that's kind of what I see a lot of this software as where,

654
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:10,089
where you have people that might start a hobby or a fun thing and all of a sudden,

655
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:11,994
you know, it's running someone's infrastructure.

656
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:13,755
It's like, whoa, what just happened there?

657
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:16,435
Well, and that, you know, that goes back to the, the,

658
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:20,755
the projects consuming this stuff should be aware of what they're consuming.

659
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,064
You know, that to me is just common sense. I mean,

660
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:27,474
if you're gonna download random code off the internet and not only run it but,

661
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:29,704
you know, build things that it runs,

662
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,170
you should probably know what you're like.

663
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,989
You should at a minimum have a manifest and again, going back to open source, that's,

664
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,150
that's something that's actually relatively easy to do in the open source world.

665
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,729
You know, I look at, um,

666
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:43,689
I've dealt with companies that have bought commercial components.

667
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,709
We have no idea what's in those things. Why is this thing? 300 megabytes?

668
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,589
It converts HTML to PDF.

669
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,560
Why

670
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:51,410
it's

671
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:51,619
fine,

672
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:53,000
you know,

673
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,800
-- that, yeah, try not to think too much about it because it just hurts.
-- Right.

674
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,969
Pay no attention to the man. Behind the curtain, everything is fine.

675
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:04,410
So I think basically a lot of it boils down to is is maturity and you know,

676
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,709
the ability to take risk like if you're building space shuttle software,

677
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:11,550
uh my understanding is every line of code is fully documented.

678
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,239
They have

679
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,239
not only who put it there but why it was put there,

680
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:19,069
right? The majority of source code that's written in the world is like,

681
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,540
uh you're writing, you know, you're writing a,

682
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,560
a cash register application for dry cleaners.

683
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:26,400
You know, you're not gonna have

684
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:30,089
that level of software maturity because you don't need it.

685
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,339
You know, if it breaks, you just go out and fix it and they,

686
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:36,300
you know, they use paper for a couple hours while the cash register is down.

687
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,650
Well, except

688
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:40,170
we have things like cars

689
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,000
now running random open

690
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,810
source software.

691
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:47,319
So we're gonna hit the point where if there are bugs, people are going to die,

692
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,420
which is

693
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:53,050
a terrifying problem that we will speak of another day. I think it is,

694
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,520
let's end it there. All right,

695
00:29:55,689 --> 00:30:00,680
let's say, let's say this. Let's say I'm, I'm a project. I'm a developer.

696
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,319
I've got some open source.

697
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:06,439
What do you think Kurt is the single most important thing I could do today

698
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
to make my life a better place.

699
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,329
Make

700
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:10,660
sure you know which open

701
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:11,359
source

702
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:15,500
projects you're using and subscribe to their announced list

703
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,819
or at least figure out where they do releases and you know, look at them once a month,

704
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,160
their web page

705
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,339
and that is great advice, Kurt.

706
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:25,780
And if we all did that the world would be a better place.

707
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,540
All right, folks.

708
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,689
So I'd like to thank you for listening to, to the podcast,

709
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:30,890
the open source security podcast.

710
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
And until next time,

711
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,219
take care.
