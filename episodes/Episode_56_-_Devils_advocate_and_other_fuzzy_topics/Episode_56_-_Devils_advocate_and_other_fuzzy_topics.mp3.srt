Hello and welcome to episode 56 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,500
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,260
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,340
What's New Kurt

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,630
forest fires?

5
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:16,850
-- That's
-- right.

6
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:18,510
No, I heard about that.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,829
-- Canada is like being ravaged by forest fires right now, which
-- is great.

8
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:26,309
Yeah. Yeah, we have an air advisory for tomorrow on a scale of 1 to 10.

9
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,260
-- It's going to be a 10.
-- What does an air advisory mean?

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,380
Uh So I remember the last time it was a 10, it meant, um, from my apartment building,

11
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,090
I could see two blocks.

12
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:38,040
That's crazy.

13
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:40,700
And that, and that was smoke drifting into the city from,

14
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,169
I think it was about three or 400 kilometers away.

15
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:44,229
That's

16
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:45,919
so the other.

17
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:46,520
So, and,

18
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:50,590
and here's the really ugly part is this year's Canada's 150th birthday and so parks,

19
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:55,040
Canada, you know, made access to all the parks free, which is, you know,

20
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:56,560
a lot of people have been looking forward to this.

21
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,560
Um But now they've had to either close a lot of parks or restrict access because,

22
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:01,159
uh

23
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:06,279
well, because either they have fires, uh they're expecting fires or option. C,

24
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,900
there's a lot of animals fleeing the fires

25
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:12,480
-- and find some
-- bears. I even thought of the animals. But that's

26
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:12,730
true.

27
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,940
No, they don't like fire

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,089
and they get

29
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:15,879
that.

30
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:17,169
Yeah.

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,150
So, you know, and like, so these, the, yeah, you don't want people interacting with,

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,959
like brown and black bears because people will get mauled because they're stupid.

33
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,410
And there's,

34
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,750
there's been a thing in the news recently about people like going, you know,

35
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,989
like 5 m away from bears to take pictures.

36
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:36,944
Don't do that. I'm, I'm not a bear expert, a bear ologist perhaps.

37
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:41,165
But, uh, yeah, going near bears is a bad idea. Bears

38
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:47,425
and search for bear chasing cyclist and there are some amazing GoPro videos.

39
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,510
Um, I mean, bears, here's the thing.

40
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,750
Folks, bears are fast and they actually have quite a bit of stamina.

41
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,639
Like they can chase you for a good 23 kilometers.

42
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:01,230
I'm comfortable saying a bear would almost certainly catch me on bike or,

43
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,269
or running.

44
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,919
Well, I'm not a fast runner. So catch

45
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:05,190
you running

46
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:08,669
-- and they can climb. So climbing a tree won't work. It's true.
-- They can climb.

47
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,899
They, they're like the, the ultimate

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,320
-- risk tool, right?
-- They're like

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,779
300 pound plus murder machine.

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,139
Right.

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,639
Anyway, anyway, well, well,

52
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,860
whatever happens, stay safe

53
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,710
-- and good luck.
-- Just stay indoors. Basically.

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,410
My default setting.

55
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,889
It's true. The sun is outside, stay away from the sun.

56
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:36,960
That speaking of the sun. That reminds me as well. Black hat

57
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,119
hacker summer camp is next week.

58
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,919
So we'll, we'll see. Hopefully we get an episode out. I will be there.

59
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:47,380
And, uh, sadly, Kurt will not make it this year next year. Hopefully.

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,690
But if, if anyone is there and you want to grab a beer or say hi or whatever, uh,

61
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:54,220
send me a message, you know, you can direct,

62
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:57,529
message me on Twitter or whatnot and yeah, I'd love to talk and

63
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,399
it'll be fun. I look forward to it.

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,660
Yeah.

65
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,389
Are you going to Defcon at

66
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:06,229
-- all
-- or I cannot make Defcon or B sides? Which makes me a little sad.

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,339
I'm basically flying in doing a bit of black hat stuff and then flying right back out

68
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:16,380
because I have many personal things on both sides of it that I cannot get out of.

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,520
So that's fine.

70
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,940
It happens this year, next year, next year, I'll be there for the whole week.

71
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:24,330
Yeah. Well, I guess so. What's the big news this week?

72
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:24,880
On the

73
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:25,550
security front?

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,979
No, I know the thing we wrote down that we talked about was fuzzing

75
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,389
and there have been a couple of stories about it that have been really interesting,

76
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:32,740
I think.

77
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,169
Yeah.

78
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:37,610
So, well, do you want to tell everybody what fuzzing is, in case they're not clear?

79
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:40,139
-- That's true. I suppose it's conceivable. Some people
-- don't know.

80
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,699
And it has grown a lot in the

81
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:46,960
-- last few years. It has
-- changed. I remember when was it like 09 maybe or 2010?

82
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,050
I think, I think

83
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,520
it was declared the year of the fuzz

84
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:55,369
because it was like brand new. I mean, I remember when fuzzing just started and ok, so

85
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,259
what it is, right? What it is? So for those of you who don't know

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,699
any time you have an application,

87
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:05,660
well, I shouldn't say any application but you, you, you process input essentially.

88
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,059
So imagine you're a video player, you take in the video file, you do stuff to it and,

89
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,100
and you make it into a video, right?

90
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:16,220
And that's called your input and you have trusted and

91
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,100
untrusted input and a lot of input is untrusted,

92
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:19,440
right?

93
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,760
The concept being trusted input is where you know,

94
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,720
it's coming from a trusted source.

95
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:27,140
Be it another part of the application or conceivably, even

96
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,320
some sort of uh we'll say other machine that you can guarantee is correct.

97
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,220
And then you have untrusted and this would be things like

98
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,570
html off the internet or a video file or whatever,

99
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:37,920
right?

100
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:41,480
And so anytime you're dealing with untrusted input, these,

101
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,320
these parsers are super complex

102
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,369
and they have to do all kinds of crazy stuff.

103
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,890
And a lot of them are written in C which we'll get to that point,

104
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,609
we'll get to that.

105
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,250
But, but the point is that

106
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,070
so essentially what happened is someone wrote a fuzz that

107
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,510
took these files and basically just like randomly started flipping bits

108
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,230
and they were incredibly successful at doing

109
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,519
this back when it first started because

110
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,450
you could literally flip random bits and you would crash tons of stuff.

111
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,690
It was crazy how successful they were.

112
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,179
And so basically, now what's happened is many of the easy bugs have been fixed.

113
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,739
So these fuzz keep getting more and more complicated where they,

114
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,040
they have to understand the protocols and understand the

115
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,890
file formats and they're changing very specific things.

116
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,220
Like a great example is I think it was JPEG or no PNG I fuzzed at one point.

117
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,899
But the PNG file has check sums embedded all over it.

118
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,000
And so basically, if you twiddle bits,

119
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,269
you also have to update the check sums or most parsers

120
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,720
are good about noticing bad check sums right away and they bail

121
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:38,640
so

122
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,970
and, and there are fuzz that do things like that where they'll, you know,

123
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,350
fiddle with some metadata and then they update the check

124
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,799
sum and then they throw the file inside of the,

125
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:46,559
the parser

126
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:50,339
and uh quite often they crash. And so anyway, anyway,

127
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,880
the reason this comes up is we ran across a couple of stories that,

128
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,040
that fuzzing was a central aspect of them.

129
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:56,399
And

130
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,209
Kurt and I got to talking and it's like

131
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:01,959
we've reached a point where why is fuzzing still successful?

132
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,970
I mean, we, these have been around forever.

133
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,399
They should just be part of a Q A process and, and they're obviously not though.

134
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,100
Yeah, Well, I mean, and

135
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,260
I remember part of fuzzing, the problem used to be compute time.

136
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,290
Right. Fuzzing used to, well, and still does require

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,450
a

138
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,260
reasonable amount of compute time.

139
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,209
Um,

140
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,059
and more to the point if you wanted to do your fuzzing, you know,

141
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,059
quickly to do it in parallel, you know, it was very expensive.

142
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,220
But now with the cloud,

143
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:28,010
you know, if you want to run a job on 1000 machines for an hour,

144
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,160
that's the same cost as having one machine for $1000 right?

145
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:31,980
So who cares?

146
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:35,619
Um And I mean, Google was a good example of this, you know,

147
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,059
they have a huge fuzzing infrastructure against Google Chrome, their web browser,

148
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,339
you know, so they're just manging

149
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:42,899
input constantly.

150
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,079
Um or they did an extreme thing,

151
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,390
we'll link to it in the show notes where

152
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,239
they basically decided to test out PDF parsing.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
And so they were like, well, first of all,

154
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:56,260
we need a corpus of PDF S that basically goes down every single possible code path,

155
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:56,619
right?

156
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:56,980
Because,

157
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,660
you know PDF S for example, can have interactive content or they can have, you know,

158
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,540
forms that you fill out or they can have, you know, the the PDF format is,

159
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,149
is actually quite amazing in what it can do.

160
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,890
It's turning complete, actually,

161
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,579
it is actually yes.

162
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:14,779
Um you can and you can embed stuff into it that is also turning complete.

163
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:16,269
Um

164
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:19,260
So it's nested during complete engines

165
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,029
anyway.

166
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,190
So they were like, well, first of all,

167
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,630
we need a corpus of PDF S that go through all the code paths and like, well,

168
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,109
we have that we're Google, we've gone through the internet.

169
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,299
Um, you know, and then they reduced these test cases, you know, these giant PDF S,

170
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,600
they reduce them into smaller and smaller test cases so that they

171
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:38,170
had basically a set of stuff that would exercise every code path

172
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,149
and then they started twiddling bits and they started, you know, mangling them and,

173
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,859
you know, of course they found a lot of problems

174
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,079
and

175
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,640
the good news though is assuming you build a good fuzz and assuming you run it enough

176
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,160
and then assuming you fix all the problems it finds

177
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,359
you're gonna have a pretty much bulletproof application.

178
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,279
It would be, yeah, I mean, if you did all of that, I,

179
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,380
I think the barrier of entry for finding flaws in your stuff would be really,

180
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,299
really high.

181
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:10,480
Yeah.

182
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,970
Well, I mean,

183
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,850
heart bleed is a good example of something that could have been found by fuzzing.

184
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,339
-- What did they find it by fuzzing? I think they,
-- they,

185
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,329
they, they did not find it by fuzzing, but it was, it was,

186
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,790
I remember specifically it was something that

187
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,510
could have actually been found by fuzzing.

188
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:23,980
Like there's

189
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,529
sometimes let's face it, there's, I mean, fuzzing is good but to truly, you know,

190
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,380
for example, fuzzing a web application,

191
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,769
you'd have to understand the web server and the

192
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,450
back end application and do all sorts of,

193
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,919
you know, maybe understand that like

194
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,020
you can only register so many seats on a plane or what the rules about transfers are.

195
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,030
Um

196
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,820
you know, so fuzzing won't

197
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:47,330
certain types of problems like say logic airs are going

198
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,809
to be maybe much harder to find with fuzzing.

199
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,979
Whereas like an off by one buffer overflow

200
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,109
-- is something you you can very much find
-- with fuzzing.

201
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,090
And not only that, but fuzzing has a, a amount of randomness in it.

202
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,219
So you could literally fuzz something for two months

203
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:05,460
and have nothing and then start the fuzz up again

204
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:08,380
and in 30 seconds have crashed just because it

205
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,900
depends on what the randomness you're dealing with is.

206
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,780
Yeah. And then there's also

207
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,270
it gets more complicated.

208
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,679
There's like the feathers the,

209
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,140
but uh there's the fuzz that basically just generate

210
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,669
outputs that you shove into the program and you kind

211
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,780
of keep an eye on the program to see if it dies or not or if something horrible happens,

212
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,109
then there's also the Fuzzs that

213
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,130
allow you or provide hooks into the program. Um

214
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,390
So for example, with Apache,

215
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,280
you can recompile Apache with some hooks to make it much easier to

216
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:38,710
fuzz so that you're not actually like running the full server locally,

217
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:41,979
you're, you're basically kind of running it in a more limited fuzzing

218
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:44,590
uh sense that is a lot faster to test.

219
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,780
Um

220
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,229
And some of these can actually provide some guidance on kind of how bad

221
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,919
this is or where did it actually crash or how bad was it?

222
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,099
You know, like, what kind of crash was it? Right.

223
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,739
Yep. Yep. Yeah. And an American fuzzy lab

224
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,799
is a great fuzz

225
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:01,270
that can do many of these things and, and in fact,

226
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,380
you're speaking of Apache and one of the stories we reference is a

227
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:10,179
guy uses a fl against Apache and he found a bug just recently,

228
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,539
which

229
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:13,020
I haven't heard of a good Apache bug in a long time.

230
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,650
Well, because basically Apache has been fuzzed by the internet

231
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,840
in the sense of all these people who run Apache web servers and

232
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:24,159
if they consistently crash and you have a reasonably clued in admin,

233
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,099
they try and figure out why it crashed

234
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,979
and then they'll go to the Apache foundation and be like, yo, you know,

235
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:32,900
when this happens, Apache dies, please fix.

236
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,739
-- That is true. I
-- suppose we've had 20 years of that.

237
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:37,859
If you have enough users

238
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,619
just you naturally get fuzzing, right?

239
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,179
Your users are literally fuzzing your application.

240
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,599
Yeah, I mean, a great example is like SSL, I mean,

241
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:48,679
if you're running a major web property,

242
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:51,559
you will see every single SSL client at some point

243
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:53,929
and some of them will be broke

244
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,570
and then some right.

245
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,250
Yeah,

246
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:59,609
you know, I remember um when we, when we were, yeah,

247
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,450
we were going to turn on SN I So server name,

248
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,929
what is it, the SSL server name, virtualization stuff. So what's, what is SN I stand?

249
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,239
I don't remember.

250
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,969
Anyway, server name indicator,

251
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,549
right?

252
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,570
Whereas part of SSL TLS handshake or whatever you indicate what,

253
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,090
which host name you want to talk to.

254
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,409
And the, the, the concern was, you know,

255
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,030
like how many of our clients support or don't support this.

256
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,260
So I think I added like a web bug

257
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,700
to the site, you know, that would then be requested. And like

258
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,979
we essentially had three client types that wouldn't work.

259
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,940
And that one was a Chinese web crawler. So, ok, too bad. Uh,

260
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,289
another was some

261
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,830
weird custom header from a phone.

262
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,340
And the third was like a really, I think it was, must have been a really old blackberry

263
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,469
nice.

264
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,710
So, you know, at that point of course, the answer is yes, yes, we can turn SN I on and,

265
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:48,729
you know, well, we'll lose like three clients,

266
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:49,150
right?

267
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,659
This is one of the things that infuriates me all

268
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,760
the time is you have a new standard of protocol

269
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,570
and people will say, oh, it has to be backwards compatible,

270
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,780
which anytime you add backwards compatibility,

271
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:01,440
you almost always add security issues.

272
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,880
-- But then there
-- are

273
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,179
some

274
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,590
cases you can't have backwards,

275
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,000
you shouldn't ever

276
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,599
is, is the real lesson.

277
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:08,500
And it's,

278
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,010
it's to support like six ridiculously old clients that no one should even be using

279
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,530
the flip side. However, is if you have backwards compatibility.

280
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,679
You can have a much smoother transition.

281
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,289
-- I don't think that's true. I
-- think so. Well, I

282
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:22,500
think

283
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,239
we tend to add backwards compatibility, but then we never remove it.

284
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,270
And so for example, if we said, look,

285
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,219
we're going to be backwards compatible for two years

286
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,169
so that we have a two year smooth transition

287
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,409
and then we're killing it.

288
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:36,229
I mean, that's for example, what Google has done with those cas,

289
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,940
but it's, you know, less and less trusted

290
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,929
is that essentially we're not going to kill it today because, you know,

291
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,520
that will cause a lot of problems.

292
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,099
But

293
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,380
we are giving you a very strict finite lifespan and then,

294
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,299
well, if you didn't fix it too bad,

295
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,320
ok, I'll agree with that.

296
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:54,940
-- I think that's more than the
-- problem is that almost never happens. We almost always,

297
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,969
you know, a great example being the S

298
00:12:57,229 --> 00:13:00,039
SSL and TLS handshake negotiations

299
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,640
that allows downgraded attacks.

300
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,679
And that has been how many, like how many really bad?

301
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:06,979
Like every other year there's a new attack and

302
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,739
they almost always focus on downgrading to something that,

303
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,549
that sucks.

304
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,770
-- It's just, well,
-- this

305
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,650
-- is
-- a perfect example.

306
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,479
The crypto ma

307
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:14,630
is good.

308
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:19,869
It's the stuff like the key management and the actual connection establishment

309
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,190
that is not so great.

310
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,770
Right. Right.

311
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,340
The reality is I'm never going to try and break Aes, that's just foolish

312
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:32,030
and nobody has to because all the other crap is broken.

313
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,039
Yeah. There's side channel attacks.

314
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:36,460
There's, there's people that put their keys into their github

315
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,299
accounts,

316
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:38,239
uh,

317
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:40,859
in their code, you know, like, yeah, why, you know,

318
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,630
I'm not gonna bother attacking a S when I

319
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,320
can just search Google for like begin private key.

320
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,760
Right. Uh Actually did you know, you can't search

321
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:47,929
github

322
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,929
for that anymore?

323
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
Yeah, they, they, yes, they did.

324
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,520
They've now blacklisted those terms, which I think is great and I think that is

325
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:56,580
um

326
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,809
in some ways, the responsible thing to do the flip side being is that,

327
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:02,239
uh there was that guy, I think we talked about this,

328
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,010
a guy wrote a little script that checks code strings for entropy

329
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,090
and the higher the entropy,

330
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,570
the more likely it is to be something like a password or a key.

331
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,200
And so then he basically sets this thing through, like, you know,

332
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,929
downloading github

333
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,679
and grinding it through the script.

334
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,219
And, you know, of course,

335
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,049
he found a ton of passwords and secret keys and Lord knows what else.

336
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,750
Yep. It's uh it's called Truffle Hog.

337
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,549
Yes,

338
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:24,549
that's the one.

339
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,869
But now on, on the downside though and,

340
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,250
and this is something I always wonder about a lot and, and I,

341
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,989
I don't have a good answer for it, but

342
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:31,909
so github

343
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,830
doesn't let you search for this. But

344
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,630
if, if, if a researcher can't help people identify, they've done this,

345
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,549
that means there are probably a bunch of repos that have private keys in them,

346
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,549
they don't know.

347
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:46,710
And it's very difficult now for people to help them understand they've done it.

348
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,119
-- Yeah. II, I generally agree with that. I mean,
-- I

349
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:52,289
don't know. I would hope. Does

350
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,890
github warn you? I should try that. I

351
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:55,409
-- don't
-- know. I

352
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:56,239
think,

353
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,909
see, and here's actually where we get into a segment we're going to do later.

354
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,570
But here's the thing,

355
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,270
if github actually starts really inspecting your

356
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,950
code and then giving you warnings or

357
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,669
kind of notifications on it like that.

358
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,280
Like,

359
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:10,109
uh maybe a simpler example would be

360
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:13,299
github runs everything through an antivirus scanner and

361
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:17,150
then sort of blocks what is an actual virus maybe or gives you a warning,

362
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,070
then, you know, there might be the concern legally that, oh,

363
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,229
if we don't detect it, we get sued.

364
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,940
Uh

365
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,880
And so I know in the security world there's a certain,

366
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,179
you know, for example, I noticed a flaw in my bank.

367
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:33,400
-- Do I really want to contact them and maybe have them yell at me or call the police?
-- I,

368
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,059
I understand this, this concern

369
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:37,349
and

370
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,200
yeah, I, I don't know. I mean, there's just not a good answer for it, unfortunately.

371
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,750
II I,

372
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:43,750
I,

373
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,250
I think we are moving to more of a

374
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,890
model where everybody gets that everything has security problems

375
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:55,010
or, you know, you have, uh, Verizon, was it Verizon with their third party

376
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,080
company that sort of accidentally dropped 13 million customer

377
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,260
records into an S3 bucket that was public.

378
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,929
That's happened to everybody

379
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,890
at this point.

380
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,520
Although you know what I love is people keep blaming S3.

381
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,159
It's not S three's fault like you screwed it up.

382
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,599
Well, S3 has amazing access controls. You can restrict by IP address.

383
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:17,929
You can tie it into, you know,

384
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,520
Microsoft's identity and authorization management system.

385
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:25,020
You can, you can do all sorts of cool things to really

386
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,789
lock it down. Give it very restricted access. But here's the problem.

387
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:32,150
People want to share data and sharing data securely is

388
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,080
a lot more difficult than putting it in a public

389
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,710
site. But, you know, with a hopefully secret name

390
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,960
that nobody else can find, you know, I mean,

391
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:43,559
we used to have this problem with anonymous FTP servers where, yeah, like literally

392
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,070
you'd have mainframes uploading batch jobs with like bank records and stuff to an

393
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,190
FTP site.

394
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,719
-- What was the
-- thing that would search,

395
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,479
was it called Archie that you could search anonymous

396
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,210
FTP?

397
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:57,020
-- Yeah, there was
-- Archie Jughead and Veronica the three search engine.

398
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,239
Right. Right.

399
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,489
You, you are, you know what people, you're gonna have to go read the Wikipedia page.

400
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,819
-- I'm going to try and explain this. I'm not
-- going to talk about it, but we'll say

401
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,790
-- is
-- like

402
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,270
-- fire
-- and

403
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,829
rocks

404
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,469
back in my day.

405
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,848
Yeah.

406
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:14,390
So,

407
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:18,699
yeah. Uh it's, and so yeah, that's, that's one of the questions is, you know,

408
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,858
if you sort of take on this

409
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,390
duty,

410
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,108
do you then kind of have that duty of care or that

411
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:29,030
responsibility to ensure that it's done correctly or can you basically say,

412
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,319
like, look, we're going to try and maybe warn you about, like,

413
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:32,770
sticking passwords in your code.

414
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,150
But fundamentally like, you know,

415
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,339
we, we're not going to guarantee anything.

416
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,369
And I guess to the point, the problem more is, is

417
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,280
there's perceived a huge negative downside in that, you know,

418
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,030
somebody sues you or takes you to court or raises a ruckus on Twitter

419
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,609
versus on the flip side not doing this while everybody doesn't do this.

420
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:51,479
So that's OK.

421
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,369
Right. Just like you said with the fuzzing, right?

422
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,520
We were talking about why don't more projects have a

423
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,979
good fuzzing test suite as part of their unit test.

424
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:58,890
So actually, I'm gonna,

425
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,489
I'm gonna do a call out here because I can is the Free Radius project.

426
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,650
Actually, uh a guy found a bunch of issues fuzzing

427
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:08,790
and they have a statement basically talked about how crappy C is.

428
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,930
And then they say that from now on fuzzing is

429
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,650
part of their testing process for all free radius releases.

430
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,410
Like that's amazing, right? That's the way you should be doing it.

431
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,430
I agree 100%.

432
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,030
The problem is, you know, a lot of uh programs don't even have a test suite,

433
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,579
let alone a good test suite,

434
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:30,739
you know, from a maturity model where a lot of projects are, are no way there.

435
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,079
And that actually kind of frustrates me because for example,

436
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,520
um, there's a, like that guy that found that Apache bug, he did a bunch of work,

437
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:36,619
you know,

438
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,250
with American Fuzzy Lop and tying some stuff into Apache to make it really robust and

439
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,250
um setting it up. So it would uh record the attacks and do replays because,

440
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,630
you know,

441
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,040
one of the challenges with fuzzing is you

442
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,880
send like 9000 fuzzing test cases to an application

443
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,489
and then it crashes at some point like which one actually crashed it, right?

444
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,900
Did uh did case number one crash it but it took like

445
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,099
-- a minute for memory to fill up or did case 9000 crash
-- it

446
00:18:59,250 --> 00:18:59,260
A

447
00:18:59,459 --> 00:18:59,729
F L is

448
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:01,329
actually pretty good at helping with that.

449
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:01,910
Yeah.

450
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,599
Um but basically what I would like to see is why isn't there like a

451
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:11,270
good web fuzzing framework that you can just easily call from your C I system

452
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,689
when you're doing, you know, your build process

453
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,910
or as part of your final acceptance test and

454
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,380
just have like a really good security fuzzing,

455
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:18,979
you know,

456
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,699
suite that like has like here's all the stuff we

457
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,500
found in the past and as we find more stuff,

458
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,239
we add it

459
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,150
and you know, all the web servers in the world, like especially like the engine X,

460
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,630
the Apache, the iis, all these guys, you know, flask and all the Python stuff,

461
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,859
all the pearl stuff,

462
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,500
you know, can run this fuzzing test suite against their web server

463
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,750
and, you know, if you pass, you're good. I mean, we're doing the same thing with CV.

464
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Hopefully is we're gonna have a test suite of CV ES

465
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,579
in a reserved block.

466
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,540
So they're, you know,

467
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,880
they're not like real CV ES in the sense of like their real issues.

468
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:53,020
Um, but there'll be things like, you know, they'll have emojis in the name,

469
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,109
they'll have emojis in the URL.

470
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:55,630
Like they'll,

471
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,599
it essentially will be if you can process this block

472
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:03,989
of really ugly but legally legitimate Kosher CV es,

473
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,760
then your CV parser is probably OK.

474
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,469
Nice.

475
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,180
You know, a great example being um

476
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,680
we support language translations of the description now.

477
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:15,900
So how many languages are there? Globally?

478
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,060
Several 1000.

479
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,160
So what happens if we have a CV E with 5000 language descriptions?

480
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:24,339
I'm guessing a lot of systems will break?

481
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:25,489
That's crazy, man.

482
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,489
Yeah,

483
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,900
I can't imagine so.

484
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,819
Anyways. Yeah. So

485
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:33,949
I, I think it's a maturity issue. We will get there.

486
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:37,130
I mean, we've already gotten away from shoot the messenger largely.

487
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,250
I mean, that used to be a problem.

488
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:39,859
It's

489
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,810
true. We are a lot better about that.

490
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:45,060
Was it Ford officially made a statement saying if you

491
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:47,099
bring a security problem to us about our cars,

492
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,369
we won't

493
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,410
like sue you. We won't

494
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,689
make your life a living hell. We will actually try and work with you

495
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:57,670
and you know, from being an open source guy. I'm like, well, duh, of course.

496
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,270
But, you know,

497
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,209
realistically there's still a lot of large companies out there that, like,

498
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,969
I would be afraid to

499
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,079
-- stand up and bring a security issue to them. Yeah.
-- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

500
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:08,660
No, there, there definitely are.

501
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,310
In fact, this is, I know one of the big arguments in favor of a bug bounty is a bug.

502
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,689
Bounty is an easy way as an organization to basically advertise, you know, hey,

503
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,489
we're on your side, come bring us things and we're not going to come after you.

504
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,349
Yeah.

505
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:22,050
Yeah.

506
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,689
Yeah, I know. It's a good way to, so like to signal

507
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,599
that. Yeah, you're not going to shoot the messenger in the face.

508
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,410
Right. Right.

509
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,709
So, so anyway, I guess the lesson of the day is fuzz your stuff

510
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,910
and if you're not fuzzing,

511
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:35,650
do it for you,

512
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,630
that is true.

513
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,030
Right. I mean, people want CV S for their resume now.

514
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,969
Buzzing is a good way to get CV S.

515
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:44,160
Oh, man, it's true.

516
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,670
You know, I remember back in the day when people would,

517
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,380
would email like OS S security or one of

518
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,329
the other various security mailing lists and say something like

519
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,349
here, I, I fuzz your library. Here's like 25,000 PDF S that crash it

520
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,439
and, and it's like this is not ok.

521
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,479
I, I don't want to deal with this and,

522
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,849
and I remember more than once I went through it and it's always, you know,

523
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,199
two bugs same to

524
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,900
it's just,

525
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,630
they didn't check how it was triggered.

526
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,229
They just ran the fuzz, they dumped it over the wall and

527
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:14,300
it annoyed me that some project would still give credit where

528
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,140
it's like I just did all of the actual work here.

529
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,550
This guy literally ran a fuzz for an hour and emailed you the output.

530
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,140
Why are we giving him any credit?

531
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,290
I've had the same situation and to be quite frank, I, I won't accept those.

532
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:28,959
You know, I,

533
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:31,170
I will say I need a root cause I need

534
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,079
to figure out what's going on or work with the project

535
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:34,160
to get your CV.

536
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm not unless it's something really like, OK, you know,

537
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,979
I here's a network packet that causes Linux to reboot.

538
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,520
That would be totally different

539
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,930
in which case. OK? You will get a CV.

540
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:46,229
Yeah, exactly.

541
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:49,050
Well, and I guess this is also a big advantage of a B bo

542
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,390
again where

543
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,619
you know what, I'm not paying you for 9000 PDF S,

544
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:55,979
you figure it out

545
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,619
and I'll give you a check

546
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,859
or you don't figure it out and then nobody cares. Right.

547
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:02,900
Well, and,

548
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,060
and this is something I've been looking more and more at is

549
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:08,060
this sort of idea of market forces in the security world where

550
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,829
a good example being, you know, if nobody is requesting CV ES

551
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:14,479
for a program, then chances are nobody's like

552
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,119
checking that program

553
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,819
for flaws because the reality is even a mature highly securely

554
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:26,060
architected and engineered program like open SSH is a great example, right?

555
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,939
Uh you know, they have,

556
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,420
uh was it,

557
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,060
you know, the, the two,

558
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,739
CV, triple seven and was it

559
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,069
776 or 778? I forget it was sequential,

560
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:40,560
you know, and they had like some really stupid flaws with some old code and stuff.

561
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,760
So everybody has CV S, you know, it's like everybody poops,

562
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:44,469
those

563
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:47,180
guys are literally some of the best in the world.

564
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:50,319
I mean, if I was going to pick people to write secure software,

565
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,849
like those are the guys.

566
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:52,359
Right.

567
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:53,339
Yeah.

568
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,010
Yeah.

569
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,349
And um so yeah, I mean, it's just,

570
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,939
yeah, we're at a point where I think,

571
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,969
well, on the one hand, we need more fuzzing but we also need better fuzzing.

572
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:04,900
Like, because like you said, you know, sending me 9000 PDF S that crash,

573
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,939
it is not actually that helpful because the reality is if you give anybody who

574
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,010
knows how to audit code a code base

575
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,900
and enough time they will find a flaw.

576
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,709
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

577
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:18,469
That's just how that works.

578
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,569
And especially, you know,

579
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:23,329
you look at like a code base like the Linux kernel or anything, you know,

580
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,000
these are huge million plus line code bases now with

581
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:28,630
logic and

582
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,560
um

583
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,510
culture issues from 20 years ago

584
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:34,630
when things were very different.

585
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,750
-- Yeah. Yeah.
-- Right.

586
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,949
Actually you want to know something really funny.

587
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:41,780
So I, I don't know if I'm still a part of the project, but I used to be uh

588
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,969
an upstream

589
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:47,280
contributor to a project called N MH, which is a new mail handler.

590
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,180
I think it's called, it's,

591
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:52,069
it started out at the RAND Corporation in the seventies, right? This was like,

592
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:55,790
this is like the craziest email program you can imagine. It was,

593
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,989
it was amazing.

594
00:24:57,239 --> 00:25:01,150
It could literally do anything. And I'm not joking when I say literally do anything.

595
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:02,890
And so if you knew how to use,

596
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,380
it was super powerful, of course, it took, you know,

597
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,780
like four years to learn how to use it correctly.

598
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:10,609
But, but once you had it down, it was great, right? But anyway,

599
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:12,050
I remember at one point,

600
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,920
I thought I'm going to run this all through valgrind

601
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,680
and I'm gonna fuzz it out and see what happens.

602
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:17,060
Right?

603
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:17,780
No, no,

604
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,050
it was like, totally clean.

605
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:22,280
But here's the thing, here's the thing

606
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,689
in the seventies.

607
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:27,530
These systems had so few resources like it had to be tight and you

608
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,410
couldn't have memory leaks and you couldn't have logic errors because it was,

609
00:25:30,484 --> 00:25:32,185
it would take the whole system down.

610
00:25:32,954 --> 00:25:36,035
Well, yeah, true. You didn't really have true multi user systems and segmentation.

611
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,385
-- It
-- was
-- amazing how good the code really was.

612
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:42,295
I mean, granted it looked kind of ugly because it was using some old like K and R style.

613
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:43,405
But I was like,

614
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:48,545
I was flabbergasted by how few errors I found fuzzing and using Belgrand against it.

615
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:49,905
It was just, it was amazing.

616
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,930
Well, it's, if maybe we'll put this in the show notes,

617
00:25:52,939 --> 00:25:54,380
but there's a good story about the,

618
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,189
the code and the quality of the code behind the space shuttle.

619
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,069
And it, it is amazing like they very,

620
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,770
they actually very strictly try not to work overtime because you know,

621
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,130
tired people write bad code.

622
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,130
Every line of code is documented and not just documented in the sense of like,

623
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,589
oh this piece of code is supposed to do this.

624
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,000
It's no, this code exists because of this meeting.

625
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,890
We made this decision and decided this would happen this way.

626
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,910
And therefore we have this case that blah, blah, you know, the whole

627
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,880
-- there's that whole cradle to grave kind of aerospace thing of, you know,
-- but

628
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:22,180
now you

629
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,400
see

630
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:25,459
exactly why this is not general purpose in any way.

631
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:25,880
And

632
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,670
I wonder what they charged or rather what it costs them per line

633
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:30,319
of code.

634
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,020
But when you think about what a code flaw in a spacecraft costs

635
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,489
a great example being that Ariane launch where I think what they got Indian

636
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,349
-- mixed up or something, then they had to
-- destroy it. That's true because

637
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:42,810
-- there was
-- several 100 million

638
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:43,410
dollars

639
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:43,689
that

640
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,439
-- you can, you can probably justify it in
-- that instance.

641
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:49,719
Or the Mars orbiter that like whoops metric imperial close

642
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:53,010
enough, we lost like half of the Mars or, or dose, haven't we?

643
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,400
The number is staggering.

644
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,119
Well, when you think about the problem though, the problem statement,

645
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,479
let's send a small spacecraft slash robot

646
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:03,000
to another planet.

647
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:07,750
Well, that's like the, the, the, the current two or one. Which one?

648
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,189
I forget what it is. The one that, the,

649
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:15,060
the sky crane that, that lowered the latest one down. You know,

650
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,819
I, I stayed up till like, three in the morning. I think it was

651
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,660
paying attention to this because it was, it was fascinating and it's funny because

652
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:25,459
there's all these people on the internet watching a live stream

653
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:26,819
and there's nothing's happening.

654
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:28,939
Like they're waiting for like, literally three beeps.

655
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,579
And then

656
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:30,119
I think

657
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,050
what a 26 minute transmission.

658
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,910
It was something crazy. I know.

659
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,619
And it was unreal and then, and then, like it lands and I thought, wow, that's neat.

660
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,339
And I went to bed.

661
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,569
It was the most

662
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,709
uneventful,

663
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,660
-- the
-- fact that they did manage to land something the

664
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,650
size of a mini cooper on Mars without breaking it.

665
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,449
-- I mean,
-- not

666
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:46,719
just,

667
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,660
and it landed, they lowered it from the sky crane.

668
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,619
It was amazing.

669
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,890
Anyway. Anyway, anyway,

670
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,770
-- all
-- technology is amazing. It works.

671
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,280
Why don't we move on to the topic we've actually been waiting for,

672
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,170
which is net neutrality and security

673
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:05,630
-- and why it's such a great thing for security.
-- That's right.

674
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,819
I mean, net neutrality is a terrible thing for security.

675
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,189
I'm going to take the contrarian view.

676
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,290
You're going to say it's bad for security.

677
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:11,949
I

678
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,560
understand the

679
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:14,650
worst idea ever.

680
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,619
I've been reading Republican Talking point.

681
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:18,069
Right.

682
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,510
Fox News.

683
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:21,109
So,

684
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,630
so here's the intent is

685
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,170
net neutrality.

686
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,040
It's been a topic in the US for years, I guess.

687
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:29,670
And,

688
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,310
and Kurt and I decided it would be way more fun to talk about

689
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,430
if one of us took a contrarian view and one of us didn't.

690
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:41,349
And so Kurt is going to represent the, uh, ignorant class, we'll say,

691
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,489
and I'm going to be the side of good

692
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,099
and say that net neutrality is bad

693
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:51,099
and, and Kurt is going to tell us why it's not

694
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:51,939
or rather wait,

695
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,770
you're saying net neutrality is bad. I'm pro

696
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,619
this is so confusing already.

697
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:57,180
Yeah.

698
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:00,260
And just for the record, I am for net neutrality,

699
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,660
I am also a Canadian and we just recently had our court

700
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,099
system decide that net neutrality is the way things are here.

701
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,619
So I'm quite happy about that.

702
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,959
But I believe it is important

703
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,719
to me, it's kind of like a, you know, it's like the prosecution,

704
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:15,250
you should have a vigorous defense and quite frankly, if the defense

705
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,219
can sort of outsmart the prosecution, then, well, let's face it.

706
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:19,979
The prosecution maybe didn't do a very good job.

707
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:23,979
And so I'm going to take the contrarian view that net neutrality is

708
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:27,500
probably literally the most terrible thing for security on the internet ever.

709
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,290
And, well, we'll see what happens.

710
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,459
Well, why don't you start? Because I, I have no idea why you'd even think that.

711
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,989
-- And so I'm curious what kind of talking points you come up with?
-- Ok.

712
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,430
So, fundamentally, well, first of all, let's define what net neutrality is for the

713
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:42,630
rest of this conversation,

714
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:43,420
right? Because

715
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,619
I think that's one of the problems is it's a very sort of nebulous set of ideas.

716
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,160
Um,

717
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,025
so I'm gonna basically restricted largely to the

718
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:52,584
sort of that idea of common carriers.

719
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:53,145
So,

720
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:57,064
um, a lot of people would argue that, you know, the, the network,

721
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:58,734
the internet rather is

722
00:29:58,984 --> 00:30:01,175
akin to infrastructure now,

723
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:05,805
uh, such as, you know, public roads, gas, electrical

724
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:06,854
telephones

725
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:10,214
and that effectively, you know, these companies providing

726
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:13,045
network service should, um,

727
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,579
provide service and that's it,

728
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:18,989
they shouldn't modify the traffic or give preference to the traffic.

729
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,459
Uh,

730
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:24,579
and that essentially, you know, back to that common carrier status of, you know,

731
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,780
I don't know what's on my network.

732
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,859
We just move packets,

733
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:30,260
right? Like it's got a valid IP address we wrote it

734
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,020
right end of story makes sense. Um,

735
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:36,219
you know, and, and then the, the, the really tough problem becomes is, you know,

736
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:39,170
you have network providers that are sort of the last mile,

737
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:43,459
you have network providers that are more like, like sort of international

738
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:47,020
providers. And then you have providers that are both

739
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,359
right, like my ISP Shaw is,

740
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:53,800
it's the last mile, but they also like, go down all the way to the US

741
00:30:53,949 --> 00:30:55,599
on their own. You know, networks

742
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,400
because they're big.

743
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,719
Well, it's also worth noting here as well that,

744
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:02,780
that some historical perspective is at least in the United States,

745
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,959
the National Science Foundation actually used

746
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:07,079
to basically own like the internet backbone

747
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,229
and they sold it

748
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:08,849
three

749
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:09,589
years ago.

750
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,459
Ok. Right.

751
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,089
And then to further complicate things around network. The tr

752
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:21,619
of course is that we have laws going back to, I believe, 1934 probably

753
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,770
than that. Yeah.

754
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,630
Title two is in fact part of the Far Reach and Communications Act of 1934.

755
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,790
So, yeah, we've got almost 100 years of law for technology.

756
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,140
That's only like 40 years old.

757
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,619
What could go wrong.

758
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:36,209
It's, it's tricky man.

759
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:36,449
Well,

760
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,010
and it gets even trickier because a lot of

761
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,369
the old laws specifically call out telephones instead of,

762
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,520
you know, some talk about communication devices, some talk about telephones.

763
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,449
And so how do we apply? This stuff? Doesn't make sense? We don't know.

764
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:49,770
Yeah.

765
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,449
Well, and,

766
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:53,890
and even today defining what is a telecommunications provider like Skype,

767
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,199
uh, they gave me a phone number

768
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:56,939
two

769
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,560
phone numbers. I mean, my favorite example of this actually is paypal.

770
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:04,569
Paypal isn't a regulated financial institution.

771
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,890
And so they're always like doing some dodgy things you hear about that.

772
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,130
Like if a bank did

773
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:10,410
the bank, the bank

774
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,930
get sued and lose. Right. And so

775
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,839
it's a great example of which is the right way. I don't know.

776
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,959
So, anyway, anyway,

777
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:23,599
so anyways, so many people would have, you believe that we should just have this,

778
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,369
you know, network that just carries whatever

779
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:31,500
and the traffic is never manipulated or given preference or anything like that.

780
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,369
The reality is how are we going to innovate new services?

781
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:42,560
If, for example, we can't prioritize traffic if we can't allow people to say, look,

782
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:45,119
you know, I really want my video streams to work

783
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,689
um, at the cost of, you know, my bulk downloads, maybe not working so well. Or

784
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,390
how do we secure the internet if we just allow people to do whatever they want on it,

785
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,569
you know, shouldn't we be maybe running I DS and IP S systems

786
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,540
at the national level,

787
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,310
-- you know, and blocking the bad traffic from other countries
-- like China do that,

788
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:11,260
they run the national firewall. Um Unfortunately, that's more about,

789
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,000
uh that's less about sort of security for the

790
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,339
end users and more about security for the state.

791
00:33:16,449 --> 00:33:20,459
Right. I see. See. But, ok, so that's kind of the whole point, right? Is

792
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,699
when you have a large organization

793
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,180
in charge of, we'll say monitoring traffic

794
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,689
and, and especially when it's kind of the network owners,

795
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:32,569
they're going to put their well being ahead of the end user well being, which,

796
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,719
which I, I think is kind of expected.

797
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:35,250
Right.

798
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:42,579
Well, and part of my thought process there would be is, you know, uh

799
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,890
in general, I would hope that the government of a country Uh I would hope that,

800
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,729
that government's interests are generally aligned

801
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:50,949
with the people of that country,

802
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,089
especially

803
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:54,729
when you have a democracy such as America where

804
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:58,479
you guys elect a president and congressional representatives.

805
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,770
Um

806
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,969
But in general, you know,

807
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:05,329
I would assume your government kind of represents your interests otherwise.

808
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:07,530
Well, things have really gone a bit sideways.

809
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,790
Man. There's like 12 hours of content in, in your statement right there.

810
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,260
But let's, let's look at it this way. Right? Is,

811
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:16,728
is right now,

812
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,679
it's not even about the government necessarily

813
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:20,389
representing the interests of the people.

814
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,129
It's the fact that you have these network owners that are arguing, it's our network,

815
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,489
we should be able to do what we want with it.

816
00:34:26,908 --> 00:34:27,717
And then

817
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:32,289
you have kind of the, the people are, are, I think in general saying, you know, we,

818
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,759
we don't want you to do that because we don't trust you.

819
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:37,599
And I mean, let's face it. I think in many instances,

820
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:39,168
your network provider

821
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,929
can really be viewed as an adversary in a way

822
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:42,728
where

823
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,810
-- can you trust them to not mess
-- with your

824
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,300
company that you deal with?

825
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,199
Right. Yeah. Yeah, I won't disagree

826
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,139
-- with. I mean,
-- when I buy breaks, they don't,

827
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,070
they're making breaks at

828
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,958
a certain price point and quality,

829
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,500
they're not making the absolute best breaks, they can at like a 0.1% margin.

830
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,179
You know, they're trying to make a healthy profit margin.

831
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,340
Right.

832
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,610
And, and that that is fair.

833
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,219
And I think that's what it, what you're going to get with net neutrality is

834
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,139
if, if you have an instance where the,

835
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:13,649
the providers

836
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,750
can mess with traffic,

837
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:17,060
you know,

838
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,000
they're going to make decisions that maximize their profits essentially.

839
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,800
And, and I don't blame them for that mind you.

840
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,510
-- I'm not saying
-- they're wrong on the flip side. For example, Shaw is a good example.

841
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,639
I have a residential Shaw connection.

842
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:31,270
I cannot connect out to port 25

843
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,320
anywhere.

844
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,010
So I can't send email from my home system

845
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,340
to random servers on the internet, right? I have to connect through,

846
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,469
you know, Google or something.

847
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:45,780
-- I mean,
-- that that's a great example we can use with security. Is that a good thing?

848
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:50,100
And conversely, I know at some points, I don't know if they still do this,

849
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,270
but I know at some points for Shaw,

850
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:57,719
some network uh neighborhood notes were so congested with SMB attacks and traffic

851
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,110
that they actually had to start blocking, you know, ports.

852
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:07,199
What is it 135 through 139 and uh 445 is CIFS because quite literally these

853
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,100
people had like windows XP machines or

854
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,250
windows 95 machines that had never been updated

855
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:18,689
and they were spewing out so much traffic. You know, if you get like 50 computers on,

856
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,290
you know,

857
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,459
say out of 1000 and they're all spewing out like five or

858
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:25,080
10 megabits per second of network traffic to their local subnet,

859
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,250
that's a problem

860
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,969
and that is going to degrade the heck out of the network.

861
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:32,260
And so in some cases,

862
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,429
there were some network uh neighborhood nodes where they literally had to block it,

863
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,649
sort of at that point of presence model where you know

864
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:41,840
that that node is servicing 100 or 200 or whatever customers.

865
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:44,489
And, and you can easily make the argument

866
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,209
that

867
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:51,040
the, the network providers should be taking some steps to, to in that case,

868
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,330
they're protecting their end users,

869
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,469
but they're also protecting their own resources and,

870
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,510
and this is where it gets super cloudy because

871
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,429
if you argue, like stay off my network, you know, get off my lawn.

872
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:03,149
You kids sort of thing of, I don't want you touching anything.

873
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,139
But at the same time,

874
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:06,989
like I like having fast internet and I'm glad my neighbor's

875
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,110
Windows X and my neighbor does have a Windows XP machine.

876
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,189
He asked me questions about it all the time and my answer is always buy a new computer.

877
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,310
But anyway, he legitimately has one

878
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,659
and knowing that

879
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,379
hopefully that thing isn't running amok, you know, and ruining my,

880
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:25,459
my local broadband because it's spewing viruses or goodness knows what it's up to.

881
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:26,340
But you know what I mean? I,

882
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:27,649
I'm

883
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:27,870
on

884
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:28,030
the

885
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,290
side in Canada, we've traditionally had fast internet speeds

886
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,060
offset by data caps,

887
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,239
right.

888
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,649
We've had data caps here for

889
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,469
quite a while now. Going on a decade.

890
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,129
And so, you know,

891
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:43,290
depending on which speed you buy and kind of how much

892
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,090
you get like 100 gigs or 500 gigs or a terabyte.

893
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:52,429
Um And most I SPS uh charge, it's I believe uh $15 a month for unlimited use,

894
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,449
which obviously I, you know, I pay for that because

895
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:56,600
um

896
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:57,370
you know,

897
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,010
uh

898
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,580
yeah, I mean, Netflix with two kids

899
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,949
that

900
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:04,020
-- eats up a lot of bandwidth.
-- I'm familiar with this problem.

901
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:05,270
So

902
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,060
here's the question though is so

903
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:12,780
like I can say that I think blocking part 25 is good and blocking S and B tr

904
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,360
you know,

905
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:18,909
here's the question and here's where it gets really crazy, right? Because I'm

906
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,260
nothing is ever black and white, right?

907
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:22,989
But now if,

908
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,429
if the internet provider decides to say uh

909
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:28,429
slow down Netflix on purpose and tell Netflix,

910
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:30,540
if you give me, you know,

911
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:31,879
10 bucks,

912
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,760
I'll speed up your connection,

913
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:35,959
right? Or rather I, I get whatever

914
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,010
I,

915
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,120
whatever

916
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,820
-- it did it did,
-- it actually happened because

917
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,179
so traditionally with networks,

918
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,979
um the way it works with the network is if you want to tie into the internet,

919
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,209
you basically have two options,

920
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:48,629
either one you pay to tie into the network

921
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:52,909
or b you are so large or so fantastically amazing

922
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,439
that people want to tie to you.

923
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,370
And so they will do that uh for free and do like an exchange.

924
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:01,350
So a good example being, you know, a company like Google, let's face it. Right.

925
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,370
Google is huge

926
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:03,209
and

927
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:06,010
customers want to access Google and have it be fast.

928
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,320
So it's in the network providers interest to, you know,

929
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,010
peer with Google and have a connection to Google.

930
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:11,570
You know,

931
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,409
network providers do that where they have peering agreements and they basically,

932
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,409
they're each sending so much traffic to each other.

933
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:19,719
It's not worth trying to figure out who owes who, what.

934
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:22,084
Yeah, it's well or more to the point,

935
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:25,245
maybe the traffic is not sort of symmetrical because for example,

936
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:28,594
like I send a lot less traffic to Google than they send to me.

937
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:31,604
Right? Like I'm downloading a ton of email. I'm downloading search results. I'm

938
00:39:31,854 --> 00:39:32,064
you.

939
00:39:32,294 --> 00:39:32,645
Right.

940
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:34,064
I make one request to youtube and then I

941
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:37,175
watch a video giving them your valuable personal information.

942
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:37,375
Exactly.

943
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:41,554
Well, but from the i from my network providers point of view, you know,

944
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:43,814
if they don't have good connectivity to youtube,

945
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:45,534
I'm gonna go find a new network provider,

946
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:46,939
right?

947
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:50,820
So basically Google is amazing enough that, you know, they can,

948
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:52,610
they, they want to

949
00:39:52,899 --> 00:39:53,169
with.

950
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:55,389
And so what happened with Netflix is I think

951
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,860
it was Comcast was basically making the case of,

952
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:00,739
you know, people send very little data to Netflix.

953
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,530
Netflix sends a huge amount of data to us that they're

954
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:06,729
not paying for it, which is a factually correct statement. Um

955
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,409
However, on the flip side, you know,

956
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:10,820
people are arguing that the customers of Comcast had

957
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,580
paid for the data and were requesting it.

958
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:13,469
Yes.

959
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,739
And I think,

960
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:15,919
um,

961
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,679
it's hard to argue for Comcast,

962
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,530
even though I don't live in the US. I've read so much about them.

963
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,479
But anyways having said that

964
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:23,760
there, you know,

965
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,679
we can go back to that sort of protecting your own network and making sure it works.

966
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:28,040
Now,

967
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:32,770
also, on the flip side is, uh Netflix is big enough that they actually build these,

968
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,919
you know, racks of machines that will host content and they will,

969
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:36,340
you know,

970
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,989
if you provide them with a rack electricity and uh I think it's 10 gigabit internet,

971
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:43,290
they'll drop these machines in on your, you know,

972
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:48,070
uh data centers so that the content is served more locally rather than, you know,

973
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,040
from uh from Netflix's head end in Amazon.

974
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,550
And that to me is also a great example of,

975
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:58,239
you know, where we, where network network neutrality breaks down

976
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,199
in that,

977
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,639
you know, we want things, for example,

978
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:03,979
we want companies to provide the data more to the edge.

979
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:05,800
So it's maybe faster and more reliable,

980
00:41:06,649 --> 00:41:09,969
right? We want to give people an incentive to maybe do these things

981
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,899
rather than to say, look carrier.

982
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:13,189
You're just going to have to make sure you have

983
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,820
a lot of bandwidth with Google or Amazon because that's where

984
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,840
-- we host and
-- then you can even make the argument

985
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,429
would Netflix have done that if Comcast hadn't played tough.

986
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,620
Yeah. And, and I, I don't know.

987
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:29,239
I, I honestly suspect they, they might not have because what's their incentive

988
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:33,340
to work with, with someone like Comcast in this instance? And so

989
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,989
-- this is, I mean, it's super cloudy and it's super crazy and,
-- well,

990
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,469
the problem is this isn't a technical problem so much

991
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:42,959
as it is also a business and worse political problem.

992
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:44,860
Uh,

993
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:45,850
yeah.

994
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,320
Yeah.

995
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,909
And also a legal problem because we also have case law because you,

996
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,939
there's certain things you can't just

997
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,540
decide to do certain things if you have like

998
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,000
80 year old telecommunications law that applies to you.

999
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:58,580
Right.

1000
00:41:58,699 --> 00:41:59,500
-- Right. Right.
-- You know,

1001
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:02,919
unless you pull a paypal and you're like, I'm not a bank, we just

1002
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,629
do money,

1003
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:08,139
-- but we're totally not a bank.
-- Right. Totally not a bank. I think Netflix is,

1004
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,199
is maybe tricky and,

1005
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:13,419
and not as obvious because there are some super obvious things that can happen.

1006
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:14,399
Right. You could have,

1007
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,030
I, I, if a network provider was detecting viruses on the wire,

1008
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,320
would anyone really complain?

1009
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:20,159
Probably not.

1010
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,750
Right.

1011
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,409
But now if a network provider decides one day that, uh, you can't go to

1012
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,399
Breitbart News because we don't like

1013
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,639
what they're saying.

1014
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:33,370
Now you have the question of, well, is that ok,

1015
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:37,560
or what if they say one day that MS NBC is, is terrorist propaganda?

1016
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,050
We're not, we're not letting you go there.

1017
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,689
And so it, it, there's certain lines of fuzziness,

1018
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:46,379
-- I think that start to
-- emerge that's already happened with, you know,

1019
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,939
government censorship of sites, for example, in the UK.

1020
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:51,780
Right. They have that big, uh, by default.

1021
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,689
I think pornography is supposed to be blocked and you actually have to apply to

1022
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,479
-- the porn unblocked on your internet connection.
-- That happened.

1023
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:58,590
I don't know if that's happened yet,

1024
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,510
but I'm pretty

1025
00:42:59,620 --> 00:42:59,909
sure that

1026
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,949
-- they were talking about it. I mean, yeah,
-- that's actually a great example too.

1027
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:04,189
Right.

1028
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:06,929
Like things like pornography or content that you

1029
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:10,020
might be considered taboo as to social norms

1030
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:14,610
and just because you don't like, it doesn't mean I don't like it

1031
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,370
or, or I think there's anything wrong with it. Even

1032
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:22,520
the current legal status of ISP web blocking is voluntary

1033
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:26,360
in the UK for this. But there are a number of I SPS doing it.

1034
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,560
-- Why would you do that voluntarily?
-- Honestly? Um, I have kids,

1035
00:43:34,939 --> 00:43:34,959
uh,

1036
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,870
you know, having

1037
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,479
I, and now to be clear before people send me hang

1038
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:42,300
up, I get that, like, blocking stuff on the internet and trying to, like,

1039
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,409
somehow sanitize it.

1040
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:45,320
So my kids only see the quote unquote good stuff.

1041
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,280
Yeah. No, I get that. That's not,

1042
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:51,000
that is a social problem that is very

1043
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,899
difficult to solve with

1044
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:54,584
technology and more to the point,

1045
00:43:54,594 --> 00:43:56,625
I don't think technology is the right answer because at

1046
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,264
some point my kids are gonna, like,

1047
00:43:58,314 --> 00:44:01,544
have a friend with an unlocked iphone that can just browse whatever.

1048
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:02,004
Right.

1049
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:03,854
So, to be clear,

1050
00:44:03,864 --> 00:44:05,745
I'm I I see this as a social problem

1051
00:44:05,754 --> 00:44:09,225
that is probably best solved through social solutions,

1052
00:44:09,235 --> 00:44:10,985
like teaching my kids good judgment.

1053
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:16,159
Um But on the flip side, it would be kind of nice. Like a great example, youtube

1054
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,800
has an app on the iphone and ipad kids, youtube

1055
00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:20,290
with

1056
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,250
somewhat sanitized content

1057
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:23,909
-- for
-- youtube.

1058
00:44:23,919 --> 00:44:26,729
Even if you're not a kid has, you can,

1059
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,929
there's certain explicit content it won't show you

1060
00:44:28,939 --> 00:44:30,570
unless you're logged in and have like the,

1061
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,459
I'm over 18 box check

1062
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:33,959
ticked or whatever.

1063
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:35,729
And on the flip side, the kids youtube,

1064
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,770
my one kid was somehow got into some videos about

1065
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,000
weapons of mass destruction and he was talking about s

1066
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,719
palma and smallpox.

1067
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,209
-- And
-- did you get a visit

1068
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:44,820
from

1069
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:46,280
the authorities?

1070
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:49,100
-- But
-- when he brought up, for example, he was trying to,

1071
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,379
he was trying to talk about um,

1072
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,209
three stage nuclear fusion fission devices,

1073
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:56,590
but he has a hard time pronouncing the word.

1074
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,320
Is this the same child you have that uh, like destroys villages in Minecraft.

1075
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,850
I'm going to get to tell people I knew you Sunday, Kurt.

1076
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,169
Yeah.

1077
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:07,639
Yeah.

1078
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:08,590
Yeah.

1079
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,989
Oh dear.

1080
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,409
But I mean that's the thing, right?

1081
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:13,209
I personally,

1082
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:15,050
I would kind of like for there to be a youtube that

1083
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,699
doesn't talk about weapons of mass destruction because at one point,

1084
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:20,909
my child was very afraid of black holes and couldn't get to sleep

1085
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,770
because he was afraid a black hole was going to destroy the earth.

1086
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:27,689
That's, it. Might, I mean, who's to say? Ok.

1087
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:31,010
Well, yeah, I get that but there's a certain sort of, you know, let's just,

1088
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:34,679
let's pretend the world is softer and fuzzier than it actually is

1089
00:45:34,689 --> 00:45:36,129
-- so that my six year old can get a good
-- night.

1090
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:37,889
It's not gonna happen tonight. Go to bed.

1091
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,689
That's what, that's that book or the f to sleep, man. Right.

1092
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,110
Yeah, pretty much. I was read by Lamar

1093
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,520
Burton, which is amazing.

1094
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:45,909
Right.

1095
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,310
And so,

1096
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:49,280
you know, on the flip side as a parent,

1097
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,500
I have looked at some of these blocking programs, but by and large,

1098
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,909
the majority of them are terrible.

1099
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:56,409
Uh, just from a technical standpoint. It's like,

1100
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,010
I mean, I,

1101
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,219
I'm actually waiting for one day for Tavis Ormandy to

1102
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:02,129
start looking at these things like he did the antivirus program

1103
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,399
-- and they're going to be an amazing train wreck.
-- It would be a train wreck

1104
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:08,449
anyway anyway.

1105
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:13,100
-- And
-- then of course, the, the content list they use are, are like bad because,

1106
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,610
you know, they're blocking like, uh, breast cancer on Wikipedia

1107
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:18,159
or, you know, prostate cancer.

1108
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,479
So, so we're kind of in the weeds here. But I think here's,

1109
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,479
I don't think there's a good answer to this.

1110
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:29,699
I mean, I like the, the, the crazy liberally. Let's, let's all be friends.

1111
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:30,840
Part of me thinks

1112
00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:35,600
that letting your ISP control anything in any way is wrong.

1113
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,330
But then there's also a part of me that says

1114
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:42,129
some of this isn't the worst thing in the world

1115
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,489
and it's really hard to draw a line and, and who, who gets to be the police,

1116
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,929
who decides what's good and what's bad.

1117
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:50,300
And

1118
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,409
I, I think what I would really like to see would be

1119
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,810
proper competition

1120
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,290
where like right now I, I have is it Charter?

1121
00:46:58,729 --> 00:47:01,389
I think it's charters, my current internet provider

1122
00:47:01,629 --> 00:47:06,830
and my options are AT&T or charter and I don't really like either.

1123
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,429
And I literally have no other options.

1124
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:12,909
The problem there you have is in Canada, for example, I have cable,

1125
00:47:12,919 --> 00:47:15,879
like I have physical cable and physical phone line coming to my house.

1126
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:17,949
So I have cable uh

1127
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,350
cable modems and Ds L as an option for

1128
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,879
uh network service currently and hopefully at some point

1129
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:25,149
in the near future fiber optics as well.

1130
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,340
However,

1131
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:29,620
um so for example, the Ds L uh

1132
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,489
tell us physically owns all the lines and infrastructure in like Edmonton

1133
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,679
and they are legally, they have to

1134
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,479
uh provide access to other parties like tech Savvy. So I actually have DS L from Tech

1135
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:41,959
Savvy

1136
00:47:42,399 --> 00:47:43,639
uh because they were

1137
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,590
quite a bit cheaper than tell us and it's a backup line.

1138
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,469
So I'm not super worried if it goes down for a day or two.

1139
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,639
So that's the other dirty secret, right?

1140
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:52,409
If like the tech Savvy stuff breaks, tell us is like, yeah,

1141
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:55,679
we'll fix it when we fix it because you're not really a customer of ours so too bad.

1142
00:47:56,479 --> 00:47:59,120
Um But the problem we have in Canada is if you look at,

1143
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,699
say the internet plans between major carriers like Shaw and tell us

1144
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,659
uh the plans are basically all identical in what they provide and what they cost.

1145
00:48:07,669 --> 00:48:09,620
And so we have what's called an Oligopoly

1146
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:13,399
where it's not a monopoly uh except

1147
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:15,600
we have multiple companies providing

1148
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:18,280
essentially the exact same product

1149
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,080
and they just happen to, for example, do a $5 price hike

1150
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,449
uh within the same month. And I

1151
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:27,760
here's the best part. Shaws

1152
00:48:28,379 --> 00:48:31,040
their, their phone support.

1153
00:48:31,439 --> 00:48:34,159
I was kind of annoyed because I'm like, why is there a $5 price increase?

1154
00:48:34,169 --> 00:48:36,560
Like, what am I getting a faster service or something?

1155
00:48:37,149 --> 00:48:38,350
Because, you know, seriously, if you're gonna,

1156
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,919
if you're like upgrading the network

1157
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:42,370
and making everything twice as fast, five bucks a month. So

1158
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,270
I must say this, I, I don't think I've told you this before, but

1159
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,080
so I,

1160
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,760
I used to be a Time Warner customer and then I think

1161
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,479
it was charter bought them and now they call themselves spectrum.

1162
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:54,750
And

1163
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,370
when that happened,

1164
00:48:56,649 --> 00:49:00,870
the amount of money I pay for the internet went down and my speeds doubled,

1165
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:05,209
which is like in the history of internet that has never happened,

1166
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,330
it will never happen again.

1167
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:08,469
Yeah.

1168
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:09,010
But anyway,

1169
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,689
Shaw's excuse officially for this $5 price

1170
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,560
increase is that they had more customers.

1171
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,929
Ok? Like they had more customers now.

1172
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:21,820
So they have to, like, totally checks out, build out their network and stuff and I,

1173
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,729
I felt like arguing.

1174
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:24,959
Like, so economically what you're saying is if you get enough customers,

1175
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:25,989
you go bankrupt because

1176
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,050
apparently

1177
00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:31,760
apparently you have some sort of reverse economy of scale for

1178
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:34,719
your network which honestly shaw being run the way it is.

1179
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:35,370
I believe.

1180
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:40,290
I, I mean, I know people that used to work for Sean, they all left because it's just,

1181
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:40,770
yeah.

1182
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,260
Um

1183
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:43,409
but yeah, I mean, so

1184
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:48,679
yeah, I it's, it's frustrating because yeah, I get it on the one hand,

1185
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,100
I don't want,

1186
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:52,870
you know, one day to be like, oh,

1187
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:55,790
I can't access Facebook because that's an extra five bucks a month.

1188
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,699
But on the flip side,

1189
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,209
you know,

1190
00:49:58,219 --> 00:49:59,909
there's a good vice documentary talking about those

1191
00:49:59,919 --> 00:50:02,570
bulletproof hoster and all the horrible stuff they host

1192
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,570
and I don't necessarily maybe want, especially if I'm a network provider.

1193
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,479
I really probably don't want that on my network or,

1194
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:13,449
you know, if there's a tax like a great example being Amazon,

1195
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,620
uh go log into your EC2 instance and go run N map

1196
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,929
and scan out to some other host

1197
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:21,659
and you

1198
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,449
basically get

1199
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:26,350
an angry email within five minutes saying like, please explain yourself. Yeah.

1200
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:27,770
Yeah.

1201
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:28,699
And

1202
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,080
I,

1203
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,050
you know, I, I guess here's what I keep thinking of is

1204
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:40,439
there are, we'll say societal norms and certain expectations

1205
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,750
and

1206
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:46,189
I don't think there's ever going to be a super good answer to any of this stuff.

1207
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:47,030
But I think

1208
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:48,350
you can't,

1209
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:52,030
you can't let these companies kind of do whatever they

1210
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,169
want because you're going to end up with crazy talent.

1211
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:55,560
Right. Right.

1212
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:56,949
But at the same time,

1213
00:50:56,959 --> 00:51:01,810
I think having it be total wild west is probably not ideal either because then you end

1214
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,989
up in situations where you've got Windows XP machines

1215
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,350
kind of ruining the internet for everyone else.

1216
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,310
Well, just like back in the day spam, you know,

1217
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,739
when spam started it was whatever and then it got to what 98% of you

1218
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,000
was.

1219
00:51:14,189 --> 00:51:14,600
Right.

1220
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:18,110
And I think now it's down to 80 or 60 or whatever,

1221
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:19,340
but more to the point,

1222
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,090
spam filters have just gotten to the point where it's

1223
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,149
not really a problem on the flip side though.

1224
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:25,850
We're spending how many tens of billions of dollars a year on anti spam.

1225
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:27,469
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

1226
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:28,310
And

1227
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:33,739
II, I guess I hate saying this and I know there's people that will probably disagree,

1228
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,030
but

1229
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,790
this is probably where having a sane regulating body

1230
00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:40,070
comes into play

1231
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,129
because you need people to be able to look at something

1232
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:43,449
going on.

1233
00:51:44,439 --> 00:51:44,459
I

1234
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,959
know that's, that's the trick, right? Is

1235
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:48,899
we, we don't know.

1236
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:49,169
I mean,

1237
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:52,790
I think honestly if you kind of look at the way things have worked up to this point,

1238
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,600
I would say it's been relatively sane.

1239
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:56,510
Right?

1240
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:57,659
And,

1241
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,350
and that's going to be the challenge going forward is

1242
00:52:01,169 --> 00:52:02,949
regardless of what happens.

1243
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:07,449
Can we continue to maintain some level of sanity? Because, and let's face it too.

1244
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:07,860
All right,

1245
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,439
if, if your cable provider one day says you have to pay $5 to access Facebook,

1246
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:16,429
like there's going to be an armed revolt in the streets, right?

1247
00:52:16,439 --> 00:52:18,110
That, that is how revolutions happen.

1248
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:22,229
Well, I, I don't think so because for example, the I SPS across Canada Jack,

1249
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,739
the rates up by five bucks a month

1250
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,120
-- but
-- not just for Facebook. You know what I mean?

1251
00:52:26,129 --> 00:52:27,310
And, and no, but just

1252
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:31,770
this kind of customer abuse, you know, it, it becomes, well,

1253
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,250
it's like any abusive relationship, right?

1254
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:37,030
You get used to the abuse and, well, you know, he, he hits me but he loves me.

1255
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,949
Right? And that's kind of, I feel that's generally speaking

1256
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:43,649
that is people's relationship with their ISP. It's like, yeah,

1257
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,659
you know, he hits me but he lets me like uses internet. So e

1258
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:48,000
you know,

1259
00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:52,290
my, my bill keeps going up and service keeps getting a little bit wonkier.

1260
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:54,850
-- But, and you know, what are you going to do?
-- Right.

1261
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:56,000
Yeah, I, I don't know.

1262
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:00,169
It's also going to get interesting in the future because I, a lot of young people

1263
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:03,129
use their phones for almost everything

1264
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,679
and now we have a whole new dynamic there because

1265
00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:09,209
you're not using a wire strung to your house,

1266
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:12,030
you're using your phone that's going over the air and

1267
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,649
like there's not a lot of cell phone providers either.

1268
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,570
But if you kind of look at all of that

1269
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:17,689
as one,

1270
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,090
we're almost reaching a point where there's going to be competition here.

1271
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,110
I don't know.

1272
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,169
I, yeah, no, again, in Canada we have an

1273
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:26,860
Oligopoly

1274
00:53:28,229 --> 00:53:31,310
because you guys have what Bell is pretty much your, you're really only have

1275
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:34,120
about four national kind of, well,

1276
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:36,219
it's complicated. But, I mean,

1277
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:40,899
yeah, like, tell us, for example, was so hated that they actually created a new brand

1278
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,080
that like piggyback anyways.

1279
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:43,860
Um

1280
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:44,429
But see,

1281
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:48,580
and part of the problem too that uh with net neutrality is on the technical side,

1282
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,649
something to remember is

1283
00:53:50,149 --> 00:53:52,120
everything is port 443 now, right?

1284
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:58,129
-- Everything is SSL TLS encrypted http
-- because our providers are adversaries

1285
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,870
-- and
-- also it's a good protocol, it works,

1286
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,370
right.

1287
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:06,760
And so now the problem becomes is, you know, you can't sort of be like, ok, well,

1288
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,889
video traffic we're gone to, you know,

1289
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:11,729
throttle a bit so that like stuff like SSH and email works.

1290
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,149
The reality is, for example,

1291
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:15,820
like video traffic is now the thing for bandwidth

1292
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,629
use and that's what people use a lot.

1293
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:18,610
And so,

1294
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:19,409
you know,

1295
00:54:19,709 --> 00:54:22,879
you can't really throttle video selectively other than to say like, ok,

1296
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:25,510
everything touching youtube or everything touching Netflix.

1297
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:27,010
Right. Right.

1298
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,189
Well, and there's been I SPS, for example, that actually on mobile,

1299
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:34,330
uh we're doing, what was it? I think they were doing TLS and SSL interception and then

1300
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:37,159
actually downgrading the video and smushing it a bit

1301
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:39,530
before sending it like over the airwaves to yourself.

1302
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,389
That is horrifying.

1303
00:54:40,399 --> 00:54:44,969
Actually, I'm a T mobile customer and they do that where if, if I use there's,

1304
00:54:44,979 --> 00:54:48,459
there's like a whole, they've got a website with a ton of video.

1305
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:50,040
It's most of them for what it's worth.

1306
00:54:50,189 --> 00:54:56,600
But basically, like when I use Netflix, they only let me use the 480 P feed to my phone.

1307
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,020
But I do not pay for any of the data

1308
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,550
that, that I'm getting from.

1309
00:55:00,709 --> 00:55:04,239
-- And
-- that's something. It's, I mean that is totally not net neutrality.

1310
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,939
I love it, man.

1311
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:07,969
I'm not gonna lie.

1312
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:08,540
I

1313
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:13,709
I get two gigs of data per month. So unless I'm on Wi Fi, I'm not watching video.

1314
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,399
And if I could watch Netflix,

1315
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:19,489
for example, on my phone for free, not consuming my data.

1316
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:22,050
That means for example, I could now watch Netflix out of the car,

1317
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:24,129
-- right?
-- It's, it's amazing

1318
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,209
-- and
-- my kids would love that

1319
00:55:25,419 --> 00:55:29,580
and, and I do so for my cell phone, I have a data plan that claims unlimited data.

1320
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,729
If you use like a ton of it, they, they throttle you and things like that. But,

1321
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:33,979
but then I have a my I,

1322
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,850
I carry around when I travel

1323
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,719
and I get like 10 gigs a month on that.

1324
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:42,770
But obviously, if you're watching Netflix, you can eat 10 gigs in a couple hours,

1325
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,270
right?

1326
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,929
But with this. I can literally watch all the Netflix I want on my laptop

1327
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:50,040
and I use zero data. Which is,

1328
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:51,770
that's sweet. Right.

1329
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,610
I mean, in fact, they're kind of screwing themselves with that deal because

1330
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,760
if it wasn't for that, I would have a more expensive data plan. Probably

1331
00:55:58,939 --> 00:55:59,929
so I could watch

1332
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,209
-- the exception
-- to the rule. Right. Most people aren't willing to pay more than five.

1333
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:07,530
Like, it's funny to me that people will gladly spend five or $6 a day on coffee.

1334
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,449
But, yeah, you, like, try to raise their internet rate by five bucks a month and they,

1335
00:56:10,899 --> 00:56:11,320
you know,

1336
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:12,360
they lose their money.

1337
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,189
I know.

1338
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,439
Anyway, it's, it's probably time to wrap this up, I guess at the end of the day,

1339
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:21,199
as much as I'd love to say, net neutrality is evil and earth crap.

1340
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:22,189
I keep screwing this up.

1341
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:24,530
Maybe

1342
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,159
you heard it

1343
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:26,520
here,

1344
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:29,610
Freudian Slip. I, I know it's a terrible idea anyway.

1345
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,800
You know, there isn't an obvious answer to any of this and I guess what it,

1346
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:36,570
what it really comes down to is we just need to keep paying attention

1347
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:38,679
and we need to understand what's going on and, like,

1348
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:40,260
this is just true of security in general.

1349
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:40,770
Right. Like,

1350
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:42,260
if you're not paying attention

1351
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,149
something bad is gonna happen

1352
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,500
and, and that's just, well, heck, that's life in general. The

1353
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:47,590
world keeps changing.

1354
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,550
It, it does and,

1355
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,530
and we have to change with it and we're trying to understand what's going on and,

1356
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,280
and I suspect the real reason we have these debates

1357
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:57,459
is because you have companies and organizations and even people

1358
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,179
that they don't like change, they don't want to see change.

1359
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:03,830
And so they're going to do things to try to keep things the way they want them to be.

1360
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:04,989
And, and let's face it.

1361
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,949
You're gonna lose at the end of the day, you might be able to slow it down a little bit,

1362
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:09,149
but you're gonna lose.

1363
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:09,550
Right.

1364
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:11,189
Change is coming.

1365
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,419
It's gonna happen,

1366
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,590
get used to it.

1367
00:57:14,959 --> 00:57:18,290
All right, cool. Well, anyway, thank you, Kurt. That was,

1368
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:22,649
you know what I came out of this being way more receptive to the

1369
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:26,030
anti net neutrality people now than I was at the beginning of today.

1370
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:26,949
So

1371
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,639
-- funny enough, it's
-- like most things, it's a,

1372
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,149
every time you have the intersection of politics, law, technology and

1373
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,830
the social side of things. Plus it's global in nature, right?

1374
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,080
Like Canada has one set of rules and we next door to the US that has a totally

1375
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:46,040
different like, and things like data caps, not data caps, net neutrality,

1376
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,020
not net neutrality.

1377
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,129
You know, you have an unlimited

1378
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,790
uh network plan for your phone uh data plan rather

1379
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:57,580
-- I get my two gigs a month.
-- I, I, yeah, I burn through two gigs in like a week. So

1380
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:01,310
-- I'm not, I mean, I
-- have to be very careful when I'm, you know, traveling this

1381
00:58:01,469 --> 00:58:05,969
-- year,
-- right? I believe it, man. Uh Anyway, anyway, so, so thank you.

1382
00:58:05,979 --> 00:58:09,250
This was an amazing conversation. Thank you, everyone for listening.

1383
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,590
You can go to open source security podcast.com

1384
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,649
and get the show notes as well as links to Twitter and Facebook.

1385
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:19,649
You can you see Pound Os S Podcast hashtag and I guess as a bit of housekeeping

1386
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:25,350
at the end as well is we've recently changed providers for the hosting the MP3 files.

1387
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:28,229
So if you're hearing this, you don't have to do anything

1388
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:31,979
but just kind of. So, you know, it's, it's not on soundcloud anymore.

1389
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:32,919
We're using something called Libin

1390
00:58:33,169 --> 00:58:34,229
now, which,

1391
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:35,709
which seems to be working well enough and

1392
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:38,149
if there's any weirdness or anything you don't

1393
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,530
like or anything you can think of that we should know about by all means,

1394
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,389
let us know and I will deal with it as quickly as possible.

1395
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:46,750
So, yeah, until next time, Kurt have a great day, man.

1396
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:48,669
You too. Thanks, folks. Bye bye.
