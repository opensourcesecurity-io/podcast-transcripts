Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 100 and

1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,119
25 which by the way is a perfect cube with myself.

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,819
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,790
-- And
-- what's a perfect cube

4
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,780
-- five to the power of three,
-- five to the power of three?

5
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:24,829
Ok. That's fair. So, five times, five times five equals 100 and 25. And, and

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:25,290
actually,

7
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:26,219
right.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,159
Does it. Yeah, I guess, I don't know. I can't do math in my head.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,079
-- If
-- it doesn't, then maybe check your computer.

10
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:35,819
I, I do have a calculator. Actually, let me look it up. So funny enough. I, uh,

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,259
I opened up, I was cleaning up my desk the other day and I found my old T I 82 calculator.

12
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,939
So I've been, I've been using it. I wrote some programs on it. Yes.

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,299
Five times, five times 5, 125.

14
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,529
Thank you. T I

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,299
it's, uh, the whole calculator industry amuses me because like this calculator,

16
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,310
you can still buy it today pretty much

17
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,119
for the same

18
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,909
price. Like it's, the new ones are just as crappy.

19
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:02,139
-- Is it
-- the T I 85 that's actually required

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,388
by pretty much all the schools in North America

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,449
or T I 82 or one of those models.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,860
82 or no. I'm sorry, I've got, let me, let me look again. I have the, this is the 82

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,980
-- and so when I
-- discontinued in 2004,

24
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,180
probably it was really, it's a long time ago,

25
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,489
but when I was in, in school they required the T I 81

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,580
and I bought the, the better one

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,860
because why not?

28
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,550
And yeah, so anyway,

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,389
oh, here we go, Texas Instruments. T I 8383 plus or T I 84.

30
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,650
So the 83 is like the new, I guess, crappy model and it probably costs what,

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,029
$200 and it has 32 K of RA M, right?

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,110
Uh

33
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,629
-- No
-- discontinued in 2004.

34
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:45,110
Ok.

35
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,309
So, so what's the current one? And how much ra M does it have? Because mine has 32 K,

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,680
the T I plus blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Discontinued

37
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,790
when not, doesn't say

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,239
I, I do know that the tis are still required

39
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:04,550
-- and, and they still cost like 100 bucks or whatever ridiculous amount,
-- right? Ok.

40
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,250
So let's see here.

41
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,740
I just typed in T I graphing calculator into

42
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,880
uh Google shop shopping or whatever they call it.

43
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,360
-- And it looks like uh T I 84 is 100 and $50
-- introduced in 2004. Still being made.

44
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,720
And like, as I understand it,

45
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:21,679
one of the biggest reasons is because you

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,020
can essentially provably clear the memory on it.

47
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:26,000
There's, there's very little way

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,080
when you do the memory, clear

49
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:31,740
uh commands, it's like what three or four buttons you mash in sequence.

50
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,960
Uh Yes.

51
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:37,669
As I understand it, there's like, absolutely no way short of like rooting the thing.

52
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,600
There's, there's,

53
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:43,574
I, I don't know. OK. So actually this has 100 and 54 kilobytes of ra M.

54
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,414
So I guess good job. T I

55
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:45,794
like

56
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:49,615
what the WTM it does come with three megabytes of RA M,

57
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,574
which is embarrassing but whatever.

58
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:52,095
And,

59
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:56,184
and I remember that where teachers would make you clear the memory and you could get.

60
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:59,654
So, so one of the advantages I had with my calculator was

61
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,910
you could, uh, like program it with,

62
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,500
with a little cable where you plug it into your computer,

63
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:09,279
then you plugged into the calculator and you could upload like assembly programs.

64
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,190
Someone figured out how to basically route the thing.

65
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,520
-- And there were, there were programs you could get that when the teacher,
-- like,

66
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,580
I doubt it has a trusted boot chain.

67
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,630
They might now,

68
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,520
but they didn't then, right?

69
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:22,850
And you could actually install an application that would like,

70
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,229
make it look like you cleared the memory even though you didn't.

71
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,710
And, and now I, I remember I never did this because it's like, I was,

72
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,570
I was always fairly good at, like, if I can use a calculator and write down,

73
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,500
I was always good at math.

74
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:34,729
So I never worried about it. But

75
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,610
I remember thinking like, that's interesting

76
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,339
because, I mean,

77
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,929
that's one of those things like teachers are

78
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,119
counting on the security of this calculator and,

79
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,850
and obviously that was not the case.

80
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,330
Well, realistically, from what I've seen, I mean,

81
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,410
in high school there were definitely kids who cheated

82
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,690
because either they managed to get grades that there's

83
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,479
no way they could have gotten that grade or.

84
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,850
Right. You know, you could see like they, they, they admitted to or they,

85
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:59,570
they both stood about, or claimed about cheating later.

86
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,809
And I'm,

87
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,350
I know when I went to school there was no honor code and I'm

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,440
guessing when you went to high school there was probably no honor code.

89
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:10,009
-- I don't know if that's a thing
-- now, not in high school. I had one in college

90
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,449
and, and it was, it was

91
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:11,820
nice.

92
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,500
I enjoyed having,

93
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,570
I think it makes sense when you're getting into more of a professional setting.

94
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,238
But, you know, at the same time, like having high school kids ride each other out.

95
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,170
Like, yeah, what, what problems could that possibly cause?

96
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,179
Exactly. Exactly. But, yeah.

97
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,329
No, it's, I, I do, I,

98
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:28,670
I really do utterly despise that whole t I series of calculators because, yeah,

99
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,170
they still cost over 100 bucks.

100
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:33,649
-- I
-- mean, let's face it, it's like $5 worth of technology. Is it even

101
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,410
$5?

102
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,549
-- Probably? I mean, the plastic case probably costs more than a chip.
-- Like,

103
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:43,160
I

104
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:45,899
think

105
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,029
you

106
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,079
buy Zylosteum order is like a shipping container's worth.

107
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,790
Well, in T I manufactures them. Right.

108
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:56,519
So they, they're probably getting them, like, for nothing.

109
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,320
They're probably using the same fab line they've been using for 20 years.

110
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,679
-- It,
-- it would not shock me at all anyways

111
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,980
in related news, I guess,

112
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:04,600
is the N PM thing this week.

113
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,730
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

114
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:10,769
So we're going to kind of call an audible on this one and, and let's talk about kind of,

115
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:10,809
I,

116
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,970
I don't want to focus on the specific N PM problem itself

117
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,359
because I think that's less interesting than some of the bigger questions about

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,709
open source security and kind of the dependencies and, and what do we do with this?

119
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,529
-- To
-- be blunt, this also affects

120
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,489
closed source security. It's just they do it behind closed doors.

121
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,869
-- It,
-- it totally does

122
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:33,790
-- and we never find
-- out. We, we have no idea. Absolutely. Absolutely.

123
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:38,690
And so let's kind of let me set the stage here so we can understand what's going on.

124
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,500
And I, I'm not going to go into specifics because I don't think they're important.

125
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,750
So

126
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,220
essentially there was an open source project hosted on github.

127
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:49,390
Somebody essentially helped out and said,

128
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,630
can I become the maintainer of this project?

129
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,709
I want to take it on

130
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,549
the author said, sure, why not?

131
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:59,579
-- They became the maintainer, they inserted a back door,
-- quick piece of context.

132
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:03,309
The original author apparently had several 100 packages he was managing.

133
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,890
So, like, it's not like this guy was lazy or something, like,

134
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:06,890
legitimately,

135
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,790
he probably could get rid of a few of these and still have a lot of work to do.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,179
Yeah.

137
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:10,899
Right. Right.

138
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,250
And, and then essentially whoever took it over, eventually kind of went rogue

139
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,250
and, and, I mean, you could even make the question, you know, ask the question.

140
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,850
Did, was it even the original kind of owner of the package who went rogue, you know,

141
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,089
with his account taken over?

142
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,160
We'll never know,

143
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:25,565
doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

144
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:29,484
Or was this whole thing a false flag narrative from the original author?

145
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:32,015
No, you're never allowed to use the word false flag.

146
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:34,065
Like never say that

147
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:37,285
what it boils down to is we don't really know who did this?

148
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:38,885
Does it really matter?

149
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:42,725
-- Not really,
-- doesn't matter, doesn't matter because here's the point is so

150
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,845
in the open source universe,

151
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,535
there are

152
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:50,154
probably millions of projects. I would, I would bet.

153
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,445
I, I think that's a safe guess at this point.

154
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,519
And so what happens is

155
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:58,220
if I'm a project maintainer, people can send me patches,

156
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,029
right. That's like how open source works. It's the whole point.

157
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,269
So I get a patch.

158
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:07,190
I, I, we call them pull requests and github right back in the day.

159
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,309
It was email or whatever, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter, it's irrelevant.

160
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,459
So, anyway, I get a pull request

161
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,839
and I might look at it and say, wow,

162
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,649
this is great and then I accept it and then I

163
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,679
might get a few more from the person and I'm like,

164
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,160
that's great.

165
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,980
I'll accept those.

166
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,790
And after like the fourth or fifth, I'm just going to say, uh

167
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,529
can I just make you a committer? Because I'm tired of approving your pull quest.

168
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,200
And like, I've done this more than once. In fact,

169
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:31,019
I have a handful of crappy projects I maintain and,

170
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,820
and this exact thing has happened to me

171
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,579
recently where it's like I'm tired of committing,

172
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,010
of, of approving your pull request.

173
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,899
I'm just going to make you a committer, right? And now, boom, this guy hasn't.

174
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,470
-- Well, and
-- this is one of the classic

175
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,040
problems in that, you know, we always talk about, oh, you know,

176
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:45,570
all code should have a code review and go through C I

177
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:49,785
and CD and blah, blah, blah. And the reality is nah, humans are lazy man.

178
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,704
Well, it's not even that they're lazy. Like when you're a guy

179
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:56,954
who's, you're not going to review everything, I mean, a large project, right?

180
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:59,904
Something like the Linux kernel or the Apache web server, whatever,

181
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:02,984
those have the manpower to do approvals and reviews.

182
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,820
But the reality is if you're like one guy

183
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,130
you're not gonna approve or review patches,

184
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,880
I would point out that despite the Linux kernel and Apache doing, like,

185
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,010
having a lot of manpower and a lot of smart people and a lot of committed people, like,

186
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,320
they still let things through that are problems.

187
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,820
Oh, totally. Right. Right.

188
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:20,380
Right.

189
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,820
And I don't mean just from a security point of view but from a point of view of like, oh,

190
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:27,260
you know, this makes the system crash or this eats data or,

191
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:27,750
you know,

192
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,630
there's been some truly horrific nonsecurity flaws

193
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,920
in software where it's kind of like,

194
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:35,578
oh yeah, don't use this version because then all your data is gone.

195
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:39,369
I'm like, what do you mean gone? They're like, there's like a file system bug.

196
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:40,669
Don't use it.

197
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:41,859
Whoops. You know,

198
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:42,859
-- sorry
-- guys.

199
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:43,979
Right. Right.

200
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,888
It happens all the time and,

201
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:49,888
and in this instance though we're focusing on a nefarious act.

202
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:50,348
Right.

203
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,088
And now like this guy, if he was smart,

204
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,289
he could have done it in a way that no one would ever see

205
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:55,960
but he wasn't.

206
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,669
And well, I shouldn't say that I, I think

207
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,070
the likelihood of being caught is, is

208
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:00,250
a,

209
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,299
well, even if you're caught, there's no consequence.

210
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,900
What the police are going to capture this guy.

211
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,650
No, no, no,

212
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:05,830
I,

213
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm ignoring the consequences for the perpetrator here because I

214
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,080
think that's irrelevant as well in this conversation because there,

215
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:12,690
we

216
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,159
probably can't find them.

217
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,380
-- Yeah. Right. I, I don't, is that even, is it illegal? I don't
-- know.

218
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,559
I'm sure somewhere it's illegal, but

219
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,609
good luck getting that jurisdiction to find prosecute or sorry, find,

220
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:28,010
build a case extradite and prosecute this person.

221
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,210
I mean, in, in all seriousness, I bet,

222
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:33,020
like in the US with the computer fraud and abuse act,

223
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,700
which is what's generally used to prosecute like hackers.

224
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,820
I, I bet

225
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,679
it would be a stretch to convict someone who did this under the C FAA.

226
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,419
I, I would be, I, I guess if they, if they were found guilty, I wouldn't be shocked.

227
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:48,950
But if they were found innocent, I would be as equally Unho

228
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,500
-- written to deal with it.
-- There's a specific law that will

229
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:56,969
actually allow you to, to prosecute under this as a criminal matter.

230
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,619
Now, as a civil matter, you could definitely pursue this person,

231
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,950
sue them into oblivion, but good luck finding them.

232
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,710
-- Right. Right.
-- So, anyway, anyway, here's the point.

233
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,109
So I've heard a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth where there's people saying,

234
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:12,229
oh N PM is such a tire fire and, you know,

235
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,179
you shouldn't use open source dependencies and you should vet all

236
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,659
your source code and there's been a million things and I guess

237
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,250
I want to break this down in a way that is practical insane

238
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:26,539
because I think the security people have done their usual light,

239
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:28,650
their hair on fire and run around like crazy

240
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,770
and that's not helpful to anybody because this is weird and this is hard and,

241
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,450
and I'm going to be quite frank here.

242
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,330
Uh, most security people probably don't know how open source works and, and

243
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,369
some do,

244
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,059
-- but a lot of them don't,
-- well, more to the point,

245
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,094
most people don't know how soft works.

246
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:47,094
Like, whenever anybody's, like, I've literally had people say to me,

247
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,815
what are you going to do for a work when all the software, like,

248
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:50,895
security flaws are fixed?

249
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:52,294
I'm kind of like, excuse me. What now?

250
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,594
-- Yeah,
-- I'll be dead before that

251
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:57,655
happens. The universe will be dead before that happens.

252
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:59,625
But fundamentally, you know,

253
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:04,335
we can't prevent people who want to make the best software possible

254
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:08,005
from making flaws and making security vulnerabilities.

255
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,455
And you expect us to somehow prevent

256
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,445
a malicious actor from doing this.

257
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,500
Now, granted it is possible in some very, you know, constrained, confined well

258
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:20,849
understood environments.

259
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:21,780
You know, for example,

260
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,419
um my understanding is like the space shuttle

261
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:25,500
software was one of those pieces where essentially it's

262
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,909
like we have all the money in the world to build this thing and we're going to,

263
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,299
you know,

264
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,429
document every line of code and what the intent was and who did it and

265
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,369
why we did it in which committee meetings were related to it and everything.

266
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,440
-- And you can absolutely
-- do airplanes,

267
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,460
airplanes,

268
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,809
airplanes work like that too,

269
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:39,849
to a degree,

270
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:40,809
except

271
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,900
for the flight control systems,

272
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,830
the really, really important stuff.

273
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,830
I I, yes,

274
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,729
because I was working with the FAA actually at

275
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,950
one point and they were very clear about this that

276
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,489
anything that like flies the plane, every line of source

277
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,280
-- needs to
-- be

278
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:55,330
done.

279
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,590
For example, the new anti

280
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,880
stall stuff in the Boeings that apparently was at fault for that crash in Malay.

281
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,239
Was it Malaysia? I want to say

282
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:03,640
that recent

283
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:05,539
Antall

284
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:07,179
Boeing crash.

285
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:11,539
Um and that was, yeah, here we go. Sorry, Indonesia, my apologies.

286
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,049
The problem here is that they added new features in the form of an anti

287
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:17,770
stall system for the, yeah, for the new 737 max

288
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,039
and apparently the pilots didn't get any training on it.

289
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,960
And so again, I'm not, I'm not gonna completely blitz,

290
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:26,830
but it's related in the sense of

291
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,039
they made changes to the software that had a

292
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,599
very real and material impact on the system.

293
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,989
Yeah, whatever run with it and, and that's kind of what happened here. Right.

294
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,229
Somebody made real and material changes to the software.

295
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,590
Um, but,

296
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:43,299
you know, could very much potentially impact you if you're using it in a certain way.

297
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:43,469
Right.

298
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:46,630
And my understanding is it only affected you if you're running one specific uh

299
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,390
uh

300
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,950
wallet or coin type, I forget what it is.

301
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,500
Uh Right. Right. It was, it was to steal

302
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:56,010
kind of CIN

303
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,559
but um,

304
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,010
but even so I'm,

305
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,070
I'm what I'm just trying to point out though is even the airline industry with all its

306
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,650
money and care and regulations still gets it wrong in the sense of, oh,

307
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,789
we added a new software feature that materially affects how the plane flies.

308
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,820
I'm sure the pilots will figure it out.

309
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,590
Right.

310
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,349
So,

311
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,309
and that's the problem

312
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,119
software.

313
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:21,530
It's not just about the, like, good or bad code,

314
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,309
but people have to know how to use this stuff correctly and safely,

315
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,530
you know, open SSL being a classic example of that. Right. How

316
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,190
open SSL reasonably well built piece of software, how many people use it wrong?

317
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,859
Basically, all of us,

318
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:34,130
all of them.

319
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,070
Right. Right. So, OK. OK. Anyway, let's, let's get back on track here.

320
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:38,960
So

321
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,270
there's

322
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,599
is open source secure. And, and how do we deal with, with this sort of problem

323
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,710
in a very open universe where anybody can contribute, anyone can deal with it.

324
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:52,869
And here's my answer that I know not everybody likes and,

325
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,429
and some people don't like at all

326
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,070
is uh we don't deal with it because this is how open source works.

327
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,419
And that's just, that's the answer I have and I wrote a blog post about this actually.

328
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:07,500
And, and here's kind of my summary of it all is in the TLDR, this is like public health,

329
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,619
we will never stop all disease.

330
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,780
Our goal is to stop epidemics.

331
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,890
And it's the same thing with like open source.

332
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,000
We're never going to stop incidents like this.

333
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,380
In fact, there's almost certainly another one happening right now.

334
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,140
But what happens is

335
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,409
somebody's going to notice it and they're going to raise the

336
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,789
red flags and it's going to get dealt with as needed,

337
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,969
which is exactly what happened this time

338
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:32,309
and, and yes, some people are, are going to have a problem and they're running this,

339
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,179
this bad code but people get sick and it's just the way it has to be.

340
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,900
There isn't a way to fix this.

341
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,539
Well,

342
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,500
fundamentally what I see it boiling down to is

343
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,020
there's a lot of software out there that,

344
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,890
uh, is sort of on that, on that part of the distribution curve where,

345
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:55,280
you know, it's not a billion downloads but it is over a million or over 100,000

346
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:58,580
-- easily.
-- This thing was like 2 million a week. Yeah,

347
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,179
exactly.

348
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,260
-- And which
-- is, that's a

349
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,340
lot, not really by current standards.

350
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:03,229
That's kind of what's amazing.

351
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:05,929
Like, I remember many years, I remember about 1015 years ago,

352
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,849
uh or not 1015 years ago, but no, this is even shorter, five years ago.

353
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,599
I think it was, uh, I forget, I think it was a ruby thing.

354
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:17,909
This, this basically this kid had literally gotten involved in ruby writing,

355
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,409
you know, helping with the documentation

356
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,260
and from there leveled up to like,

357
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,859
you know, helping with the code and stuff.

358
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,659
Uh, and sorry, not ruby but various ruby gems,

359
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,119
you know, the modules

360
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,760
and, you know, he leveled up and got competent at it.

361
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,349
So they're like, cool, like this one isn't very well maintained.

362
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,039
Uh Do you want to take ownership of it? And he's like her dip.

363
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm not smart enough to say no. So I'll say yes.

364
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,500
So this guy takes on ownership of it does a pretty good job

365
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,880
and then there's a major security flaw in it

366
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,159
and this poor guy's freaking out because he's like,

367
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,419
we've had 10 million downloads of it.

368
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,130
Somebody's going to sue my ass into the dirt.

369
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,099
And I'm like, nah, they probably won't, it'll be fine,

370
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,960
you know, we'll get this fixed

371
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,200
and this poor

372
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:52,750
guy was,

373
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:53,580
he was

374
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,590
and I'm like, no, trust me, it'll be fine. Nobody's going to sue you,

375
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,409
right?

376
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:02,059
And kind of talk to him off the ledge because he was pretty like he really wanted,

377
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,710
like, he was really worried and freaked out and like,

378
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,809
really wanted to do the right thing and protect everybody

379
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,229
and,

380
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,780
you know, with all that. Yeah, we still have security flaws.

381
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:12,440
So yeah, you introduce a malicious actor

382
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,179
but more to the point what it boils down to for me is with the open source world.

383
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,940
There's so much code out there that is

384
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,210
very

385
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:22,729
good useful code. A lot of people use it.

386
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:25,320
It, you know, it sits there churning away dates or doing, you know,

387
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,349
whatever it is that it does.

388
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:26,770
Right.

389
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,969
And you know, there's like, maybe if we're lucky one,

390
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:33,770
slightly not dead maintainer of it, like straight up, right?

391
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,289
Like, I,

392
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,880
I know of major like image libraries that

393
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,049
literally are one person working on the weekends

394
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:43,400
and these are libraries used like industry wide,

395
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,250
you know, like the time zone guy.

396
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:47,409
That is a sad story.

397
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:49,760
Everybody wants to be the cap but, ok, great.

398
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,130
Who's going to step up and actually do it?

399
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,599
Nobody's gonna step up and do it. And that's the problem.

400
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,880
And I don't think they should.

401
00:16:55,909 --> 00:17:00,840
It's, it's, it is a problem I will say in, in a certain respect,

402
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,919
but I also don't think it's a big enough problem to

403
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:08,459
necessitate any sort of drastic actions because like what happened here

404
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:10,118
where people noticed they,

405
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,390
they ra they rang the bell and then everyone came and helped out.

406
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,900
-- Like that's how it's supposed to work.
-- Well.

407
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,219
And I was going to say that's the thing though is we do have

408
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,348
sort of an emergency procedure.

409
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:24,339
We have a generic emergency procedure and open source to deal with this,

410
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,709
which is called, let's have a small panic and fix it

411
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,910
and, and we do,

412
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,469
and then like 12 hours or 24 hours later,

413
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:31,790
we've fixed it

414
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,180
and

415
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,439
just pull a new version.

416
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,150
There's nothing more we can really do. Like we fix the problem.

417
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,619
You need to go consume the fix.

418
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,349
Ok. We're, we're done for now

419
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,930
and while it's not very pretty or maybe super efficient,

420
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,890
it's, you know, it's essentially the, the,

421
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,160
the spot fires that flare up or are generally when they're seen they're put out

422
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,770
well, and, and let's face it. I mean, let's, let's think about here for a minute,

423
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:59,829
how you're going to fix this? And I've heard a multitude of,

424
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:03,359
-- of possibilities here.
-- Well, how about I propose some solutions?

425
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:04,920
And then, you know, we, you,

426
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:09,130
you let us know or we figure out why they won't or maybe why they will work.

427
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,050
So OK, let's go with the classic one

428
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:15,349
code review. Let's let's have every single piece of commit

429
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:20,640
coming in to a project properly, code reviewed before it goes into that project.

430
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,369
So essentially only good trusted code is going to make it in,

431
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:24,770
right?

432
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:25,839
So

433
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:29,849
how many, how many? Right? So

434
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,729
this one's even

435
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:34,449
so some, I guess here's the deal.

436
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,670
If you have a large project, you can do this.

437
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,160
And for example, the Linux kernel reviews every, every commit.

438
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,099
Uh I I work for elastic,

439
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:45,310
we have elastic search and that's an open

440
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,430
source project and every commit is reviewed,

441
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:48,270
right?

442
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,390
Because that's

443
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,569
we, we have the resource

444
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:51,574
to do that.

445
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:57,185
Now, if we think about a project, for example, I, I maintain a project called

446
00:18:57,474 --> 00:19:00,474
Yarn, which is a very old text based dungeon crawler game.

447
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:03,724
I am literally one person and I think there's two other committers who I

448
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:06,515
added because I was tired of approving their pr s at one point.

449
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,104
If they commit something,

450
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:12,224
I, I don't have time or care enough to view it like let's just face it, right?

451
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,489
If, if I'm one person,

452
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,729
I, I can't do that. I don't have the resources.

453
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,780
And so now we're in a position where if you think that is a,

454
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,479
something that has to be legitimately done by humans

455
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:25,510
who's going to pay for it and who's going to find the resources.

456
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:27,949
And what's interesting, I mean, to me is that

457
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,280
a lot of these large companies will do this internally and then consume

458
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,979
open source and a lot of them will basically not give any,

459
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:38,859
uh, work or resources or help back, not even bug reports.

460
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,089
Right. Right. So, OK, so that probably, OK.

461
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,050
Well, then, OK, well, let's, let's maybe move that up the chain a bit.

462
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,469
So the people who consume this

463
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,739
can do code reviews of all the code that they're consuming.

464
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,729
Why, why can't that work?

465
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,160
So how many packages are in a Linux distribution? Uh Tens of thousands,

466
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:00,589
Kubernetes

467
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:01,969
-- has
-- billions of,

468
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,160
between one and 2000 dependencies. Now, something along those lines,

469
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,819
I, I would be shocked if it's only that and,

470
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:11,800
and it's probably when you look at the system as a whole,

471
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,599
my guess is Kubernetes is probably a million lines of code

472
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,780
and that's probably a, a conservative estimate is my suspicion.

473
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,020
And so the, so here's the deal.

474
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,459
Uh if you're going to review your code, here's what you've got, you've got a human

475
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:24,939
could do it.

476
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:26,030
Humans don't scale,

477
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,130
they're really bad at it and they're going to miss a lot

478
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,829
of things because nobody can review a million lines of code.

479
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,239
Right.

480
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,229
So maybe they could grip around for a couple of things and, and whatever,

481
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,219
there are some automated tools, there are things that do like static analysis,

482
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:39,150
there's things that do like dependency analysis and,

483
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,189
and some of them are pretty good.

484
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,510
I'm not going to say they're, they're, they're all bad,

485
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,770
but the reality is the vast majority of them will produce a 13,000 page report.

486
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,920
And what do you do with that? Right. Like of those 13,000, maybe 10% are real.

487
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:53,280
Well, you run into the human scale problem. Again.

488
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:56,280
That's true because a human has to consume the report. Absolutely.

489
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,599
And so what are your options now? Right. You, you can't let humans do it.

490
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,479
We don't have the automated tools to do it.

491
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:04,040
So what I know, let, let's have the security,

492
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,770
every new package we add. Right.

493
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,349
Right.

494
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,209
And, and again,

495
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,819
we're back to who's going to pay for this because

496
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:13,969
are you going to hire 100 and 20 security?

497
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:16,109
Could you find 100 and 20 security people?

498
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,449
I was just about to say,

499
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:21,540
like the problem is you can't even by definition anybody capable of doing this kind

500
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,410
of code review and security work probably has a job and they're probably very busy.

501
00:21:26,189 --> 00:21:26,770
Right.

502
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,810
Right. Exactly. Exactly.

503
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:31,810
And so where are you going to find, even, find people ignoring the fact that,

504
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:33,680
that no one's gonna hire 100 and 20 people to do

505
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,849
it like you can't even find him if you wanted to.

506
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,689
And, and not only that this kind of work sucks.

507
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:40,099
So nobody really wants to do it, like, all the time, all day,

508
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:41,699
every day for like garbage, right?

509
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:42,650
You want to work on fun?

510
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,890
Interesting, cool things that when you find security problems in them,

511
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,479
you can make some noise and be like, look at this cool thing I did as opposed to saying,

512
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:49,959
look,

513
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:51,930
I found a security flaw in this no name N

514
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:55,170
PM package that like nobody uses and has two maintainers

515
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:58,189
and, and I'm going to send them a patch and nobody's going to care.

516
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,849
Right. Like that's

517
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:04,140
so, so anyway, we're kind of back to that whole resourcing issue here and,

518
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,979
and there isn't,

519
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:07,160
there isn't a solution to this.

520
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,000
-- You know
-- what this kind of reminds me of is

521
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,270
forest fires and that we've essentially got this technical debt,

522
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,959
this fuel load building up.

523
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:14,800
Right. We've got

524
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,050
how many tens and hundreds and billions of lines of code now in the open source world.

525
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,099
But most of it's probably reasonably ok. But,

526
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,339
you know, we're, we're probably adding

527
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,880
thousands or tens of thousands of security flaws a day across the

528
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,099
whole ecosystem just because of the amount of code being committed.

529
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,619
Right.

530
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:35,790
Right.

531
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,709
So, here, here, here's a question.

532
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,609
What do you think is the rate we're adding security flaws

533
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:43,390
as opposed to fixing them 100 to 1000 to 1?

534
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,790
I bet it's at least 100 to 1.

535
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,849
I would say it depends slightly because there are some projects like,

536
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:52,510
say open BS D where when they find a flaw, they'll try and act,

537
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,489
get rid of that entire class of law,

538
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:57,310
either through code audits or re architecting it or whatever.

539
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:57,939
But

540
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,189
ignoring,

541
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,609
ignoring them, there is statistical anomaly.

542
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,410
They're the like seven standard deviations out of normal

543
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,010
anomaly, right? They're like space aliens in disguise.

544
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,770
Uh the the the more typical like looking say at the Linux kernel, right,

545
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,849
the amount of code being added versus the number of security flaws

546
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,260
being identified.

547
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,819
And, and to be clear, also the Linux kernel, I kind of liken that they're basically a

548
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,140
bug is a bug.

549
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,479
We don't care if it's security related,

550
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:26,900
it's a bug and we need to fix it because this is a kernel and it can't

551
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,339
be like randomly trashing people's data or locking

552
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:31,270
up their video card can't have that right.

553
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,459
It might be a hospital system.

554
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,250
So I kind of like that theory.

555
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,699
The problem is then our data becomes skewed because we have no idea how many of those

556
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:41,780
flaws that they fixed are have a security impact because their take on it sort of is,

557
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,979
you know, we fixed the flaw, we made sure the flaw is fixed, you know,

558
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,770
maybe it has a security impact in some way,

559
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,140
but we're not going to bother investigating, right?

560
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,939
We just, we fixed it, we're moving along.

561
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,849
But I would suspect the rate at which security bugs

562
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,810
are knowingly being fixed is obviously probably a lot lower than

563
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:01,939
what they are actually being fixed because, you know, people rearchitect stuff,

564
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,079
they get rid of old code,

565
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,739
they refactor things cleanly, you know, and that probably

566
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:08,859
hopefully gets rid of more security flaws than it introduces.

567
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:09,619
But

568
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,119
I, I would say

569
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:15,780
I would probably say about 10 or 100 to 1 somewhere in that neighborhood.

570
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:21,630
So, uh for your, your long answer you just gave you had me thinking, I,

571
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,439
I suspect the major projects are probably 10 to 1 or less.

572
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,469
But I bet if you looked at open source or just software as a whole, I won't even,

573
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,239
I won't pick an open source in general here.

574
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,469
But

575
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,589
-- I bet if we like lumped all the software together, the Bell
-- Curves, Microsoft

576
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,130
like no straight up, right.

577
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,609
You know, like, I mean,

578
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:44,109
Microsoft has been doing a lot of good security work for a long time.

579
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:46,609
Patch. Tuesday is still a thing.

580
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:49,089
It, it's true. All right. So anyway, we're,

581
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,989
let's keep this

582
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,160
going. So what, what are some of the other ways to fix this?

583
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,329
I guess we've talked about reviewing commits, reviewing our dependencies.

584
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:59,660
00, oh, I know a classic one for you.

585
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,170
And I let's take a quote unquote, known good version of the software.

586
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,680
Freeze it in time and just back

587
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:07,250
to the fixes and updates and things that we specifically need,

588
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,750
that's so much work.

589
00:25:11,189 --> 00:25:13,910
-- I'm so glad I don't have to do this.
-- That is,

590
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,869
I know it's a horrible job like that is

591
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,660
a potential solution to this because for example,

592
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,469
if you were running an older version of this N PM package,

593
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,390
you,

594
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,709
you don't have the problem because you didn't upgrade into the bad version. Right?

595
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:30,010
But at, at the same side, it's a ton of work to do.

596
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,560
You need like huge teams dedicated to this.

597
00:25:32,689 --> 00:25:36,000
Well, and conversely now you've created the risk of

598
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:41,550
we have a frozen in time version and there are known security flaws in it

599
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,290
that we don't know about because for example,

600
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,829
the project doesn't get CV numbers or they don't do security really, they just,

601
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,310
they fix bugs and move along and

602
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,430
you know, their response to security as well,

603
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:54,430
just run current because that's the one with the most bugs fixed that we know about,

604
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,280
which I think is actually kind of a fair answer.

605
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,020
Yeah, I I would not suggest that as a solution to anybody unless again,

606
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:06,130
-- you have a massive team of people who can deal with this issue
-- or, or for example,

607
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,510
maybe you're using the software in a way

608
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,800
where that particular version of that functionality is,

609
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,170
is good enough and

610
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,780
maybe it's more of a constraint.

611
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,319
So for example, I remember looking at one piece of software,

612
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:19,689
all it did was convert dates from IO format to uh American format, which is,

613
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:20,790
what month, day, year

614
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,030
-- and that's all it did
-- the dumbest format ever.

615
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:28,180
-- And I'm guessing it
-- had, although I, I hate the European format too. Everyone use. I

616
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:28,369
o,

617
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:31,959
yeah, I agree. So, did that thing have a security flaw? Yeah, probably did.

618
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,719
But, you know, it was used in a constrained enough way where the, you know,

619
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:37,020
the dates being generated were never fed by the user.

620
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,089
It was created by the system and fed by the system.

621
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,170
So they would always be a correct iso

622
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:41,680
date.

623
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,650
-- And I was like, so,
-- so I couldn't give it a date of

624
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,130
potato. Exactly.

625
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,270
Or like 1000 years in the future,

626
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,930
1000 years in the past or that day that doesn't exist in the Julian calendar or,

627
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:52,459
you know, whatever.

628
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:52,800
Right.

629
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:55,959
And so I basically looked at this because I looked at what I did basically is I

630
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:57,739
downloaded all the dependencies and looked at when

631
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,420
the last commit was and in some cases,

632
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,750
like it was four years ago,

633
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:02,569
like, they, they haven't, you know,

634
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,569
when a piece of software is being used and it hasn't actually had an, a

635
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,489
commit or a version or anything happened in four years. It's basically dead.

636
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,290
I, I would agree with that. Yes.

637
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:14,290
Right. And if it has a security flaw, you're gonna have to fix it.

638
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,569
And in this case, I was like, yeah, whatever, fine by me, like the risk is so low,

639
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:21,390
you know, somebody can actually exploit this cool, good for them.

640
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,229
Maybe that's a problem that we can manage scale wise,

641
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:26,380
which is at least review your dependencies

642
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,650
and, and make sure you don't have anything truly unhealthy in there.

643
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,849
But again, for something, but the problem is,

644
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,390
well, if you pull in something like Kubernetes, then boom,

645
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,109
it's like one or 2000 of those things.

646
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,530
What do you do then? Right.

647
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:41,250
And, and I would argue if you're running Kubernetes,

648
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,969
don't worry about the dependencies.

649
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:44,979
Kubernetes has just worry about Kubernetes.

650
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:48,650
It's up to Kubernetes to take care of the dependencies in all seriousness.

651
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,469
-- Well,
-- and a healthy project will do that.

652
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,920
And, and maybe that's part of the solution too is,

653
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:55,390
is accepting dependency.

654
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,260
Hell and saying essentially we're going to abstract

655
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,250
it away by allowing a healthy project like Kuber

656
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:00,339
to deal with it.

657
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,219
-- That is absolutely correct
-- because realistically, what else are you going to do?

658
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,219
Let's face it, right.

659
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,780
Uh Yeah, nothing. That's what you're gonna do. You're gonna do nothing.

660
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,099
Um All right. So, so what are the other, what, what else can we do here? So you've got

661
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:16,316
source control, we've got managing dependencies.

662
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:17,926
There is back porting,

663
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:21,255
freeze it in time and back port, which none of these are good solutions.

664
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:24,505
-- I mean, let's face it. They all suck for their own reasons.
-- You could.

665
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:26,865
Well, and a related one would be you fork the software

666
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,265
which I think is the same as freezing it in time.

667
00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:29,686
Well,

668
00:28:29,956 --> 00:28:32,985
it's actually, I think it's worse. It's a combination of freezing it in time and

669
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,671
to keep all the commits because now you have to also generate all the commits.

670
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,552
That's true. Actually. That's fair.

671
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:41,462
Yeah, it's actually the worst of both worlds in a way. I'm

672
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:44,151
trying to think what else can we do? Not use it?

673
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,192
Uh, that's also, I mean,

674
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:49,312
don't laugh that that is a possibility where you could just not,

675
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:53,112
not do something if you know, it's questionable functionality

676
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:55,949
and, and that's not unreasonable at all.

677
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,969
There, there, actually, there, there is a solution but I'll,

678
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:02,079
I'll wait to save it until you, you think you're out of ideas.

679
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:03,540
Uh, well, it's not that I'm out of ideas.

680
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,380
-- I just can't think of anything realistic that
-- there's one realistic option.

681
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,270
Ok.

682
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,050
Nothing.

683
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:13,229
-- Oh, just business as usual.
-- Do nothing.

684
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,290
That is the only realistic

685
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,550
and, and I, I jest, but,

686
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:23,329
well, that's basically the fire drill option. No, no, no.

687
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:24,979
That's the fire drill option. Right.

688
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:27,540
Every time we have a forest fire we rush to put it out

689
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:31,229
and, but we don't do forest management. You know, we don't call dead trees.

690
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,869
We just put out the spot fires and,

691
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,760
and hope the fuel load doesn't get so large

692
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,839
-- that eventually the whole damn thing burns down
-- and,

693
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:37,099
and

694
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,260
that's probably a bad analogy because like there was a,

695
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,800
a terrible fire in California just now.

696
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:46,020
Yep. Same here. Which was like, super devastating. Right. That's true.

697
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,760
You guys had one in Canada. I forgot about that.

698
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,729
Well, and, and that's a direct, I mean,

699
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:52,579
and I think that's one of the fears we have is, you know,

700
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:54,869
what happens if some bad guy collects up,

701
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,310
say 1000 really good vulnerabilities and uses them to like,

702
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,170
pone everything or break everything.

703
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,199
I, I think that's definitely a possibility and, and I guess, II I say,

704
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:06,390
do nothing in half jest because I think there's some,

705
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,739
some real options here for how, how this should be managed moving forward.

706
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,089
And so here's actually what I think we should do.

707
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,130
So we're, we're pretty much out of time for this show. So why don't we cut here

708
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,229
and we'll come back with kind of like a part two talking about like,

709
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,829
well, well, let's look into the future

710
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:27,030
and say, what are the things you need to do to deal with this kind of stuff?

711
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,479
Because there actually there are some cool things going on

712
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:31,829
and I think there's some real possibilities as to where,

713
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,349
where we can go with some of this.

714
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,430
And so let's cut it here.

715
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:36,969
So you can go to open source security podcast.com, grab the,

716
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:38,939
not a lot of show notes today but whatever can use a

717
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,430
Podos podcast. Hashtag You hit us up on Twitter

718
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:45,030
and I guess, yeah, stay tuned for part two, which will come out.

719
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,430
Um Unfortunately, probably sometime after this but yes, I think,

720
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:51,569
I think there are things we can do, but it's not super simple.

721
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:54,400
-- So, all right, Kurt, have a great day. Thanks everyone for listening.
-- You too.

722
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,170
Thanks everybody.
