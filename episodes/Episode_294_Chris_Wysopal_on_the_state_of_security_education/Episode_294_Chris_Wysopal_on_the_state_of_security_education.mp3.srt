Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,270
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,020
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,770
Today we have a guest. I'm super excited. We've got Chris Weisel,

4
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:19,180
the founder and CTO at Verrico. Chris, welcome to the show.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,760
Hi, Josh. Hi, Kurt. Thanks for having me on.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:28,489
-- We
-- are ecstatic. I'll guess so. This is going to be a show about security education.

7
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:32,290
So if you're here for old stories, go, go find another podcast. But

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,729
I, I think why do

9
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:38,337
you give us kind of the, the 12th? Who are you? And how did we get here?

10
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:42,516
Because given education is a topic, there are going to be people who listen,

11
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,777
who don't know who you are.

12
00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:51,146
Sure. So, um, you know, I've been doing computer security stuff for over 20 years.

13
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,516
I started in the mid nineties

14
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:57,657
doing vulnerability research before we even called it vulnerability research.

15
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,486
We called it hacking software.

16
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:02,196
And that was confusing when you said I hacked a micro

17
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,124
soft product.

18
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:08,263
But then I, you know, switched into a more professional role at,

19
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:13,174
at stake as a security consultant and consulted for a lot of security vendors

20
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:15,333
and then in 2006, I,

21
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:17,424
I founded a

22
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:20,143
uh application security company.

23
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:24,174
That's a SAS company that does security testing for people building software.

24
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:25,774
Awesome. Awesome, cool.

25
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:27,893
So you're here to talk about security

26
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:30,253
education and this is Security Awareness Month,

27
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:31,611
which is convenient.

28
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:32,861
So I guess

29
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:38,011
let's, let's set the stage, tell us your thoughts and what you think

30
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:40,291
-- we should know about this topic.
-- Well,

31
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:44,611
you know, my focus is, is developers because I think, you know,

32
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,611
developers have a huge role to play

33
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,130
in making the world secure security people

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,250
and end users certainly need to understand

35
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:59,291
uh how to make the world secure and have secure practices and behaviors.

36
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:02,870
But for me, developers are the most important because

37
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,860
they're building the technology itself and the decisions they make,

38
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,990
whether it's the way they code something or their design or their user interface,

39
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,470
those things make a big difference in how secure the, the the world is.

40
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:17,809
So I,

41
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,910
I think security awareness and security training needs

42
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,020
to be done to basically to everybody.

43
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:28,500
You know, I talked to my mother about this like on a weekly basis, right?

44
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,589
But I talked to developers about it constantly too.

45
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:35,589
It's something that everyone needs it and it should be focused on, you know,

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,320
-- sort of the way that you interact with technology,
-- not to be a devil's advocate.

47
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,630
But my one thought is we've been trying to teach developers to code more better,

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,190
you know, since ever. And

49
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,860
I, I'm not sure that it's working

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,330
and I can't help but wonder if, like,

51
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:53,240
automation and tooling is maybe a better answer than education.

52
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:55,339
Well, I think we need both. Right.

53
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,899
I, I think, you know, we, we talk about, you know, shifting left,

54
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,539
right when we talk about securing software.

55
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,550
So don't like,

56
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,940
put, put wrappers around it.

57
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,460
You know, we did the old way we did, it was, we tried to wrap the vulnerable software

58
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,199
when it was in production like, right, network security

59
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,250
WFS and,

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,580
and that type of thing to try to protect the vulnerable software.

61
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:21,199
And, you know, over time, we've realized that,

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,539
you know, there's big limitations to that so that the next best thing was like,

63
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,979
all right, well, let's at least get rid of the egregious vulnerabilities and,

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,580
you know, do manual pen testing or do a security scan

65
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,679
and, and get rid of the worst of the worst right before we go into production

66
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,250
and, you know, that doesn't work anymore

67
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,229
because, you know, software just moves too fast, you know,

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,380
going into production means every day.

69
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,350
So, you know,

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,820
the the whole thing about shifting left

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,809
is find the vulnerabilities earlier and earlier.

72
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,270
And one of the benefits of that is if you get to

73
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,229
um the actual, you know,

74
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:03,949
interaction with the developer as they're building the application,

75
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,720
you can start to get that learning experience to be part of their part of their job. I

76
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,000
think we've all become better spellers because

77
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:12,910
of spell checkers and to some degree,

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,410
better writers because of grammar checkers.

79
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,428
No one likes to give someone's uh a document full of squiggly lines.

80
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,290
It's like you just feel like I need to fix some things.

81
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,059
I'm old enough to remember when you spell, check the document at the end

82
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,019
before you sent it out.

83
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,489
And then you're like, oh my God,

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,890
I got to go through all these things and fix all this stuff.

85
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,399
I'm just, you know, it's not that important

86
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,380
but if you see that as you're typing, you actually, that, that quick feedback loop

87
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:44,649
actually gets you to, uh, actually learn how to spell something and, and of course,

88
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,640
when it fix, fixes the wrong spelling of their, you know, I, er,

89
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,269
to eir that's even better like auto fixing.

90
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,239
That's the best way.

91
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:53,059
But

92
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:53,730
I

93
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,470
think that those quick feedback loops is

94
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,200
something that's new for developer education,

95
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,489
like showing them

96
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,809
they're writing vulnerable code as they're writing it.

97
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,529
So I, I don't think we're done trying to

98
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:10,339
educate developers. I'm not ready, I'm not ready to give up yet.

99
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,160
That, that's very fair because

100
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,380
I don't think, I mean, spell check.

101
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,779
I've never thought of it in this context and you've got my brain

102
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,480
moving at about a million miles an hour now. But, but you're absolutely right.

103
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,029
We have spell check.

104
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:30,260
We're never gonna not teach people how to spell and write and do English

105
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:31,420
and

106
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,380
all this tooling we have in development, I think is similar

107
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,160
in that vein. I mean, this is,

108
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,929
I like this, this makes a lot of sense to me.

109
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:43,869
So I think basically every, every study I've seen around, you know,

110
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,549
criminality or training, you know,

111
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:50,100
getting Children to behave or getting dogs to behave, boils down to

112
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,350
the, the feedback needs to be as soon as possible. Right.

113
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:56,420
Like you, you can't have somebody or a dog do something bad and then

114
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:59,070
like, and then punish them a month later for it,

115
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,730
right? Because they're not going to have any idea what you're talking about.

116
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,220
And I can't help but wonder if that's maybe part of the problem is, you know,

117
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,779
developer writes a bunch of code

118
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,140
and then a week or a month later,

119
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,459
you know, the sort of the security issue pops up and I mean,

120
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,910
do they even remember what they wrote?

121
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,859
Like, I, I certainly don't remember code I wrote a week or a month ago.

122
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,130
No, there's no learning experience there and it's even worse than that because

123
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,160
uh a lot of times when you find something, a month later,

124
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,609
you have some other developer fix the problem.

125
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,279
Uh So there's not even an opportunity for the person who originally wrote the code

126
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,140
to, to, to learn from that um situation. So,

127
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:41,153
you know, getting the feedback uh as, as close to the create code creation process

128
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:44,882
is, is important and you know this, this isn't just the way that, you know,

129
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,233
security is done.

130
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:50,363
Like you don't want to find out that you have a syntax error,

131
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:52,893
you know, when you're compiling the code, right?

132
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:56,303
Like if it can give you that squiggly line as you're typing the code,

133
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,572
that's even better, right?

134
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,072
So like even things like syntax error

135
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:04,746
and other basic code quality issues, we've built into the ID E,

136
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:07,175
we've built into the developer experience

137
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:07,876
and

138
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:10,686
and and and security really kind of needs to be

139
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,365
the the same way and also like test driven development,

140
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:13,615
right?

141
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:16,686
It's like you write some code, you run the unit test,

142
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:18,436
if it passes you ship to production.

143
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:21,415
Well, that unit test should have a security test in it too

144
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,880
because you can't always find everything,

145
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,149
you know, it's, it's not always available in one line of code.

146
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,250
Maybe it's the way it interacts with some code

147
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,700
that you wrote last week that's in another module.

148
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,100
You still want to find out about that as soon as possible.

149
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:39,359
So to me, it's just finding out about that as soon as possible, we'll get these

150
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:43,299
official, you know, feedback loops uh ha happening.

151
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,779
-- So
-- now I want to bring this conversation kind of back to the

152
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,200
whole education piece because we're talking

153
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:52,630
about tooling and feedback while developing,

154
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,670
but you have to learn before you can develop. So where do we kind of

155
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,869
think about drawing that line between

156
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:01,540
what is a kind of a fundamental, you need to know about, you know,

157
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:04,559
developing in security and, and pick a topic versus

158
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:05,690
what is the,

159
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,369
you just, you're good enough,

160
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,850
the tool will help you fix it. You know what I mean?

161
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,250
Yeah.

162
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,089
I mean, I, I think that you need to go back further, right,

163
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,880
during the education process.

164
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,559
I mean, we all get trained around certain things

165
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,489
before we're actually doing the,

166
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,279
doing the thing and while you're doing the thing you want, that

167
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,529
you want that good feedback. Um

168
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,390
but you want, you also, you, you, you need to be trained in something first, right?

169
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,419
Just to have the basic foundational. So you just even understand

170
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,320
what's happened.

171
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,659
Like we, we, we,

172
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,739
we kind of understand basic spelling rules and basic

173
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,510
English before we're presented with the spell checker,

174
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,849
right?

175
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:52,750
So I think there needs to be a big push to move education of security in, into the,

176
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,650
you know, the college or the, you know,

177
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,989
the code camps or wherever people are learning how to code

178
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:04,159
that, that they need to get the basics there. They need to basically understand

179
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,349
the basics of, you know, how an application can be at risk to something like,

180
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,039
you know, SQL injection or,

181
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:15,229
or command injection or things like that because those concepts just,

182
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,179
you know, they, they're pretty specific, right? Like you,

183
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:18,929
you, you,

184
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,320
you need to have a basic understanding of how input flows through the system

185
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,880
and how an attacker can manipulate and control the system.

186
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,719
So I think training modules around secure coding and application security

187
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:36,820
principles need to be part of the standard curriculum for,

188
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,780
for, for developers.

189
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,390
And the, and the crazy thing is

190
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,119
we talk a lot about cybersecurity and education, you know,

191
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,950
colleges have cybersecurity programs,

192
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,349
but all that's doing is training cybersecurity professionals to to,

193
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:55,380
to try to protect from all the problems that the developers are creating.

194
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,349
So, so that's all,

195
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,460
that's all well and good because there's a lot of legacy code out there.

196
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,739
But as soon as that new developer comes fresh out of boot

197
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,849
camp or fresh out of college and starts writing new code,

198
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,510
um you're, you're exacerbating the problem. It isn't happening in many places.

199
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,190
I, I know a professor at Tufts University who offers a course on this and it's, it,

200
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,989
it's still an elective, right?

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,099
It's still an elective.

202
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:22,989
Like if you're in a computer science program, you can elect to learn about

203
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,590
security. Most colleges don't even,

204
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,039
don't even offer that in their computer science program.

205
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:33,190
So to, to me that, that, that's a huge missing piece of the puzzle.

206
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,630
I wanna grab on that for a second because I never explicitly thought of that before.

207
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:36,900
Like I,

208
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,070
I know some engineers like physical engineers with

209
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,719
their Iron Pinky Ring here in Canada,

210
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:43,969
a big part of what they do is try and build stuff that doesn't kill people,

211
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:44,570
right?

212
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,590
It's that simple that's,

213
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:48,880
that's like literally what the iron pinky ring represents is they built this bridge

214
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,229
and the bridge fell down a bit and killed a bunch of people.

215
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,919
And so they're like, let's not do that.

216
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,599
You're right. Like, in software, essentially building software fast. Good. Yes.

217
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:01,880
But building software secure is, is literally, like you said, it's an elective.

218
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,130
It's a, it's a,

219
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:06,559
it's not even a nice to have in some cases. It's like here's an option

220
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,700
that you could choose to take.

221
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,799
We're not even going to encourage it that heavily.

222
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,179
Yeah, I, I mean, I went to,

223
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,960
I went to an engineering school and I took computer systems engineering.

224
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:17,349
So I

225
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,179
certainly learned a lot about how computers work,

226
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:24,239
but I also had to take sort of those foundational

227
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,340
classes in mechanical engineering

228
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,659
and things like that.

229
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:30,690
Um As you do when you get an engineering degree and,

230
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,789
and in one of the mechanical engineering classes,

231
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,909
um I think it was called lumped parameter systems or something

232
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,030
of that where you learn about springs and things that bend.

233
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:42,969
And one of the video they showed a video

234
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,969
in the class of the Tacoma Narrow bridge incident.

235
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,989
And the Tacoma

236
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,919
narrows bridge is a famous uh bridge that basically

237
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:54,820
wind from a particular direction at a particular velocity.

238
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:59,059
Made the made the bridge go into this oscillation mode where it started

239
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,020
going up and down and up and down and eventually the bridge fell down

240
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,309
just from the wind

241
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,419
and, you know,

242
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:11,020
basically that's learning from a failure and now everyone who basically designs,

243
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,109
you know, mechanical structures

244
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,409
knows about that because they learned about it in college and, and,

245
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:20,489
and understands about oscillations and things like that

246
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,270
and, and plans for it.

247
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:27,085
Right. And it's like, what's the equivalent for, for, for computer science?

248
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,354
Like mechanical engineers are learning about this,

249
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,585
the failure modes of what they do.

250
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:33,804
But we don't do that in computer science.

251
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:38,505
It's like we're all just have happy, you know, happy ears on and everything's rosy.

252
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,385
This is, I've had this discussion more times than I can count now.

253
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,034
And I've gone in circles and circles and circles and I think that

254
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,625
the thing I always come back to when we talk about this is

255
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,200
the vast majority of regulation

256
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,710
in,

257
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,630
we'll say mechanical engineering and

258
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,429
civil engineering and electrical engineering.

259
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:59,630
Those regulations were written in blood. It's just the sad reality of it.

260
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,830
And I think in the world of computing,

261
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:06,090
I feel like we are standing on this precipice saying if we don't do something,

262
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,030
we're going to have regulations written in blood

263
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,200
yet it is a struggle

264
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:11,979
to get anyone to listen to us.

265
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:17,169
-- Sometimes I feel like it's
-- a good point because blood is, is very, is very visceral.

266
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:21,760
Um But where, where computers uh control things that,

267
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,559
that, that could cause

268
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,479
um

269
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,539
you know, people to die.

270
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:32,539
Um like the computers that are running in a you know, a 787 for instance, or,

271
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:38,859
um, I'm not sure what the, the, the, the, the plane that crashed, the, the 737 max.

272
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,400
Yep. Yep.

273
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,659
You know, there's, there's a lot of testing that, that happens

274
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,299
to make sure that the software controls are doing the right right thing.

275
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,130
Like there's a completely different level of

276
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,200
testing that happens in aeronautics systems.

277
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:51,539
Right,

278
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,659
as there should be. Right. And so,

279
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,859
but that also means that there's a long certification process

280
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,750
and you know, look, look at all the 737 maxes that are grounded,

281
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,380
we got billions of dollars of aircraft that,

282
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,369
that can't go anywhere until something is, is, is fixed.

283
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,700
So

284
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,559
that's,

285
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,940
you know, that's the, that's, that's one extreme, right?

286
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,380
And, and we actually have that now, but the solution is this, you know,

287
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,130
sort of extreme regulatory and testing testing process

288
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,030
and there's just no way that is going to

289
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:25,070
work for your sort of general purpose software.

290
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,744
But the problem is general purpose software is being,

291
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:30,494
is getting pretty close to being used in

292
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:32,905
those same situations where people could die.

293
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:34,125
Right. Yeah.

294
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:39,465
Yeah, people are using like browsers and cloud technology to, you know,

295
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:40,905
to administer,

296
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:45,375
you know, sensitive equipment that has like life changing decisions behind it.

297
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,809
So that's, that's the problem is like the,

298
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,849
the solution we have now for aeronautics isn't going to work,

299
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,710
but we're getting very close to using general purpose

300
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:57,309
computing and cloud computing and regular operating systems in

301
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,349
critical places. So,

302
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,530
um, we,

303
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,270
we need a different solution and, you know, part of that is gonna be education,

304
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,159
but I don't, I don't think, I don't have the answer for that.

305
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:10,570
-- It's a little scary.
-- I was just gonna ask you for the answer. So

306
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,169
that's unfortunate.

307
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,770
Well, you know, I certainly education in, in, you know, in,

308
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,289
in school schools and education on the job is,

309
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,750
is something that every engineer that is touching things that,

310
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,590
that, uh, is, is gonna go into,

311
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,770
you know, a system that, you know, where life or limb is, is, is a problem.

312
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,080
And, you know, I think that probably the closest place we have that right now

313
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,185
is, is, is, is cars, right? Because cars are

314
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:41,075
not as regulated from this standpoint

315
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:45,736
as an airplane, like the FAA pretty quickly realized like, oh, wow,

316
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,385
there's software controlling an airplane.

317
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:48,185
We got to do that.

318
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,335
But that same scrutiny isn't,

319
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:52,325
isn't, isn't on cars.

320
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,866
And, you know, I, I have a Tesla and, you know,

321
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,752
I get an over the air update like every few weeks.

322
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,211
So I know

323
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:03,651
that the same scrutiny isn't happening to that code that's happening to, you know,

324
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,101
the 787 Dreamliner.

325
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:06,002
Every time, you know,

326
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,531
every time they do a self flying airplane there's a big news

327
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,812
article about it because it's such a special and rare thing.

328
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:13,901
And then in the self-driving car world, you know, we find out that, uh, what is it,

329
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:16,541
Waymo, for example, has a bunch of cars getting lost in a,

330
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:18,401
in a dead end in San Francisco.

331
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:19,909
And,

332
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:20,979
you know,

333
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,359
they're talking about testing self driving cars where I live

334
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:26,950
in Edmonton because we have like really long snowy winters,

335
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:29,859
you know, reliably every year for six months of the year.

336
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:32,780
And I don't remember consenting to, you know,

337
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,919
being part of a self driving car test.

338
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,719
-- I
-- mean, that, that, that's an obviously a very, a

339
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:41,530
very challenging engineering engineering problem which

340
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:42,830
I think will eventually be solved,

341
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,979
but it's gonna take a really a

342
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,340
really a really long time.

343
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:50,020
Um And so sometimes it does scare me a little bit to,

344
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,460
to think about how much software is running in the car, I'm driving.

345
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:54,599
Um

346
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,710
And so far, you know, Tesla has done a de

347
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,340
has done a decent job

348
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:01,260
so far, but, you know, this is, this is gonna be everywhere,

349
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,599
it's gonna be in every car.

350
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,368
Um It's going, it's going to be in, you know, every, every factory,

351
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,219
every critical infrastructure

352
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,880
um is, is,

353
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,520
is going to have more general purpose software

354
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,579
in it because it allows improvements to,

355
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,770
to happen at a, at a, at a quicker pace.

356
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,689
So then is maybe one possibility that we'll see sort of,

357
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,890
especially from the open source world, that sort of best of breed software

358
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,089
that everybody just sort of agrees to use.

359
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,989
Well, you know, I think over the,

360
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,849
over the long period of time standardizing on certain open source is,

361
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:37,180
is beneficial, then, then a lot of, you know, focus

362
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,949
in of the community can go into securing,

363
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,790
you know, a few, a few pieces of software

364
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,310
that everyone kind of agrees are, you know, important pieces of software.

365
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,189
I mean, there's a lot of efforts go going, going into that right now.

366
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,099
Um

367
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:56,310
And, you know, things are getting more components.

368
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,140
So there is the, there is the opportunity

369
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,550
to, to, to, to do that, to have more, you know, sort of more reliable parts

370
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,239
that, that people are,

371
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,569
people are putting together and open source seems the way the way to

372
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:13,109
go there because of the visibility and the idea that anyone can,

373
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,020
can do the security testing on it,

374
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:15,810
right?

375
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,119
I feel like we've covered a lot of ground here and

376
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,400
there's two pieces to this. I think

377
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,920
that we keep coming back to is there is

378
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,609
the education aspect of we'll say new developers,

379
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:33,790
be it schooling or self taught or however, because I mean,

380
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,729
let's face it like we're all pretty old here.

381
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,829
None of us went to school to learn how to write code, right?

382
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:42,199
Like it's something we did on our own and, and that's not always the case anymore,

383
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,780
but then there's also the I think continued

384
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,069
learning aspect of once you exit university,

385
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:49,640
now you're in

386
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,560
the real world will say. And I mean, this is something like VIC

387
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:57,099
code obviously does where you have your tooling and you work with organizations to

388
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:59,099
help them write better software. And

389
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,099
I'm curious what your thoughts are on.

390
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,250
So,

391
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,939
should we have more expectation on?

392
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,260
I, I guess more stringent

393
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:10,979
education from, say,

394
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,859
like the university or online classes or

395
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:16,719
whatever versus should we have more stringent expectations

396
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,459
once you enter the workforce, let's say, as a developer

397
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,040
or maybe both?

398
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:25,949
Yeah. So I, I think it should be both but I, I, you know,

399
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,239
you, you're gonna have to educate people who didn't get educated in school no,

400
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,469
no matter what.

401
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:34,280
Um And there's always gonna be people who,

402
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,280
you know, are sort of self taught.

403
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:40,040
Um So they didn't, they didn't get that education in school.

404
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,079
So I, I do, I do think you need, you need both.

405
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,880
Um I, I would love it if the, you know,

406
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,359
the academic community would make this a requirement

407
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:52,689
of becoming AAA computer science graduate just like,

408
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,479
you know,

409
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,189
learning data structures is a requirement of being a computer science

410
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,939
graduate or learning how operating systems work.

411
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:00,790
So

412
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:03,630
I, I think, I think you really, you really need both.

413
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,069
And so, you know, the corporate environment

414
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:11,189
um you can have these feedback loops during, during the development process.

415
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:16,469
But I think the best way to, to educate, you know, take a break from, you know,

416
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:21,410
coding and take a class in something which, you know, developers do do that you know,

417
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,920
they,

418
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:26,239
they, they learn about, you know, Kubernetes or they, they, they learn about,

419
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,109
you know, server list, they, they do this

420
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,819
all the time. You know, it developers are constantly learning new technology.

421
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,650
They're just not learning how to secure that new technology, right?

422
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,359
So like every new technology is another opportunity

423
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,369
for, for, you know,

424
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,010
uh design and implementation weaknesses that then Attackers will exploit.

425
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,089
So, you know, it'd be nice if every time you learned a new technology,

426
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,859
you learned about the issues associated with that.

427
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:54,339
Like, so a class on, you know,

428
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:59,099
containers would talk about how you really kind of wanna know what's in

429
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:02,680
that container you're pulling from the repo that you're adding code to?

430
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:03,810
Like, is there

431
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,349
an old vulnerable library in there?

432
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,349
Like that's something you should know about, you know, I,

433
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,630
I think it can go hand in hand with,

434
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,910
with how the developers learn about new technology

435
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,449
because you don't learn about that in school,

436
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:15,579
right?

437
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:17,579
You don't, you, you typically don't learn about, you know,

438
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:19,709
Kubernetes or anyone who went to,

439
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,390
you know, comp I class more than five years ago didn't,

440
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,430
certainly didn't learn about it.

441
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:27,939
So, I it's got to be part of that continuous education process

442
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,560
again.

443
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:31,040
I, I think that's actually just sort of easier to take,

444
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,719
like instead of taking time out and saying, all right.

445
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:37,479
Well, we're gonna take like several days to learn about how to build secure,

446
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,180
you know, cloud native software,

447
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,319
it's as you learn about each new capability that,

448
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,359
that cloud native environment gives you,

449
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:44,760
you

450
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,415
also,

451
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:48,694
you know, learn about the risks um as that's happening.

452
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,285
The one thing I, I keep thinking about,

453
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:52,025
especially with continuous education is like,

454
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:54,494
everything I know is basically out of date by Monday.

455
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:54,915
Right.

456
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:55,915
Right.

457
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:59,694
Like I love that every time I log into Amazon web services, I'm like,

458
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:01,724
what is this new button or where's the button?

459
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,935
I want gone off to? Right.

460
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:05,094
No, totally.

461
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:05,864
And

462
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,420
but part of the challenge is, you know, where,

463
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,260
how do you get people to,

464
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:15,300
to, to resource and give that time to the developers?

465
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,900
That's a huge challenge, right? That's, that's where management has to come in

466
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,939
and work on this, you know, risk versus reward trade off

467
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:30,900
and realize that educating, educating the developers that are, that are building,

468
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:32,540
you know, your systems

469
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:38,239
is actually a very cost effective way of, you know, not having a, you know,

470
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,599
impact from a, from a data breach

471
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:41,880
rather than, you know,

472
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,819
having a huge security team and buying all these security products

473
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,839
that you're just layering on

474
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,040
hoping that, you know, the vulnerabilities can never get, you know,

475
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,760
never get exploited and you can,

476
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,439
it's cost effective to actually educate your, your developers.

477
00:22:57,449 --> 00:23:00,199
And this is something that just management, you know, has to,

478
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:02,000
you know, has to understand,

479
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,770
maybe maybe we're not doing a good enough job of, of explaining that

480
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:11,540
because we have no data and we have no metrics and you know, this is, it, it, it, it's,

481
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,900
it's a hard problem, right?

482
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,689
It's a hard problem. And so

483
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,689
uh I think that people in sort of the, the,

484
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:21,770
the software security builder world have to

485
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,130
have to get better at, at, at, at demonstrating

486
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,050
that it is actually worth

487
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:31,130
spending some developer time there rather than having them keep, you know,

488
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,109
pushing faster and faster vulnerable code.

489
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,630
This rings,

490
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,050
I think with everyone, everyone understands this.

491
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,229
But the thing I just realized is you mentioned about

492
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,310
management needs to have a buy in here. But

493
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,670
let's say

494
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:48,709
you had leadership come to you tomorrow and

495
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:52,839
say here's $10 million educate the developers.

496
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,979
What now?

497
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,109
So that's,

498
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,689
that's a good question because um I don't know the Kubernetes

499
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:03,880
course that they can take that has the built in security.

500
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,270
They have to take a separate course in, in, in that, right?

501
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,050
They have to take like a separate cloud computing. So

502
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:12,770
the the the ideal world certainly doesn't exist.

503
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:16,989
Um One of the things that uh we found um at, at, at VIC

504
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:24,050
code is giving developers more interesting and interactive. Um and labs

505
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:25,531
based training

506
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:29,251
is something that engages them more, right?

507
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,891
It's not like if you if you give them

508
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:33,442
an elearning class where they're just sort of click,

509
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:34,932
click, click through and

510
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:39,401
you know, it's a video and it's a question, it almost becomes a game,

511
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:43,322
like how quickly can I get through this with as little attention as possible

512
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:45,332
and, and, and, and, you know, can I just, like,

513
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:48,371
skip fast forward and try to take the questions and see if I can answer it.

514
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,962
You know, we, we've all done this with compliance videos before

515
00:24:52,264 --> 00:24:53,343
you do that.

516
00:24:53,904 --> 00:24:54,693
I don't.

517
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:55,134
Um,

518
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:56,083
uh,

519
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:56,843
so,

520
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:58,083
so yeah, so,

521
00:24:58,303 --> 00:25:00,973
uh, you know, I think a lot of, a lot of

522
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:04,723
that, that's not the best model, like it has some benefit,

523
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:06,644
but it's not the best but a lab based

524
00:25:06,654 --> 00:25:10,413
model where you actually put someone in a virtual environment

525
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:12,293
and they can actually

526
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:14,443
attack an application,

527
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:17,803
you, you show them how to attack it and then they actually do,

528
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:19,354
like you give them tooling

529
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:20,053
to actually

530
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:25,296
try that SQL injection payload and see what happens and learn

531
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:26,895
actually how to attack.

532
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:29,375
That's kind of cool, right? Like that's interesting.

533
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:33,875
Like everyone, everyone would love to understand like, hey, you know,

534
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:38,265
I see a form field here, let me see if it, if it's vulnerable and if it is,

535
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:40,796
let me see what data I can access, right?

536
00:25:40,826 --> 00:25:44,115
That engages like the black hat brain, which is pretty, pretty,

537
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,235
pretty interesting, right?

538
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:48,056
And that, that's the fun side of computer security, right?

539
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,880
Um And, and so

540
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:53,880
getting developer that can help engage developers like and, and,

541
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,579
and light bulbs can go on.

542
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:58,140
It's like, oh my God, I didn't realize this was so easy,

543
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,239
like one coding error makes it so I can just do this

544
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,609
so that engages the awareness of how serious these things are.

545
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:06,079
Like,

546
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:08,959
I, I maybe I should actually listen to those security guys.

547
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:11,719
Maybe they actually do know something. They're not just annoying.

548
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:12,640
Um

549
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:13,849
-- Yeah, they're
-- still annoying,

550
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:18,160
-- annoying and know things.
-- So hopefully that

551
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,229
type of lab can engage that,

552
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:25,209
that part. But then of course you want to say like, well, now let's look at the code

553
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:29,469
and let's look what was wrong in the code in sort of uh you know,

554
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,050
an editor where you can, you can actually, you know,

555
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,510
use real developer tools to look at the code

556
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:38,089
and then let's try to fix that code and then let's attack

557
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:41,930
it and see what happens in that sort of developer loop of,

558
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:46,619
you know, try to run the unit test, look in the debugger at your breakpoint,

559
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,040
understand what's happening.

560
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,150
And I, I think that's the thing that's been really missing

561
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:57,119
with developer education is to make it so that it, it just comes to life as, you know,

562
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,219
part of the way they do their job.

563
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:01,339
So, and I feel stupid for us on this. But

564
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,319
I'm thinking to all these companies that complain, we can't hire developers,

565
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:06,250
hiring developers is hard, they're not available.

566
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,250
But thinking about this, I've never seen a company advertise as part of their

567
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,890
sort of hiring practices that, you know, here's the salary band

568
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:14,770
and

569
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,770
we commit, say five or 10 hours a week to your furthering education. Which,

570
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:22,839
like, that's where I'd want to work. Right. Is a place where we're gonna help you keep

571
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,650
training and getting better at this. And I've,

572
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,290
now that I think about this, I've never seen that advertised.

573
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,400
-- Yeah.
-- I don't know if that's advertised. Certainly.

574
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,939
Developers ask for it once they're in the job.

575
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:36,469
They're, they're like, well, I, I want training, like, can I have training?

576
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:39,239
And of course, if you don't give them any training, they'll,

577
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,329
they'll eventually leave.

578
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,449
Um So I don't know if it, if it, if it needs to be

579
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,930
in, in, in the application, but

580
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,150
they don't want training around security though. That's the thing.

581
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,719
They don't want, they, until they get it, they,

582
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:54,599
they don't really understand the value of it

583
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:56,719
and then after they understand the value,

584
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:58,469
then they, then they get it.

585
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:01,819
So that, that's part of the, you know, the chicken and the egg egg problem.

586
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,719
Like I, I've talked to developers that have had

587
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,130
the, you know, they've gone through a lab, they've gone through a lab training,

588
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,250
something that's gamified where they were pitted against the, you know,

589
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,599
their teammates and they won because they, they solve the most challenges.

590
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:18,719
Uh They fix the most code or they attack the most code

591
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,959
and um they, they feel good about themselves and they,

592
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,839
they have a totally different perspective on this.

593
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,270
So they're like, yeah, the training was great.

594
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,589
Um, but they don't know that until enough of their peers

595
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:30,439
have done it.

596
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:33,890
I mean, we have, it's almost like it's a bootstrapping problem we have now, right?

597
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,069
Like there's just not enough critical mass

598
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,530
that there's awareness yet.

599
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:38,119
Yeah,

600
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,609
man, that's a lot. That's a lot to think about. All right, Chris. So we're,

601
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,810
we're nearing the end

602
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,430
and

603
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:49,229
I have a very unique opportunity for you here

604
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,280
during cybersecurity awareness month and talking about education,

605
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,709
there is a class

606
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,420
whose professor tortures the students by making them listen

607
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,130
to this podcast every week and then discuss it

608
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,150
and I'm not going to dox anyone so like, you know who you are,

609
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:04,800
but

610
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:08,339
you have an opportunity to literally address a

611
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:14,810
class of students taking various cybersecurity like networking programming

612
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,910
or kind of the the whole gamut here.

613
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:19,270
What do you want to say to them?

614
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,510
And what do you think is a useful piece of

615
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,859
advice they can walk away with from this conversation?

616
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:31,030
Well, I I think that having the uh an understanding of, of software security and,

617
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,270
and how vulnerabilities are exploited and how you can fix them.

618
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,060
It's just gonna make you a more valuable developer. You know, you're gonna,

619
00:29:38,316 --> 00:29:41,995
in your career, you're gonna have more opportunities like, you know,

620
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:46,436
security architects that understand like cloud native computing and

621
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:50,196
architecture and security is a super high paying job.

622
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:51,475
Um And they're really,

623
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:54,875
if you think being a developer is hard to find that's really hard to find

624
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:58,515
and it's more, it's more fun, right? You're not like grinding

625
00:29:58,621 --> 00:30:01,432
now, like basic U I code, right?

626
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:05,001
And in node I, I think it just, it enhances your career.

627
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:09,411
It'll enhance your perspective on, on the world of the future where

628
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:13,371
I know security is going to be more important because computers

629
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:15,651
are going to be doing more and more important things.

630
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:19,001
You might be coding a robot or something that has a gun, who knows?

631
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:19,689
Um,

632
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:23,109
so, so it's gonna make your career more valuable.

633
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,550
And I think it's really interesting when, you know,

634
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,099
II I learned development first and then I learned hacking

635
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,150
and I'm very happy I did.

636
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,780
So it just, it will, it'll, it'll,

637
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,260
it'll make dealing with technology much more interesting to, to learn this stuff.

638
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,969
I agree 100%.

639
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,949
And I guess I will end on one last note, which

640
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,810
you just open source Loft Crack. So, congratulations.

641
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,219
That is awesome that you, you did that.

642
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:56,479
Well, well, thank you.

643
00:30:56,489 --> 00:31:01,280
Uh It's been a, it's been a long, a long journey with, with Loft Crack

644
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:06,709
and, you know, it, it's, it's kind of fun to, you know, have an open source project.

645
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:11,040
Now, I'm one, I'm one of the maintainers of it. There's a lot of cool code in there.

646
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,000
You know, Christian ryu

647
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:12,530
Dildo

648
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:17,800
is basically like a windows hacking genius and his code is in there.

649
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,160
So,

650
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:24,160
look at how he is dumping the hashes over the network from from a domain controller.

651
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,739
Look, look at how you know, there's some a lot of optimizations in there for,

652
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,010
for for cracking.

653
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,579
So

654
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,979
it's a fun, it's some fun code to look at and I think it's pretty,

655
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,660
it's a pretty capable framework to build upon. Yeah, so check it out for sure.

656
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,140
Definitely. Right patch is welcome, as we like to say in the open source world.

657
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,229
Awesome.

658
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,300
Well, Chris, it has been

659
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,050
-- absolute treat having you here. Thank you so very
-- much. Well, thank you, Josh.

660
