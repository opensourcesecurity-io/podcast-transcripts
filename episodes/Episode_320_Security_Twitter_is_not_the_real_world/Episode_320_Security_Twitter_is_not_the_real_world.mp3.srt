Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,770
Kurtz Fried and my partner in spreadsheet shenanigans.

2
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,359
Josh Reser

3
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:15,090
-- spreadsheets. I don't know how spreadsheets even work, man. They're
-- magic.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,829
It's funny because we um I did a, a presentation last night with Yee

5
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:21,469
and then actually we ended up having a one hour discussion afterwards.

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,010
There's about 20 of us and a couple of new people that want to break

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,250
into the industry and it was comical because one of their questions was like,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,530
what kind of math do I need to know?

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,770
And all of us were like,

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,440
what do you mean? Math?

11
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:31,879
Right? Like

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,930
we do spreadsheets and charts sometimes. But like, unless you're making crypto,

13
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:40,560
that's a reasonable question. I think,

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,090
especially a researcher because like,

15
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:46,180
if you're doing any sort of vulnerability analysis,

16
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:51,590
it's not uncommon at all to need to know, like weird binary and hexadecimal math for,

17
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:53,810
you know, changing addresses and stuff like that.

18
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:55,084
Well, that's more an encoding issue.

19
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:57,715
But he was thinking like, you know, do I need to know algebra or crypto?

20
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,915
And we're like, no,

21
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:00,834
like, really? No,

22
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:02,404
that's, that's true.

23
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,135
But then I, I did point out, for example,

24
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:07,324
I use a lot of estimating sort of on logarithmic scales.

25
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,665
Like, is this a 1 1,000,000 or like million problem?

26
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:13,925
Because it's a one or a 10 problem I can deal with it

27
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:17,904
and if it's a million problem. Yeah. No, I, like we need to go talk to the government

28
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:20,165
and get policy. That's true.

29
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:24,074
You know, because I can deal with a sick kid but I can't deal with a million sick kids

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,559
as we've discovered through this pandemic scale matters

31
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,069
actually. So it's funny you bring that up because I've been fighting with this.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,150
Remember several episodes ago,

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,650
I talked about how I'm downloading all of the N PM

34
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,269
data and I'm going to write a white paper about it.

35
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:41,500
How's that going for you?

36
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,629
I have, I have all the data now and it's taken a while to get it all.

37
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:47,260
I just downloaded the downloads data, which that's

38
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:51,402
sounds hilarious now that I say it out loud. But one of the challenges is

39
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,902
you're dealing with 1.9 million packages,

40
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,242
25 million like releases where it's 1.9 million times a

41
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,663
number equals all the releases of N PM data.

42
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,133
And when you have numbers at large,

43
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:06,892
it's really difficult to try to tease out useful information because

44
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:10,785
looking at 25 million data points is extremely difficult

45
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:12,936
and there's often an enormous amount of noise.

46
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,796
Well, like if you chart it out is that

47
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:18,016
an actual pattern or you're just like seeing the shape of the clouds.

48
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:19,255
Well, and that's just it.

49
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:22,255
And so like one of the things I've, I've realized and this is uh I,

50
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:25,975
I'll give a little teaser here is the 95th percentile.

51
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:26,445
Basically,

52
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:30,716
if you look at all the packages in N PM and how many times they've been downloaded,

53
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,776
the largest packages have been downloaded billions of times

54
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,589
and the, the 95th percentile, the cut off like the top,

55
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:42,479
the top 5% have been downloaded 20,000 times or more.

56
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,050
So you think about that, there's

57
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,759
1.9 million

58
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,690
and only 5% of those things have been done in a year.

59
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,050
Mind you,

60
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,580
this isn't over the life of the package because I

61
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,360
can only get a year's worth of download data,

62
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:55,669
but like 20,000 is zero

63
00:02:55,779 --> 00:03:00,289
compared to a billion and that's 5% which is maddening.

64
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,369
So anyway, that's one of the challenges.

65
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,270
Well, I imagine a lot of the stuff in the N PM is like a, what is it called a power

66
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,110
curve or whatever where it's just like it goes from like

67
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:12,809
1000 down to like three and then there's like a long tail

68
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:14,520
that it's like asymptotic.

69
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,330
-- That's right. Everything is that
-- or in this case actually may hit zero.

70
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:21,970
I would actually assume there are packages that have hit are at zero downloads.

71
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,270
-- Uh
-- There are 20 thou no. Um

72
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:28,460
Yes, but I don't remember the number at the top of my head.

73
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,309
It is a very small number compared to everything else.

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,240
Strangely enough,

75
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,800
there's a massive spike around 100 downloads and I don't know why that is.

76
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,960
I assume it must be some sort of automation or something.

77
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,899
Well, I mean, because, yeah, you would think statistically

78
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:45,550
you, I don't want to say you get a bell curve, you get like an inverse power like a,

79
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,619
a steep,

80
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,940
steep ski slope curve. Yeah.

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,520
Yeah, that's exactly what you get.

82
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:51,940
But like having an actual, like,

83
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:54,750
because I think you said what the number 95 popped out or something, right.

84
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,539
Yeah. Yeah. 95 specifically has

85
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,960
an extraordinary number of downloads.

86
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:04,630
Well, I should say an extraordinary number of packages have like, between 90

87
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,160
100 downloads, basically.

88
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,270
Like, what an odd number, I guess two downloads a week, basically.

89
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,190
Anyway, it doesn't matter. I'm working on it.

90
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,380
Weird. It's too bad. You can't get some data to correlate. I'm working on it.

91
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,000
It's coming, well, this and this is what we're talking about.

92
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,608
We're talking about like security kind of at this weird scale in a,

93
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:24,179
like industry wide year long trends.

94
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,200
That's right. That's right. All right. Let me, let me pull up the name of the report.

95
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:27,890
So there was

96
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:34,010
Tux care sponsored a white paper called the State or is it a white paper?

97
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,230
I don't know, whatever it's called the state of enterprise. Linux Security.

98
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:37,899
Management, the P

99
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,250
on institute did it, which I love the word Ponemon

100
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,570
because it's spelled Ponemon.

101
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,869
-- But every time I hear it said out loud, I think Pwnmo N
-- I actually,

102
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,720
at first when you said

103
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,339
like when I read it, I was like p

104
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,040
on I'm like, is this, did they misspell p

105
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:53,019
like what?

106
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,190
No, no, they did not. I imagine the Pony

107
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:01,779
Man Institute is a long storied institution

108
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,269
that unfortunately has a name that has been co opted in recent years.

109
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:06,209
But like Pony

110
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:09,140
on is the real deal. They do real good research.

111
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:13,899
So Tux Carere sponsored this data and I'll put a link in the show note how to get to it.

112
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,480
It was really interesting.

113
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:19,589
And so there's a couple of things that just kind of stand out to me and I want to jump,

114
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,130
I'm not going to start at the beginning because I think

115
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,309
starting at the beginning on a report like this gets boring.

116
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,359
I think the most fascinating data point I saw in this is on,

117
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,040
it's on page 10 of the report.

118
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,959
And they asked

119
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,279
the respondents and at the very end,

120
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,369
they talk about how many people responded and all that stuff.

121
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,339
I don't care. I'm not going into it if you care, go read the report. But

122
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,309
they asked

123
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,700
the respondents,

124
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:43,170
does automation successfully reduce your time to respond to vulnerabilities?

125
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:43,619
And

126
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,929
33% say it's significantly shorter.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,299
21% say slightly shorter 27% say no time to

128
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,579
respond and 19% say increase in time to respond.

129
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:59,730
Now, if your automation doesn't change your time to respond or increases it,

130
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,450
why are you paying for that?

131
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:02,820
Like,

132
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,850
you know what I mean?

133
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:05,850
Well, I mean, on the one hand you could,

134
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:09,250
uh just devil's advocate here is that maybe they're still taking,

135
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,660
like they might have broken process or the automation might be hard to kind of like,

136
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,910
get it to do something.

137
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,940
But once it kind of decides to do something, it goes and does it efficiently.

138
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,470
II, I don't know. Right.

139
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,100
Like I've, because all the automation I've used consists of like shell scripts or,

140
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:23,299
you know,

141
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:24,959
kind of these larger products where it's just like

142
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,450
once you make a decision and push a button,

143
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,350
it's just like poop

144
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,309
and it's basically done, right? Because that's

145
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,059
kind of the whole point of automation is to press a button and loop.

146
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,470
-- It's done
-- the graph right before this

147
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,799
has, it says if your organization uses automation, what steps do you automate?

148
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:44,970
And this one says 67% patching, 53% prioritization,

149
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,929
50% reporting and 41% assignment.

150
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,399
OK.

151
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,109
I can speak to that prioritization thing that's already all that is, is,

152
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,359
is glorified

153
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,720
CV. SS scores from NVD in

154
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,429
a, in a spreadsheet style layout

155
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,920
that's in there too.

156
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:03,390
But time kind of what you've assigned priorities on your internal infrastructure,

157
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:03,779
right?

158
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,739
So if you have like an internal accounting

159
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,220
server running red hat enterprise links versus like a

160
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:13,619
red hat server running the toilets or something or the cafeteria sign boards,

161
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,630
you know, one of those is more important than the other.

162
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,380
So, so they actually have data on that and that this is on page eight.

163
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,470
No, I actually, I've got a bunch of paper notes. I'm holding a real notebook.

164
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:25,869
So now I look at page eight and they actually asked the question,

165
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,019
how do you prioritize vulnerabilities?

166
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:29,570
And this one shocked me a little bit.

167
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:30,290
They have,

168
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:33,769
they have four options they list and there's other at 5% which doesn't count.

169
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:33,989
But

170
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,459
so the top one is vulnerability factors such as exploit availability, right?

171
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,390
Which is kind of what you were talking about a little bit of and that's at 53%.

172
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,839
They have type of system impact at 51%.

173
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:45,869
And then, but then,

174
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,950
then the third one says business risk of

175
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,579
systems affected by the vulnerability that's 47%.

176
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:53,410
And I feel like those two are potentially the same.

177
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,149
-- I don't know how I would tease them apart.
-- What happened?

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,239
There is at least my experience was sort of a type of system impacted.

179
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,299
It was more things like can this be easily upgraded? So for example,

180
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:08,709
an accounting server I can upgrade and if it kind of whoopsies, well, it'll,

181
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,130
we'll spot it pretty quick

182
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,660
and we can roll it back.

183
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:14,940
But if it's like an industrial skated control system for an oil refinery.

184
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,390
We can't run that risk of like, hey,

185
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,589
let's upgrade the software and see if something breaks and if it breaks,

186
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,589
we'll roll it back.

187
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,309
But isn't that business risk?

188
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,320
Well, no business risk would be more like, well, ok, perfect example,

189
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,429
when I work for that small, well, not small, medium sized firm payroll was done.

190
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,159
Every Friday, a big pile of checks was printed out and given to the 500 electricians.

191
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,989
Is there a business risk not printing them their checks? Absolutely.

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,830
Those guys were strong and there was 500 of them. But here's the thing.

193
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,070
Could the owner have said like, right, whatever,

194
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,349
run 500 checks for three grand each and just hand them out.

195
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:49,450
-- Uh That's true. That's true. Right.
-- And they could have done that.

196
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,690
Like, so that's the thing. Like sometimes there's like a, a sort of a pain.

197
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,609
Like there's a,

198
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:57,489
my favorite example is Revenue Canada because Canada Revenue Agency

199
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,729
basically has the policy of if everything goes all crazy,

200
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,299
we just turn the website off because

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,280
you have to pay your taxes,

202
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:07,049
right? Like we'll extend the filing date and you just have to

203
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:09,854
pay them and we can turn the website off for a week and deal with log for J

204
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:13,255
-- Right. I remember that. Yes. No, it wasn't log for J though. What was
-- it?

205
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:14,015
And heartbleed?

206
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:17,294
-- No, they've done it for heartbleed and log for J, oh,
-- they did it for Log for J also.

207
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:17,854
That's neat.

208
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:20,325
-- Yeah.
-- But it didn't make the news because it was in December and who cares?

209
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:20,505
Right.

210
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,775
But for heartbleed, it was the week of,

211
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:25,585
like, when you're supposed to pay your taxes

212
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:27,575
and they had to extend the filing deadline.

213
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:28,895
So, that's the thing. Right.

214
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:32,215
Like, there's like, revenue, Canada has a captive market

215
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,349
and thought,

216
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,619
like, you can't

217
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,219
take your business elsewhere.

218
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:38,820
whereas Amazon can't shut their website down for a week.

219
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,359
That's true. That's a good point.

220
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,260
Actually, anyway, I don't want to dwell on this one.

221
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,179
And then the fourth is CV SS score

222
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,780
-- and it's 46%. So it's
-- a lot. Well, it's the default number, right?

223
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,969
But I was shocked CV S S's last, I mean, this is what,

224
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:57,309
what comes to mind here is we live in this weird security bubble where

225
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,650
we think certain security things are vastly more important than they really are.

226
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:01,580
And so if you would have asked me,

227
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,552
I would have said CV SS is the

228
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,533
number one way people prioritize prioritize vulnerabilities.

229
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:10,432
And it's clearly not because this is a survey of like normal folk,

230
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:11,742
not security goons.

231
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:12,793
Well, here's the problem.

232
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:16,913
They are talking about CV SS scores, but they are not talking about CV SS scores.

233
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:20,953
They are talking specifically about the CV SS base score only

234
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:26,663
and that's the trick is CV SS scoring is actually also a temporal score,

235
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,372
which is things like exploit code, maturity,

236
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,153
remediation level and report confidence

237
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:30,583
and

238
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:31,786
the environmental score,

239
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:34,406
which is to put it bluntly how important is this thing to you.

240
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:38,716
And so the idea of a CV SS score is what it's supposed to be is vulnerability plus,

241
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:40,585
exploit plus affected system.

242
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:45,005
But obviously NVD can't do that. Like NVD doesn't know what the heck you're running.

243
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,846
And so they assume a worst case scenario.

244
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,986
I think there's another piece to this and it's

245
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:52,835
not that they're going and finding CV SS scores,

246
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:57,286
they're using an automated system to tell them the CBS S score functionally.

247
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,645
Right. I mean, that, that's where these come from. It's not,

248
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,739
no one is going and seeking out scores on

249
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,809
their own because finding them is terrible and then,

250
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,659
you know, getting them shoved somewhere useful is even worse.

251
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:09,659
There's a number there. Where's the,

252
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,809
-- let me check my notes here. Um
-- Did you actually? Oh, yeah, that's right.

253
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,599
-- You were using handwrit notes today. I do
-- have some handwrit notes.

254
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:19,210
Uh That's not what I want. Um

255
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,049
They do have a note about

256
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,049
how, who's using automation

257
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,039
and ok, here it is. What is automated?

258
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,559
Oh, we talked about that already because patch is 67%.

259
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,969
So here's an interesting number. The very first thing they talk about on the,

260
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,340
on the report, it's, I think it's technically part of the executive summary

261
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,229
is they, they ask,

262
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,190
they say once you detect a critical or high priority vulnerability.

263
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,989
How long on average does it take to patch?

264
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,950
Oh, I know. Right.

265
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,390
-- That time frame
-- and, and so here's what's interesting, 44% said,

266
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,429
within a month and 56% said five weeks

267
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:53,869
to more than one year,

268
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:56,755
which seems like a, it's like five weeks or more. But

269
00:11:57,044 --> 00:12:01,135
I hope a lot of that is a quarter and not more than a year, like,

270
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:02,594
I hope they kind of lumped it all together.

271
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:02,994
But

272
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,434
I worry that there's actually a lot of, although in fairness,

273
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:09,434
if you don't patch it in 30 days, then kind of 123, many,

274
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,849
I, I agree with that. I agree.

275
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,080
But this kind of goes to my,

276
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,679
either you're patching or you're not because if

277
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,159
you're not patching it within 30 days,

278
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,479
then, well, yeah, like you're basically not patching.

279
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,359
I

280
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,520
kind of agree with that.

281
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,469
And now here's what's interesting tying on to that.

282
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,960
See, this is where like this report feels a little out of order.

283
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:30,440
Well, maybe just from my, my view,

284
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,599
I guess this again is probably the security bubble.

285
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:32,840
But

286
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:34,330
one of the questions he asked said,

287
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,219
did any of these cybersecurity incidents occur while a patch

288
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:39,960
was available for a known vulnerability but was not applied.

289
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:47,989
55% said yes, 40% said no and 5% said unsure. So you figure the most, 56%

290
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:53,789
are taking more than five weeks to patch and 55% are having cybersecurity incidents

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,739
with a patch available like this feels like a self fulfilling prophecy.

292
00:12:58,789 --> 00:12:59,919
-- Well,
-- but how much, I mean,

293
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,969
how many people still believe firewalls work to keep the bad guys out?

294
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:06,119
It depends whose marketing materials you, you read.

295
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,530
You know, I, like, I run into this all the time like it was,

296
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,539
it was actually quite comical.

297
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:10,190
I was on a call with Cloud

298
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:10,969
and they were,

299
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,219
you know, trying to mention the, um, the cloud FFL teams, which is the VPN stuff.

300
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:14,719
And I'm like,

301
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,570
and he, he starts talking about it and I'm like, oh, I have some good news for you.

302
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,789
And he's like, what I'm like, we don't have any infrastructure.

303
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,679
He's like, huh, I'm like, we're 100% cloud based. Like we,

304
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:25,010
we, there's nothing to VPN to,

305
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,130
right. There's literally the cloud security lines.

306
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,739
We don't have anything to VPN connect to that.

307
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,119
They're just, it's like, we, we, it's like,

308
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:37,750
you know, it's like Africa, they skipped to fiber optics and cell towers.

309
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,900
There's no landlines, like just,

310
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,090
it's, uh, that's not a thing for us and never will be.

311
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,659
And he's like, oh, ok. Then I'm like, yep.

312
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:46,000
Well,

313
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,229
we both worked at Red Hat and what was

314
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,880
Red Hat's Support Lifetime for Red Hat Enterprise LX.

315
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,159
It was 13 years

316
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,919
and it wasn't 13 years because Red Hat wanted to do that

317
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,000
forever.

318
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,039
The answer is forever.

319
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,179
It wasn't 13 years because Red Hat, you know, felt like that's a good number.

320
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,289
It's 13 years because that's what customers demand.

321
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,479
And I remember there were some banks now, this was a decade ago.

322
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:08,330
I don't think it's the same,

323
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,174
but there were banks that wouldn't use the latest version

324
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,515
of or rather the version of Red hat enterprise.

325
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:15,294
Linux

326
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:16,344
they would use,

327
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:20,575
would they would only start using it when it entered the long life? What do we call it?

328
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:24,155
extended support or whatever? Basically critical updates only

329
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:27,164
because they were like, this is moving at the speed we want,

330
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:29,414
we don't want this fast moving

331
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:30,565
operating system.

332
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:33,335
And by that point it was like five years out of date and it's like,

333
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:36,655
what infrastructure are you even running on this stuff?

334
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:36,815
I

335
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,554
like Swift. Swift is running on this stuff

336
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:40,559
that you

337
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,130
like,

338
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:43,849
I mean, all, all the stuff but,

339
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:44,849
and that's the thing, right?

340
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:48,359
Like stuff like, well, like you look at like Saber and the, you know, the airline,

341
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,940
uh the travel stuff,

342
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,000
it's going on horrifically old mainframes and whatnot and it's kind of like,

343
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:58,750
yeah, it's not very amazing or sexy or cool, but it kind of mostly works and again,

344
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,270
it gets the job done.

345
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,510
-- Well,
-- if you kind of have a captive audience, you know,

346
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,869
like revenue Canada and IRS are running on old old code,

347
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,070
you gonna take your business elsewhere.

348
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,559
Don't have

349
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:10,679
a

350
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,510
job, you know, like you're an airline.

351
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,960
Are you going to take the risk of dealing with some small start up who's like, hey, we,

352
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:19,750
we rewrote Saber in like rust with a web responsive front end.

353
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,979
That would be an enormous risk because then you wouldn't exist

354
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,260
in any of the booking systems that are already being used.

355
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:28,450
-- Well,
-- yeah, and there's also that minor problem of like, why does

356
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:31,815
swift work? Well, because everybody uses Swift. Why does everybody use Swift?

357
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:33,835
Because everybody uses swift?

358
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:35,395
That's right. All right. I don't want to get stuck in this.

359
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,604
I'm going to keep this moving. All right. So here's another interesting data point.

360
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:41,844
60% of the respondents said open source is

361
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,565
as secure or more secure than proprietary software.

362
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,429
Now, Red Hat asked a similar question in one of their surveys.

363
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,200
They released a couple of months ago and they

364
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,659
said it was 89% of respondents answered that question.

365
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,659
I suspect a lot of people when they think of closed source,

366
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:58,510
they're actually thinking of the hybrid closed,

367
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,739
open source stuff that is pretty much everything now like

368
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,979
Windows is a hybrid of open and closed source.

369
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:04,340
Everything is a hybrid now.

370
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:09,885
Well, and not only that, I have a suspicion that Red Hat asked a different question

371
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:15,085
than Tux Carere did because I suspect Red Hat was looking for that answer

372
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:19,844
and this particular report isn't about the security of open source.

373
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,125
It's about patching your systems.

374
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,364
I'm always reminded of that yes minister scene where you know,

375
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,315
he asked the question two different ways about youth joining the military.

376
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:29,155
And it's, you know, to get two different answers.

377
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:30,630
Yes.

378
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:32,710
Anyways, I, I think, I,

379
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,559
I, like,

380
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,390
I remember 20 years ago when there was

381
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,309
stuff like Solaris that was 100% closed source.

382
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,900
Like they, they wrote their own

383
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:43,299
everything, device drivers, you name it

384
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:47,164
-- and that's just not possible anymore if you want to relevant. No,
-- I, I agree.

385
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:51,224
-- It's completely out of the question. You know,
-- like a and especially if you,

386
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:51,395
uh,

387
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:54,304
well, at a minimum, you're gonna need an I PV six stack,

388
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:55,815
you're gonna need a Wi Fi stack.

389
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:59,044
You're gonna need a secure web server and client. If you want to talk to anything

390
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:00,755
and those three things alone,

391
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,439
you're gonna need a team of 20 to 100 people who are really sophisticated

392
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,000
or if you're lucky or

393
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,858
you just grab an open source library and you're done in five minutes.

394
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,670
No, I, I agree. Absolutely.

395
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,598
You can't justify those kind of business decisions anymore.

396
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:16,550
And I mean, heck, even if Solaris is open source now, I think,

397
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,358
or maybe it's under that terrible.

398
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:20,500
Well, I know that,

399
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:21,439
but

400
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,170
like I'm just saying,

401
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,858
one of the attempts, one of their Hail Marys was to open source it

402
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,969
with open Solaris

403
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:29,640
and

404
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,489
that went about as well as one would expect. But anyway, anyway,

405
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,640
we're not here to talk about

406
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:39,790
-- Oracle is a great supporter of the open source world. Look
-- they actually are.

407
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,099
I don't want to get into some bizarre rant bashing oracle.

408
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,979
You can edit that part out.

409
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:45,550
No, that

410
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:46,109
I'm,

411
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,979
it's too late. You said it? It's recorded. Alright.

412
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,640
Here's one of the other really interesting graphs I think. Which is,

413
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:56,349
let me, ok, on page eight, they ask,

414
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,439
how often does your organization scan for vulnerabilities

415
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,560
and 25%

416
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,819
don't have a schedule, which is

417
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:06,069
honestly a little smaller than I expected.

418
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,040
I'm

419
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,369
kind of in the same boat because for example,

420
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,859
we get this question all the time at the CS A and that do you scan on a regular basis?

421
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:15,250
You know, for CV S in your software?

422
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,869
And the answer is, well, we don't do it on a regular basis.

423
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,540
But every time they build the software, which is like 2 to 3 times a week that happens,

424
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:25,689
I would say your answer is yes. In that context,

425
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:28,930
I think the problem is we don't do it for security reasons.

426
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:31,770
We do it because it's just part of our build process now.

427
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,489
Like it's,

428
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,425
it's, you know, it's like, how often do you clean your teeth hurt?

429
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:39,604
-- Well, II, I just brush daily because that's what people do.
-- I think you're

430
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:44,354
splitting hairs and I think not scheduled in this context means people are YOLO

431
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:45,724
this for the most part.

432
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:49,185
True. I think that's what that means. Now we can go farther.

433
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,405
There's more than four weeks, 20%

434
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:56,795
every four and Now, mind you, this is the largest, right? 20% every four weeks, 90%.

435
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:58,165
So monthly, obviously, right,

436
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:03,405
every three weeks, 15% 2 weeks, 11% every week is 10%

437
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,569
2 to 3 times a week is 2%

438
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,109
daily is 7% and more than once a day is 1%. And here's

439
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:17,439
what I guess kind of stood out to me when I looked at this particular one is if you have

440
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,800
a modern automation system that can

441
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,390
basically catalog what you're running,

442
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,540
you can effectively run these scans like every

443
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,640
10 minutes and there's no system load.

444
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,219
But if you have like the legacy style scanner where it has an

445
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:35,130
agent that's causing some sort of disruption to the system and load,

446
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:36,290
it becomes a big deal.

447
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,859
And I think given these numbers,

448
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:41,619
I would say the vast majority of respondents are using legacy system

449
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,859
scanning because so few are doing like the very fast scanning model.

450
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,939
Well, ideally what should happen is you should have it

451
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,339
on change,

452
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,640
you scan that thing, like you do a software update, you scan it,

453
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,920
you do a config change, you scan it, you do like anything to the system, you scan it.

454
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,709
And then I would say concurrent with that, you should probably also do

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,130
like a daily or weekly scan because there will be systems that don't change a lot. But

456
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,430
you kind of want to keep an eye on them or make sure the agent didn't die or, you know,

457
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:09,839
whatever.

458
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:10,109
Right.

459
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:12,069
Yeah. Yeah. No. Absolutely.

460
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:16,410
And again, like, yeah, that requires modern it, which by definition,

461
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
if you're a large enterprise,

462
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,949
-- you have a mix of stuff from 20 years ago and stuff from like
-- now

463
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:22,170
that

464
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,130
you have every single piece of it ever made.

465
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,109
-- Like
-- at the CS A,

466
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,609
like we're 100% cloud based and the effort it's going

467
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,829
to take me to get rid of Jira is significant.

468
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,069
Like we're, we're transitioning out of,

469
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,930
we made that choice actually quite a while ago because honestly,

470
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:37,170
the text editor situation alone in Jira is so

471
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,790
painful and the collaboration aspect of it is terrible.

472
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,989
So we're moving to air table and going from Jira to air table,

473
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,739
like we've got about 80% of it out,

474
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,530
but that kind of last 20% most of it's my stuff is

475
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,810
I'm seriously getting to the point of like just we're going to

476
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,770
like walk away from it and I'm going to have to recreate

477
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,050
the data in air table manually or something because there's no good,

478
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:57,650
there's no good migration path.

479
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,540
Well, that's

480
00:20:59,089 --> 00:20:59,520
fault then

481
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:04,219
it it's well, but it's also Jira fault in that they don't give you,

482
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:08,339
they don't make it really that easy to get at your data that you want, right?

483
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:11,709
Like you can do an export, but I kind of want like a live cut over,

484
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,500
not just like a dump and run.

485
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,579
I might have to end up doing.

486
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:20,479
But basically, like, even to shift from one cloud service to another cloud service

487
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:24,489
-- is, it's a significant amount of effort.
-- No, I, I agree. I agree completely.

488
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,890
You know, and so I can't even, like,

489
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,199
I haven't touched traditional it in a long time and I, I

490
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,140
can't even imagine, you know, if I had a fleet of like, 1000 red hat servers doing

491
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,619
back in the stuff.

492
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,270
Oh,

493
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:35,229
man,

494
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:37,989
like I do not want to remember those days from 20 years ago

495
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,630
when I had like a fleet of 20 machines to maintain and it took forever.

496
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,170
So, so I feel for these people.

497
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:47,469
All right, here's our next very interesting data point I thought is they asked

498
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,569
respondents,

499
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:50,849
what they thought their ability was to prevent

500
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:54,109
and detect a data breach or cyber attack

501
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,459
based upon obviously the tooling they're using in their infrastructure.

502
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:01,869
46% said they have the ability to prevent a data breach.

503
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,979
And 52% said they have the ability to detect the data breach.

504
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,199
I feel like those numbers are much, much higher than your reality.

505
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,739
I was going to say, I think they're very optimistic.

506
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:12,949
Yes,

507
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:16,540
this is like what percentage of people say they're better than average drivers,

508
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,819
80% of people think they're better than average.

509
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,680
I,

510
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:21,689
you know,

511
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:23,349
it's funny because we've been having this discussion with

512
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,920
a lot of members of the CS A where

513
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,060
they're discovering, for example, like within Aws or within Microsoft,

514
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:29,660
you can basically take data,

515
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,619
have it flow through the system and like handle it securely.

516
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,319
And so, you know,

517
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:35,060
you can have like your very sensitive data that's

518
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:37,099
locked down in your like public data which,

519
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,459
you know, you can serve on a web server.

520
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:42,380
But the moment it leaves that ecosystem, it loses that sort of security taking and

521
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:43,410
you can't

522
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,319
like do enforcement on it, right.

523
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:48,410
So you can't take the data out to an external system and still have

524
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,709
it like locked down or not locked down when we're talking with them.

525
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:54,180
They're, we're also teaching them things like you can say no to accessing data.

526
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:56,500
But then have like a fallback of like, you know,

527
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,339
Bob tries to access the data but he's accessing

528
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:00,079
it from a weird country that he's not normally in

529
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,390
and he gets denied, but he can f the help desk and maybe escalate to get access by,

530
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,010
you know, authenticating manually or something.

531
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,849
Right. Sure.

532
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:10,810
And they're amazed by this, like, they never, like they've never heard of this,

533
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,739
never consider this.

534
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,290
And in reality, the majority of technology does not support this.

535
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:17,119
And so a perfect example of this that does

536
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,890
it really well is the Microsoft family accounts,

537
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,069
right?

538
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,310
I have them set up on windows

539
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:23,579
and so both my sons have a, you know, a family sub account

540
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,459
and I have my one son set to be able to play video games from 330 pm till eight pm.

541
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,430
And so like the last two days, there was no school,

542
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:32,920
there was uh Easter Monday and a PD day for the teachers.

543
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:33,750
And so of course,

544
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,540
he's wanting to play Hearts of Iron Four and Roblox at like 10 in the morning.

545
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,939
And so he

546
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,589
tries to run it and it basically will block him and say,

547
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,719
do you want to ask for more time?

548
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:45,160
And the second he hits yes to ask for more time.

549
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,859
I get a notification in an email about five seconds later

550
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,670
saying, you know,

551
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,500
Felix is asking for more time on Roblox or

552
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,579
Hearts of Iron Four or Paradox launcher or whatever.

553
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:54,000
Do you want to say yes or no?

554
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,030
And if you say yes, is it like 10 seconds all the way up to three hours kind of thing?

555
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,219
And I click that it's just done, but that doesn't exist in the enterprise world

556
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:08,170
and yet like we can do it for video games for a 10 or an 11 year old.

557
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:12,150
-- And that's the kind of stuff we need that.
-- That is, that is funny. That is funny.

558
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,089
And, and you know, you know, what else has reminded me of?

559
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,699
I don't want, I don't want to dwell on it too much.

560
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:18,219
But I think there was an article one time that was like a

561
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,810
survey of grandmother reveals 100% of

562
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,099
grandchildren are above average and like just

563
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:28,969
-- it anyway,
-- remember when Blizzard and World of Warcraft had two factor RS A tokens.

564
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:30,219
They'd mail out to you for free.

565
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,040
Yep.

566
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,250
And that, like, my bank still won't do good to fa,

567
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:34,459
I

568
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,890
-- know. I know. But banks have insurance and, and Blizzard
-- doesn't.

569
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,319
Actually what's been happening is Canadian Banks have been, uh,

570
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,619
just telling people tough.

571
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,199
What?

572
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:43,780
Yeah, there's been a bunch of news article,

573
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,310
like R BC basically misfiled a bunch of wire transfers and was kind of like, too bad.

574
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:47,800
So sad.

575
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,439
And then of course, once it hit the media, yeah, it, they're like, oh, we, we fixed

576
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,920
it, we accidentally said the wrong thing.

577
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,020
Yeah. Um anyway, so,

578
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,239
but yeah, but what gets me is like enterprise soft,

579
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,170
especially enterprise security software is a really,

580
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,319
really hard market because you have the old stuff that is kind of

581
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,880
trusted in the sense of like, it won't,

582
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,949
you know,

583
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,939
it'll,

584
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,369
it won't break or mess up too badly. I mean, it will but we pretend it won't.

585
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,199
But then there's all the new stuff that actually does new and useful things,

586
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:18,640
but nobody wants to take that risk.

587
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,319
All right. All right.

588
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:22,420
I want to move this on because we've rat holed and you,

589
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,770
you've just transitioned into, I think the last point,

590
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,719
the last thing I've written down in my notes that I want to make

591
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,160
and on page 11,

592
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:33,589
they asked the respondents how important is live

593
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,650
patching and the idea behind live patching is,

594
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,579
let's say you have like an old system running

595
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:39,859
and there's a kernel update and you don't want to reboot.

596
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:41,459
You can like live patch the kernel

597
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:43,780
to remove the security vulnerability or whatever.

598
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,109
And you can do this now in a lot

599
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,900
of systems with like kernels and binaries and whatever,

600
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,050
right?

601
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,939
And the idea is minimize downtime. And obviously when you're

602
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:54,785
old gear, minimize downtime is the reason you're running old gear,

603
00:25:54,795 --> 00:26:00,165
72% say the importance of virtualization stack live patching, which

604
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:01,964
that seems really high,

605
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:04,285
-- 70% database live
-- patching.

606
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:07,305
The problem is if you have to, if you have to take down your virtualization stack,

607
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:08,885
you have to take everything down.

608
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,444
I mean. Right. No, II, I get that. I, I agree.

609
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,569
And basically all of this,

610
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:17,349
these uh the response and it's just live patching services, whatever.

611
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,959
It doesn't, it doesn't really matter what the details are,

612
00:26:18,969 --> 00:26:20,920
but basically 60% and above

613
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:24,290
are live patching stuff in their infrastructure, which I,

614
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,089
I'm not surprised by this, but I didn't realize it was that pervasive.

615
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:31,819
I think it became pervasive because it allows you to paper over cracks and bad it.

616
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:35,300
-- I
-- mean, I guess that's true because if you can't reboot,

617
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,479
it's because you don't have a reboot strategy or, or fail over or you know,

618
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:40,640
high availability.

619
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,420
So live patching is the band aid for not

620
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,180
having all these other best practices in place.

621
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,359
Even I suffer this locally.

622
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:49,390
I reboot my son's computer and then I have to immediately log in

623
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:52,319
as myself. Otherwise, the Plex server doesn't run

624
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,459
and if the Plex server doesn't run,

625
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:56,229
then my other son is going to be very annoyed because he's going

626
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,180
to go into his flex client and none of his media is available.

627
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,920
You know, you can run Flex on a Raspberry Pi. Right.

628
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:05,650
Yeah. But this thing, we have like six terabytes of content. It doesn't care

629
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,550
anyway. I know it's,

630
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,680
it's just from a management interface perspective. It's a bit easier to do it on a PC.

631
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:15,239
That's fair. And in fairness, this PC is like, you know,

632
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,170
it's a, it's a Ryzen 5 5600 X with 32 gigs of ra M and

633
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:21,689
all the storage.

634
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,250
Ok? I wanna, I wanna bring this all home now because we're running out of time.

635
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,250
And I think this is

636
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:28,050
so

637
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,229
we talked last week about

638
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,130
kind of patching and,

639
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,410
and speed of updates and all this stuff and then this data falls into our lap,

640
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,050
which I think shows the reality of this problem.

641
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,930
And I think this is where if you listen to security Twitter,

642
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,219
it sounds like you need to be updating quickly

643
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:49,349
and it's the most important thing in the whole world

644
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,260
and you're going to get hacked by Russians if you don't or whatever.

645
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,979
And I think the reality is stark contrast to the security people.

646
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:58,459
And so I think if you're a security practitioner,

647
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,699
you need to read reports like this and understand

648
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,560
where people are coming from and they're not doing this because they're stupid.

649
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,520
They're doing this because their job is keeping

650
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,810
this infrastructure running their job isn't applying patches.

651
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:15,989
And I think that's one of the big disconnects we have as security people.

652
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,810
We forget what the incentives are for the behavior of nonsecurity people.

653
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,010
-- Well,
-- it is the servant of the work, not the other way around.

654
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,810
And, and I see that so much with security people like, oh you can't do that.

655
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:28,859
Like every time security people say no.

656
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:31,479
And then people just short circuit around the security people

657
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:33,209
and security people are all horrified and it's like,

658
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:35,130
but they have to get their job done.

659
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,390
We're being so careful of the UBQ roll out of the

660
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,540
CS A because I'm like this cannot impact or be negative.

661
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,500
It has to be a good experience otherwise people won't use it.

662
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,780
Um And sorry, I just want to put out two more data points.

663
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,310
There's now uh CIA has been doing fantastic work these last few months.

664
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,619
Like they've really upped their game

665
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,270
with the known exploited vulnerabilities catalog and we'll have

666
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,359
a link to that in the show notes,

667
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,170
but it has about 700 entries now.

668
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,300
And

669
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:01,099
um

670
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,849
it's, it's actually kind of fascinating because

671
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,180
what's fascinating to me is if you said Kurt, you're going to have an own exploded. V

672
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:07,410
Andre

673
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:09,550
got like, I'd be like, oh, that makes sense because so you're gonna like,

674
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,380
see stuff kind of coming out on the regular, put it in the catalog, blah, blah, blah.

675
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:16,160
But what's fascinating to me is there's like the most recent stuff is a 2018 Zim,

676
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,099
a 2019 meta platforms.

677
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,430
A

678
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,479
2022 Microsoft Windows thing like, OK, you know, the, the most recent print spoo

679
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,199
uh thing that was out like two weeks ago or whatever.

680
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:25,739
Yeah.

681
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,180
But what's fascinating to me is these things that are like they've been out for four

682
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:32,229
-- or more years in some cases, like
-- a week ago,

683
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,500
they added a bunch of flash player stuff from 2015.

684
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:35,550
I

685
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,900
-- was running flash player
-- anymore.

686
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,640
Well, and if you're running flash player like, yeah, you're like,

687
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,699
well remember that Chinese um train

688
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,920
company or something was running their

689
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:46,660
scheduling or something on flash.

690
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,500
It was like there was an article a few years ago about how it just all went,

691
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:52,920
it went tits up when flash either got attacked or

692
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,300
stopped working or whatever.

693
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,369
But the, and then the second thing is, and uh dang it, let me find the,

694
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:02,130
sorry, I rebooted just before this. But there was that the Google article

695
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,969
or the article about Google tracking, what was it? 58

696
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:07,479
0 days last year?

697
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,209
Yes. Let's just make that a topic for a future show because I think

698
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,060
that is super interesting because the number of zero days

699
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:16,619
has gone up drastically and they actually talk about,

700
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,410
well, the number of detected zero days.

701
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,790
-- Yes. And, well, they, they kind of discussed some of that that are
-- publicly known.

702
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,170
-- It's,
-- I think that's a fascinating topic and I wanna,

703
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,510
that's too good

704
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,180
to

705
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:30,790
waste in the, like seven seconds we have remaining.

706
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,060
So

707
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:36,890
I think we're entering an era of better data because let's face it.

708
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,630
Like, I, you know, I,

709
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,560
we've been in this industry for 20 plus years and if you basically said Kurt, well,

710
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:42,619
you have eight hours today.

711
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,449
What are you going to patch?

712
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:48,209
And I'd be like, uh you know, and I basically, I would kind of go, well, honestly, I,

713
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:51,410
I pick CV SS scores because then if it's kind of wrong, it's like, well,

714
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,579
but NVD made those numbers so it's not my fault and don't fire me, please.

715
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,719
And I think there's a lot of that, like, I don't want to take some risk and be like, oh,

716
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:00,170
I think, you know, I'm just reminded every time at Red Hat

717
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:02,290
when there was some stupid thing where I was like, oh,

718
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,020
this is so dumb and then it blew up.

719
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,040
Oh,

720
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:08,010
I love it when that happens. Actually, that was my luck for Jay story.

721
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,770
I thought L for Jay wasn't that big of a deal. I was wrong.

722
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,619
Well, oh, and speaking of spring, uh for Jay or whatever,

723
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,819
it's called somebody privately.

724
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:15,849
DM. Ed Me on Twitter.

725
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,930
Saying they have a customer with a real world

726
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:20,589
situation where they got attacked and compromised by it.

727
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:24,800
So it like exists and, and he can't go public

728
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:25,660
with it. But

729
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:26,410
that's

730
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:27,849
cool. And I kind of was like, oh,

731
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:28,739
you know, that's a,

732
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,959
that's a valid point.

733
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:34,369
And I kind of said and thought that, well, you know, with, with all the it we have,

734
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,800
there's gonna be somebody who's vulnerable.

735
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,170
I mean, that's true. All right, man. I, I gotta cut this one off. I'm ending it.

736
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,410
We will discuss

737
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,770
zero day

738
00:31:41,939 --> 00:31:42,810
