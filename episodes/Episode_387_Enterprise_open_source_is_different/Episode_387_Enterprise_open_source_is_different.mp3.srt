Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,579
Kurt Siefried and I think we're on an almost episode coming up on 400 this year, Josh

2
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:20,040
-- Reser. I mean,
-- we'll hit 400. I think what I just published 386 or 87.

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,370
-- Yeah. So
-- like November

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,520
-- ish, I think
-- 20 ish to go.

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,360
Who cares? We're, we're monkeys with 10 fingers. It doesn't matter.

6
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,000
It's a sustained effort.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,639
I mean,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,049
-- how many podcasts make it past 10 episodes?
-- Probably not many.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,779
I think I read once that I think 50 is the magic number where like 1% make it to 50.

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,659
I would be shocked. It's as high as 1%.

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,240
It, I don't know. I don't know.

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,540
It's been a long time since I've looked at podcast stats.

13
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:48,139
That's one of the beauties of not caring

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,500
because you don't have to look up data,

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,740
which is exactly our topic for today is that sustained effort is different

16
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:57,029
than a one off.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,549
It's true. It's true.

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,310
So, there's been a whole kerfuffle with, uh, Red Hat Linux and, uh, what Alma Linux,

19
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:04,019
Rocky Linux

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,080
or Oracle made a bunch of angry noises.

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,029
Susan actually said something intelligent, which is, you know,

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,510
we're going to devote $10 million to building like a proper clone.

23
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,430
So you can just come by

24
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:17,194
stuff which is still like, $10 million isn't enough

25
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:21,535
ignoring that. What better way to say, we think our actual product is crap.

26
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:23,815
So we're going to clone someone else's like, just,

27
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:26,315
I don't even know how to respond to that anyway. Keep

28
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:26,614
going.

29
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,434
So, uh, there,

30
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:30,915
so people are beginning to sort of realize,

31
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:31,855
well,

32
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:33,254
I don't think they're beginning to realize that's why

33
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:34,915
we're doing the show to maybe help educate them.

34
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:35,144
But

35
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:38,110
so, OK, the long and the short of it is there was a security flaw in I

36
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:41,139
proof and it's not all that serious.

37
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,470
So it was kind of fixed upstream

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,589
like upstream and I

39
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:46,199
proof, I mean,

40
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:49,690
and then of course, people are like, why doesn't you know,

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:50,290
uh

42
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:55,775
Red Hat, what is it called? Red Hat stream sent to us stream. I forget the name of it,

43
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:57,014
whatever the stream thing.

44
00:01:57,735 --> 00:01:58,254
Like,

45
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:01,875
why don't you just fix it? And they're like, well, because it's kind of not that bad.

46
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:06,605
And he's like, but we've developed a patch and merged it like we've done all the work.

47
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:10,880
And I remember reading that and I started laughing like, I, I'm sorry,

48
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:11,990
I just started laughing

49
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,240
and Josh is laughing because you and I both know that, that,

50
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,600
that is literally step seven of like 100 and 64 steps

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,300
when you do enterprise

52
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:21,940
source

53
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,800
Cody security update things. Right.

54
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,460
So, without getting into the

55
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,289
details and the weeds,

56
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:33,889
having a source code patch is literally like step number seven. number one.

57
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,259
Well, before that,

58
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,110
you even need to figure out what the problem actually

59
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,820
is because we've had a lot of people say,

60
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,779
oh, I found a security problem.

61
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:40,800
Here's a patch and we're like,

62
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,169
we dig in a bit and we're like, oh, no, it's a lot worse than that or

63
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,169
more complicated or whatever.

64
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:46,509
Yeah.

65
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:50,460
And I mean, competent people, like, like the, the whole, uh, Kuala stack card thing,

66
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,610
right?

67
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:53,429
They were like, oh, we came up with a one megabyte stack card page. It'll be fine.

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,339
Right? I have a better example than that because you talk about it too much.

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,110
And so I'm not gonna let you tell your story again.

70
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,789
I remember there was one time,

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,270
one of the open source security groups got a bug report for Fuzzed true type fonts.

72
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,020
And there were

73
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:09,503
a lot, a lot of reproducers, right?

74
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,373
And I went through a whole bunch of them

75
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:14,602
and I created a bunch of patches and then I went to upstream.

76
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:18,322
I was like, here's a bunch of reproducers. Here's a bunch of patches that fix these.

77
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,682
Like, how do we, how do, let's work on this and get it fixed?

78
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:25,302
They're like, oh, all of these are one unchecked integer overflow.

79
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:27,643
Like way up here because I didn't know the code

80
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:30,126
that well. So I didn't understand what the path was

81
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,496
but the authors looked and they're like, oh, yeah,

82
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,376
everything is this one thing right here.

83
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:35,716
So it was literally one

84
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:39,445
line patch to fix what I thought was like, 20 bucks.

85
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,335
Exactly.

86
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:42,975
And it's fascinating when that happens.

87
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,225
Well, and I've seen that happen with a lot of web apps where, like,

88
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:48,285
I found 100 and 67 crossfit scripting injections and it's like,

89
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,710
oh, yeah, we forgot to escape HTML in this one spot

90
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,710
for sure.

91
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:57,350
And so like things like that. But then also does your patch break anything.

92
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,949
The thing,

93
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,990
I think a lot of people forget

94
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:05,139
is Red Hat has contracts where they have said

95
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:06,729
we guarantee

96
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:09,330
A B I compatibility

97
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,320
for 13 years.

98
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,260
And as an open source project, you can be like, oh, oops, t he, we broke it a little bit.

99
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,559
We'll fix it on Thursday.

100
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,690
And everybody's kind of like, oh, it happens.

101
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,519
But when you sign contracts in some cases, north of seven figures,

102
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,609
there's no giggling in t he, it's like our lawyers will be contacting you.

103
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,970
-- Uh
-- Right. Right. Exactly. And I think

104
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,529
so, this is an interesting point you bring up because

105
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,130
there are enterprise companies that do open source things.

106
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,410
And Red Hat is an obvious example, Google does this oracle, does this,

107
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,250
all of the big companies do this, Amazon, whatever, all of them.

108
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,109
And then there's open source, which is people like us doing

109
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,690
whatever random thing. And if I,

110
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,880
if I completely break my project,

111
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,489
whatever, it's probably fine.

112
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,170
I mean, pretty much every open

113
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,239
source software license has some version of like if this breaks too bad

114
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,100
in it.

115
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,390
Yeah,

116
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:04,089
if it works. Is it all useful? Hey, good for you.

117
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,190
But we don't make any guarantees about that.

118
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,450
But the problem is when you start selling open source,

119
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,290
well, that's kind of why people are paying you money for it is to get guarantees.

120
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:21,119
I have a second angle to this that often annoys me and, and just really grinds my gears

121
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,920
is I think you see some of these companies

122
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,480
pretending

123
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,600
that their enterprise thing

124
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,989
is an open source project when it's not. And so I think there's two angles to this.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,570
There's the angle of

126
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,079
I am an enterprise trying to run a real open source project,

127
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,820
but I also have to keep my enterprise hat on.

128
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:44,869
And then there's the we are an enterprise company

129
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,200
pretending

130
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:51,019
our product is open source because then it lets us do certain marketing things

131
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,029
in public that you can't necessarily do

132
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,440
with a truly closed source enterprise product.

133
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:55,980
Yeah.

134
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:00,230
Yeah, like that whole uh a lot of companies doing the open core model,

135
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,010
like

136
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,160
there's also a big difference between companies like Red Hat.

137
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,730
I I think part of it is just simple,

138
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,459
what percent are they building in house versus bringing from outside?

139
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,350
And I don't mean just as a dependency chain but like where Red

140
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:17,079
Hat is importing things wholesale and turning them into an enterprise product.

141
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,690
And also the scale issue because there's a big difference

142
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,899
between having a product or two open source products.

143
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,769
And Red Hat, which like when I left there was over 100 and 20.

144
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,579
Sure. Ok. I feel like we're all over the place on this topic.

145
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,660
So we need to tighten it up.

146
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,929
Problem is that this is, it's a,

147
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,359
what I'm trying to get across is it's a

148
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:38,089
fundamentally different issue of scale of sustained effort.

149
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,679
Like, like I was saying to you earlier, I can do one push up. Cool.

150
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,079
Now, can you do one push up an hour

151
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,959
for the rest of your life? Because that's what Red Hat is doing.

152
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,600
They're doing that consistent effort.

153
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,380
Like it just came out with the, uh, alpine limits, right? They're, they're

154
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,109
the person who does the most packages and commits

155
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:56,820
has decided to step down and leave.

156
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:00,339
And I, and I quote, they said they're going to catch up on a year's worth of sleep,

157
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,309
-- like, more than a year. Yeah.
-- Thank you for the effort. And I, yeah. Wow. Like,

158
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,109
and the problem is

159
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,230
who,

160
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,839
unless somebody is insane enough to take over

161
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,799
that level of effort for basically free,

162
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:13,440
I don't think

163
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:13,769
this is

164
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,630
stuff like Red Hat.

165
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:14,929
Ok.

166
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,190
Hold on, hold on. There's

167
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:20,100
a couple of pieces to this and I want to break them apart. So, first of all,

168
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,000
I think alpine is probably going to be fine.

169
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,899
A lot of people are picking up these packages. I think it is easy for people to say

170
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,700
an open source project with one primary contributor is a bad thing.

171
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,179
I don't think that's the case.

172
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,019
I think the measure isn't how many contributors you have. It's when a contributor

173
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,700
ends up on

174
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,799
something happening that they can't necessarily do

175
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,040
the work that there are other people

176
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,040
willing and able to pick up the slack.

177
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:50,899
And I think in alpine we're going to see other people pick up the slack.

178
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,019
And so that is really important.

179
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:59,109
And I, I, in no way, want anyone to use this to construe that alpine is in trouble

180
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:01,420
maybe someday. But I, not yet.

181
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,160
Well, and the challenge too is not just pick up the slack but carry it

182
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:06,600
long term.

183
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,799
And that's what a lot of people forget is like,

184
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:11,000
every time one of these projects has a problem, they're like, oh,

185
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,200
I'll step up and help

186
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,459
and they're happy to put in a few hours of effort.

187
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,309
-- But it's like, no, no, we need like four hours of effort a month
-- for forever until,

188
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,269
until time ends.

189
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:20,720
Right.

190
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,440
Ok.

191
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:23,040
And that is

192
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,480
something redhead has always done a good job of, yeah,

193
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,440
-- because they have money to pay people to do the, um,
-- yes.

194
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,119
Now,

195
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,909
here's the other piece of this that I think is vastly

196
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,969
more interesting and this is the kind of open source versus

197
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,049
enterprise open source discussion

198
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,070
and this is where I want to steer the boat.

199
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,289
So there is what we call open source.

200
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,450
And this is software with an open source license.

201
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,909
The,

202
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,690
the technical definition of open source is just a

203
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,489
piece of software that carries an O SI license.

204
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,559
That could be something you and I do. It's stuff Microsoft is published on github.

205
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,409
There's

206
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,539
many, many things when we think of open source though,

207
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:03,200
I think we generally think of this community of people building stuff,

208
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:09,150
right? And it's never done in a silo. It everything has to interact with each other.

209
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,849
Like the Debian Linux distribution or the

210
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,309
Alpine Linux distribution are great examples.

211
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,020
These are communities of people that have come

212
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,700
together to build something big and amazing right

213
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:23,849
now, when we think of enterprise open source,

214
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,260
this is where you have like a company paying someone to do some work.

215
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,349
This is where like,

216
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,450
and I'm not just saying it has to live under the company's umbrella.

217
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,919
Like Red Hat pays people to work on x.org,

218
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,650
right?

219
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,419
That is their job.

220
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,010
It is why x.org works on a lot of hardware is because of these people,

221
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,770
if Red Hat stopped paying them,

222
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,419
they would stop. Well, some of them would keep doing it.

223
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,559
But the the amount of time they get to spend on it would

224
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,979
definitely decrease drastically as they have to do things to feed themselves,

225
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:54,809
for example.

226
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:55,380
Right.

227
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,780
And I think

228
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,780
that is where

229
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,500
we sometimes forget what is going on.

230
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,739
I think

231
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,539
when we're talking about like regular open source, like random people,

232
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:09,880
this is where we get back to that open source owes you nothing conversation.

233
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,179
Right. Like you can't expect random people to do your bidding.

234
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,799
They don't want to, they don't have to, it doesn't matter.

235
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:19,530
But now if we have open source from someone like Red Hat

236
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:20,830
where they're paying people to actually

237
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,099
do this stuff that changes the conversation

238
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:25,500
because now

239
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:30,950
you can say person I'm paying, I really want you to add this feature

240
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:31,890
and you know what?

241
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,609
They're probably gonna listen.

242
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,450
Well, and I mean, that goes to this whole low, moderate, high

243
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,530
urgent security bug thing where,

244
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:44,530
yeah, we're not gonna fix lows and moderates quickly because

245
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:49,400
it costs tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to

246
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,590
-- fix a security flaw and
-- every patch carries risk,

247
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:53,010
right?

248
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,450
Like,

249
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,669
and some are lower risk like fixing a pro

250
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,390
scripting flos or whatever. But some like heartbleed. Was it heartbleed?

251
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,979
That had the 30% performance CPU hit?

252
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,820
Uh No, it wasn't heartbleed. It was one of the,

253
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:08,640
one of the, the CPU bugs. I forget which one,

254
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:14,950
whatever the point is, you can't ship a patch that hammers 30% performance. Like

255
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,530
there's change, fatigue and change management fatigue.

256
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:19,219
Red

257
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,320
Hat can't

258
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,130
ship a security update every day for a package.

259
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,900
You kind of want to bundle them and patch

260
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:28,450
them like an extreme example would be Microsoft Tuesday.

261
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,820
Microsoft discovered that the industry is like, you know what, once a month is good,

262
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,190
maybe an emergency one once in a while,

263
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:35,929
but

264
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,710
-- once a month is good.
-- That's right. I mean, I remember when

265
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,849
Red Hat,

266
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,590
we tried to like cash things up and only release them at certain times.

267
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:48,710
And it's funny because you, you have both sides of this,

268
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:53,190
this scale where you would have people saying you're releasing updates too often.

269
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,150
I hate this

270
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,229
and, and then so we're like, ok,

271
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,950
we're going to batch them up and maybe every

272
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,559
other week we push all of our security updates.

273
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,390
Then you have people that,

274
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,830
oh my goodness.

275
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,359
I want these security updates right now. Like why are you waiting to give them to me?

276
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,539
-- And
-- this speaks to Redhead has many different

277
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:12,390
customers with many different capabilities and maturity levels.

278
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,989
Some and some just

279
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:17,700
can't. Like if you're running an oil refinery,

280
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:18,989
you can't just

281
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,190
update the computers,

282
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,119
you know, whenever and just reboot up, it'll be

283
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,030
-- fine.
-- It's probably fine. It's just a refinery

284
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,940
anyway. Ok, we're off track, we're off topic, we're off topic.

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,619
But I think the thing people forget is enterprise

286
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,969
software

287
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,450
doesn't have one cohesive set of customers with one

288
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,710
-- cohesive set of capabilities and wants and needs
-- and,

289
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,539
and open source

290
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,289
is exactly the same thing

291
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:45,929
you say open source

292
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,440
and depending upon who you say it to.

293
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,219
Some people might think of like people in their basement,

294
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,460
some people might think of Debbie and her alpine.

295
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:55,820
Some people might think of Google Chrome

296
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,280
and they are all technically open source.

297
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:02,210
Well, Google Chrome isn't chromium is, but they are technically open source,

298
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,330
but they functionally are not

299
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:05,010
right

300
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,250
because you, you have this huge collection of everything and they're all different

301
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,580
and not just different, different, but like wildly different cultures

302
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,109
and expectations.

303
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:16,869
So

304
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,559
the problem is,

305
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,659
I mean,

306
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,830
to write even a basic primer that explains all this would be

307
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,320
-- 3040 pages long and nobody would want to read it
-- 30 way,

308
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,200
way more than that.

309
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:28,400
Like,

310
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,830
it's funny because I'm going through the same thing with A I usage policy

311
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,419
and a lot of people are struggling in their head to be like,

312
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:34,799
well, is this for just business?

313
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:35,440
And I'm like, well,

314
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:40,510
no, it's for business, for schools, for academia, for people, for small companies,

315
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,369
big companies, government.

316
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,409
And they're like, well, what do we recommend? I'm like, oh my God.

317
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:46,770
Well, it like, it's different for each one of them,

318
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,489
right? It's wildly different.

319
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,830
And so part of the challenge is, is I can't actually necessarily tell you what

320
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,710
they should like what you should be doing,

321
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:57,830
but I can maybe offer you some options with some what we think the,

322
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,299
the upsides and downsides are

323
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,309
and tying that back into this conversation.

324
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:04,820
Like even if you have the capability to rapidly patch,

325
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,989
you might not want to because it might introduce more risk and cost than it's worth.

326
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,900
I mean, maybe depending on how you use it. Right. And so

327
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:18,500
even, even if you have this high level of maturity and the ability to do something

328
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:22,679
just because a business can do something doesn't mean it does.

329
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,770
Right.

330
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,489
-- Right. Right.
-- For sure. You know, and people forget these things.

331
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,690
So I think part of the challenge is

332
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,440
to put it bluntly, a lot of the people that work in open source, like

333
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,780
at scale on the enterprise and

334
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,799
they're not like talking about it on hacker news constantly or posting

335
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:43,659
blogs because,

336
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,090
well, when they try to post a blog, it has to go through legal first.

337
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,530
No. Like we, we had this at Red Hat, right.

338
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,760
We'd write stuff and it would have to go through legal and that's

339
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,989
like a fortune 500 is not going to let their co just randomly

340
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:57,559
spell

341
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,349
whatever's on the, at the front of their head

342
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,150
without it going through legal.

343
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,500
Because, you know,

344
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,219
we've seen what happens when people start doing that and it's just like,

345
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:08,710
-- oh, you
-- know what my favorite thing ever still is,

346
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:12,750
is one time I was writing something at Red Hat and I sent it to the legal team

347
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:13,489
and they,

348
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,070
they said we have to get rid of this paragraph

349
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,090
because it makes it sound like we're offering advice.

350
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:21,440
And I was like, the literal point of this blog post is advice and like, oh, never mind.

351
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,010
Then it's fine. I'm like, what, like, what just happened?

352
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:28,789
Like, whatever I know

353
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,140
what to

354
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:31,119
say it's published. I don't care anymore.

355
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:31,770
So,

356
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:33,419
yeah,

357
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,140
like, and that's the thing is there's, there's,

358
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,059
then there's all the competing business constraints and there's all these,

359
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,460
there's,

360
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:44,619
there's just shipping a patch that fixes the security problem is a very localized

361
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:49,150
maximum solution because it ignores a lot of other stuff

362
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:49,830
because it,

363
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,900
it can in the small open source universe where it's if like if someone like me,

364
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:59,750
I have a multitude of open source projects in my

365
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:00,400
github

366
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:02,070
name space

367
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,830
and most of them are abandoned because I like do a clever

368
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,869
thing I want to do and then I never do it again.

369
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:08,590
But

370
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,950
I have things that are, we'll say slightly longer lived.

371
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,909
And if I submit a patch to that or if I accept a pull request or something,

372
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,349
it's basically zero real effort for me, right? The cost is very minimal.

373
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,479
But now

374
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,849
when a an enterprise is going to submit a accept a pull request to their enterprise

375
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,690
github repo

376
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,979
and you see this all the time where like people submit things to Chromium

377
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:34,570
or whatever and then there's a lot of back and forth or to go

378
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:38,690
lang or Python or, or some of these bigger things and like Python's not enterprise,

379
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,890
right? That one is owned by a foundation but it still follows.

380
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,770
-- I think some of the enterprise rules,
-- well,

381
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,289
it's not that they follow enterprise rules per se.

382
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:50,010
It's, I think that they're aware of, oh, if we do this

383
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,679
-- local maximum solution it has these downsides. Right. Yeah,
-- that's true.

384
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,080
Because, like, if you read the Python has their pep,

385
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,880
I forget what the PEP stands for now.

386
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,559
-- Python enhancement proposal. Is it?
-- Ok?

387
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:05,719
But they, like, they have amazing discussions about what they want to do.

388
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,520
And it's a similar thing, right? Where

389
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,439
any decision they make any change they accept can have wide ranging consequences.

390
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,160
And more importantly,

391
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,108
they like test the crap out of their stuff. So that testing isn't free, right?

392
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,709
It costs money. I don't test my stuff because I don't care

393
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,020
but they're different,

394
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,060
not just the testing but making tests that are comprehensive.

395
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,910
And

396
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:34,489
the thing is like there's always 2nd, 3rd and 4th order impacts for doing something

397
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,349
a lot of the time. They don't really matter all that much.

398
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,290
So whatever, you know, just like fixing an html,

399
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,390
special care is missing in a PHP app is almost never going to have much of an impact.

400
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,910
But when you start

401
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,540
fiddling with stuff like Python,

402
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,349
which a

403
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,689
-- lot of the world runs on. I mean,
-- all of the programming languages work like this.

404
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,040
We're picking on Python, but literally if you go to go

405
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:57,290
or

406
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,150
rust or anything, it's the same story. Yeah.

407
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,800
I love when you see somebody make a proposal, like for c like,

408
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:04,729
let's add this thing to make it memory safe and everybody's like,

409
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:09,339
where do we even begin to explain how that breaks? Don't

410
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,060
touch anything?

411
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,660
Like,

412
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:14,079
like this Python Gull thing blows my

413
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:16,739
mind that they're even seriously considering the possibility

414
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,640
of talking about changing the color of the report cover to discuss a subcomittee.

415
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,180
-- No, the
-- gill

416
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:21,739
has to go.

417
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:22,619
But I mean,

418
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,089
but the fact that they're actually doing it is amazing

419
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,739
for no one knows there are people who don't know what they mean. So in Python

420
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:29,849
there is

421
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:31,219
what is Gill Stand for?

422
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:34,739
It's a global Lock, global interpreter lock, global interpreter lock, right?

423
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,020
And so even though Python has like multi threating libraries and things like that,

424
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,589
there's still functionally

425
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,819
a, a

426
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,430
global locking system

427
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,680
that when variables are what is being written to, I think it, it locks every thread

428
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,170
and it stops them

429
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,719
-- so
-- well. No. Yeah, it's more complicated.

430
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:57,160
Basically, it's, it's running one thing at a time in about 100

431
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,189
what is it? 100 tick increments

432
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,479
and when something goes to the network or goes to sleep, it releases the Gill,

433
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:05,439
which means you can actually do some very clever stuff.

434
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:06,962
Like I had some code I wrote

435
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,531
where it wasn't multi threaded,

436
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,932
but it didn't have to be multi threaded because it was doing a pile of DNS lookups.

437
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,222
And so I basically abused that the Gill exists by doing AAA

438
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,692
lot of DNS lookups in various threads and I didn't have to do any

439
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,982
thread management because they would essentially spend 99% of time out of Gill.

440
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:29,911
-- Like waiting for network replies.
-- The point is the Gill

441
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:33,784
is definitely something that affects the performance of Python.

442
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,203
It's so core and fundamental to the

443
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,384
way the language

444
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,713
culture works.

445
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:43,144
Like not even the technical working of the language, but just the culture around it.

446
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:44,333
And like, like I said,

447
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:48,343
I have written code that specifically takes advantage of the Gill behavior to,

448
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,904
to be very quick and efficient,

449
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:52,384
but regardless Gill has to go.

450
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:52,943
Right.

451
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,406
Oh, I agree. But I'm just saying like this is so foundational.

452
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,576
It's not even a technical foundation, it's a cultural foundation. It's

453
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:02,235
-- alright
-- that, that's some nonsense you're making up now.

454
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:03,995
Well, but the point is this is the,

455
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:07,046
this is the part of the difference between enterprise and open sources.

456
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:10,336
Enterprise has a different culture and different foundational.

457
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:13,556
This is open source now. It's not a difference.

458
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:17,656
But there is because the people using Red Hat enterprise, Linux

459
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:19,416
pay Red Hat

460
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:22,130
to take on that view to take on that.

461
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,250
What about the people running Python who don't

462
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,170
want Python to explode every other release,

463
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,199
which it kind of does.

464
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:29,430
But

465
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:30,349
right.

466
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,170
And they could pay Red Hat to keep back porting fixes to Python 3.10 or whatever.

467
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,640
No, no, that's not true at all because

468
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,599
I think if you look at, especially something like Python,

469
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,670
they have been

470
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:46,729
pretty consistent where you can run what they deliver

471
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,060
and not get it from Red Hat. Now,

472
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:50,650
I, I think

473
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,949
maybe a couple decades ago you wouldn't have been willing to take that bet.

474
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,239
But I think today a

475
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:59,910
lot of these like language ecosystems like N PM is a great example. Right?

476
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,579
No one's paying Red Hat to maintain N PM packages. You just YOLO that

477
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:08,020
-- and it kind of works.
-- That's something that has changed.

478
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,135
Like traditionally we had for a good example. This was post Chris SQL.

479
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:15,094
They were the poster child for good mature stable,

480
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,405
like it works

481
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,255
like it's good

482
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:19,314
and you know,

483
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:21,275
and even they're talking about getting rid of that or they

484
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:26,165
did get rid of vacuum basically and huge performance enhancements and operational

485
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:27,344
improvements.

486
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:28,094
But,

487
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,800
and maybe that's part of what's also happening is

488
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,869
open source is maturing because it has to be because

489
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,969
like we're using it for real work now to run the world.

490
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,150
I mean, right. It's not just the world running some random person's blog website.

491
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,300
It it's ebay, it's Google, it's,

492
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,739
it's all the websites, everyone,

493
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,910
everyone and everything

494
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:52,949
and, but the problem is it's still you can't.

495
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,750
And maybe that's part of the challenge is that some of the

496
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,579
culture and some of the community hasn't caught up and probably

497
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:02,150
never will because they don't have to care about it.

498
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,949
They don't want to care about it and if it blows up too bad don't use it.

499
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,810
Yeah. Well, because open source isn't one thing.

500
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,469
I mean, I think we, we, we do this,

501
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,939
everyone does this where I think the world often

502
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:17,390
forgets that open source is this huge cornucopia of everything

503
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,510
and some of it is enterprises and they're gonna act

504
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,709
like enterprises and that doesn't make it less open source.

505
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,550
-- I mean, it makes it maybe less community focused but,
-- well,

506
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,390
there's not even an agreement on what defines an open source license.

507
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,199
Like, you know, a lot of people,

508
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,880
no, there's an agreement.

509
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,849
It's what the O SI says is an open source license which I don't like. But,

510
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,060
and a lot of people disagree with that.

511
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:41,979
-- Look,
-- you can disagree with that, but legally speaking,

512
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:45,969
the open source trademark is quite clear on this matter, like

513
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:50,219
I don't like it, but that is the technical legal definition.

514
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,979
The thing is that you don't need to use that

515
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:52,660
to

516
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:54,579
do open source.

517
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:55,000
I mean,

518
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,599
you can just go do reasonably or less or more open source or public domain even.

519
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,819
But, um, I think

520
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,739
the challenge is a lot of this stuff,

521
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,339
especially in the enterprise world kind of happens behind closed doors.

522
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:07,660
It,

523
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,439
there's boring conversations between boring companies that

524
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:12,859
don't post the things to hacker news.

525
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:14,400
Boring is good.

526
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,099
Yeah.

527
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,060
And I think a lot of people forget this and,

528
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:22,050
or they're not even aware of it because reading some of what people have proposed,

529
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,369
it's like you've really never had to keep a system up and

530
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,979
-- running 24 7 because it's doing something important to have
-- you.

531
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,849
It's funny you bring this up because I

532
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:31,439
had this discussion with someone literally yesterday,

533
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:32,699
we're recording this on a Monday.

534
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:33,819
It was over the weekend

535
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:34,660
and

536
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:37,680
it is common for us to forget

537
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:38,619
that

538
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:43,550
the boring stuff is like what keeps the lights on and keeps society

539
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,880
functioning and that's not the stuff that gets accepted to conference talks.

540
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,420
It's not the stuff that ends up on the front page of hacker news or,

541
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,760
or whatever site we're using now to,

542
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:55,380
to view news. You know what I mean?

543
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,069
And I think that's one of the things we often forget about is

544
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,050
we live in this environment that's just trying to sensationalize literally

545
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,640
everything and everything doesn't have to be sensational or exciting.

546
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,260
Like it's ok to be a little bit on the boring side.

547
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,459
Well, you know, when I, whenever I look at the skater world,

548
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,050
yeah.

549
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,819
Oh, wait, now we finally have a dashboard and we can see the status of the,

550
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,180
the system or the plant

551
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:24,099
or, you know, I know somebody that built the dashboard for, um, a large

552
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,579
oil producer. And when I say large oil producer, they're the ones

553
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:30,689
that basically they have an income equivalent to a large nation state

554
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,979
and they wanted,

555
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:34,000
they basically now have a dashboard where they can

556
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,270
see the state of all their offshore oil rigs,

557
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,920
which is,

558
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,819
it's a lot.

559
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:41,170
I mean, that's pretty cool and having that situational awareness. I know. Yeah,

560
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:42,900
you're like,

561
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,020
you can't just go monkeying with that and start patching it

562
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,979
like it needs to work,

563
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,530
even though it's not a safety critical or even it's

564
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,800
just literally for the executive to see what's going on,

565
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,459
you can't break it

566
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,469
well, and, and

567
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,160
again, this comes to your 2nd and 3rd order effects. What if,

568
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:05,199
what if an attacker uses your dashboard to then get to the oil rig to that?

569
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:06,250
You know what I mean? Like,

570
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,530
there's so many other pieces to all of this that you often don't even think about.

571
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:10,920
But again,

572
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,094
this is where if you're a large company,

573
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:16,395
you have groups of people thinking about this stuff.

574
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:19,244
So the person building the dashboard isn't the security team

575
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:22,484
thinking about how are we making sure that our,

576
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:26,525
our offshore oil platforms aren't targets of malicious activity?

577
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:30,569
Yeah, I mean, by definition, to start specializing into security,

578
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:33,449
you need a group of at least 10 or 20 people probably.

579
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,670
And a lot of open source projects are not

580
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,900
anywhere. Well, they're in the single digits and that's fine.

581
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,829
Look, most development teams

582
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,709
will never reach that point either. And that's ok.

583
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,359
It's,

584
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,790
and that's why people pay Red Hat is. So that Red Hat internally has that. Right.

585
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,810
Right. For sure,

586
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:55,050
for sure. It's it's why you work with a lot of vendors

587
00:25:55,489 --> 00:26:00,219
because the reality is I mean, this is Tomaz, I am not a supplier, right? Like

588
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:03,229
you can't make demands of a supplier.

589
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:06,469
But now if my supplier

590
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,869
is an enterprise

591
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,770
that has an open source project,

592
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,410
I can make demands on that project, right?

593
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,349
Well, and not even that you can make demands,

594
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,430
you can negotiate with them and say basically like I want X, what do you need for

595
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:20,109
X to be accomplished? And

596
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:23,699
quite often and the answer is like the pile of money needs to be this high.

597
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,380
Right? No, but that's, and that's how things get done

598
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:27,319
and it's

599
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:27,479
fine,

600
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,410
you

601
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,560
know, and a lot of, there's not a lot, I don't know,

602
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:33,439
but there's a bunch of open source developers that have said similar things like,

603
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:34,030
oh, you want a

604
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:36,030
fine hire me as a consultant

605
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,109
and it amuses me when people become offended by that because it's like

606
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,260
if you are working with a company, if you have a vendor,

607
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,579
if you asked me to mow your lawn, I would want money.

608
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,050
Why is software? Why is putting my effort into running software any different?

609
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,709
That's a good analogy. I'm gonna steal that one, I think. But yeah, for real.

610
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:58,619
-- No,
-- like really, it blows my mind that they ask for free work and it's not just

611
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,329
even, it's not, it's not inconsequential, simple work.

612
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:06,410
It, it's hours that I could be spending playing with my Children or

613
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:07,209
doing some

614
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:07,569
money

615
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,010
to pay the rent or

616
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:12,650
which I need to do because it rained last night and holy jeez things getting long.

617
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:16,699
But it blows my mind that these people demand

618
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:21,880
-- free work and I guess they do because there's no downside like there's no,
-- well, not,

619
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,180
not just that look,

620
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,839
I think the nature of open source to this point has been that

621
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:31,380
old saying of we've done so much with so little for so long,

622
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,839
we can do anything with nothing.

623
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:33,869
And

624
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,390
it has been trivial

625
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:40,180
to just go into the open source wilds

626
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,239
and emerge with the solution you need for the particular problem.

627
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,380
You have be it github

628
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:47,660
or stack overflow or whatever.

629
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,160
I cobble stuff together all the time where I'm like,

630
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,630
I

631
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,479
had

632
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,239
7 billion parameter llama running on my desktop here.

633
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,329
I managed to shoehorn it into a 12 and a four gigabyte video card

634
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,500
with like

635
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,500
1.5 gigs of VRM to, to spare.

636
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,329
Like I got that working in about an hour and a half,

637
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,719
like setting up his own large language model.

638
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,834
-- That's a I nonsense for those of you playing along,
-- right?

639
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:14,275
Like this is, it's ridiculous that I can do that.

640
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:15,344
And so now I, you know, I,

641
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:18,994
I basically spent 800 bucks Canadian on two video cards so I can reliably do it.

642
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:21,444
-- But
-- if you're using Lama, are you using github's

643
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:25,805
data that basically says like you can't be mean to us if you use this data

644
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:28,459
isn't, doesn't or not, or Facebook, right.

645
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:31,400
Doesn't Facebook's license have some, like ridiculous terms.

646
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,180
The way, the way the Facebook

647
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:34,869
and I'm making air quotes here, the open

648
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:36,300
source license. The biggest point is

649
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,560
I cannot build a project that will have over 700 million users,

650
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:42,180
which is a suspiciously specific number that I think.

651
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:45,239
-- Well,
-- isn't there some other nonsense in their license? Yeah.

652
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,569
There's a couple of things that you can't do it for

653
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:47,770
Schengen.

654
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,339
Like it's not

655
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:51,670
-- open source and it's ridiculous, but
-- whatever,

656
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
it's open source enough and it will be useful to me to get

657
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:59,160
-- to solve problems I need to solve.
-- That's fair. But it's not open source anyway.

658
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,020
OK. Not legally or trademark wise, open source. But you know what?

659
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,189
It's open source enough that I don't care and more of the point it's free and I like

660
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,479
free because free fits my budget quite well and

661
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:11,510
even better because it's free and open source ish.

662
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,310
There's a lot of people

663
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,199
using it and there's an ecosystem building up and growing up around it.

664
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,489
So there's tutorials, there's plugins, there's

665
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:21,760
like, there's all that stuff I want, I don't want just software. I want an ecosystem.

666
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:23,400
And that's why,

667
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,140
for example, when I run Linux,

668
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,079
I run stuff like ubuntu because there's a big enough ecosystem around it

669
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,760
that most of the problems I'm going to run into somebody else already. Did and

670
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,319
put on a blog that

671
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,619
the search engine can find and so I can fix it quickly

672
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:39,140
because

673
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:39,369
I

674
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:39,619
don't,

675
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:42,920
I have spent enough of my life being the first one to

676
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,959
find a flaw and then fix it and document that fix.

677
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,069
Like that's how I got my career. I wrote the Linux

678
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,839
Administrative Security Guide because I literally,

679
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,839
I remember I was connected to the internet by a 19 or

680
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,819
was it 14, 4 dial up then? 19? Yeah, it was 14 4 dial up to begin with.

681
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:01,640
Yeah, because my friend had a nice 600 bo modem.

682
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,709
So, yeah, anyways, I could connect to the internet 14 4 dial up

683
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:06,430
and I was connecting out to stuff and I

684
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,430
had this sudden epiphany one afternoon where I'm like,

685
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,650
wait a minute, I can connect to anything on the internet.

686
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,609
They can connect to me.

687
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:14,089
How exciting.

688
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,160
And that's what I realized. I'm like, I need to do something about it. So

689
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,920
again, like there's a lot of people out there.

690
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,439
How do I put it nicely?

691
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:26,170
I want my computer to you to do useful things and even better yet. I will pay money

692
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:28,645
for that to happen with less pain.

693
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:30,255
And you look at a lot of people with

694
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:32,285
hobbies like there are some expensive hobbies out there.

695
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:35,234
Like I remember Linus Torvalds talking about his swim flippers where he spent like

696
00:30:35,454 --> 00:30:38,494
hundreds of dollars on these swim flippers that are like 10% more efficient.

697
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:41,214
But if you're really into scuba diving, that's a massive

698
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,359
-- improvement. Uh,
-- scuba diving gear. Well, not only that scuba diving gear is like,

699
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:50,510
it's keeping you alive underwater. Don't keep out on that stuff. You know,

700
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,609
like, I mean, you have a proper bike that will last more than a couple of 100 miles.

701
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,829
I imagine it costs more than 500 bucks.

702
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,280
Uh, my bicycle was actually, it's, it's like 10 years old now

703
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,550
and it was about $500 when I bought it.

704
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,489
But now the equivalent bike is, I think, I think I looked at the bike store.

705
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,670
I like going to the bike store

706
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:15,689
and I think the current bike I have is about $900

707
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:18,550
and it's a little nicer than mine. But at the same time, like,

708
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,729
I like my bike.

709
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,050
It's, I probably have 5 to 7000 miles on that bike

710
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,489
and I've replaced many pieces of it many times.

711
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,290
But I like the bike and it's funny because I bring it in.

712
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,729
They're like, we can sell you a new bike. I'm like, yeah, I like this bike.

713
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:35,770
Like, I don't want, I don't want a new bike. I want this bike.

714
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,869
-- So,
-- but I think ultimately,

715
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,890
I think the biggest thing is people need to be aware that

716
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,349
there's more to the world than just what they

717
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,420
see in their village or city or whatever.

718
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,869
II, I think that's not a problem necessarily I think that

719
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,439
-- you
-- can't go visit the Enterprise world without going and working for them.

720
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,790
-- Uh,
-- that, that is,

721
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:56,660
I think that is a good way to end this.

722
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,949
Yes, I think the enter, it's, it is enterprise, open source. It exists.

723
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:03,020
It is technically open source but

724
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,160
it,

725
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,770
it doesn't work the way we often think of open source and it doesn't have to.

726
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,329
Yeah, I mean,

727
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:11,339
the only reason I actually know anything about skater is

728
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:13,790
my sister's a PM for a large skater firm.

729
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,989
That's cool. Like,

730
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:15,609
that's

731
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:17,750
otherwise I would know nothing about skater.

732
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:18,709
Yeah.

733
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,280
And how would I find, like,

734
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,140
they're not publishing blogs about how I built this cool thing for whatever,

735
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,469
or there's a new technique like those are

736
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:30,770
-- things that they charge money for. Right.
-- Right. Oh, exactly. For sure. Right.

737
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,869
And also they're too busy to write that stuff and

738
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,229
also legal would never let them talk about it.

739
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:35,829
Oh, man.

740
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,329
Imagine what like the government would do if all

741
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,560
of the skated details were suddenly being blogged about,

742
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:41,630
they would lose their minds.

743
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,479
-- Well,
-- like when Schneider

744
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:45,900
Electric became AC N A CV Numbering authority and started publishing CV,

745
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,750
S for Schnyder Electric stuff, it was like

746
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,790
a lot of people freaked out.

747
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,459
You're not supposed to talk about security flaws in, in hardware dear. But,

748
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,839
like, again,

749
00:32:57,439 --> 00:33:00,839
it's not that I don't want to replace my Schneider electronic relays.

750
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:01,959
They're, you know,

751
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,599
at the bottom of an oil well, under 2000 ft of water.

752
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,109
Uh

753
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,430
We like,

754
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,760
yeah, not a lot we can do with that. All right. Anyway, I'm kind of so

755
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,329
we're, we're, we're rambling now.

756
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,770
Thank you, Kurt. Thank you all for listening. Go to social security podcast.com.

757
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,550
Hit up the show. Not easy.

758
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:18,770
Podos

759
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,400
says podcast hashtag on Mastodon to get our attention.

760
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:23,930
Kurt have a marvelous.

761
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,069
Yeah, I deleted my Twitter or I didn't, I, I,

762
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,030
-- I closed up my
-- Twitter account. I deleted mine. It's been gone for a while.

763
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:30,550
-- I
-- haven't

764
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,040
-- deleted it because I don't want somebody to squat the name.
-- You know what?

765
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,430
At first I thought that but I'm like, you know what?

766
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,790
-- I don't even care if someone wants to squat me. Go
-- for it.

767
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I suspect in six months it won't matter anymore

768
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,410
-- because I think I
-- don't think it matters now

769
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:44,609
-- is I
-- would, I would view someone squatting my Twitter name as the,

770
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:48,270
the ultimate form of appreciation we'll say

771
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:49,400
so.

772
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,890
Kurt have a marvelous rest of your day.

773
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:54,979
-- You too. Thanks everybody.
-- Thanks everyone. Bye bye.
