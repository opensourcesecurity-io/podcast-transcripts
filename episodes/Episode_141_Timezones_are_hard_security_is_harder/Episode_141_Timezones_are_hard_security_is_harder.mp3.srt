Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 141 with myself,

1
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:10,539
Kurt Siefried

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,609
and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser. So, how you doing, man?

3
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:16,290
Better spring break went well. Yeah. Right. Right.

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,549
By the time this is out, we'll hopefully know how Brexit went.

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,559
And then I'm, I'm going to assume it gets worse.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,870
I,

7
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,850
yes, I, I'm not, I'm not even to think about it. I,

8
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,590
the more I know the, the sadder I get,

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,909
I think at this point,

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,680
all I can say about Brexit is the problem isn't Brexit anymore.

11
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:36,970
The problem is that the British government

12
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,779
doesn't work and I don't mean in the sense of like,

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,270
the current political parties are like f bar but I mean,

14
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:43,750
like the whole system doesn't work

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,069
like representative democracy in that country is broken.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,270
I'm not even going to start on this one man because there's,

17
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:54,189
that's a rathole we will never escape from, but we'll just leave it with.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,369
-- Well, and I suspect Canada and the US are not far behind. All
-- right.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,909
So, so let's do this since this is before

20
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,290
April 12th,

21
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,160
which is the new crash out date for Brexit and I'll use

22
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:07,230
the word crash out because I think that's where I may,

23
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,370
-- oh,
-- regardless of what happens, it's going to be a disaster.

24
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:13,239
I see three possibilities and let's, let's predict it now and we'll find it later.

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,010
So there's either,

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,650
-- uh, they revoke Brexit and don't do it,
-- revoke article 50

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,849
right. Revoke article 50. They crash out hard or they come up with a compromise.

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,040
What do you think is going to happen?

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,940
They absolutely can't come up with a

30
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:27,010
compromise because internally they can't negotiate it.

31
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,110
And also the eu states, one of them will veto it.

32
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:33,470
So that leaves you with either revoke article 50 or crash out hard.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,389
And

34
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:35,830
I hate to say it, but

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,290
if they were going to revoke article 50 wouldn't they have done it by now?

36
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:43,510
I tend to agree. So we both, we both agree, crash out hard. That's our prediction.

37
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,949
I'm thinking hard, Brexit and like complete

38
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:47,989
cluster.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,059
I'm going to stock up on beans because while I don't think it will affect me,

40
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,300
technical

41
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:56,370
one never knows. And it's always good to have a surplus supply of canned beans.

42
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,639
What really gets me is that they can't even

43
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,650
import enough extra medicine to hold over for shortages

44
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,400
because they don't even have enough refrigerated warehouse space.

45
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,480
It's

46
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:07,419
like

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,429
second order problems, man. I love it anyway.

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,929
Anyway, let's, I'm not going to let us rattle on this.

49
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,500
We're going to find out when this publishes, if they crash out and I Lord knows,

50
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,740
I hope we're wrong because

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,100
that's the worst possible option. But anyway, all right, that's enough.

52
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,839
That's enough. That's enough. We don't, we don't need to do this.

53
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,960
I hope they survive it.

54
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:28,619
Yes.

55
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:29,600
Right. Me.

56
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,464
May God be with you all? That's,

57
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:31,835
yeah.

58
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:36,384
So, I guess, well, and this is kind of feeds into that, that whole, like, who knew?

59
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:41,195
-- This could be so complicated, kind of class of problem. Oh,
-- security is easy, right?

60
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:43,115
Like everything is easy. It's fine.

61
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,535
I think somebody came up with it last week was

62
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:48,085
that we just train all the developers to do security.

63
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:49,675
Why did we think of that before?

64
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:52,514
I know it's been 50 years and we just, we got this one thing wrong.

65
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,240
-- I, I know. Right.
-- Right. Right. Exactly.

66
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:58,899
So, so you say that and this is something I've,

67
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,809
I've started doing some research into the history of aviation because this is

68
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,550
like we can't train developers

69
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:07,039
and at the same time, I've, I've come to realize just

70
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:10,490
security is on fire so much all the time.

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,130
I like,

72
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:15,119
I never have 10 minutes to just sit down and say what happened and how do we prevent it,

73
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,509
-- you know? Yeah,
-- we never have time for a good post mortem

74
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,320
followed by actually fixing the root causes.

75
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,210
-- And
-- so anyway, I'm,

76
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,309
I'm curious if this is how industries evolve or if we're special and I,

77
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,369
I don't know the answer yet.

78
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,809
-- I'm, I'm trying to find out,
-- typically, industries evolve this way,

79
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,009
but part of it is industries typically get

80
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,279
sort of a, a

81
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,279
comprehensive body of knowledge of engineering.

82
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:37,809
So for example,

83
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,009
I was at the university bookstore one time and I remember seeing this book,

84
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,649
it was about three inches thick hard cover

85
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:47,070
and it was a manual for civil engineers specifically on roads. That's it.

86
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,720
And things like, you know, what angle do you make the road to bank it on a curve?

87
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,410
You know, how do you do drainage? How do

88
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,690
you, you know what, what layers of the road do you need,

89
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,470
say in a warm climate versus in a climate like mine where we have lots of frost heave

90
00:03:58,679 --> 00:03:59,270
and just,

91
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,589
but they have this body of knowledge of like, OK, you have problem X.

92
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,970
Well, you can solve it

93
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:04,990
with, you know,

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,190
technique A B and Q or you can do this

95
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,309
other thing that also works and it's known to work.

96
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,330
Whereas in software,

97
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:14,910
well, let me put it this way. How many web servers can you pick from at this point?

98
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,369
Over 1000?

99
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:17,000
I,

100
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,829
I would say there's probably 10, you could practically choose.

101
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,390
Well, no, no, no, I'm I'm also talking about like the,

102
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,269
the language specific things like say flask or you know,

103
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,769
Python flask or ruby on rails,

104
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,390
Puma or

105
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,670
just all the, you know, all the different things that basically are like hi

106
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,989
you can talk to me with http

107
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,859
like restful api

108
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,190
how many things provide that?

109
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,100
I, I bet you could.

110
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,850
-- And the answer is thousands.
-- It is thousands.

111
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:49,100
I bet though the practical answer is 100 which is still ridiculous

112
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:50,359
-- or
-- something is quote

113
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,559
unquote, simple ruby on rails. What's the asset pipeline?

114
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,420
Well, currently they're moving to a new thing called Web pack.

115
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,869
Away from the old one which I don't even remember the name of.

116
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,540
And so part of the problem is we just,

117
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,100
we don't have established like we don't have a good mix for concrete.

118
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:03,839
Yeah,

119
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,739
we don't even have a way to measure if our concrete is strong.

120
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,989
I know you've been working on that.

121
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,079
-- I
-- I am and

122
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,010
yeah, but that, that's a good point. I got, you got me thinking now anyway,

123
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:17,130
so

124
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,690
I ran across this article that I love is, which is

125
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,480
so the eu is getting rid of daylight savings,

126
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:28,100
which I 100% support like changing the clocks is some bs, sorry folks.

127
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:31,709
But that whole World War Two thing needs to go away. And so they're getting rid of it.

128
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,470
Great.

129
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,260
How do you store a date and time accurately?

130
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,559
Especially when you have things like time zones and

131
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,279
especially things like time zones that do change,

132
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:40,510
right.

133
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,309
That's something

134
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,720
I always took for granted as a kid because like I

135
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,790
live in a time zone that actually has been basically the same

136
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,070
for a long time.

137
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,369
Um, but time zones do change.

138
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,010
I lived through this once, I,

139
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,720
I used to live in the State of Indiana in the United States.

140
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,290
And when I moved there, when I was fresh out of college,

141
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,510
they did not,

142
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,809
they did not observe daylight savings time,

143
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:05,399
which,

144
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,649
when I was there I thought was super annoying because basically the

145
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,459
whole rest of the country was observing it for the most part,

146
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,609
everyone I interacted with.

147
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:14,100
And it really sucked being

148
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:18,329
the one place that didn't. And so when they wanted to change the time zone,

149
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:21,320
I said that's great. Let's totally do that.

150
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,959
And then I hated it. So,

151
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:28,119
-- and actually there's because you
-- had to fix all your computers.

152
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,950
Well, there's a second problem to that too is

153
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,619
they put us in the eastern time zone when we

154
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,320
were extremely far west in the eastern time zone.

155
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:42,730
And so it ended up being light out until 10 pm in the summer.

156
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,380
And that kind of sucked rocks too.

157
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,049
I bet the reason they did that simply was for economic reasons.

158
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:51,029
-- So,
-- here's, here's part of the challenge that came with it is when the,

159
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,559
the then governor, his name was Mitch Daniels.

160
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,230
I remember that

161
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:58,540
he, he kind of, part of his campaign promise was we're going to

162
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,209
observe daylight savings time and we're going to be in the central time zone. Right.

163
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,429
And we thought, oh, that's neat.

164
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:08,070
Uh, it turns out the states don't get to choose the, the Federal Trade Commission.

165
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,589
I think it is, tells you what time zone you're in and you can't, you can't like

166
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:11,839
the

167
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:13,190
-- States.
-- Right.

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,720
No.

169
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,279
Right. Exactly. And there was nothing

170
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,459
we could

171
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:16,600
-- do.
-- It. Kind of,

172
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,269
it was actually as well.

173
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:18,730
It was

174
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:18,920
crazy.

175
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,279
Wow. That, that's kind of bonkers

176
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,920
is sort of, but not really.

177
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:24,119
I mean,

178
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,350
I guess the issue I could see is they don't want like one state

179
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,299
in the middle of the country deciding we're on the eastern time zone now.

180
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,399
And

181
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,839
you can't just do that. You idiots but whatever, whatever.

182
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,390
Anyway, back to the topic. So

183
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,820
this one came up as really interesting when you,

184
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,410
when you mentioned it because like you said,

185
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,209
it feels like dealing with time should be really easy.

186
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,299
Oh,

187
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,649
-- easy.
-- Right. Just fix

188
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,760
it and, and kind of using the parallel of security here.

189
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:47,859
It's very similar of,

190
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:50,920
there's lots of things we do in security that feel like it should be easy,

191
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,619
but it's actually really hard to do.

192
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,279
And I think the time zones are a unique thing

193
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,459
for us to discuss in the context of security because

194
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,470
people generally understand time zones

195
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,929
and they're way harder than people can imagine.

196
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,179
-- People have a superficial understanding of time zones,
-- right?

197
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,660
Just like security, right?

198
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:13,459
And so the worst thing is they, they think they understand it but they really don't.

199
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:13,940
And,

200
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,649
and it's also worth mentioning that the planet has literally

201
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,720
hundreds of time zones and we always think of,

202
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,869
-- oh, there's like, uh,
-- thousands,

203
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,140
there, there's 24 of them.

204
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,100
Is it is. It could be thousands. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised at that.

205
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:28,799
But we always imagine there's 24 but they're totally honest.

206
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,950
Well, there's so there's, obviously there's 24 time zones.

207
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,200
There's also the half hour, 15 minute ones.

208
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:36,760
But then there's all the different, like, daylight savings

209
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,640
or daylight standard or all that kind of stuff where, you know,

210
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,140
your time changes throughout the year.

211
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,679
And so if you count sort of each jurisdiction

212
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,859
that has its own set of unique kind of

213
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:51,460
time zone rules laws, whatever, then it's, it's my understanding is it's like

214
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,109
probably close to 1000.

215
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:56,309
Go look at the time zone file on your UNIX machine that's maintained by that one guy.

216
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,859
Remember?

217
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,270
It's enormous

218
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,989
and, well, so there, there's a reason for that though.

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,380
And here's, here's what it comes down to and I'll, I'll,

220
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,119
I'll set the table here because this is something I had

221
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,890
to deal with back when Indiana changed the time zone is.

222
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,380
So

223
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:12,570
let's say you have a, a time stamp

224
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,450
saved in a file, right?

225
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,520
And you need to say, what is this, let's say, what is this UTC time

226
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,479
in

227
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:23,859
whatever time zone I want. We'll say at, at the time it was called Indiana.

228
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:28,409
Us East is what I was in because we had our own time zone because we were a weird place.

229
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,770
So anyway, the thing is

230
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,659
you have to look at the time and then decide where in

231
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:36,539
history is it from and what was the time zone back then?

232
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:41,130
Because obviously if I look at the time zone, say from 1990 in Indiana,

233
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,330
there's no daylight savings time.

234
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,599
Right.

235
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,969
So I've got to take that into account, but if I look at a time,

236
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:47,039
say now they're totally observing it.

237
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,609
And so that makes it really difficult.

238
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:51,929
And you have to think there are places that change time zones on a

239
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,710
sadly regular basis where they're either adding an hour or subtracting an hour.

240
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:58,309
They're observing daylight savings or not observing daylight savings.

241
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,169
-- And it's, well,
-- they're skipping a day.

242
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:02,479
-- Right. Right.
-- That's what Samoa did.

243
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,210
They,

244
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:06,219
they basically skipped forward a day because so that they were

245
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:08,679
-- more in line with the people they do business with
-- which,

246
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,690
which makes sense

247
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:10,530
because

248
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,609
it was, yeah, here we go

249
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,770
in doing business with New Zealand and Australia.

250
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,869
We're losing out on two working days a week. Mr, and I can't pronounce his name.

251
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,890
Tuil, a

252
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,080
apostrophe or no hyphen

253
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:20,479
or

254
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,210
whatever epa said

255
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,330
while it's Friday here at Saturday, New Zealand, when we're at church on Sunday,

256
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,679
they're already conducting business in Sydney and Brisbane.

257
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,489
So Samoa was just over the Dateline

258
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,809
and they skipped

259
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,849
forwards to be like,

260
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:36,239
so that they could do business with the people they do business with.

261
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:36,820
And,

262
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:38,719
you know, And that totally makes sense. Yeah.

263
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,539
But, and again, like, your Indiana thing,

264
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,570
I'm guessing that's why they picked the ST, because,

265
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,010
you know, being, like, no offense central,

266
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,729
my understanding of the central US is it's a bunch of farmers, right.

267
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,659
Uh, generally speaking,

268
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:53,479
Chicago is kind of the big city there that you'd often deal with.

269
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:54,599
And, and again,

270
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,789
when, I mean, I was a remote employee,

271
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,960
generally dealing with people on the east coast.

272
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:00,960
And so for half the year

273
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:04,549
I'd be in their time zone in half the year I wouldn't be.

274
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,869
And this was before Google calendar existed.

275
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,349
And so scheduling meetings is a freaking night.

276
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,489
Well,

277
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,770
it's still a nightmare because like dealing with people

278
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,150
in Australia because they have the opposite daylight savings.

279
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:17,119
So all of a sudden it's not that we're one hour apart, we're two hours.

280
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,859
No, there's a simple solution to this. I've discovered

281
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,349
you schedule the meeting

282
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,669
and you can click a box that says, allow guests to modify event

283
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,299
and in the invite you say, if this time doesn't work for you, please move it

284
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,510
and then it's not your problem.

285
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:32,030
Well, no, but I mean,

286
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,640
just something that's a regular meeting all of a

287
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,760
sudden for one of you shifts two hours.

288
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,659
-- It does. It
-- does.

289
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,239
And, and I have some standing meetings just like that with Australia, in fact,

290
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,169
and II, I just always tell him like, I've got that box ticked.

291
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,960
I say, look, guys if this doesn't work.

292
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:47,969
But I don't care, I'll, I'll, I'll show up when the meeting is,

293
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,309
-- this
-- is why in my calendar I'm marked when I'm sleeping.

294
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,679
So that, and vice versa, I tell people I deal with and,

295
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,030
you know, because I was talking with one of my coworkers and, and she's like, oh,

296
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,500
it's getting really

297
00:11:56,684 --> 00:11:57,765
here. And I'm like, what? It's like lunch.

298
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,094
She's like, no, no, it's like eight o'clock at night.

299
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:04,594
And I'm like, uh, where are you in, in Berlin? 00. Right. Right.

300
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,655
-- We have an office there. I forgot about that.
-- No, I agree. I do the same thing.

301
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:08,655
I block off

302
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:11,265
because they all speak really. They speak better English than I do.

303
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:12,695
I know. It's so funny.

304
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,289
I love it. But, yeah. No, I, I totally do that on my calendar.

305
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:18,039
I block off all kinds of crazy stuff.

306
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:21,109
Yeah, I just tell people if, if I have a free slot on my calendar,

307
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,950
I will show up if there is anything else there, I will decline this meeting.

308
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,780
I don't care if you think it's less important than your thing. Like

309
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,849
full stop. That is my policy. Anyway.

310
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:32,469
-- Anyway, we're talking about time zones, not ranting about meetings.
-- So, yeah.

311
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:35,229
So you have a time zone. You, well, and here's part of the problem,

312
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,169
you better have that.

313
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,969
I'm hoping that you store the time zone in UTZUTC

314
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:42,719
because if you don't store it in UTC,

315
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,890
then you've just opened up a whole other can of worms.

316
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,890
-- The time stamp, you don't UTC is a time zone.
-- Sorry.

317
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,349
Uh Yeah, you better store your time stamp in UTC otherwise.

318
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,049
Well, what happens if you don't store your time stamp in UTC?

319
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,119
Uh I mean, look, there's nothing that necessarily makes it wrong.

320
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,549
It just creates some extra pain when you're

321
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,320
trying to process the dates because now you,

322
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,359
you probably have to load the time

323
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,450
and make sure the time zone is correct in whatever library you're using.

324
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,799
And then depending upon what you're doing,

325
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:12,969
you may have to turn it into UTC and then turn it into something else.

326
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:13,200
Just,

327
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:16,294
there's a lot of crazy things that get involved here.

328
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,344
-- U
-- TC is sort of that, that it's the lowest common denominator.

329
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:25,114
And so that in my mind is why you should always store your time stamps in UTC.

330
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,854
Yeah, I agree completely. It, it just makes life easier.

331
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:29,965
I've been.

332
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:33,244
Although, so here's one of the funny things you'll love is when,

333
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,229
when I lived in Indiana

334
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,190
and we were changing our clocks, actually, windows was very,

335
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,159
very late to pick up on this time zone.

336
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:44,219
Change the open source world, of course, got it right immediately.

337
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:45,650
And there were no issues but

338
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:48,700
the people on the news were telling everyone just, yeah,

339
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,260
on this day just change your clocks to Eastern time.

340
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,349
Right. That's your time zone.

341
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,340
-- It's like,
-- no,

342
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:55,380
that's

343
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:55,580
no,

344
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:55,820
that's

345
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,219
wrong.

346
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,369
But I'm not going to argue with you.

347
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,820
In fact, I worked at a company that,

348
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,150
that's what they did to their servers and I'm like, you know what,

349
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,200
this isn't worth arguing with you,

350
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:05,299
whatever.

351
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:06,099
Right.

352
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:09,919
Right. Good enough. Eventually they got it. But,

353
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,460
yeah, whatever

354
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,619
it was, it was very silly.

355
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:14,340
And,

356
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,289
but again, time

357
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:15,559
zone

358
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,580
are you gonna do

359
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,809
well and especially if your vendor doesn't support it.

360
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,539
What literally are you going to do?

361
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:23,419
-- You're
-- going to change your clock to be on the eastern time zone.

362
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,150
That's what you a

363
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:25,849
calendar reminder.

364
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,179
Pretty much it, it was, it was very silly. But anyway, anyway, so

365
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,299
this is a security podcast.

366
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,460
So, so here's the thing I always think of,

367
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:39,099
especially in the context of time is time

368
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:42,700
is one of those fundamentals that as a species

369
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:46,340
we accept and deal with on a regular basis just because it's like,

370
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:48,260
it's a truth of the universe as much as I

371
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,309
wish the arrow of time wasn't one direction it is.

372
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:52,679
So that's the way it goes.

373
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,760
And,

374
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,330
and like this is something

375
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:57,969
humans understand from birth,

376
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:01,289
whether we know it or not and we struggle to get it right.

377
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,070
And now we want to talk about security and say, oh,

378
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,020
just teach people security or read this or learn that or something.

379
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:14,429
And it's like this is so foreign to us as, as mammals that you just, you can't learn it.

380
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,979
-- Oh,
-- and actually you know what you and I got a fundamental thing wrong,

381
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:21,409
this whole conversation, you and I were wrong about something.

382
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,900
It wouldn't shock me at all.

383
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,840
UTC is not a time zone,

384
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,469
it's a time standard.

385
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,500
It is a standard, it is not a time zone

386
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,570
is a time zone,

387
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,130
for example, but UTC is not a time zone.

388
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,450
IP

389
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,549
Z equals UTC

390
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,179
-- and things happen
-- but it's not technically a time zone. It's the time standard.

391
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,630
It's, it's above the time zone. Essentially.

392
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,789
It, it could be, I mean, it wouldn't shock me at all.

393
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:49,919
I,

394
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,799
I remember it was so much special also because you

395
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:53,340
got to remember with leap seconds and you know,

396
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:54,729
keeping UTC

397
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,789
kind of on, on time, I guess expiring the pun with, you know,

398
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,580
the solar clock like the solar, the earth going around the, the the sun

399
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:05,960
does vary a bit because, you know, gravitational disturbances from

400
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:09,500
-- stuff like Saturn and Jupiter
-- and we're slowing down,

401
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,619
right? I mean, someday I believe the earth will become tightly locked.

402
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,929
Yes. Well, that, that's inevitable in, well, not inevitable,

403
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,520
theoretically speaking, that's inevitable in all of these,

404
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,440
all of these orbital systems, right, that you become tidally locked at some point.

405
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,559
Um So yeah, the spin of the earth is slowing down,

406
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,669
which means the days will get longer.

407
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,309
-- And then, yeah, in theory, eventually becomes tightly locked
-- like

408
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,369
the

409
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:33,989
what is tidally locked mean for people?

410
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,539
So a perfect example is the moon, the moon orbits the earth,

411
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:40,390
right goes around the earth in a big kind of wonky oval.

412
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,349
And, um,

413
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,229
we only ever see one side of the moon, one face of the moon because it, it's,

414
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,590
it's basically the moon rotates around the earth

415
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,570
in one period of its orbit.

416
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:50,909
So it's just,

417
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,479
it's like when you're holding your kid in

418
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,229
helicoptering them and you can see their face

419
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,640
and I'm assuming you're holding your kids' hands, not their feet.

420
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,729
If you hold their feet, you're hard.

421
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,640
I like it.

422
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,900
I approve.

423
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:06,020
Uh, and, and actually mercury is tightly locked to the sun as well.

424
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,449
So, good luck settling it.

425
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,180
Right.

426
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,270
Right. I don't

427
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,300
anyway.

428
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,939
Right. Oh,

429
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,540
but wait, so time zones are hard.

430
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,358
-- Security is hard
-- and time is hard because there's also things

431
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:21,219
like leap seconds that an extra second or subtract a second.

432
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,088
And my experience,

433
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:26,659
there's a lot of computer programs that just assume a minute is 60 seconds always.

434
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:30,989
Uh, didn't, didn't Microsoft's cloud come down because of a leap second.

435
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:31,979
A couple of years back.

436
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,538
Uh, no, that was a leap

437
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,979
year certificate. Expiration thing

438
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:36,659
where

439
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:42,119
-- they had their certificates set to expire after how many days in a
-- year? 365. And

440
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:42,619
most

441
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:42,938
of the

442
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:43,218
time

443
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,260
it's three out of four,

444
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,420
it's close enough.

445
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,449
It'll work.

446
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,170
Yeah.

447
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,339
And so, yeah, they are all their certificates expired on, uh, well,

448
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:56,939
the certificates, uh, a bunch of certificates expired February 29th

449
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,300
as they should because they were valid until February 28th because February 29th.

450
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,780
Whoops, that happens this year.

451
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,420
God bless time.

452
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,250
Well, it's unfortunate that the earth is close enough to kind of that,

453
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,209
you know, like if it was some wonky

454
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:14,650
other number then we'd probably pay more attention to it.

455
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,869
But it's close enough that, you know, we have this correction

456
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,619
that mostly works except, well, here's the thing. Right. What was 2000 a leap year?

457
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,849
Well, the answer was, yes. No. Yes. Right. Like every four years, yes.

458
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,770
Every 100 years. No, every 1000 years. Yes. Or is it 2000 years?

459
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,349
We didn't, we don't even know it's too hard.

460
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,439
Well, because the, the, the, the, the length of the year I, it's what,

461
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,969
365.25 something something something.

462
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,760
-- Right. It's just, it's slightly more than a quarter.
-- It's madness anyway.

463
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,640
-- Anyway, this is making
-- my

464
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:41,750
head.

465
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,020
So, yeah, good luck with your buffers and memory management.

466
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,939
And see, I guess is what the conclusion is

467
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,920
and whatever that's

468
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,910
cross site scripting.

469
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,650
I mean, pick a security issue and the fact is we can't figure out time zones.

470
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,670
How are we going to figure out security?

471
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,270
And

472
00:18:58,859 --> 00:18:59,280
once

473
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:02,000
you train your developers to do time correctly,

474
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,390
then maybe think about teaching them to do security correctly.

475
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,260
That is fair.

476
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,630
And I,

477
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,410
I want to make sure we don't always just end

478
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,430
on doom and gloom and talk about how doomed.

479
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,430
We are because we are. But I mean that that's another point story.

480
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,270
Uh No, I, I feel like the answer here is

481
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,180
there's I I'm all for developer awareness and

482
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,800
I think it's good people understand this stuff.

483
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,400
But I think we also need to make

484
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:25,880
the realistic observation that we can't train away some of these problems.

485
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,099
And this is a place where the right answer is who cares about time zones,

486
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,439
Just trust someone else to build a library that will do them correctly.

487
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:33,849
And in

488
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,400
all seriousness, those libraries are,

489
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,160
are going to figure this out and they'll get it right.

490
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:38,880
So you,

491
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,400
you don't have to care or worry about it and security

492
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,469
doesn't have that in many cases and we need them,

493
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,530
we need them back.

494
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:44,869
Well,

495
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,750
it's weird that like in civil engineering or whatever you have these standards,

496
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
like I need some rebar with this tensile strength.

497
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,560
OK? Flip through the catalog. OK. I'll buy it from you

498
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,949
or I need screws of this strength and whatever and you just go and get that.

499
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,579
Whereas, but in software it's always like

500
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,099
I need to handle time.

501
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:02,579
I'm going to write it myself rather than use some like very simple library or,

502
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:06,219
or God forgive all the people that are like, I need encryption.

503
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:08,180
-- OK? I can do that.
-- Right. Right.

504
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:08,439
And,

505
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:11,310
and you think a screw is infinitely simpler and

506
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,650
we don't think twice about buying them because,

507
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,030
oh, my goodness.

508
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:19,790
Actually, there's a video I'm gonna put in the show notes. I, I watched this weekend,

509
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,300
there's this guy on youtube called Project Farm

510
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,810
and he's just some weirdo who does these like

511
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,660
crazy things and one of the things he did,

512
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,819
he was, he was testing like the po strength of nails and screws.

513
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:31,550
It is

514
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,069
insane

515
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:32,430
how

516
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,609
strong screws are. It's

517
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:34,209
bonkers.

518
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,380
It came up on my feet and I was going to look at it, but I, I forgot

519
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:37,959
it

520
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,189
was

521
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,109
fantastic.

522
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,979
I actually did a bunch of research

523
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,900
into this and,

524
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,270
and there's some really interesting patents around nails and screws,

525
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,900
especially modern ones because there's this company that makes these really

526
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,719
fascinating high tech hurricane proof nails

527
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,609
that are almost as strong as screws.

528
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,670
And the way they're designed is actually quite clever.

529
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:58,199
And what really got me was when I installed my, um, my nest smoke alarms.

530
00:20:58,209 --> 00:20:59,250
They come with a screw

531
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,489
that's designed to work in both wood and drywall.

532
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,890
And so it's got actually two sets of threading on it.

533
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,989
Wow.

534
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:09,790
It's got like wood screw or it's got like a finer thread

535
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,709
on the tip and then like a chunkier threading on the shank.

536
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,709
So that if you're, you go into a wood, it'll,

537
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,839
the tip of it will go into the wooden hole there.

538
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,459
But if you're just going into straight drywall,

539
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,890
it's got like a nice chunky thread that will hold in the drywall.

540
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,209
And it was interesting because like the nest was so proud of

541
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:26,829
their engineering and they were talking about how they spent like,

542
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,030
ump Gaji Lion hours

543
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,510
basically over engineering these screws so that they only had to send

544
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,390
one set of screws with the device to plug it in,

545
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,140
like to screw it into the wall so that people

546
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:36,109
didn't

547
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,390
forgive me for this. They didn't screw it up.

548
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,430
Um

549
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:42,420
And uh but seriously, right, because like, I've,

550
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,459
I've bought devices where they come with like really terrible, you know,

551
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:46,680
drywall screws

552
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,569
and then if you have to screw into wood or something, that's like, well,

553
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:50,780
that's an exercise left to the reader.

554
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,339
-- Good luck with that.
-- Right. Right.

555
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,670
So, so anyway, the other cool video I watched this guy,

556
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,260
uh I won't link it but I'll tell you to find it.

557
00:21:57,459 --> 00:22:01,780
Is he put bacon grease in an engine as the oil and it was,

558
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,439
the results are amazing and I will just let you watch it and find out.

559
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:10,369
So, so anyway, anyway, let's move on to the second thing we wanted to discuss today.

560
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,280
And that is,

561
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,119
and this is totally related right there.

562
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,599
It's completely related to the time zone problem because

563
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,589
there's a story on Reddit

564
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:23,280
talking about the fact that U two F which we've discussed in the past numerous times

565
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,119
will now work in Firefox and Safari

566
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:27,810
and then the Reddit

567
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,670
and, and edge poor edge,

568
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,420
-- even Microsoft gave off.
-- I know, I know, I feel bad

569
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,819
for. OK. Just so real quick.

570
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:40,069
What is UTU two F

571
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,319
-- Fido? Again, it is
-- basically,

572
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,400
it's a second factor authentication.

573
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,060
And the beauty of it is when I go to a website and it'll say plug in

574
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:50,680
your key and I plug it in and I have to push a button on the,

575
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:53,729
on like a UB key is a little tappy thing. But whatever

576
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,119
you,

577
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,084
you have to physically interact with the key

578
00:22:56,305 --> 00:23:00,925
and then something happens and the beauty of it is it uses the URL in the browser

579
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:04,324
is basically what gets sent to the key. What, what was your description of this?

580
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:05,015
A magic?

581
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:08,275
It's a magic elf that sits inside the key signing off on paper. There you

582
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:08,555
go.

583
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:09,224
I love that.

584
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:12,755
That's perfect and only paperwork that he recognizes like so to be clear,

585
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,214
you have to register your key.

586
00:23:14,224 --> 00:23:17,415
So if you want to use a U two F key with Google, you go to google.com/,

587
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,209
it's like two step landing,

588
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:22,780
just Google Google second two fa and you'll get their

589
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,359
landing page and at the very bottom you click,

590
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,219
let's get started

591
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,479
and then you choose security key at the top and you choose register security key,

592
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,209
you plug your key in, it sends it that little URL bit of data stuff, your key signs,

593
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:38,859
it sends it back and also gives it like the public key that the key is using

594
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:40,900
and now your key is registered and,

595
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:44,810
and you're good to go. It's that simple. You plug it in, you touch it.

596
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,349
Yep,

597
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,229
that's it. There's no second step.

598
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:50,709
And you basically can't be man in the middle with this where

599
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:55,640
the like uh the, the, the Google authenticator style apps on your phone,

600
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,869
someone could present you with a fake login page.

601
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,920
Have you enter all the credentials they need and then log in as you.

602
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:05,189
Whereas in this instance, if you're not on the real website,

603
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,689
the U two F key just doesn't do the right thing.

604
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,390
So there's no way to spoof it.

605
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:10,510
Yeah.

606
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,709
Well,

607
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,400
the only way to really attack this would be is if your browser had a

608
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,569
flaw that allowed the attacker to like spoof the address bar on an entire website,

609
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:19,890
which we've gotten really good at preventing that

610
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,040
or I guess

611
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:21,770
now,

612
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,089
now here's something else I want to point out is there are going to be flaws

613
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,689
similar to this and there are going to be people who find ways to leverage,

614
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,569
we'll say shortcomings in U two F.

615
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:36,890
But that's not a good enough reason not to use it because it's like 99% good enough.

616
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,329
Whereas nearly every other solution is 80% or less,

617
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,250
it basically moves the attack surface to things that we've

618
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:46,859
already spent a lot of time fixing and gotten really good at.

619
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,369
And so it basically,

620
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,949
it relies on things like your browser address bar showing the correct address,

621
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:56,109
which it's like I don't know people that are young here but 1520 years ago,

622
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,810
that was a hard problem.

623
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:57,800
And there were a lot of flaws

624
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,530
-- but we fix them like we got good at that.
-- Some of them. Not all though.

625
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,410
I mean, there's still,

626
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,020
you can use various unicode characters or

627
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,400
it's still not perfect and there's still ways

628
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,219
actually. No, they, most of those have fixed the unicode thing.

629
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:12,780
They, they, they don't display the unicode,

630
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,630
they put the hyphen hyphen blah, blah, blah stuff in.

631
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:17,689
Um Well,

632
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,300
I remember we did that on the show and remember

633
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,229
on the mobile browser it didn't put on the Safari.

634
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:24,319
Right.

635
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:28,420
-- Right. Right.
-- But regardless the point is that, yeah. No, you, you the, the,

636
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,170
the bar for proxy and doing an attack is way, way higher and more to the point.

637
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,170
What I love about these keys,

638
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,119
they're epoxy sealed, you can't break them.

639
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,790
They sit on my, like I have a bunch of them on my key ring. They don't, they don't

640
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,800
break there. You plug it into the computer and you tap it,

641
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,030
that's it.

642
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,099
-- And
-- actually
-- unplug it because you need to put your keys back in your pocket.

643
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:49,619
My other favorite feature

644
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,959
is the UI

645
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:54,989
-- keys can store P GP and SSH keys in them,
-- some of them,

646
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:56,500
some of the

647
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:57,040
keys.

648
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:57,719
But

649
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,060
here's the purpose of this particular discussion is you look at these

650
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:05,800
comments on Reddit and there's a lot of misunderstanding about this.

651
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,280
-- Well,
-- and so it's understandable because people have never,

652
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,479
if you've never been exposed to a UB key,

653
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,310
how would you understand or know what it is?

654
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,319
Because quite frankly, it looks like a USB thumb drive.

655
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:17,589
So you assume it has like storage on it. Well,

656
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,609
it kind of has storage but like secure crypto magic storage, not like

657
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,310
regular file storage.

658
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:26,859
-- And
-- it's even more confusing for some people because like you plug in a UI

659
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:29,199
key on, on my Mac

660
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,630
and it always pops up. Oh, you just plugged in a keyboard. Let's configure.

661
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,910
It's like, no, there's no F and keys on this keyboard you moron.

662
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,469
But asking me that

663
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:39,989
there's nothing I can do to make it go away.

664
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,959
That I thought, well, my solution is to get rid of the Mac.

665
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:44,280
But that's another story and that that's happening soon. I'm excited.

666
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,989
But

667
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,510
yeah,

668
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:45,750
and

669
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,400
there's

670
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,599
so here's,

671
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:51,599
here's what I thought of when you sent me this link and I was reading these

672
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,229
comments and there was a lot of misunderstanding

673
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,750
is if a security person tells someone,

674
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,280
get one of these and just use it,

675
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,439
are they going to listen?

676
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,729
So, no, they're not. They really aren't.

677
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:04,170
I was going to say like even in my case,

678
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,469
I have trouble convincing people to use these things.

679
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:09,010
And it's funny because once they start using them, they're like, oh,

680
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,709
this is awesome.

681
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,130
I'm like, yeah.

682
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:11,130
Right.

683
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,680
But, but at the same time I,

684
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:18,329
I feel like as an industry I have a suspicion we have tried to scare people for so long.

685
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,349
They look at us

686
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,055
funny anytime we say this is something you should do.

687
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,295
I think it's a combination of the boy who cried wolf

688
00:27:25,305 --> 00:27:27,354
because we've doom and gloom about all sorts of things that,

689
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:29,064
like, my favorite is the c,

690
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:30,614
remember Cyber Pearl Harbor.

691
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:32,395
Yeah. When, when does that happen again?

692
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:36,834
-- I think we, I think it got rescheduled to next Thursday,
-- next Thursday

693
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:37,755
maybe.

694
00:27:37,765 --> 00:27:40,555
But so there's the, I think it's a combination of alarm fatigue,

695
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:42,025
the boy who cried wolf and all that.

696
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,395
And more to the point though,

697
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,790
when we, a lot of security professionals and you and I both used to be guilty of this.

698
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,670
When we do tell people what to do and to fix things,

699
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,500
we give them horrifically terrible.

700
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,750
Hard to follow advice

701
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,099
like, ok, tell the world about how you store your encryption keys.

702
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,579
Oh, wait, you gave up. You just, you, you basically,

703
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:03,689
I don't think you're going to try and recover them anymore. Right?

704
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:07,069
We don't have a lot. We don't have long enough left on our podcast.

705
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,599
I need a whole podcast to explain to you how I,

706
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:13,780
I still protect my encryption keys this way just because it's, it's already done,

707
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:17,550
the damage is done and there's no reason to undo it. But yeah, it's uh I

708
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:21,619
bet it would take me more than 20 minutes. To explain everything. I do.

709
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,189
Yeah.

710
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,469
And I just have my,

711
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,369
what few encryption keys I have basically on

712
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,550
my workstations with no passphrase because the,

713
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,150
you know, it's, it's an encrypted laptop to begin with.

714
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,349
-- And, and
-- the number of times we've each been hacked is

715
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:35,300
the same.

716
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:37,260
Actually, you know, I got my,

717
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,079
my servers to get hacked once through a known combination

718
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,770
of a wordpress bug and a Linux kernel bug.

719
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,760
-- And this is about 1520 years ago. I
-- mean, having your keys stolen. Right.

720
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,670
The number of times our keys have been stolen is the same number. Even though

721
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:50,829
I spent,

722
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,229
uh, I bet I lost days of my life putting together my key protection scheme.

723
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,500
Oh, I used to be like you, I'm, I'm not, I don't hold the moral high ground here.

724
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,810
II, I admitted

725
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,010
my problem and, and I, and I, well, and I buried the problem out in the backyard.

726
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:11,369
Right, right now at the same time, my, my P GP key is very old because changing it.

727
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,910
It's a lot of work. So I just have no incentive to do it.

728
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,550
But someday I will.

729
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:18,030
Although I don't know, maybe I won't, it doesn't matter. I mean,

730
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,300
-- no, not really.
-- Do you

731
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,469
-- even
-- need your encryption keys?

732
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:21,219
I use

733
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,640
-- mine
-- to sign git commits. That's all I use them for anymore.

734
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,390
Because encrypted email is a dead donkey.

735
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,300
In fact, when people send me GP G mail, I usually reply back with,

736
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,770
please send it in plain

737
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,469
-- text.
-- Yeah,

738
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,260
un unless, yeah. Anyway, anyway, whatever. So here's,

739
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,050
I, I guess here's the point is

740
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:42,040
I can relate to these users on Reddit who don't understand what's going on.

741
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,599
And then I think about our industry and, and let's say I want to find out about U two F.

742
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:51,449
Is there anywhere I can go and get like a nice easy explanation.

743
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:55,040
And the answer is maybe, I mean, you could probably go read some Yuki materials.

744
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,609
You could probably find some youtube videos that are ok.

745
00:29:57,619 --> 00:29:59,849
-- But
-- the Wikipedia page is not bad.

746
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,359
But I, I guess if I'm in

747
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,489
it's not great.

748
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,859
Oh yeah. No, this is, no, this is not. No, no, no, no, no, no, sorry. Actually, I lied.

749
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:09,930
The uh the Wikipedia page is not,

750
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,569
it, it has the factual of like when it became a standard and stuff,

751
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,420
but no actual explanation of what it is

752
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,689
and, and this is and at the same time,

753
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:21,660
no one's no one's going to care because you're talking about screws earlier.

754
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:26,430
I'm sure there are thousands of pages detailing how to test screws,

755
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,589
how to build screws.

756
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,209
What kind of,

757
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:31,099
what kind of things we should look for when we make the screws. And

758
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,829
as a consumer of screws,

759
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,380
I don't care, I'm not going to read that crap. Right.

760
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,260
I want to basically show up at the store and buy some screws.

761
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,609
Funny story about screws.

762
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,040
I noticed at Home Depot about a year, maybe two years ago,

763
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,550
the screws went from like, they have, you know, like the, the number, uh, screw,

764
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,380
like how wide the screws, right?

765
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,020
Like number four, number six, number eight, number 1012, 1416, whatever.

766
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:54,839
And they have the different lengths, obviously,

767
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,400
you know,

768
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,180
because sometimes you need a half inch screws to do whatever and piece of furniture

769
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:00,500
and sometimes you need like a 3.5 inch

770
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,069
construction screw because you're building a deck.

771
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:02,250
Right?

772
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:06,520
But what I noticed is for all the sort of standard steel screws for wood stuff,

773
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:12,150
they're still all packaged individually by, you know, size and length.

774
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,589
Um, but they're all the same price.

775
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,869
There's just like this giant wall of like,

776
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,849
it's like little boxes of like five or 10 or whatever screws each

777
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:21,790
and they're all like

778
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,380
five bucks or whatever it is.

779
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:27,239
Whereas they used to all be different prices in different, you know, like the, like,

780
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,689
you know, the, the number four, like

781
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,209
half inch screws were a different price than the number 41 inch screws.

782
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:34,489
Now, they're all the same price

783
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,770
and you just get slightly different amounts of screws. So it's kind of

784
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,890
almost like just by buying by weight.

785
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,050
But the point is they, they,

786
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,199
they vastly simplified it for the people that only need like

787
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:46,849
a few screws for like hanging a picture or doing,

788
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:48,170
you know, like a small project.

789
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,890
And I guess the professionals, you know,

790
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,359
still you go to the kind of down the aisle a bit more and look down and, you know,

791
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,530
there's like the big scary boxes of like, you know, 20 pounds of,

792
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,160
-- of construction screws or whatever.
-- That's fair.

793
00:31:59,560 --> 00:31:59,939
And

794
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,329
right, I mean,

795
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:03,849
-- this is the thing I keep thinking of is
-- why can't we do

796
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,650
that offer people a couple of different

797
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,079
security solutions that are all attractively packaged

798
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:12,689
and they're all relatively easy to use and they, you know, oh, you, for example,

799
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,189
you want a hardware-based token because, you know,

800
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,839
you want to have a high level of security.

801
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:17,349
Cool.

802
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,800
You know, you want to, you want to go download Google authenticator,

803
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,750
put that on your phone.

804
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:23,109
Cool. You do you right. That, that's pretty secure.

805
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,430
Especially if your phone is a modern phone.

806
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:26,089
It has like a fingerprint reader and stuff,

807
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:28,829
you know, and you have a good pass, uh lock and all that.

808
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:31,239
But yeah, no, instead we offer them like these

809
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:33,579
horrifically complicated solutions that

810
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,119
kind of don't work a lot of the time. Like antivirus.

811
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:39,239
I have no antivirus on any of my systems because it's just,

812
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,400
I don't want to screw them up.

813
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,550
You know what the example I would say is,

814
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,459
imagine if you didn't know what you were buying for screws,

815
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:49,630
you bought them and then some of the screws when you tried to use them actually,

816
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,619
like destroyed the thing.

817
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,420
You were screwing it. Into instead of actually working, right?

818
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,670
That, that's the comparison.

819
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:57,640
That's actually a thing that can happen because for example, here in Canada,

820
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,270
we use Robertson's, you know, the square hole right on the top of the,

821
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,160
which is

822
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:07,560
far superior because a properly made screw sticks to your screwdriver, even

823
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,160
horizontal, vertical, whatever,

824
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:09,969
right? You don't.

825
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,650
Yeah, it's perfect. But

826
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,000
there's the different sizes, right?

827
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,040
There's like the number six, number eight, number 10, whatever.

828
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:19,880
And if you like me, um, or sorry, the number two is the most common size for the bit.

829
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,199
And so like me, you have like 50 million numbers, two bits but not the, you know,

830
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,280
the slightly larger one,

831
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,209
you have like three of them and they're lost because

832
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:28,010
they're like floating around the bottom of your tool bag.

833
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,560
And more annoyingly they're color coded and the ones,

834
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:33,469
the slightly larger ones are color coded black and of course, my tool bag is black,

835
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:33,869
so it's

836
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:35,329
really tricky to find.

837
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:36,329
Fantastic.

838
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:39,560
So you can usually, if you're driving into something that's not too hard,

839
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:42,510
you can use the smaller bit in the larger screw head.

840
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,910
But if you're driving into something that's a little bit harder,

841
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,520
then of course what happens is the bit will rotate

842
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,130
and round the inside of the hole of the screw

843
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,170
and now you have a screw halfway into something.

844
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,479
Well, no, actually, no, the bit, uh, well,

845
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:58,829
the bits I buy are really good and hard metal So the bit doesn't ruin, it,

846
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,250
ruins the head of the screw.

847
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,780
And then basically you have to go hunting for your vice lock grips,

848
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,920
chomp them onto the screw and manually

849
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:08,679
pull it like, turn it around to get it back out and it takes about a good 10 minutes.

850
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:12,149
So the point is by using the wrong screw bit and the wrong screw,

851
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,199
you can actually drive a screw like halfway into something,

852
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,958
Have it sticking out and can't, you maybe not,

853
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,750
can't get it out easily or when you walk the vice grips to it and unscrew it,

854
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,668
it sheers off.

855
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:21,679
I've had that happen,

856
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,100
which

857
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:22,300
does

858
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:23,228
happen. Yeah. And then I just

859
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:23,989
cut it

860
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,478
off. Yeah,

861
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,840
just take a dremel out and try to get the sparks anywhere.

862
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:30,840
So the point is with screws, you can make, you can mess up and

863
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,070
ruin something if, but, but you kind of have to try,

864
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:36,108
you have

865
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:36,239
to.

866
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:41,569
Security is the opposite in a lot of instances and, and we're,

867
00:34:41,728 --> 00:34:45,648
we're, we're, we're fresh out of time at this point. But I guess here's,

868
00:34:45,998 --> 00:34:50,358
here's what I would say is my not doom and gloom advice at the end of this,

869
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:51,498
go buy a

870
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:51,789
Yike

871
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:52,518
five

872
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,518
and use it

873
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:54,918
end of star,

874
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,709
right? And if someone says, what do I do here,

875
00:34:57,909 --> 00:34:58,899
the answers go by.

876
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,469
It only works

877
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:04,000
at a couple of sites like the support for the thing is nowhere near universal.

878
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,669
But I'll be blunt the sites it works at are kind of the ones that matter, like Google

879
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,469
or

880
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,469
last pass it works on the enterprise and

881
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,989
the premium, but it doesn't work for like the free one.

882
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:19,040
Right. Because, you know, but if you really want like a strong,

883
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:23,550
easy and see, here's the thing, right? This is the up is one of those great examples of

884
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:26,979
the, there's a classic trope of, oh, you know,

885
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:30,189
you can have security but you have to trade off usability and it's harder to use.

886
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:30,899
No,

887
00:35:31,189 --> 00:35:33,560
no good. Well designed security

888
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:34,919
is easy to use.

889
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,479
And the UB key is a perfect example of it.

890
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,879
You plug it in and tap it when the light turns green

891
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,639
-- and,
-- and I would even argue if it's hard to use.

892
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,919
I'm not going to call it good

893
00:35:45,149 --> 00:35:47,350
-- because
-- it's easy to screw up like antivirus.

894
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,620
There we go. I like it.

895
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:50,040
That makes sense. All right, sweet.

896
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:50,899
I'm calling

897
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,139
it.

898
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,389
