Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt

1
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:09,720
Seyfried

2
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,140
and my partner in discussing what Poly Phil dot Io has to do with NFTS and A I,

3
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,260
Josh Pressers.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,870
Oh my goodness. What I don't even want to know.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,100
So, OK. Well, first let's set the sage. So what is Poly Phil?

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,379
Do you want to take it or shall I?

7
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:24,534
I'll, I'll explain it as best as I can.

8
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:28,055
So mind you, this all kind of happened yesterday at the time we're recording.

9
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:32,435
So I assume I'm hopeful more information will emerge.

10
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:36,255
But what is Poly Phil and to be clear? Poly fill, not poly fill dot IO.

11
00:00:36,264 --> 00:00:39,634
-- So let's start with the software,
-- right? Poly fill the concept, right?

12
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:41,159
So, and I'm,

13
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,819
I'm gonna explain this in the context of the

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,080
web browser because I think that kind of makes sense

15
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:47,040
when you're using a web browser,

16
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:51,869
new web browser versions will have new features, right?

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,319
Where it could maybe show an image on a screen in a certain way or, or maybe, you know,

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,279
rotate something or whatever, there's millions of things web browsers do.

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,520
Now, it's ridiculous. And so

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,189
the idea being

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,830
some of your users will be on older browsers that don't have those features.

22
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:11,569
And so Polypill is this like concept in,

23
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:15,050
I don't know if it's specific to computer science or programming necessarily.

24
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:19,650
But the idea being we're going to add this functionality in.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,889
-- Well, it's monkey patching, basically,
-- it's not monkey patching.

26
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,730
You're just adding the function

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,989
like via a library

28
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,235
versus being included in the browser.

29
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:29,485
Yeah.

30
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:33,764
And it's, but what I mean is it's a similar concept to you don't have this capability.

31
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:37,184
I want you to have this capability so that my software runs.

32
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:38,714
Because fundamentally as a web

33
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:43,535
application developer, I don't want to write 4000 versions of my software, right?

34
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,095
I want to write one version of my software that

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,114
will show the dancing monkey and rotate it or whatever.

36
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:50,794
And oh your web browser, I wanted to work on browsers that are like

37
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,500
years old.

38
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,919
-- I mean,
-- I think I would video games are probably a great example of this, right? Where

39
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:00,379
if you have the latest and greatest graphics card, you might have,

40
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:04,269
you know what, what is the thing? Ray Tracing is the big hot topic right now,

41
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,730
I think they gave it a weird name.

42
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,260
But anyway,

43
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,440
you know where there's functionality in newer

44
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,139
cards that aren't available in older cards.

45
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,550
And so now when you're a game developer, you either just don't use the functionality

46
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,125
where you're like, you don't get shadows, right or whatever

47
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,324
or

48
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:23,154
you write a software function that will do the thing you need to do.

49
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:26,744
Just not as well as the hardware, for example, might do it.

50
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:27,684
Same idea.

51
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:28,085
Yeah.

52
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:29,054
And so, and to be clear,

53
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,774
this is classic web stuff where it's a bunch of javascript that

54
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:36,035
is included in the web page loaded. And that leads to a problem.

55
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:38,154
What happens if you include

56
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:40,360
hundreds of kilobytes or

57
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:44,119
tens of javascript files on a web page? Well, it loads slowly.

58
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,699
Well, they all include like bazillions of things now.

59
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,050
-- But yes, I understand what you're saying,
-- but the more you include,

60
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,440
the more slow it is.

61
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:52,169
And so, and this is where Poly

62
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,539
dot io comes in, which is, it's actually quite close.

63
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:55,699
So what Poly

64
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:58,520
dot io does, which I think is quite gorgeous

65
00:02:58,729 --> 00:02:59,309
is

66
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,539
it serves the Poly

67
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,000
Fill javascript

68
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,559
but

69
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,149
depending on what user agent and headers,

70
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,250
it serves different things.

71
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:11,160
So it basically says, oh, you're like, really up to date,

72
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,369
you only need this one more recent thing.

73
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,639
It only serves what you need

74
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,309
exactly. And

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,429
you're 34 years out of date, OK? You're getting like half a megabyte of javascript.

76
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,210
Good luck. And

77
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,020
because it's poly fill dot IO because it's served off of

78
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:28,199
a central CD N if I use Poly Fill dot io.

79
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,910
And the first time you come to my website is slow,

80
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,059
but then the next time you go say in a week

81
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,320
to somebody else's website that uses poly fill dot IO,

82
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,389
it loads

83
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,990
instantly basically

84
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,789
because you've already cashed it

85
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,449
because we're, you, we're both using Poly Phil dot Io.

86
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,130
And that's one of the reasons why people

87
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,050
because II I always see this like,

88
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,419
why are web devs so insane of like including third party stuff.

89
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,509
Well, for example, Google fonts,

90
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,149
we include Google fonts because you've already got them loaded

91
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,830
and so they just load instantly and like

92
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:01,190
our web page doesn't load slow while you wait for half a megabyte of fonts.

93
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,270
There's a very important thing

94
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,350
that poly fill that IO

95
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,509
does

96
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,669
or rather there's an important security feature.

97
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:13,910
Poly fill that IO can't use when you're loading remote javascript.

98
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,170
For example, a lot of people might load

99
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,170
what's a, what's a javascript library like

100
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,040
the Google fonts or, or let's let's call it, let's say Bootstrap, Twitter,

101
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:22,829
Bootstrap, right?

102
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,649
That's a better example where I'm gonna say go to

103
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,649
this CD N download this javascript and run it.

104
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,529
And so as a security minded developer,

105
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,010
I'm nervous about this because I don't want to just download

106
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:36,329
whatever random crap the CD N is going to serve me.

107
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:41,470
So there's this ability in the go load this javascript. I forget the name of it.

108
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:44,059
It's SR I and it's not just javascript, it's

109
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,420
-- oh S
-- R I, that's it,

110
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,470
it's any, it can be pictures, it can be images, it can be audio,

111
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,489
right? Yeah. Any, any remote content.

112
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,630
So you can say here's the, here's the check,

113
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,750
some of the javascript I'm expecting to download and use if the checks don't match,

114
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,869
it doesn't load it obviously because you don't want to download random crap.

115
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,109
However, because of the way poly fill works, poly fill dot IO specifically,

116
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,480
you don't know exactly what you're going to get.

117
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,779
So you can't use that SR I tag on poly fill

118
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,570
content.

119
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,500
Also, a lot of people don't use SR I because for example,

120
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,630
you point at the latest like you point at the

121
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,959
bootstrap dot Js, not a specific version of it.

122
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,739
-- And so it will at some point update and then have a different hand break
-- everything.

123
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:27,760
Exactly. So a lot of people don't use

124
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,109
subo integrity sr because

125
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,230
fundamentally it forces you to pin your versions which you should

126
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,269
and there's a, you know, there's a chance like for the sake of argument,

127
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,630
let's say they start,

128
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,572
it's serving it regular and then they start serving it min

129
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,282
well, different hash and it was

130
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:48,192
-- which is it should though you want it to break.
-- Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree.

131
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:51,433
But the problem is if you give a developer a security

132
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,472
capability that requires

133
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:57,192
extra work and often results in potential breakage,

134
00:05:57,673 --> 00:05:59,072
they're not going to use it

135
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:02,113
and, and regardless Polly Fill that IO just can't.

136
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:02,942
So this

137
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:04,062
in

138
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:05,132
this context,

139
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:06,122
dynamic

140
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,335
generated content.

141
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:08,656
Yeah, you can't do it

142
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:09,756
-- right
-- now.

143
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:13,756
Something special happened to Polly Fill dot IO that we found out about yesterday,

144
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:16,096
but it looks like it happened at the beginning of 2024.

145
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:16,406
Yeah,

146
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:20,216
-- it got sold to a Chinese company and
-- now they're serving what appears to be

147
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:23,235
-- malware
-- selectively once in a while serving

148
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:26,015
malware and you found that supposed payload,

149
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,196
-- which
-- is a link off of a github

150
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,615
-- issue that was closed. And now you have to look at archive.org to find.
-- Now

151
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:32,968
for

152
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,209
-- archive.org, the whole
-- thing is super sketchy.

153
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:38,368
-- Basically,
-- it's, it's pretty much exactly what I was expecting, which was,

154
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:39,819
it's not a payload itself.

155
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:43,588
It's a loader. That kind of looks at what you are,

156
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:44,919
what you're, you know,

157
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:48,688
what kind of are you on Baidu or Tencent or some like a couple of Chinese websites,

158
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:49,789
what are you doing?

159
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:52,989
And if you meet certain criteria, then you get to,

160
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,789
you get told to load this other very suss looking domain something something Js

161
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,248
which is now gone. It's 400.

162
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,432
This is very common

163
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:03,502
in the malware world. Is

164
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:07,022
you, you do some work to understand?

165
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:11,562
Am I like running on my legitimate target system

166
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:14,981
or am I being inspected by a malware researcher,

167
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:15,682
for example?

168
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:16,122
And

169
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,721
like a favorite is

170
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:21,981
malware will look at your CPU and if it detects it's running in a VM,

171
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:25,641
it just won't do anything because it's like I'm probably being researched by.

172
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:29,644
-- So I'm going to make their lives miserable.
-- And these tricks

173
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,325
generally work like they,

174
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,434
-- they're surprisingly effective and
-- not only that when I looked at some of the de

175
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:35,875
obfuscated code,

176
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:38,295
it looks like it was just basically doing like a math,

177
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:41,684
not rand and only running a small percentage of the time,

178
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:47,165
which is also very clever because now you go from malware that I'm noticing

179
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:51,204
something weird is happening on this website to, oh, the website's acting weird.

180
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,244
I'll just reload it.

181
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,649
It's back to our bicycle theft problem.

182
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,850
-- Right.
-- Like, if you stole every bicycle in Edmonton, the cops might care.

183
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:05,079
No, like they might actually care. But you steal 1% of the bicycles in Edmonton

184
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,910
and their response is make sure it's registered on bike index.org.

185
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,010
And if we recover it, we'll check and give it back to you.

186
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,010
I wonder if 1% of the bicycles in Edmonton legitimately get stolen.

187
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:16,049
I bet it's higher than that,

188
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,070
but it's,

189
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:22,160
I don't know, 1%. It's pro let me go this way. It's probably less than 10% I hope.

190
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,299
And it's probably more than 0.1 of a percent. Ok.

191
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:25,279
But now here's,

192
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,609
I think what makes this whole story kind of wild and

193
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:30,720
I think the topic we actually need to talk about.

194
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,739
So it sounds like the

195
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,799
github repo

196
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,058
was changed to some other entity.

197
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,229
Probably the people running the new Poly Fill that IO site,

198
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,159
the Poly Fill,

199
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,940
that IO domain which was apparently not owned by the original developer.

200
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,690
-- I don't understand that. So
-- basically the poly

201
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,510
fill

202
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,630
as a

203
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,030
piece of software

204
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,390
was totally

205
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:54,549
separate from Poly Fill dot Io.

206
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,030
They, they,

207
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,739
the only thing they had in common is that Poly Fill dot Io was this

208
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,530
really cool service that was of all places run by the Financial Times originally.

209
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:07,229
So I'm assuming the Financial Times was using it

210
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,960
and was just like somebody internally managed to sheer

211
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,020
their way into like, let's host it, pay for it.

212
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:16,140
And, you know, it probably was not that actually expensive. And so

213
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:19,330
the Financial Times actually owned Poly Phil dot Io apparently.

214
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,900
And then, yeah, sold it or got rid of it or whatever.

215
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:25,419
And so there's the software itself which is fine, it's good.

216
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,859
But there's this CD N serving

217
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:32,039
it most of the time. And once in a while, a little extra special sauce,

218
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,169
a

219
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:33,299
little spicy,

220
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,320
you know, you get a little chili pepper in there

221
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,880
that you're not expecting.

222
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:38,309
That's the thing is,

223
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,729
uh what's really funny is back in February Cloud Flare actually started serving.

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,469
Yes, Pauly fill dot IO.

225
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:48,909
Like they basically, if you go to like it's like Cloudflare CD, n.com/and,

226
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,080
-- then they basically like
-- cloud flare serves a ton of this kind of

227
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,799
stuff like Bootstrap is in there and a whole bunch of other things

228
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:58,929
-- like that's not unusual for them at all.
-- The problem is they don't,

229
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:03,609
they serve the content like statically, like as one traditionally does,

230
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:07,530
they don't serve it in the way that Poly Phil dot IO dynamically generated it.

231
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,260
And that is,

232
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,450
and, and so that's the thing that Poly Phil dot Io with that dynamic generation,

233
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,409
it reduces load times because you know, if it's,

234
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,190
if a recent browser comes and is getting it for the first time,

235
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,630
it's only gonna have to get tens or

236
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,989
maybe 100 kilobytes of javascript, you know, versus the whole thing.

237
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,030
And so

238
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:29,309
using poly fill dot io basically means you don't have to do anything clever,

239
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,530
like determining what the client can and cannot

240
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,859
do and then serving them the files selectively.

241
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,789
Basically, the three options are serve if you want to work, serve them all the files.

242
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,859
That's slow, simple, but work

243
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:43,145
but slow, you determine what they need and serve them that stuff,

244
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:46,544
which means you need to do some clever stuff or you just point out what polyfit

245
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:47,684
I own kind of like,

246
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:50,804
-- it mostly just works
-- well in that very web.

247
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:51,724
Now,

248
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:53,844
that's just kind of how the web works is you just

249
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:57,544
point at a CD N for whatever weird library or javascript

250
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:59,844
you're using and you use it because the CD Ns are

251
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:02,085
-- fast and I don't have to carry the crap around
-- it

252
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:05,684
-- and they're hosting it for free. They're not charging you. So it's like magic.
-- OK?

253
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:09,099
I think the, the more interesting discussion is the,

254
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,900
you had a trusted open source project and service

255
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,739
that has been taken over.

256
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,609
Let's make sure that they're very like they are very separate things.

257
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,640
-- They
-- were at the beginning. Are they now though? It sounds like the Poly filled

258
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,650
github Repo has been taken over by a

259
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,460
-- nefarious individual
-- and that's where things get complicated.

260
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:30,159
It sounds like, yeah, a Chinese entity has taken over essentially both of them.

261
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,919
I don't know if they're maybe going to try and sell people

262
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,505
a service or if they are straight up militia just malware like,

263
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:34,965
hey,

264
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,034
let's grab this service that, you know,

265
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:41,505
the reality is hundreds of thousands probably of websites or more depend on this

266
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:44,375
and the tweet, you know, update all your poly

267
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:46,294
fill io things to fix this.

268
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:49,565
Like less than 1% of poly fill io users are going to see

269
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,594
that and of that 1% maybe 1% will actually make the change.

270
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:56,544
Sure. This is like this is like, for example, Calgary had a water main break.

271
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:58,034
They asked people to use less water.

272
00:11:58,614 --> 00:11:59,034
No,

273
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:01,570
there was the quote yesterday where I think it was,

274
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,890
they, their, their target goal is to uh the, the threshold is 480 million L a day.

275
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,799
And

276
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,590
they said we're approaching that limit yesterday. They used 476 million L.

277
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,080
Like that's a 1% buffer basically

278
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,020
like,

279
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,469
yeah, exactly. So it's like we can't even get people to stop flushing their toilets

280
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:24,090
and you expect something as complicated as changing a whole bunch of software,

281
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,070
right?

282
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,400
That's just very few

283
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:27,544
at

284
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:30,494
the high end single digit percentages of people using polyu

285
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,534
dot IO will, will actually fix this.

286
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,544
And what's really interesting is so, um, ad blockers,

287
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,655
some of the ad blockers have started adding that domain as

288
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:42,844
-- malware.
-- I can't go to it now where you block origin is hitting it.

289
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,684
I don't know if Polly filled that Iowa.

290
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,655
Actually, I could curl it to see if it's still up at least.

291
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,494
Oh, yeah, it's still there. I mean, they paid good money for it.

292
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:51,494
Why would they take it down

293
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:54,184
the registrar or other

294
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:55,849
in between?

295
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,109
But they haven't kind of been,

296
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,549
it's one of those things where, like, I don't like this sort of cowboy, like, oh,

297
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,469
you know, the, the registrar just takes it down because they feel like it,

298
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:09,059
like there needs to be some due process here because one could argue for example,

299
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,210
what if they got hacked and were serving that malware once in a while?

300
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:13,150
Like, that's enough to nuke your entire thing

301
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,429
because that happens with Google where people, you know,

302
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,969
come on hacker news and they're like,

303
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:20,320
Google blocked my domain because I serve some malware and now I fixed it,

304
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,039
but they don't believe me.

305
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:21,590
And it's like,

306
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:22,049
yeah,

307
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,510
-- that's how that works because Holly Phil
-- is still

308
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,469
serving what looks like a legitimate web page.

309
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:30,940
I'm just looking at HTML. Ok. Ok. Anyway, there's the angle of, ok.

310
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,539
So we have a project

311
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,619
that has been co opted by an organization with nefarious intent.

312
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,659
Let's say I'm comfortable with that statement.

313
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,049
OK. And what about the service? Same for the service.

314
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,489
I'm going to group them together because both of them

315
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,239
have something strange going on.

316
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,989
And I think it makes more sense to treat them

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,099
as a single entity for the purpose of this,

318
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,239
this discussion.

319
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,549
Because the question is,

320
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:58,599
as we're seeing, we'll say more and more.

321
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,440
I, I hesitate, I guess it's a supply chain attack.

322
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,960
We'll call it a supply chain attack.

323
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,239
It is a supply chain. What else is it? It's part of the,

324
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,080
it's a supply chain for that.

325
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:10,700
Let me put it this way.

326
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,190
It's one thing if it's somebody's personal blog using poly fill.

327
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,289
But what if it's your bank?

328
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,809
-- Uh Well,
-- yeah, like for all I know my bank is using Poly Phil.

329
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,140
-- Who
-- knows? I'm

330
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,409
right. Anyway. OK.

331
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,340
So

332
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,280
you have an open

333
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:28,869
source project. It has been co opted. We don't know the details.

334
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,460
I don't care if it was stolen or expired or someone paid someone.

335
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,909
The details are unimportant. The point is

336
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,549
that you have something that used to be,

337
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,159
we'll say open and moderately trusted that is now

338
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,530
kind of open and not trusted at all.

339
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,849
Well, it's clearly malicious stuff going on in this

340
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:47,380
instance.

341
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,390
Sorry, I have to say this. I just opened up td.com.

342
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,710
Click on login, opened up the easy web

343
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,580
login page,

344
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:57,849
script source equals poly fill dash blah, blah blah, blah, blah.

345
00:14:57,989 --> 00:15:00,020
So they are hosting it themselves.

346
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,960
But like my bank uses poly

347
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,500
fill. So it's pretty clear at this point.

348
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,979
Although there is something coming off of nigh.com, I assume it's an insight thing

349
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,130
and there's B CD n.tv.com.

350
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,390
So I assume that's, I assume, I hope that's their own content delivery network.

351
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:18,969
But like my bank is using poly fill. And if I had to guess I would say

352
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,130
a good chunk of banks are using poly,

353
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,849
I would not be surprised at all if an enormous part of the web is using this.

354
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:26,770
But regardless

355
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:31,020
that's not important for this particular topic, the topic is

356
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,650
well, but the point is this poly

357
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,119
actually matters because

358
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:37,599
-- it's in use. This isn't a theoretical.
-- No. Exactly. Exactly.

359
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:40,590
Like I think all of these sort of attacks matter and,

360
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:43,710
and they might not matter to a huge swath of people, but it,

361
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,270
it's gonna matter to someone.

362
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:45,796
Right.

363
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,685
So it doesn't matter if it's a hugely popular important open

364
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:51,395
source project or it's a project used by 10 people.

365
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:56,236
Like when you have something happen like this, it is kind of terrifying and,

366
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,085
and kind of bizarre.

367
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,145
But the question is,

368
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:02,796
so I'm existing in the modern world, I'm using open source software.

369
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:07,676
How can I possibly keep track of something like this and have a clue

370
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:11,106
of whether my UPS streams are marginally

371
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,322
trustworthy or if it's completely gone off the rails,

372
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:18,882
especially with the web stuff it's really hard because unless you happen to

373
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:21,091
go to the web page and you happen to get a malicious polypill

374
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,971
and you happen to notice it's malicious

375
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,992
and you do a bunch of investigation,

376
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:26,442
you're not going to notice.

377
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:28,192
But this is the beauty of these webs

378
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,911
attacks is if I, if I modify code and github,

379
00:16:31,142 --> 00:16:32,361
everybody can see it.

380
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:35,841
But if I modify code that's served via a web page,

381
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:36,961
only that person

382
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,288
sees it and like, unless they notice,

383
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:40,348
well, they don't.

384
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:41,047
Right.

385
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:44,367
And like Paully Phil was doing this for weeks or months.

386
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:45,338
Who knows?

387
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,908
Ok. I, I think there's two sides to this though.

388
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:49,168
There's the

389
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:55,117
angle of it has been co opted, right? Which is one that's its own discussion.

390
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:59,268
But then there's the piece of the security universe seems

391
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,807
to be doing a reasonable job of detecting this stuff.

392
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:06,253
But you have to be paying attention and you have to know,

393
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,534
you have to be following the right people, right, so to speak.

394
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,173
-- Yeah.
-- And that's not sustainable.

395
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,303
It is definitely not sustainable and normal

396
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,803
people would never even know about this.

397
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:16,134
Right.

398
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:20,792
If only there was some database of vulnerabilities and incidents and problems.

399
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:22,253
-- Oh, I know.
-- Right.

400
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:24,773
With maybe some sort of, you know, common

401
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,093
product enumeration

402
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,513
naming scheme.

403
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,290
No, but, ok. But like this is one of my complaints is

404
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,099
CV, will never cover this issue. That's the best part.

405
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,020
-- No, which is nuts because it's a
-- service.

406
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,280
Well, not even because it's a service, it's malware. They don't cover malware.

407
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,760
It's an intentional backdoor.

408
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,719
So if somebody had accidentally put in a back door, like a password or something,

409
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:47,300
they would know.

410
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,609
But because it's intentional, they'll never cover it. Like,

411
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,160
fantastic.

412
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:52,520
So

413
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,069
yeah, but

414
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,500
that's, I like the more I look at this,

415
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,180
the more this is clearly the future

416
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:00,430
because these little projects have grown not into

417
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:06,209
trees but into giant forest ecosystems that are like literally used by my bank.

418
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:08,859
I check my other bank. My other bank doesn't seem to be loading it.

419
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:10,079
I'm going to check. Uh

420
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,339
you know, but the point is like at least one major Canadian Bank is using it.

421
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:14,810
And by major, I mean, one of the top five.

422
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,339
Right. Well, we have five banks in Canada.

423
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:20,000
That's how we roll, you know, two airlines, five banks.

424
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,699
It's, it's a country of three corporations in a trench coat masquerading.

425
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:29,329
The thing is like the cost to hijack poly fill like the cost to straight up,

426
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:30,319
just buy it.

427
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,040
It's probably in the low tens of thousands of dollars

428
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,170
because

429
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,829
here's the thing, the person running poly Phil dot IO,

430
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,920
like running an operational service for free for the internet is a pain in the

431
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,170
word I can't say

432
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,989
like that's just it,

433
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,790
it's a pain and there's no way to monetize it or make money off of it.

434
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,640
There's, you know, you're not gonna offer consulting or premium

435
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:50,900
to

436
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,000
access or whatever. And so, like, if somebody that looks somewhat legitimate,

437
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:58,369
said, you know, I'll, I'll just give you 50 grand for this and like,

438
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,609
it's not your hassle anymore.

439
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:02,290
I mean, that's 50 grand and you don't have the hassle of it anymore.

440
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,510
That's a compelling story. That's compelling argument.

441
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:07,670
And, you know, same thing with running open source projects, like, as we,

442
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,910
as most people are starting to notice

443
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,569
that's not a very thankful job. Like, you know, you look at like

444
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,770
the emails or the issues, the stuff they have to, you know, the,

445
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,380
the vitriol and hatred they put up with.

446
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,609
Yeah, like somebody comes along and says,

447
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,510
I'll take this off your hands and I'll pay you for it.

448
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,739
Like,

449
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,550
yeah,

450
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,599
maybe

451
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,910
because the other thing is like, if you worked on Poly Phil, like, yeah,

452
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,790
your resume is good.

453
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,829
You're, you're hirable, like, you're clearly competent and good at stuff,

454
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,939
you know, you're not doing this as a portfolio project anymore.

455
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,219
And,

456
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:38,520
well, I mean,

457
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,239
one of the devs at the CS A is in charge of a Rails library because, well,

458
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,079
we needed to use it and it was not properly maintained.

459
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:49,989
So this poor guy ended up maintaining it and now he's, you know, like a baby goose.

460
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,359
It's his, he's stuck with it.

461
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,660
And I mean, if somebody,

462
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,900
if he came to me and said somebody offered me five grand for this

463
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:59,719
Rails app, I'd be like a sell it get the five grand. I want 10% and B

464
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,405
we need to stop using it immediately

465
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:03,045
for sure.

466
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:04,444
And, you know,

467
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:10,285
like you think use of open source and just fire and forget devs using open source was

468
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,155
quote unquote, air quotes bad.

469
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,314
Like as far as I know there are no s bomb products for the web.

470
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,805
No, no. And this is something we're going to talk about at some point

471
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,505
because there's a concept called the Sass bomb that

472
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:26,364
C has been like pushing on. But it's definitely,

473
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,469
I don't,

474
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,859
the, the, the,

475
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:34,030
the purpose of it today would probably not have caught this because a Sass

476
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,979
bomb is more about, I'm going to just scan my, like, local infrastructure,

477
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,680
not necessarily like all the services I'm using,

478
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:44,939
but the services you're using is definitely something that

479
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:47,500
needs to come into scope at some point.

480
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,579
And there's well, and,

481
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,930
and it's a subtle difference but it's more think

482
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:53,140
of it as the services your clients are using.

483
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,420
You're not

484
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,060
like I as TD, I'm not directly using poly fill,

485
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:01,510
it's being sent to the client who then renders it

486
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,880
right. Yes, exactly. And so there's a subtle distinction from like, like from

487
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:10,000
a, it's kind of like control ownership argument in the sense of like, yes,

488
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,869
TD is air quotes using it,

489
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:15,689
but it's running and being actually called by the client side

490
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:17,069
and with the web as we know,

491
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,489
like most devs are pretty lazy and just want to include stuff.

492
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,109
So it works and I don't blame them because,

493
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,589
you know, if your choices are figure out how to use poly fill or

494
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:27,014
just literally as per their main website, you know,

495
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,394
what is it? Script

496
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:29,014
poly

497
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:30,973
dot io slash V three slash polyfit

498
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:32,234
min dot Js.

499
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:33,343
And it just works.

500
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:38,713
-- That's what I'm putting in my code 100%. I mean,
-- yeah. Right. Anyway, OK.

501
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:40,313
So the question though, I think,

502
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,343
I think the thing to think about and the thing to

503
00:21:42,354 --> 00:21:45,793
try to answer is we have all this open source everywhere.

504
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:50,234
Some of it is going to be co opted we've seen now, this is like the second in what,

505
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,624
like two months we know of, we get X

506
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:57,177
for now. You've got this, they were completely different ways to co opt a project.

507
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:59,427
But it fundamentally same idea,

508
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:00,177
like

509
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,998
I have a suspicion,

510
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:05,277
there's a lot more of this happening we don't know about

511
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:09,397
and the question becomes what can we do? You know what I mean?

512
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:12,238
And I don't, I don't have a good answer for it right now.

513
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,878
So this would be where the classic, like the security companies that like

514
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:19,628
have some sort of incentive to scan for malware because for example,

515
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:22,328
they scan for malware because they make a malware antivirus product,

516
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:26,131
right? Or like the companies I worked out where we kind of worked on,

517
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:29,442
on, on malicious code and stuff because so we could alert companies to it and say,

518
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:30,491
like, look how clever we are.

519
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:32,432
We saved you from this horrible thing. That

520
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:33,562
doesn't,

521
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,141
I'm gonna use the term and forgive me for this.

522
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:40,582
That doesn't work at web scale because the problem with web scale is even if you have,

523
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,842
OK, let's thought experiment.

524
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:44,202
Let's say you have a perfect database.

525
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:47,121
You have a system that catches all of this malware in minutes

526
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:50,041
and publishes it clearly and concisely and

527
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:51,852
in really well machine readable language.

528
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,686
-- What percentage of websites would use it? Less than 1%
-- probably.

529
00:22:56,696 --> 00:22:58,566
Yeah, I don't think it would be huge.

530
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:02,965
Like my bank might Walmart might but like, you know.

531
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,686
Yeah. Right. Right. It's

532
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:08,086
like, and what could happen? Cloud flare, for example.

533
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,265
Well, cloud flare can at least see like, OK,

534
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:12,635
I'm serving a web page with Paully Fill involved.

535
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:14,426
Right. Then what's cloud floor going to do?

536
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:17,566
Like, just start blocking it and break 30% of the web?

537
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:20,206
That's not going to be a good time for anybody

538
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,609
-- is breaking all of the web better than serving malware.
-- Yes. Yes.

539
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:28,989
Breaking all of the web is better than serving malware to a,

540
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,410
a minor percentage of people.

541
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,319
Absolutely. It is worse. Yeah.

542
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,209
You know, the thing is too, like,

543
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:37,069
just because you got served malware doesn't mean something bad happened, right.

544
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,780
These are attacks, not successful outcomes, right?

545
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,780
And we don't even know what the payload was like.

546
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,400
For example, you know, was this targeting crypto wallet users by, you know,

547
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,329
like exchange

548
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,250
loins, right? We don't, we have no idea what was being served.

549
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,339
Nobody's shown the payload,

550
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:56,314
-- not the loader but the actual payload.
-- I know that's the thing.

551
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:58,185
I've been trying to figure that out and there's

552
00:23:58,194 --> 00:24:01,704
been less attention than I'm happy with about that.

553
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:04,505
But I'm also not like in that malware universe

554
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:06,194
so there could be a ton of stuff happening.

555
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:07,545
I'm just not even aware of.

556
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:10,224
-- Somebody definitely has a copy of it because
-- like, I just, well,

557
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:12,854
I'm sure a crowd flare has several copies

558
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:14,114
probably.

559
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,400
Yeah, like, I mean, and for all we know Clouder, for example,

560
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,579
is running a service where when they see a new javascript include that's popular and

561
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,939
1000 times more, you know, I would assume that they,

562
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:25,839
one of their people had a pet project that maybe is in production

563
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:29,780
now that grabs that stuff and archives it for this exact eventuality.

564
00:24:30,189 --> 00:24:34,780
But the trick is unless Cloud Flare grabs it air quotes properly,

565
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,400
they might be served the neutered version of it.

566
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,500
Like, unless they're using

567
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:38,750
a

568
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:42,206
-- headless browser with the correct user agents and behavior.
-- I would

569
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:44,776
hope they downloaded it from like the github

570
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:45,576
site.

571
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:46,375
Well, no, no, no.

572
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:51,036
-- What I mean is the payload being sent by the malicious Poly Phil dot Io. Right.
-- Right.

573
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:53,135
Well, that's coming from somewhere else anyway. Ok.

574
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:56,365
We keep dancing around the question I asked and we,

575
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,826
we don't have an answer and I get it.

576
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:00,615
-- No, we, we don't even have the beginning of an answer.
-- I mean,

577
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:03,932
I don't, I don't think we know what problem is yet either.

578
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:06,991
I think you're right. I think you're absolutely right. Because

579
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:08,371
you're gonna hear

580
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:12,131
in the next days and weeks and months all about, oh,

581
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:14,761
use an S bomb and use a malware scanner

582
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:18,161
and use antivirus and endpoint detection and blah,

583
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:18,761
blah, blah, blah blah.

584
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:20,452
It's like I went to my,

585
00:25:20,582 --> 00:25:21,832
for the sake of argument.

586
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:24,671
There's, there's got to be some exchange out there using poly

587
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:26,822
loaded dynamically from the

588
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:27,807
dot IO site.

589
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,307
-- Like it's just statistically, it's, there's at least
-- one I'm sure there are,

590
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:34,258
I'm sure there's Bitcoin exchanges all over the place

591
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:34,968
doing it.

592
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:39,567
And so they in theory could do something which is like use a static copy or whatever.

593
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:41,067
But me as a user,

594
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:43,057
there's nothing I can do. Like I'm going,

595
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:44,598
you have no choice

596
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:48,618
the best I can do honestly and that you can generally do

597
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:50,838
for your web security as an end user is run an ad blocker

598
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:54,723
like running reputable ad locker because the vast majority

599
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,973
of these attacks are done using drive by downloads

600
00:25:57,173 --> 00:26:00,274
often over ad networks because to quote Jesse James or whatever, you know,

601
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:01,073
why do I rob banks?

602
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,543
That's where the money is. Well, why would I serve malware from an ad network?

603
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:04,683
Because, well, that's,

604
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,604
that's who serves content to everybody on the planet.

605
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:12,543
And so I think honestly right now for end users, ad blockers

606
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:14,803
and for sites.

607
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:17,020
Well, I mean, don't,

608
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:22,160
don't use convenient things and do it yourself the hard way that's not gonna fly.

609
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:22,180
I

610
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,859
mean, like, my bank will do it. But,

611
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,949
-- you know. Oh, I wonder if the CS A uses it.
-- I already checked an cars websites.

612
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,670
Like, that's the first thing I did. I was, like, holy crap. I hope this isn't there.

613
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,329
But I couldn't find it. That's the thing that terrifies me though.

614
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,599
So I couldn't find it in any of the websites I looked at,

615
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,660
but it also doesn't mean there can't be

616
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,969
like some crazy freaking third party service.

617
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,109
That's all of a sudden gonna do something weird because goodness knows every

618
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,079
website on the planet has a bunch of stuff plugged into it.

619
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,390
-- Well,
-- yeah, like we serve,

620
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:58,281
we pull something off of this third party site and I bet our devs aren't

621
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,921
even totally aware of it because it's probably

622
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:01,602
pulled in by something they pulled in,

623
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:03,641
you know, and that's part of it is, um,

624
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:06,562
like a lot of these things are being pulled in by frameworks and dependencies.

625
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:10,842
-- Like they're not, you know, the DEV is not typing in, grab
-- this.

626
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,761
I started a thing a while back

627
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:16,281
when we started talking and it just finished. So I want to, I want to discuss it.

628
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,511
I ran open SSF scorecard against the

629
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:19,881
github

630
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:21,401
Repo in question.

631
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,063
Did it do? Well, they did very well.

632
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,093
There is, if I ran, if I looked at the scorecard,

633
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:32,634
there is nothing in here that would cause concern to me.

634
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:37,254
The, my favorite part is the contributor. Section score has a perfect score.

635
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:38,004
Well done.

636
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:40,004
Perfect 10 of 10.

637
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:42,203
There's 43 contributors

638
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:42,953
where

639
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:46,774
it, it, it looks at the, the contributors for

640
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:48,093
weird.

641
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:49,413
I, I don't even know exactly

642
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:52,495
what it's looking for but it looks for like shady looking contributors and,

643
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,125
and they all, there's 43 of them.

644
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:56,225
It's 10 of 10. Like they all checked out.

645
00:27:56,566 --> 00:28:00,265
It has, it has dependency, updating tools like, yep. Good job.

646
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:05,135
The license. Great. It has a security dot markdown or whatever they call it.

647
00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:06,296
The that thing,

648
00:28:06,406 --> 00:28:07,465
-- the
-- security policy,

649
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:10,345
10 dependencies, good job folks. 10 of 10.

650
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:13,985
And that's like, realistically given a budget of,

651
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:17,426
let's say for this government $100,000 you could easily,

652
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:21,118
like, that's easily a couple of months of a competent person's time

653
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:23,718
and 10 or $50,000 in cash to go.

654
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:26,157
But like, that's the thing why, like, yeah,

655
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:28,868
like hijacking XC by being kind of mean to them.

656
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:30,267
And also nice, like, good cop, bad

657
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:34,307
cop, basically, thousands of dollars of work basically spread over a long time.

658
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:37,907
-- So some patients and
-- even if you had a full time employee

659
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,738
and you were paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year,

660
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:45,437
the potential outcome of that attack is worth millions.

661
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:46,339
Yeah.

662
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:50,579
And like in this case, buying, you know, it's like you can literally ask Google,

663
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:53,680
like what is the most popular framework to fix

664
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:56,630
my javascript to make things run better and good?

665
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,390
And how do I make it work automatically?

666
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,959
And you're going to get solutions like Paully Filled Off

667
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,599
show. And there's, there's more, this isn't the only one

668
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:05,569
-- and,
-- and look, the reality is if you have an overworked,

669
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,219
underappreciated maintainer and someone shows up with a bag of money,

670
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,160
everyone has

671
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,290
a

672
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:13,765
and it's easy to say, oh, I would never do such a thing like that.

673
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:15,115
Why on earth wouldn't you? No?

674
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,495
Seriously, why on earth wouldn't you sell that headache?

675
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,735
Well, because you're a decent human being who doesn't want to, you know,

676
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:23,125
basically doom the world.

677
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:26,475
But maybe this company is saying, look, this is really important to us.

678
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:29,526
-- We want to make sure
-- that's true. That's true. We don't know any details.

679
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:32,125
It could have been totally that they might have lied,

680
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:32,956
right? And that,

681
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:34,806
that could totally happen. You could,

682
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:37,962
yeah, I mean, you could be an open source developer and they could show up and be like,

683
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:38,432
hey,

684
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:42,411
I, I wanna fund your development. I want to take over this project.

685
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:45,812
You know, I, we, we, we want it for this reason. You're right.

686
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:46,881
OK, perfect.

687
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:48,791
Now I showed up to Liber Chat and I'm like, hey,

688
00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:51,501
there's no information on backing this up and no scripts.

689
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:52,612
I'm gonna do that.

690
00:29:53,102 --> 00:29:55,202
And this is a case where the scripts and stuff are

691
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:58,021
simple enough that it's like literally a Mongo dump of a,

692
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:59,192
a URL, right?

693
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,469
So there's, but, but in theory

694
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,050
I could, oh perfect example,

695
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,699
I could build something really sophisticated and fancy with a IU I

696
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,270
and hide some code in there that like sneaks the backups off to some other URL.

697
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,729
Anyway,

698
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:13,339
I want to get us back on track so we can end

699
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:15,219
this episode at some point because I think we just keep it,

700
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,250
we keep driving off the road because we don't, there, there's no road,

701
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,060
like there's no map that's

702
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:20,719
to

703
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:23,609
do. We're wandering aimlessly around in a field.

704
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,089
Well,

705
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,250
this is where open source was 10 years ago where it's like all of

706
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,930
-- a sudden people started to realize
-- this is where open source is now.

707
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:32,270
Yeah, there's no,

708
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,910
so this is like open source 10 years ago where it had one pe you know,

709
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,750
it wasn't official.

710
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,390
Like we have didn't have the paper saying like

711
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,589
86% or whatever of software is open source.

712
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,209
But in this case, on the web,

713
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:48,160
all of these goofy nifty free services run by literally who knows are

714
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,260
-- like used
-- widely.

715
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,510
The web is irrelevant in this context because every open source project,

716
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,109
no, what are potentially the same.

717
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,560
But what I'm saying is I'm focusing on this sort

718
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:02,150
of website delivery where I don't have to compromise github.

719
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,109
I don't have to, essentially, I don't have to do anything that is very noticeable.

720
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,630
I can just buy a free content delivery network or a multi user one or whatever, or

721
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,790
hijack it by being mean and nice to them or pay for it.

722
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,589
And

723
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,689
now I have control over what is served from

724
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:21,969
hundreds of thousands or even millions of websites for

725
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,339
tens of thousands of dollars.

726
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:27,170
Like, that's a cost to hack each website of pen

727
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,770
and what are we going to do about it? No one knows.

728
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:29,989
Well,

729
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,109
we're certainly not going to serve the content ourselves because that's way too.

730
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,689
No, I'm serious. It is. It slows the page down.

731
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,489
It makes things complicated and hard.

732
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,969
It would be a worse user experience for everybody.

733
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:42,969
-- You know? I mean,
-- again,

734
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:45,239
I don't even care about the website problem.

735
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,619
I know, I know you like it, but I don't think it matters because the reality is

736
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,880
this problem exists everywhere.

737
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,400
It is literally being we, we, I won't say it's just now being exploited,

738
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,569
but we're at least starting to find out about it

739
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,680
where XZ now poly fills something else is gonna show up soon.

740
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,359
And

741
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,599
the thing baking my brain

742
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,660
is we literally don't know what to do about this.

743
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,609
And you, you, there's,

744
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:14,040
there's gonna be a ton of people with solutions coming out of the woodwork and like,

745
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,630
look at scorecard,

746
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:21,469
that's of no value in this instance. Like uh it what do we do?

747
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,989
Well, the problem is like a thought experiment time, let's say,

748
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,660
for the sake of argument of going really crazy somehow.

749
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,020
A North Korean company, let's ignore sanctions.

750
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,900
A North Korean company buys cloud flare.

751
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,790
Yeah.

752
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:33,599
Yeah,

753
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,400
we don't have a way to deal with that.

754
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,680
It would be like a world ending of it.

755
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:45,359
So, so funny enough, the solution there actually is the US government would block

756
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:48,040
the sale of cloud flare to anyone,

757
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,619
someone like Microsoft or Google or Oracle or someone like that, right?

758
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,819
That is an example of cloud flare being critical infrastructure

759
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:03,140
and the government is going to care. But now let's say curl, right? Which is a guy,

760
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,599
let's say Daniel one day is like,

761
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:12,780
I'm going to sell Curl for $10 million to this

762
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:17,160
-- shady Chinese company that doesn't
-- even have to be shady.

763
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,670
-- Yeah, whatever.
-- It could be totally legit looking. But

764
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,010
-- you
-- know what

765
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,359
I mean?

766
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:25,630
And they be like they promised me they won't do anything bad

767
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:27,060
and like

768
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,199
what, what then

769
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:29,949
you know,

770
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,089
well, or a better example would be brew, right?

771
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:34,650
Like how do you install brew on Mac Os curl, blah, blah,

772
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,810
-- blah pipe sh
-- which is how everything is installed on everything.

773
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:40,489
So if somebody bought brew,

774
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,109
they would literally now be able to compromise every Mac developer on the planet.

775
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:52,189
I mean, yeah, and there's there's I I bet if we put together a list of like critical,

776
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:55,197
we'll we'll call it critical open source infrastructure,

777
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,046
things like curl and brew and all that.

778
00:33:57,187 --> 00:34:02,616
I bet you we could make a list of 300 things easily

779
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:06,597
and that's already more than 10 is un trackable.

780
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:10,096
And so now we're back to the, we don't, we have no idea what to do.

781
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:13,596
And this is, I mean, this is something like Toma De Pierre, right.

782
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:15,156
That I, I am not a supplier

783
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:17,487
of a blog post author.

784
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:21,793
He and I talk about this on a fairly regular basis, is all of this,

785
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:23,664
like just infrastructure

786
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:26,563
that doesn't get attention, it doesn't get funding

787
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:30,404
and in many instances, like it's very critical path.

788
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:31,533
OK. Here's two thoughts.

789
00:34:31,543 --> 00:34:34,003
I have number one even just identifying it,

790
00:34:34,013 --> 00:34:36,243
like what are the things that everybody installs on their thing?

791
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:38,322
You know, home brew VLC blah, blah, blah.

792
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:41,154
What if like because there's been talk of, you know,

793
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,813
ad blockers being sold to malicious.

794
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:46,934
Well, there have been instances of, of browser extensions at that

795
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:50,219
and this is happening with like not a theory,

796
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:51,551
-- actual
-- real.

797
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:53,520
And so I would say the first thing would be even

798
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:55,641
just identifying it and we're not even close to that yet.

799
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:59,200
But then the second thing would be is sort of who's in charge or control of it.

800
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,101
Like where does it come from? Who can?

801
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,420
And again, we can't do that because some people would like privacy, you know,

802
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,041
they're a, they're a pseudonym or an anonymous user on github or they don't

803
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,061
have their real name and pictures and for all we know, you know,

804
00:35:11,071 --> 00:35:13,400
let's pretend that's not even an issue.

805
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:18,060
Should it be Sisa? Should it be the eu, should it be the United Nations?

806
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,800
Like, no matter what group you pick, half the people are going to hate it and be like,

807
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,820
morally opposed to it.

808
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,229
Here's my comment on that.

809
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:26,860
For example,

810
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,500
every country has the generally speaking their own food safety standards.

811
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:35,885
-- And so for example, fruit loops are pale in comparison to American fruit
-- loops.

812
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:37,715
They're not radioactive.

813
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:41,104
Well, because there's certain dyes that America

814
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:42,625
likes and they,

815
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:44,495
they do pop like they make the food look amazing

816
00:35:44,554 --> 00:35:46,905
and they're illegal in Canada and the e in Europe,

817
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:51,919
you know, and so I think part of this is this is part of digital sovereignty, you know,

818
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:53,669
which Simon Wardley and Wardley Mapping talks

819
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,239
a lot about digital sovereignty of us,

820
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,560
America if I

821
00:35:57,729 --> 00:36:02,129
like they have no control over poly fill or how people use it or even insight into it.

822
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:05,820
So, in the US context, yeah, CIA needs to do something.

823
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,399
I don't know what that something is, but

824
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,280
I would say this falls under like it sounds like a problem that they need

825
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,629
to go deal with or make sure

826
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:14,659
somebody's dealing with because under digital sovereignty,

827
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:18,120
-- like you're handing it off to this Chinese company
-- except there are

828
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:19,780
9 million

829
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:20,239
open

830
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:21,270
source projects.

831
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:21,870
Well,

832
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,689
and there's like 9 million vendors on

833
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:25,989
Amazon selling stuff that sometimes catches fire.

834
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,479
And we've generally tried, like, I won't buy food on Amazon,

835
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,110
like, just

836
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,340
the chance of fakes and stuff.

837
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,580
-- Like,
-- just, no, luckily no one started selling fake cheesies yet.

838
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,350
So I can still buy those off Amazon.

839
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:38,860
Right.

840
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:43,239
I mean, this is, this is part of that maturity curve of, is this a pain in the butt?

841
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,709
Yeah. Well, this is, this is the kind of thing where government is necessary.

842
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,387
This is not a private solution space.

843
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:51,187
Yeah, you're probably right.

844
00:36:51,197 --> 00:36:51,488
Like I,

845
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,927
I don't think the answer to this is not going to

846
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:57,288
be open ssf scorecard or S bombs or anything like that.

847
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,377
Like yes, those things can help and I'm not saying you shouldn't use them

848
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:04,708
to try to keep your own infrastructure in order.

849
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:07,268
But this is so much bigger than that and I want to end the

850
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:10,308
show because I know we could keep rambling on for hours about this.

851
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:13,127
But I don't know how long this kind of stuff has been happening,

852
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:15,417
but I think we're going to see more and more of it because

853
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,766
because the more people look,

854
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:20,545
the more they will find like at the moment we're stuck at the point of the

855
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:22,585
drunk looking under the streetlight for his car

856
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:24,726
keys because this is where the light is

857
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:25,706
and I think

858
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:28,375
-- it's gonna get crazy
-- and I think it's gonna get

859
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:30,105
worse in the sense of look at the pandemic.

860
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,446
What did we learn from the pandemic?

861
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:32,426
Nothing.

862
00:37:32,595 --> 00:37:35,275
No, like nobody. Very few people are masking

863
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:40,916
the adoption of the latest COVID shot in Canada is like 20%

864
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:43,895
like, and I suspect this is part of the problem

865
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:47,983
here is that this problem is so big and so convoluted and complex. There

866
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:49,624
cannot and won't be a solution

867
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:50,954
that works for everybody.

868
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:53,464
Will there be like private solutions where like, oh, well, you know,

869
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:56,224
find these malicious guys and help you block them and you know,

870
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,464
s bomb your supply chain of web stuff.

871
00:37:58,474 --> 00:38:00,243
Yeah, that there's already a market for that,

872
00:38:00,374 --> 00:38:03,743
but this isn't going to solve it at scale and make it better for everybody and, and,

873
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:06,864
-- but life will just kind of lurch along like, you know, I mean,
-- we'll, we'll,

874
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:08,144
we'll survive.

875
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:13,461
Some people will get ripped off and like a few people will log into their exchange and

876
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:16,971
their waltz will be empty one day and that's gonna suck for them.

877
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,382
It's ironic, it's too big to fix.

878
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:19,981
Like,

879
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,481
so we'll just ignore it.

880
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,221
Too big to fix.

881
00:38:23,392 --> 00:38:27,342
-- No, I like that. Too big to fix.
-- That's, that'll be the podcast episode.

882
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,582
