Hello and welcome to episode 93 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,220
Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:11,979
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:17,250
Right. I'm just gonna call 2018 as the year that keeps on giving

4
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,409
because if, if I would have told you even say six months ago

5
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,090
that there's going to be a privilege escalation flaw in the beep program.

6
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,610
You would have laughed at me and told me I'm an idiot

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,889
and, and

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,040
like, I don't even know, like, beep.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,919
Just,

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,709
well, that's what I don't even know. This is what I hate about.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,939
All these old UNIX utilities is

12
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:44,490
so many of these old UNIX utilities require

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,090
some degree of privileged access,

14
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:50,090
especially when they interact with hardware because there was, like,

15
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:51,290
no sound subsystem.

16
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:53,029
Like I, you know,

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,110
you and I probably both owned our first several computers didn't have, like, sound,

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,479
it had the, the built in.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,959
Is it even

20
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:05,650
a

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,290
speaker elect?

22
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,190
It,

23
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,959
it didn't make tones, it just, it beeped or it

24
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:12,000
didn't beep.

25
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:12,970
Right.

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,879
And it, it seemed to work back in the day and apparently now beep needs to be set U ID

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,790
to beep.

28
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,370
Yeah, because it's talking of hardware.

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,099
I mean,

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,830
unless there's like, well,

31
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:27,589
yeah,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,709
just, yes, I mean, because here's the thing, like, what are we better off with,

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,470
like a kernel interface for beep

34
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:34,849
or?

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,440
Yeah, exactly.

36
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,709
Well, remember that's how I used to play audio files. Right.

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,730
Cap the A U file into DEV audio.

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,209
I remember that.

39
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,669
And, you know,

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,760
I'll never forget there was way back in the day

41
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,650
I was working on an open source project and,

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,849
and we thought, wouldn't it be a neat Easter egg

43
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:52,769
if you caned the binary to DEV audio

44
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,860
and it, it like, played something,

45
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:55,379
right?

46
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:57,720
Because it would be like a hidden audio file

47
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,379
in the binary because I remember that too.

48
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:00,660
That'd always be the joke you do

49
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,010
is you don't log into their computer,

50
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,489
you know, V SSH and then just like, start catting random garbage into

51
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,800
audio and it would,

52
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,050
it would scare them half to death. It was, it was lovely.

53
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:15,160
I remember and this terminal escape sequence is control G,

54
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:15,809
right?

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,399
And you, if you were chatting with somebody on like IRC,

56
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,399
you could fire off a line of control GS at them in their computer would just be like,

57
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:24,000
ah, yes, those are the good old days.

58
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:27,550
And, and that does still work, but, well, not in Irc maybe.

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,820
Well, and it's also come up again with, uh people have discovered, of course,

60
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,690
people cut and paste stuff from web pages into their command line.

61
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,070
Like all of those new age Softwares that are like to install this, you know,

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,000
type in curl hyphen blah, blah, blah pipe sh.

63
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,139
And it's like, oh, that's a little scary.

64
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:45,139
But then it's like, oh, wait, you can like hide

65
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,330
characters in there either using um

66
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:48,229
unicode

67
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,710
or like a really small font or like

68
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,869
a white font on a white background

69
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,350
and people will just cut and paste,

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,050
slam it into the command line and you could even embed like a new line so

71
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:01,509
that they don't even really get a chance to like view it before it like executes,

72
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,309
you know, put a new line in the middle of the command.

73
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:07,179
Oh Man, that happens to me all the time where if you, if you drag too far,

74
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,619
you end up with a new line.

75
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,750
So when you paste it, it hits enter.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,339
Yeah,

77
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,210
I know.

78
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,789
Go beep and I don't,

79
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
I don't think there's much else to say.

80
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,979
Yeah. Well, and, but here's the best part about the beep thing

81
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,039
is remember they provided sort of a

82
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,520
joke patch for it,

83
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,320
right?

84
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,279
And

85
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,300
the patch for

86
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,320
beep, OK? This is going to get a little confusing.

87
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,419
You apply patches in UNIX called the utility called patch.

88
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,039
So when you use patch to apply the patch to beep, the patch exploits patch

89
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:43,919
and then you end up with patch running arbitrary code as these are running the patch,

90
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,279
right?

91
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,279
Because of a 30 year old feature

92
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:49,759
I,

93
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,270
right. And that, that's the second half to this story. It's just

94
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,880
old code keeps giving.

95
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:01,119
This is more than I can handle. It's, it's, I don't even know if, is it old code even is

96
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:02,520
like, 30 years old. Yeah,

97
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,190
it is.

98
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:04,449
When I started

99
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,100
I looked in the last release was, I think in 2012.

100
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,649
Yeah, it's not maintained anymore because it's

101
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,279
right.

102
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,860
It feels like one of those things that probably doesn't need a lot of attention.

103
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:15,520
Let's face it.

104
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,858
If, if we let people keep developing it, it's gonna just turn into emacs someday

105
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:24,540
and we don't, we don't need that. We have one. We don't need to.

106
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,500
So, yeah. So what happened in patch is there?

107
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,260
So patch basically applies a patch file to a set of other files and,

108
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:36,839
or it can generate a patch file by comparing two sets of files.

109
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,309
Right. So the idea

110
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,950
doesn't create patch files. Diff creates patch files. Oh, sorry. Yeah.

111
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:43,575
Just patches.

112
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,864
I thought I had a copy of patch that would actually create the patch file.

113
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,904
Please say, I hope that doesn't exist because that would be terrible if it did.

114
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:53,964
Oh, ok. Right. Yeah. Sorry. You're right. Yeah, it's different.

115
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,834
It's, it's been a long time since I've had to do this because quite honestly,

116
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:59,125
everything just happens and get now magically.

117
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:03,075
It's true. It's true. It's, it's much easier than it used to be. Thank God.

118
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,774
All this stuff is being abstracted from people.

119
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,265
But so yeah, long story short, sorry.

120
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:07,524
Um

121
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,005
patch

122
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,285
applies a patch

123
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:11,725
to

124
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,839
uh file or files,

125
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:18,910
creates new files. Uh can delete files, can modify what's in the files.

126
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:21,260
Uh The format's

127
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,690
conceptually simple. You

128
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,890
have a file name and then plus space content or minus.

129
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,049
Yeah, I'm getting to that. I'm getting to that.

130
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:35,929
So, and, and conceptually what the a patch file typically looks like is

131
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,890
here's the file we're going to interact with.

132
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,739
Here's the list of interactions and

133
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,459
it can also have stuff like the line number.

134
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,410
So it, you know, knows where to go in the file and it's got, you know,

135
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,570
um essentially a plus or minus, either

136
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:51,440
delete this, delete this line or add this line and then when you're modifying a line,

137
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,850
you'll have like the delete the line and then the, you know, plus this new line.

138
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,760
Cool. Right. Conceptually simple. Effective.

139
00:05:59,089 --> 00:05:59,519
Oh,

140
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:02,760
wouldn't it be awesome if you could have a patch file that could like

141
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:07,480
cause your uh text editor to fire off so that you could like interact with

142
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:10,239
the file while you're patching it like that. Actually,

143
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,440
honestly, 20 years ago seems kind of useful.

144
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,859
So of course, they add this

145
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,200
and of course it,

146
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:20,820
well, here's the thing you need to a text editor on a UNIX system.

147
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,390
Well, what do we have that everybody has?

148
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:26,630
Ed Ed is the only editor that's everywhere. Yes.

149
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:27,890
Right. Viv

150
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,190
No V I and

151
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:29,730
VR,

152
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,359
well VM came after V I so V I didn't even exist back in those days.

153
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:36,820
But V I, like, I remember being on systems that didn't have V Mas or yeah,

154
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,200
didn't even have V I like so UNIX.

155
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,339
Right. And, and that's so, that's important.

156
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,970
But, you know, putting on the Geezer hat for a minute, you had a couple of scenarios,

157
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,540
one

158
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,190
was,

159
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,140
the system was underpowered and so the

160
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,869
admin either wouldn't install or would disable V

161
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:53,059
space

162
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,100
or, or memory was usually the issue, right? Ed

163
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,250
used very little memory and, and you could do the work you needed to do.

164
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,470
You'd also have admins like an admin would hate V I and they would disable it.

165
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,940
So you can only use emacs if you logged into the system.

166
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,170
Like what's the matter with you? You monster?

167
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,970
Right. Or alternatively,

168
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:11,769
um

169
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,679
I remember I worked with an admin once who

170
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,779
hated emacs and claimed it used too much memory.

171
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,339
I'm like, that's, that's a line, you know it, but whatever. So he uninstalled it

172
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,359
you had to

173
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:20,839
use

174
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:21,649
or more to the point.

175
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,029
I've dealt with systems where it was installed as a turnkey,

176
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,390
like accounting system and too bad.

177
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,140
There's no editor.

178
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,709
Sure. Right. Right. Well, except Ed or Cisco routers, man. I, I remember I learned Ed

179
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:36,950
because of Cisco routers because on every Cisco router there was Ed.

180
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,500
And so if you had to edit a configuration file, you could just you know,

181
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,489
open it up and Ed do what you needed to do and then keep going,

182
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,070
see. And here's what really blows me away is like

183
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,670
Mac O West has Ed, like the most recent version of Mac Os has Ed.

184
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,049
Why wouldn't

185
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:52,809
it,

186
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:54,579
Ed?

187
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:58,750
So the beauty is this patch file has its way to

188
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,829
essentially you can have a line

189
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:06,019
and it passes that line to Ed and Ed processes that line.

190
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,980
Now, Ed being a text editor, of course on a UNIX system,

191
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,940
you're inside of your text editor

192
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,609
and you want to run a command.

193
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,380
And again, this is before the days of fancy tools like screen or you know,

194
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:23,179
having a graphical user interface or you know, you're on basically 300 bod dial up.

195
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,459
So that means like 300 characters per second.

196
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:26,890
So

197
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,420
pretty much all the text editors had some facility internally to run commands,

198
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,150
right?

199
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:32,890
Sure.

200
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,820
I think basically they all still do pretty much eviv

201
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,650
I Yeah.

202
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,190
Anyway, so Ed had this

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,690
and so the beauty is in patch,

204
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,340
you can add a line of text to a patch file that will then be passed to Ed

205
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,729
and that text line will trigger Ed to then execute an arbitrary

206
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,530
shell command or commands as much as you want. Basically.

207
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,739
So you can basically create patch files that when applied will

208
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,909
cause command and code execution as whoever's applying the patch file,

209
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:01,609
right?

210
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:05,770
And the beauty is Ed, I guess kind of like a lot of people, you know,

211
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,619
is also like, well, this could be dangerous.

212
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,320
So if you run Ed hyphen R, it's Ed in restricted mode and it doesn't allow,

213
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,969
for example, command execution

214
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,049
seems like a good idea

215
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,580
except it's not the default. Whoops. Right.

216
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,849
So what free Bs D did is free BS D created a,

217
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,250
there's now a slash bin slash

218
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,010
Ed and a slash bin slash red.

219
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,640
So there's like a copy of that runs in restricted mode by default.

220
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,059
And they then also changed,

221
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,950
um I believe they changed the patch source code to then point at

222
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,770
that red editor so that they wouldn't have command execution as a possibility.

223
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:49,169
So, you know, of course, this got caught in 2015 by free BS D. And of course,

224
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:54,369
I'll be honest, most of us UNIX guys, we, we tend to stay in our own UNIX worlds

225
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:55,869
really.

226
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,590
You know,

227
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,979
like I, I have no idea what Solaris

228
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,570
or so

229
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,750
Os is doing anymore.

230
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:03,679
I,

231
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:05,640
I agree, I've really only run Linux

232
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,539
for probably the last five or six years. And I mean, I run Mac O

233
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,679
now, which is a form of UNIX, but quite honestly, I don't dig around it all that much.

234
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,150
I just,

235
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,520
and,

236
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,000
and more to the point there's no reason to because like either

237
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,520
I get my patches from Apple and install them or I don't,

238
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:24,119
that's it. Those are my options as far as security on a Mac go.

239
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,500
So, yeah, I mean, it's just,

240
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:29,500
I was, I was poking around, I mean, there is a ton of old,

241
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:33,179
uh like if you look at it on a Linux system is the GNU Core

242
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,020
Ils is the package you want to take a poke

243
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,030
at like that's kind of like the oldest craftiest stuff.

244
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,820
Um And I don't mean Cruft necessarily and like it's bad, bad code.

245
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,330
It's just, it's crufty in that.

246
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,809
It's like, literally a lot of this code is older than the people now using it.

247
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:52,010
It's a really good point. It is really old, isn't it?

248
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,679
Yeah.

249
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:54,849
And I don't mean just like my kids who are seven, but I mean,

250
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,590
like administrators running these systems,

251
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,650
you know,

252
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,369
it doesn't matter how old the code is sometimes, I mean,

253
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,239
well, because

254
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,080
it's from a different era,

255
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,010
it comes from a different era where, for example, back in this era,

256
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:11,570
how did you get a patch file?

257
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,609
He downloaded it off the B BS, right?

258
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,900
Or off an MTP server.

259
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,049
And it was essentially a relatively trusted way because

260
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:20,599
like,

261
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,700
for example, doing a man in the middle attack that was like Black magic 20 years ago.

262
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,210
Like, I remember when tools

263
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:32,659
unheard of came out to do art poisoning and we're like, oh my God, my local subnet

264
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,210
because we didn't have switches, we all had hubs.

265
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
Yes. You know,

266
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:40,609
and then like, art poisoning came along and we're like, oh God,

267
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:43,789
we have to get smart switches and we have to configure the switches not to be dumb.

268
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,349
And that was like, really expensive.

269
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:48,770
We're talking hundreds of dollars per port and now it's, you know,

270
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,719
these things are like 20 bucks,

271
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,640
you know, and they just do this all by default.

272
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:54,719
Um,

273
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,979
so that's the thing, right? Like if somebody emailed me a patch file, like

274
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,630
that was because I was on, like, the Linux

275
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:05,219
mailing list or whatever. And they're like, oh here's this bug boom. The deve,

276
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,030
you know, the DEV just mailed me a patch.

277
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,929
I applied it and hey, my system stopped crashing. But part of it too, a lot of projects

278
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,679
didn't use source code control

279
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:15,880
because I mean, the Linux kernel used FTP

280
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,890
for managing the source code.

281
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,530
I mean, I remember like CV S was terrible but it's all we had.

282
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:25,530
And that's the other thing is, is when you look at the ecosystem back then, yeah,

283
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:27,770
you had like CV S, you had patch, you had diff

284
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,530
you had like some very basic text editors

285
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,400
and, and, and devs made these things work together in ways that

286
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:35,640
assumed

287
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,080
a completely trusted environment of a DEV on his workstation

288
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:42,229
working with other devs who he like literally

289
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,000
has, you know, known for since college or whatever, right?

290
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,669
Highly trusted groups of people,

291
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,460
you know, like II, I guess it would be like um

292
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,280
the pope and the cardinals, right?

293
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,460
All these cardinals know each other for like, 50 years.

294
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:55,260
Right.

295
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,270
So, when they elect a Pope,

296
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,390
it's a pretty high trust exercise because it's like everybody in

297
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,039
the room voting has known each other for like 50 years.

298
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,289
You know, it'd be hard to get an imposter.

299
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,599
Uh,

300
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,570
yeah, that's, that's probably fair.

301
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,070
There

302
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,440
was,

303
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,580
there was no concept of a pull request or anything like that.

304
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:15,719
I mean, it was, it was like an email list and if you were a nobody,

305
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,280
they were going to be like, who's this guy go with? And then they would thrash you

306
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,960
and your code

307
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,869
and then you lick your wounds and come back.

308
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,109
And after about the 10 or 20th time that happened, they might,

309
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,609
they might start talking to you and accept you into the,

310
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,705
the barrier to entry was really high, wasn't it?

311
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,195
The barrier to entry was very mean.

312
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:35,114
It was, it was and that's,

313
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,224
you know, we laugh but in all seriousness

314
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:37,445
that

315
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:40,835
it turned tech into what it is today with all of its

316
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,965
significant structural, I think we can probably use the word

317
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,585
misogyny without being

318
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:46,594
too out there.

319
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,909
Sadly,

320
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,390
yeah, I mean, you're right, you're right. It's not funny.

321
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:54,820
No, it's uh so anyways um yeah, I mean, that's the thing, right?

322
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,570
We come from this environment where it's everything is extremely high trust,

323
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,859
like literally

324
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,869
like I remember doing using Open BS D and like I would talk to the developers on IRC,

325
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:07,500
you know, Yeah, totally.

326
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:10,289
But the thing is like, the only people that kind of knew,

327
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,409
like you had to be in the in crowd to know about that and the

328
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,270
only way to be in the in crowd and know about that was to,

329
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,619
like,

330
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:17,140
jump through the flaming hoops and spiked pits

331
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:18,809
and, or like

332
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,169
the way I got into, Linux is a friend of mine was like,

333
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,210
you know, he introduced me to Os Two,

334
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:25,510
which was a heck of a lot better than Windows 3.11

335
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,190
I could now run two programs at the same time.

336
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,010
It was pretty fantastic.

337
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,559
And then he introduced me to Linux and I'm like, wow, this gooey stuff is amazing.

338
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,960
And then I saw the N CS, a mosaic web browser

339
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,229
and I basically just about lost my mind because I was like, oh my God,

340
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,989
that is the because I, you know, that's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

341
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,200
I've only used Telnet and FTP up to that point

342
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:45,070
and

343
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:46,500
the web browser uh

344
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:49,510
didn't really use gopher because like, what's the point of that?

345
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,070
Well, there is some stuff but no,

346
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,349
but nothing fun or interesting,

347
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,380
not like web pages, man.

348
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,429
And so, you know, like this era is

349
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,109
completely different,

350
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,429
like literally everybody knew everybody.

351
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,869
So you,

352
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,250
you,

353
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,719
you've got me thinking and this isn't really where

354
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:09,869
I expected this conversation to go in any way.

355
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,109
Nor was this something I was really thinking about. But

356
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:16,479
you have a very reasonable point in pointing out that a lot of our

357
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:21,599
tools and a lot of our processes we use are from 20 plus years ago

358
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,609
and that's not the world we live in today at all. And, and I think it's,

359
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,229
it would be

360
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,289
time to seriously think about a lot of what we do in that context.

361
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,909
And I can see this in security man.

362
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,690
I mean, how much stuff like passwords are my favorite, you know,

363
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,270
uh whipping whipping boy here of

364
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:37,880
like

365
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,590
how long did we tell people you have to change your passwords every 90 days?

366
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:43,460
And there are still people

367
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,080
that I hear that are saying, oh no, you have to do that and,

368
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,760
and you should do it because uh people reuse passwords on site or,

369
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,229
or people and there's all these excuses and I'm like,

370
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:54,440
none of this makes sense.

371
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:55,770
Yeah, exactly one.

372
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,479
And what I love there is the guy that actually

373
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,760
started that recommendation has officially apologized for it and said,

374
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,239
please, please don't.

375
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:03,099
Um

376
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,080
And part of it too is I, you know, like I look at some of these things like

377
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,270
some of it, we just can't do like, for example, you know,

378
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,619
typically when you join a company,

379
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,650
they do at least some minimal level of background check to like

380
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:17,390
make sure that your name is correct for like tax purposes,

381
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,530
right? Like you are who you are, you have the right

382
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,570
tax identification number, SSN si whatever it is,

383
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,039
you know, because so the tax office doesn't spank them

384
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:26,799
and,

385
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:28,309
you know, or like,

386
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,080
I remember when I was working for a company that got bought by a larger

387
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,849
company and they all the larger company

388
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,049
required a seven year background check through.

389
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,140
Um, what was it, choice point was

390
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,369
one of those, you know,

391
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:38,409
consumer

392
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,400
information holding bureaus, like aqui fact, but

393
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,479
more stuff

394
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,409
and, you know, but like, do open source projects, do that or any

395
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:49,065
software projects? Really? No, of course not.

396
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,094
Well, well, should they, I mean, I don't think they should.

397
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:52,434
I, I don't, I don't like the idea.

398
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,924
I would generally agree.

399
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:55,744
Um, you know, but that's the point is like,

400
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:59,325
what security kind of controls can or should a

401
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:01,585
software project put on the people

402
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:02,895
adding code to it?

403
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,375
That, that, that's a fair question

404
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,864
and, and I would back it up even more and say,

405
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,020
what can they do because

406
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,118
funnily enough, you know, that whole GDPR thing coming along in uh what, two months,

407
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,020
like one month, dude, from the time we're recording.

408
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:18,880
It's, that's

409
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,160
true.

410
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,410
Like it's May 25th, I believe,

411
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,020
which is

412
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,550
very

413
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:22,900
soon.

414
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:23,949
Yeah, that's coming up,

415
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,130
you

416
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,358
know,

417
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:25,800
on that.

418
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,589
Like, I mean, can I even legally require, like, oh,

419
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:30,900
I don't want to deal with that. So,

420
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,170
yeah, I mean, how do we,

421
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,939
I mean, the good news is as far as I can tell

422
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,689
in the open source world.

423
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,410
As far as I know and readers, if I am wrong,

424
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,849
please please please let us know because I would love to know about this.

425
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:45,930
We,

426
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,969
we don't have readers or listeners, sorry.

427
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:54,599
But as far as I know, there has never been like a truly sort of organized malicious

428
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,810
actor or actors

429
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,880
who have like joined a project to get hostile code in

430
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:02,040
that we know of that we know of.

431
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,640
Yeah, I was going to say the second thing being some code, the quality like, hm,

432
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,400
well, so here's the thing, I actually,

433
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,479
I've been thinking about this lately for some other reasons,

434
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,800
but this is a problem that exists in any organization.

435
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,880
It's not just open.

436
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:16,614
I mean,

437
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:17,055
well,

438
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:19,214
it's far worse and close source because they're

439
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,805
the only people that might ever know.

440
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:21,244
Well, now,

441
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:24,655
now here's something to cook your noodle if you look at an organization with,

442
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:27,875
say 100,000 employees and there are many of them in the world.

443
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:31,625
I, I would guess they have more than 100

444
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,540
insiders that are there specifically with malicious intent, be it.

445
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,140
They, they entered the organization willfully to deceive or

446
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,390
they're disgruntled and someone approached them with some sort of opportunity.

447
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,560
There's a million things it could be right.

448
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:48,579
But anyway,

449
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,219
you know, there's insiders and

450
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:54,900
it's a similar problem in open source. It is conceivable.

451
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,510
Somebody could join a project as an insider

452
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,895
and in an attempt to subvert the project in some way.

453
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:02,755
And alternatively,

454
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,084
there are people who just suck at programming

455
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:06,275
that are there too

456
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:09,364
and there's people who just make legitimate mistakes. There's right.

457
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,344
And that's the third thing,

458
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:12,385
like everyone makes mistakes.

459
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:16,925
Like the open SSH, like the thing I always point to is open SSH, has security bugs.

460
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:19,545
If those guys can't get, they're literally the best in the world. Right?

461
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:21,574
If they can't get it. Right. And they even have some

462
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:25,734
trivial security bugs and like, remember that code that was unused and

463
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,244
was all like,

464
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,699
should have been removed and they just didn't remove a bunch of dead code and

465
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,050
it happens. But anyway, so here's my point is that

466
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:39,770
we're approaching a place now in technology where

467
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,170
we don't have full control over what's going on and we, we maybe never did.

468
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,349
We

469
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:44,869
did,

470
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:45,050
we

471
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,569
did,

472
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,930
it was a, it was OK. That's fair. We'll say it wasn't a problem before.

473
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,849
And so this is where really

474
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,449
it's coming down to things like mitigating technologies are what's

475
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:58,930
more important than necessarily focusing on correctness of the,

476
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,209
the end product,

477
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:00,729
right?

478
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,270
Where, where this is, where putting things, you know, you've got your product,

479
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:08,489
you might or project whatever you wanna call it, you've got your, your application

480
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,290
and

481
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,270
maybe, you know, you did some sort of analysis, you've got your static analysis,

482
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,260
it's been fuzzed to death by different people, whatever.

483
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,609
There's all kinds of stuff that's happened

484
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,260
and then you go another layer.

485
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,189
And now let's say you're running it in a container, right?

486
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:22,739
And you've got various things where the container is restricting it.

487
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,619
And then you've got your host Os and the host Os

488
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,209
is doing things and you've got something monitoring the application,

489
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,810
you got something monitoring the container,

490
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:30,410
you got something monitoring the host OS

491
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,420
and

492
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:36,359
individually, these things aren't necessarily useful, nor are they 100%.

493
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,380
But when you start putting them together,

494
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,130
you start approaching

495
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,800
100% you'll never get there. But it becomes much, much, much more difficult.

496
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,300
And every time you add a layer,

497
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:48,739
the burden on an attacker goes up

498
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,130
substantially

499
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,410
well. But this also leads to the second point of

500
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,260
having all that is no good if you don't have response, right?

501
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,569
Because if an attacker can just sit there and wail

502
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,939
away on it all day long with no response,

503
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:00,650
right?

504
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:04,630
And that's the second thing is you need detection and then some sort of action to,

505
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,849
you know, ideally correct the system or harden it or whatever.

506
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,069
And that's one thing where I love open source, right?

507
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:09,959
Because open source,

508
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:14,010
like the majority of security flaws in the open source world are fixed super quick,

509
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,109
like pretty much as fast as the devs can

510
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,869
do it.

511
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:17,750
Yes, they are.

512
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,900
But I mean, well, in this was, I mean,

513
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,150
this is a topic talking to Rami last time was the fact that even though these projects

514
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:24,505
are fixing things quickly.

515
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:28,435
The people actually consuming it often. I don't even know what's happened. Right.

516
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:30,854
That's, that's a very big known problem.

517
00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:32,954
And that's, you know, one of the reasons why I keep trying to get CV,

518
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:36,125
data to be more accessible and easy to get because then you can at

519
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:39,194
least label these problems and give people a chance to know about these problems.

520
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,469
Um

521
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,770
And yeah, I mean, consuming, this is hard, especially now,

522
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,719
like how well trick question, but how much software do you have on your workstation

523
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,130
or on a server? And the answer is like a lot,

524
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,709
that's not a trick question. The answer is infinity.

525
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,069
It might as well be infinity because I can't possibly keep track of it. All right.

526
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:02,130
Yeah. So

527
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:06,010
no, I, I do worry about some of these old timey tools and um

528
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,729
cause there's a lot of tools that

529
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:11,829
people interact with constantly without really thinking about

530
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:12,010
it.

531
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,300
Yeah. Again, had you told me that that patch has a security issue?

532
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,130
I'd be like you're an idiot, but that's not even possible.

533
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,229
What are you talking about?

534
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,530
And it turns out it does.

535
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,400
So,

536
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:28,050
and, and now, now here's the thing is the answer to get rid of patch.

537
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:28,680
I,

538
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,449
we, we do need

539
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:31,790
it.

540
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:33,329
Uh

541
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:34,250
Yes.

542
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,979
And

543
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:38,410
it, it, but here's the thing too and this is one of the things that gets me.

544
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:42,170
It's basically unmaintained. It hasn't been updated since 2012.

545
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,180
I, I know, there's a team that, that's dealing with this now. But like

546
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:48,250
you could argue this is critical infrastructure

547
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:49,250
and

548
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,689
it's abandon wear. Like what is up with that?

549
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,670
Well, it, it from a functional perspective, it's essentially complete,

550
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,250
right? It does what it does.

551
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,250
Yes,

552
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,459
it's like LS

553
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,790
from a functional perspective. LS is largely complete,

554
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,359
you know, and it, it, these util the thing to remember,

555
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:14,719
like especially with the UNIX velocity of have a tool that does one thing does it well

556
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,099
and you know, learn to love pipe and smash things together.

557
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,709
A lot of these tools like I'm just looking at core

558
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,439
ILS bin

559
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,500
and I mean,

560
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:24,140
there's a lot of stuff in here that

561
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:29,300
could very easily have code execution flaws uh base 32 base 64

562
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,670
base name. Oh God

563
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,420
C imagine if cat had some

564
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,099
thing.

565
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,469
Uh But you know, there's things like, for example,

566
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:38,089
unique and sort they do some relatively

567
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:41,800
useful things that also involve holding some very large

568
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,849
data. Imagine

569
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,619
that

570
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,479
unquestionably there are security flaws in that code

571
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,089
right

572
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:51,339
there. They're without, without a doubt.

573
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:55,599
Now, it could be extremely esoteric, but it doesn't matter because there, there's

574
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,530
like unique and sort literally 10 times a day,

575
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,630
I guess. Here's my point though is we know we can't fix all that source code.

576
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,839
We know that's out of the question.

577
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:07,439
And so this is where I think you need

578
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:11,099
to start using uh your layering your defenses right.

579
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,329
Uh Actually something I started working on at one point was trying to

580
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:17,709
figure out can I literally run every shell command in a container,

581
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:21,880
right, where I type unique and it executes in a container.

582
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,369
And then I pipe that and actually what I found out is uh for whatever reason, the,

583
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,209
the pipes would fail if IP too many things together.

584
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:29,920
It, it did some

585
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:33,000
wings and that's something I need to figure out. But then we get the point is

586
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,969
this is really what we need to be thinking about is having the ability to like

587
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,969
sandbox everything to death and having the ability

588
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:40,130
to log and know what's going on and,

589
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,449
and,

590
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,810
and understand, like, let me give you an example,

591
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:45,930
let's say you run unique 100 times a day, right?

592
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,010
And

593
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,770
every time you run it,

594
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:51,060
it never writes a file to disk,

595
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,020
right?

596
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,739
Or

597
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,719
I would love to have, you know,

598
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,770
if I could basically define a profile for a lot

599
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,619
of these commands where it's like all you get to

600
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:02,859
kind of do is return stuff to standard out.

601
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,329
Right. Right. Exactly. Exactly.

602
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,930
And, and not just not saying this is all you can do,

603
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,390
but I think also having the ability to do some

604
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,969
profiling is part of the story here as well because

605
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,930
if

606
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,810
restricting something and saying, all right, you can't write to shell,

607
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:21,489
but all of a sudden every time you run unique, it's trying to write

608
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:23,930
uh you know, or execute a shell, I say,

609
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,099
OK, that's bad. But if all you're doing is restricting,

610
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,079
do you have a way to have something?

611
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:33,630
Tell you, hey, uh, unique is trying to execute a shell, maybe,

612
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,449
maybe something's going on here, right?

613
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,099
We actually could build this policy through Se Linux

614
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:39,060
right

615
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:39,569
today.

616
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:39,890
Oh,

617
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,939
no, totally.

618
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:47,030
And then that means I now have a E Linux policy file or logs, you know, with problems.

619
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,209
And

620
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,930
I, I, you know, the thing is I run Fedora and I like, I,

621
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,579
I still occasionally get those like Se Linux

622
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:56,680
policy violation pops up in the thing. And I'm just kind of like,

623
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:57,060
man,

624
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,500
go away, I don't care,

625
00:25:59,550 --> 00:25:59,890
right?

626
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,109
And that, that's one of the problems with Se Linux is Se Linux creates alert video

627
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:05,229
in users,

628
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,560
right? Like, well, not

629
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,760
alert fatigue, but what the heck does this alert mean? Why did it happen?

630
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,530
I would have to really dig into it.

631
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:13,010
And I, I literally

632
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,060
consciously, I don't have time for that. Like I'm just,

633
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,280
I really don't.

634
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:20,599
No, I, I agree completely. And and this is where

635
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,619
we need to start investigating kind of the

636
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,030
next level because our error messages are terrible.

637
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,890
We don't have the ability to necessarily correlate events

638
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:33,530
because let's face it too. Like you could have what appears benign.

639
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,520
But when you look at it in the context of the last three events that got logged.

640
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,280
Oh, wait, that's not benign. Like that's a really big deal.

641
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,930
Look at what's actually going on here.

642
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:46,880
And this is, I feel like maybe the next stage, but alternatively,

643
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,229
are we gonna end up with this in everyone's desktop? The answer is no. Right.

644
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:53,400
I mean, let's face it, it's legitimately no.

645
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,449
And so this kind of becomes a question of now, what, what's the next stage here?

646
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,250
Because I think in a corporate environment

647
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:05,050
you've got j well, you should have a substantial logging infrastructure,

648
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,890
right? That, that can look for these things.

649
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,939
You know what I've done, which is I have my base operating system

650
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,420
sy,

651
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,890
like I have my hardware running an operating system,

652
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:16,920
but I do all my work inside of a VM.

653
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,869
That's a great step, I think. And I, I do the same for many, many tasks.

654
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,239
And in fact,

655
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,560
what I found is also exciting is then obviously you

656
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:27,449
can just connect to the VM from like other consoles,

657
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,459
for example, and, and do fun things.

658
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:30,020
But,

659
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:31,579
uh, like, like R SAS,

660
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,729
the, the, well, this episode will be out after RSA, I imagine.

661
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:35,699
But, uh, at

662
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:37,849
RS A, I'm bringing my chromebook, right?

663
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,989
I'm not bringing a real computer because let's face it.

664
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,410
Like the odds of hacking a chromebook are pretty low

665
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,400
and even if it does get totally whacked and I know there's something wrong with it,

666
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:45,979
you know, I'm gonna do it,

667
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:48,040
I'm gonna throw it in the garbage and I go buy a new one for two.

668
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,545
And here's the beauty of something like having a chromebook at hacked.

669
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:56,564
A large company cares very deeply about that problem.

670
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:59,214
If you go to Google and you say I have a chromebook hack

671
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:04,214
Google is going to a pay you a lot of money and b fix it really quick,

672
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:05,844
right? And that's what I love about.

673
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:07,204
A lot of these cloud providers is like

674
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:09,305
a great example being like Amazon web services,

675
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:10,204
Microsoft,

676
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:12,494
Azure, Google, you know, cloud engine,

677
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:16,579
if I were to say to them, hey, uh cool story,

678
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:20,140
I found a way to use resources for free or I found a way to do XY or Z

679
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,479
they would like basically poop themselves a bit and

680
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:24,819
then fix it as fast as they could because,

681
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,829
you know, their brand reputation really does matter.

682
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,640
Yeah.

683
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,689
Well, not just brand reputation, it's real money, like if you can use it for free

684
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:33,270
and

685
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,109
yeah, and now with GDPR, you know, those fines are pretty hefty.

686
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:38,890
So, I mean, and

687
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,369
that's part of it is, you know, using these services and hardware

688
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:45,489
where somebody kind of really does care about their brand.

689
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,489
Um because I'll be blunt it clearly nobody actually.

690
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,180
Well, you know,

691
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:54,790
there was that study of um do security events actually impact stock price at all.

692
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,619
And the answer is no,

693
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,280
no, they do not. Like look at Equifax, there was a bounce

694
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,099
or a little dip or whatever it's called

695
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:02,040
Yeah, exactly.

696
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:05,380
Yeah, let's all delete our Facebook profiles. Sure. Any day now.

697
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,290
So, yeah, I mean, it's, it's,

698
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,819
it's a, it's

699
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,119
a part of the problem is this change has happened gradually over the years,

700
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,199
but it's now 20 or 30 years later.

701
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:14,979
Like, I,

702
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:21,140
I have more bandwidth to my house than like North American backbone internet had

703
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,339
while I was on the internet.

704
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,949
You know what I mean? I remember

705
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:29,329
a T three was 45 megabits per second. That was the big bad boy.

706
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:30,439
Right. Like,

707
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,819
you know, some people had T threes.

708
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:36,459
I never got to touch one or log into a system attached to one, but

709
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:37,459
I heard about them.

710
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,219
Uh, you know, and that was like, what, 45 megabits per second now,

711
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:42,280
I have 175 bidirectionally,

712
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:42,979
you know,

713
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,380
that's

714
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:45,199
like,

715
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:49,959
so, you know, my computer now is literally over 1000 times faster than it was

716
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,760
1015 years ago.

717
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,819
You know, and

718
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,160
more to the point,

719
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,000
the access to the software we have, like, look at what's on github

720
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,500
now. It's mind blowing.

721
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,390
Right. 20 years ago, we thought the C

722
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,040
A thing with a couple of 1000 modules was like, actually pretty awesome. And it was,

723
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:09,530
and now you have, you know, your standard Ruby Gems or N PM or whatever has, you know,

724
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,449
50 to 100,000 libraries.

725
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,329
Yeah, it's madness. I agree.

726
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,290
So,

727
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,810
no, I think, but the problem is we've dragged all this old code along with us.

728
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:22,099
I mean, I look at things like open SSH or Apache. Open SSH is just what?

729
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,119
In their last release, they finally dropped

730
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,819
support for protocol, whatever by I

731
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:27,689
think it was.

732
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,689
That is, man, that's one of my pet peeves is letting

733
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:34,199
backwards compatibility. I, I feel like

734
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:37,699
get rid of it and if someone really needs old functionality,

735
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:39,449
let them run the old code, like, you know,

736
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,229
and, and don't make it too easy though because honestly,

737
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:44,949
it might be worth making them, like, go well, you know,

738
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:48,270
maybe we should just either engineer around it or stop doing that.

739
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,689
But yeah, a great example.

740
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:49,719
Yeah,

741
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:51,410
here drop compatibility support for some

742
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,050
very old SSH implementations including ssh.com.

743
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,760
Oh yeah, for those of you that don't know,

744
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,760
you

745
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,380
SSH was originally open source and then the guy tried to

746
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,920
essentially commercialize it and he did commercialize it and it's,

747
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,060
it's a decent product.

748
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,880
Um So you had ssh.com, you know, when they do like versions for mainframes and stuff.

749
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:10,739
But yeah,

750
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,170
so ssh.com less than are equal to version two point whatever and

751
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,400
open SSH less than are equal to version three point whatever.

752
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,260
Ah that is old. That's,

753
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,359
that's really

754
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:21,739
old.

755
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,359
Anyway,

756
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,219
these versions were, yeah, these versions were all released in or before 2001

757
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,510
and predate the final SSH R CS.

758
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:33,300
The support and question isn't necessary for RFC compliant. Yeah, I mean, it's just

759
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,469
again, yeah, this code is now

760
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,780
this, this code can now vote,

761
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:40,849
right?

762
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,140
And, and here's,

763
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,109
here's how, I guess let's wrap this up, let's bring it home.

764
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,510
But here's, here's my thought on this is

765
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,530
I understand

766
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,469
the necessity of backwards compatibility

767
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,579
in the context of the past

768
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:58,329
because things did move more slowly.

769
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,170
And I think expecting someone to be on something modern

770
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:06,150
was not necessarily a reasonable expectation.

771
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,500
And

772
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,800
you could also see instances where people would just,

773
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:15,459
they they would lack the ability to upgrade because there was an open source, right?

774
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,449
If you were on say an old sun machine and

775
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:20,199
the new version of Slays didn't work like too bad,

776
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,949
not my problem, right? And so there was,

777
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,910
there was something to be said about that backwards compatibility.

778
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,239
But the the era we live in today

779
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,410
that is much less important and let's face it like, well,

780
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,430
I'm gonna have to disagree because internet of things,

781
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:36,569
we're recreating this entire problem.

782
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,939
And at a vastly larger scale

783
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,410
in what context

784
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,890
in the context, I have a device that I can't update

785
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,170
because either I can't update it or there's no update.

786
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:47,849
I was getting to that

787
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:48,175
right.

788
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:54,214
There are unable devices and IOT is going to be the greatest sinner in this game.

789
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:57,635
But by allowing backwards compatibility,

790
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:00,204
we encourage people to keep these things.

791
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:03,834
Whereas if we throw away backwards compatibility and we,

792
00:33:03,844 --> 00:33:07,165
we march progress forward in this regard,

793
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:13,074
we create a disincentive to keep old gear because let's face it. Old gear.

794
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:16,635
Today is dangerous. Old gear back in the day wasn't

795
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:21,619
what's going to happen with people who are economically unable to do that.

796
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:21,829
I mean,

797
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,060
there are schools that can't afford to buy pencils and you're going to

798
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,589
be telling them they need to update their computers and their networks.

799
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:27,510
Yes,

800
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,130
it is. I, I, you do. You have to do it, man. There's no other way.

801
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,709
Well, and then the problem is there's, that creates a secondary effect.

802
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,790
Ok, I have to get rid of all my old gear. I better monetize getting rid of it.

803
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,689
Which means there's gonna be a huge secondary market for all this

804
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:44,270
old stuff and somebody will buy it even if it's garbage.

805
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,780
If it doesn't work though,

806
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,859
they will make it work because they'll just buy enough

807
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:49,819
old gear that it can all talk to itself.

808
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:51,069
Maybe. I mean,

809
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,640
you, you could be right. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say you're not.

810
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,469
I, I, in principle, I would love to see,

811
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,660
you know, if your code is old enough to vote, we take it all back and shoot it.

812
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,979
I would love to see that as like a rule,

813
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:05,790
but realistically it's not going to happen because there's just,

814
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,770
there's too many systems and people that can't upgrade

815
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,520
for any number of variety of reasons like,

816
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,350
ok, nuclear launch systems, right?

817
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,409
They were talking about how they, they have to source, what is it?

818
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:19,649
Those eight inch floppy disks. Right. And they do. Right.

819
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,370
Like, that's not a reason to keep using eight inch floppy disks.

820
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:27,010
Like, if, if one particular organization has a need,

821
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,000
they can solve it with money.

822
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,760
Right.

823
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,478
That's the reality of it.

824
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,239
And

825
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:35,989
this is a touchy subject and I won't disagree at all.

826
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,560
And I'm, I'm certain I'll get some hate mail

827
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:38,889
from

828
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:39,500
my opinion.

829
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:41,899
I think one of the things is to, you know,

830
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:45,840
we're seeing more frameworks and more sort of what I'm hoping to see more of is,

831
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,600
you know, so the device manufacturers,

832
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,760
their value add is sort of simpler in the sense

833
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,418
of rather than providing you with a whole system.

834
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,989
It's like here's Linux with Busy Box and you can keep updating

835
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,909
that we just do the web app on top of it,

836
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,469
right. And reduce the cost for these IOT guys so that they do,

837
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,090
they're less incentivized to not support it because it'll be well,

838
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,050
make it cheaper to support and there's a better chance they will.

839
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:08,449
I mean, maybe I'm,

840
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,070
I guess we don't know what the future will hold, but I'll tell you this,

841
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:15,850
the future can't be old devices that can't be updated, right?

842
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,840
Like that is, that is not a future we can afford.

843
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:19,570
Well, the Marai

844
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,949
Botnet, I mean, it'll be that times 1000 million.

845
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,350
Maybe it'll become self aware and start fixing itself, right?

846
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,739
That hope

847
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,780
and that's, that's how we shall end it.

848
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,229
I think I for one welcome, our robot overlords.

849
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,719
Alright, sweet. Well, thank you, Kurt. Thank you audience.

854
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,030
You too. Thanks.

855
