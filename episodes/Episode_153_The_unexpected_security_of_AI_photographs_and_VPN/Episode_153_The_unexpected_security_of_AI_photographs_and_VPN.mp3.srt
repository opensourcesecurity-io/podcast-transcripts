Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,899
episode 153 with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime.

2
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:12,789
Josh Pressers.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,520
-- What's
-- New Kurt Road

4
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:15,569
construction season?

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,319
-- Summer slash road construction?
-- Right?

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,760
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,760
My host was vibrating yesterday because they're,

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,790
they're working on the road behind my house.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,360
My house backs onto a major road. There's a, thank God there's a sound barrier. Yeah.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,579
So there's going to be road construction until October 31st.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,159
Oh, that's very exciting. How much fun is that?

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,119
Yeah. And that's the,

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,869
that's their hopeful date. That's not the real date.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,650
-- Is,
-- is that, I mean, you're in Canada?

15
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,389
Is that normal to go over the date horribly or do they generally?

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,209
Yeah, they go over the date horribly.

17
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:53,979
Uh, hang on a sec. Uh I, I forget how long it took us to fix or to finish the Anthony Hende

18
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:57,299
uh Ring road, but they finished the Anthony Hende Ring road

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,790
and then they had to start building all the overpasses because to save money,

20
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,740
they built the ring road first with most of the overpasses,

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,449
but not all of the overpasses.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,529
So you literally were on a ring road and you would come to a red light.

23
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:12,480
Sweet.

24
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,919
Guess what happens when you build overpasses on a heavily used ring road.

25
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:19,120
Nothing, nothing bad, I'm sure.

26
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,250
Yeah. So it's, but at the same time, right, like infrastructure has to be fixed.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,330
It's technical, it's literally technical debt.

28
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,750
So apparently what's happened is all the sewers out here in the west end, uh,

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,419
were supposed to last 100 years

30
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,769
and a lot of them are only lasting about 40.

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,290
Whoa. That's a big difference.

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,129
-- Yeah. And fixing sewers is not cheap. That
-- sounds like every it project ever.

33
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:41,889
Yeah, we'll be

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,449
good for 56 years.

35
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,889
-- Three months later.
-- I

36
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:50,290
think that's why contracting and consulting is so, um, enviable

37
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,800
because you get to leave.

38
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,519
Uh,

39
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,669
you do get to leave and then come back a few

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
months later to fix all the things you broke maybe.

41
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,610
Yeah. But, uh, anyways, so this episode,

42
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,559
yeah, I just so much, like, again, it's funny because the world is

43
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,680
on fire as usual and there's even no

44
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,839
on fire.

45
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,729
Well, but there's even more amusing piles of fire now. Like people are really true.

46
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:15,809
-- That's true.
-- Like this Facebook A I image thing.

47
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,369
All right. Why don't you explain it?

48
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,320
-- Just so those in the audience who may not be aware of this.
-- So

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,250
you can upload pictures to Facebook

50
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:24,050
and

51
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,479
you can share them, you can make them public, you can make them private,

52
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:30,889
whatever people seem to,

53
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:33,550
I think misunderstand this because what happened

54
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,360
apparently is there was some weird Facebook,

55
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:38,740
they say it's like a server configuration glitch and I'm like that whatever.

56
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,160
Basically, it wasn't serving the images,

57
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,994
but you could still see the alt text for those of you that don't know what Alex

58
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:45,684
is.

59
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:47,304
The people who did the original like

60
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:50,565
hypertext transfer protocol standards weren't completely stupid.

61
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:52,714
And so when you display an image,

62
00:02:53,035 --> 00:02:54,095
they were like, hey,

63
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:56,074
what if the image doesn't load or

64
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:58,115
what if the user is blind

65
00:02:58,414 --> 00:02:59,315
or can't see it

66
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,369
like text, web browsers, man.

67
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,380
-- Yeah,
-- or yeah, you're running E

68
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,139
links or links. I mean, because

69
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,929
Elin Man, that, that was actually fancier and came after links,

70
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,330
but you're running links or something

71
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,369
and you had what's like literally

72
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,320
alt text equals and then you could have like

73
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,110
a description like closed captioning of the image,

74
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:20,229
you know, like this is a picture of a sunset with a dog chasing a stick

75
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,009
or whatever.

76
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,940
And so of course, when people upload images to Facebook,

77
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,289
they're not putting in all text.

78
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:29,813
And sadly, most websites don't even do that anymore very well,

79
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:31,632
but Facebook does it for you.

80
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:35,513
Now, how do we generate alt text for?

81
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:39,113
You know, I'm, I'm gonna guess on the order of a couple million images an hour,

82
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:42,923
-- minute, probably an hour, maybe a minute,
-- uh probably not,

83
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,992
maybe less than an hour or more than an hour, but it's definitely not going to be by.

84
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:49,373
Yeah, it could be by the minute. It's a lot though. Right.

85
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:52,893
Well, it's gonna be more than even a couple 100,000 humans

86
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:54,085
classify and deal with.

87
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:55,255
I would. Right.

88
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:58,326
There are more images coming in faster than an army

89
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:00,645
of infinite monkeys could definitely do anything with that.

90
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:06,376
-- So how would you create all text for these images?
-- I would build an A I

91
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:10,975
that could analyze the images, uh extract user data,

92
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,856
triangulate that sell it to advertisers and then also add all text.

93
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,454
That's basically what I would do.

94
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:18,334
And that's basically what

95
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:19,495
Facebook did

96
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,429
because what else are they gonna do? Like literally

97
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,980
and people are freaking out about this?

98
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,059
And what's interesting

99
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,299
to me was the specific phrase from the article was

100
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,290
this is how Facebook's A I is judging you.

101
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,649
And what's interesting is at first I was a

102
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,980
little bit offended by that because I'm like,

103
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:38,100
well, only humans can judge but then I know whatever.

104
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:39,540
Anyway, semantically aside,

105
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,769
this is a very human perspective on

106
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,910
something a non a fundamentally nonhuman system is doing.

107
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,230
But at the same time that fundamentally nonhuman

108
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,850
system that a IML whatever system doing this

109
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,980
is programmed by people is built by people, right?

110
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:58,809
-- It didn't spring into being magically sort
-- of.

111
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,769
But also I would like to add if you build an A I uh make sure

112
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,690
it knows how to judge people because I think that would be a really cool feature.

113
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,609
Just I'll throw that out there.

114
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,059
That, that's a real thing. Remember? Because they found errors in the

115
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,220
thing. I thought we talked about it. Once

116
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,779
-- we talk about a lot of things,
-- there's,

117
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,160
-- there's the parole board ones and there's
-- anyways.

118
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,500
Oh, that's true. That's true. That's, that's fair.

119
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,609
So, we have built a, is to judge people. Yes, we have.

120
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:29,720
Absolutely. So, anyway, but, so here's the thing I keep thinking of is Alex

121
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,019
Stamos had a tweet where he's like, you know, this is great for people who have,

122
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,019
you know, need screen readers for example.

123
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,750
And

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,079
I don't disagree with him.

125
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,579
But the thing that I think that that is interesting

126
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:44,380
about this is I feel like normal people are starting

127
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:46,885
figure out everything Facebook can do

128
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:49,424
because I don't think they have a freaking clue

129
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,804
and it's starting to scare them to death.

130
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,364
And I would say more in general what technology can do.

131
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:56,265
A

132
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:58,114
perfect example of this is

133
00:05:58,214 --> 00:06:01,605
50 years ago. We had phone networks and fax.

134
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:05,975
-- Do we have fax 50 years ago? Yeah, we did.
-- Uh sure it would have been very new, but

135
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:06,095
I

136
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:06,375
pretty

137
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:08,605
sure but we did not have the computer

138
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:11,084
processing power or storage

139
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:13,005
to log and record all of it.

140
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,790
Right. Well,

141
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,790
yeah, that, that happened a decade or two. Something changed. Yeah.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,500
And, and I think, you know, my, because we've already been through this once.

143
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,529
Remember Google, I'm familiar with them and Google Mail.

144
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,910
And remember when Google Mail started inserting ads and people are like, oh my God,

145
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,309
they're reading your, the email.

146
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,670
And it's,

147
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,109
and see this is the problem is this is a very

148
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,750
subtle thing.

149
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,799
And from the outside we actually don't know exactly what's going on,

150
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:41,510
but we can make a reasonably educated guess that no

151
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,329
Google in the sense of like, people at Google are not reading your email.

152
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:45,690
Like, I,

153
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,670
I'm a system a man and I could read people's emails and I'll tell you the truth.

154
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,950
I don't, it's

155
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:50,440
like

156
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,119
I would, I, it's boring. And also I don't have time for this.

157
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,640
I have enough of my own email to read.

158
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,959
And if I did have time for this, I'd go watch Netflix, I wouldn't read your email.

159
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,510
-- That's true.
-- You know, like I have way better things to do with my life.

160
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,510
That's sort of the first thing is it's not humans at Google, reading your email.

161
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,100
It's an automated system.

162
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:12,079
And the thing too is, is the automated system, reading your email and then

163
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,950
say, drawing some characterization or judgment on you

164
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,920
and then feeding that into another system

165
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:23,690
that's been stored and used later in a way that negatively affects you or is it like,

166
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,649
simply put an advertising thing?

167
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,019
So it's kind of a closed loop and that it stays

168
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,489
within Google and it's only used for the specific purpose of,

169
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,250
you know, oh, my favorite thing right now. Twitter is displaying ads to me in French

170
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,720
constantly in French.

171
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,390
I'm like,

172
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:41,339
-- what did I do wrong? Canada
-- wasn't French one of your national languages.

173
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,619
We have two official languages, French and English.

174
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,920
And I mean, I had French in grade one through nine and uh Jean

175
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:49,179
palais

176
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,470
de

177
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:49,750
Fran,

178
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,040
Parle

179
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:50,739
Anglais

180
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:51,179
SIV

181
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:51,570
play,

182
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,100
that's basically my French.

183
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,540
-- Uh What was that? I do not speak French.
-- I do not speak French.

184
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:59,079
-- Do you, can you speak English, please?
-- Got you.

185
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,179
-- Uh
-- And uh what is it?

186
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:01,739
Jacques

187
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:02,149
Ave a

188
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,350
cinema I

189
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,190
think is the correct form.

190
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,260
Uh And that's it. That's all I got. I have no idea what that was.

191
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,760
Uh Jack went to no crap. Is it goes to the cinema or he went to?

192
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:12,649
That's

193
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,380
damn it, it's gone.

194
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,799
I'm down. OK.

195
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:17,579
Well, the good news is I'm still my,

196
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:20,320
I do have the one French phrase I can ask you if you speak English or German.

197
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,019
My German is better than my French. Fair enough. But um

198
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,489
anyway, so, I mean, the,

199
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,779
you know, a great example of this is, well, Google and Amazon both

200
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:32,594
extensive

201
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,984
data processing, mining extraction,

202
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:38,835
whatever you want to call it on your behavior on your, on their sites.

203
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:42,265
But then they tend to keep it in house, right? Like, so Amazon,

204
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:45,065
you know, Amazon is getting kind of freaky at like,

205
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:48,234
hey, do you want to buy one of these? And I'm like, I kind of, do

206
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:49,174
you know,

207
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:50,765
you know, you want it.

208
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:51,505
Yeah.

209
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:52,830
And

210
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,500
fundamentally, I think,

211
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:58,289
you know, as a human, I'm a little bit more OK with that than, for example,

212
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:01,070
if Amazon were to data mine all that and just sell it to whoever

213
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:04,130
some other third party company and then it escapes into the wild.

214
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,679
And the problem here is that

215
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,760
though, as a consumer, I have no idea what's going on. Right. There's,

216
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,400
you know,

217
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:11,450
and I think part of it is we're sort of used

218
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,909
to this idea of sort of passive versus active hosting.

219
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,809
You know, like you remember back in the day, like if you uploaded a picture to the web,

220
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:22,340
it was very passively hosted in that, here's a blob of data

221
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,460
and it's up to another human

222
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:25,820
to find it,

223
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,520
look at it and interpret it.

224
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,119
Like the computers

225
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,020
just were like,

226
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,489
I think it's a JB,

227
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,570
I'm not even sure,

228
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,010
but it

229
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:33,599
j

230
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:38,659
the thing is most normal people think that's still how it works.

231
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,380
They don't

232
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,520
know what's going on.

233
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:41,979
Well,

234
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:43,409
it kind of crept up on us and it's one

235
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:44,909
of those things where it happens behind the scenes,

236
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,340
like

237
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:46,820
for all we know

238
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,190
these companies have really good A I

239
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,820
that are doing really good targeted advertising or

240
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:53,414
Twitter. They have some

241
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:56,094
A I that's not doing fantastically good.

242
00:09:56,104 --> 00:10:01,015
Twitter has its own set of problems we'll say. But no, Google and Facebook have

243
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:03,135
crazy A is man.

244
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:04,974
And the funny thing is, I don't, can I,

245
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:10,325
-- is there somebody I can complain to that can fix it or, or
-- that cares

246
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:13,215
well, exactly. Or is there something I can do to be like,

247
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,580
because I actually got an ad and it's, um, uh, it's, um, uh, what's,

248
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,849
I can't remember the actor's name.

249
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:22,809
He's the son from, uh, Kim's Convenience. It's a really good CBC show.

250
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,479
Uh, very, very Canadian show.

251
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,059
It's, uh,

252
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,690
Kim's Convenience. It's a convenience store run by Koreans in uh Toronto.

253
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,049
And it's very funny and very good, highly recommend

254
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:33,140
anyways.

255
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,080
And, uh it was an ad with him in it, but honestly,

256
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,760
it was something that was totally more appropriate for my partner than me

257
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,700
in that. It was, I think it was like an old spice style commercial, right?

258
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,719
So, she loved it.

259
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:47,270
I was like, ah, whatever, it looks cute and clever, but I can't read this thing.

260
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,859
And my partner is fluent in French

261
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:52,359
and she really enjoyed the ad. I however, had no idea what it said.

262
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,239
But yeah, so, like a part of it I think is that

263
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,500
in the past when a company had some data about me, in theory,

264
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,732
I could get them to correct it or at least tell me what they had.

265
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:01,982
Like a great example is what is it called?

266
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:04,052
The Fair Credit Reporting Act in the United States

267
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:08,043
where you can at least challenge the stuff on your credit report and be like,

268
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:09,372
no, I don't

269
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,333
owe this random company 20 bajillion dollars for

270
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:16,893
some random thing that happened when I was three years old or whatever. Right.

271
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:17,663
But with this,

272
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:21,013
I don't even know if there's recourse and, and when I say that I don't even mean, like,

273
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:23,043
from a business or procedural point of view, I mean,

274
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:26,822
even from a technical point of view, I don't think Twitter has some knob in there,

275
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:28,166
they can, like, you know,

276
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:32,346
-- dial to be like stop showing Kirk French ads
-- and it's probably magic.

277
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:37,135
My guess is you somehow ended up looking at some French things and they decided,

278
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:37,945
you know, French.

279
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:40,166
And so now Twitter thinks, you know, French

280
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:42,406
and I know when you,

281
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,406
when you sign up for these advertising platforms,

282
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,486
you can pick things like only show this hand to people who know French and,

283
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,606
and their first name is Kurt and they live in

284
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:53,046
a house and you happen to be those things now.

285
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:53,395
So

286
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:53,955
its,

287
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,799
yeah, that's like, you know, you know what this reminds me of always is what was it?

288
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:01,440
We were, we were talking about something the other day and you told me

289
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,719
you made a comment about something I will say on the dicey side of things

290
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:08,489
and, and I didn't know what you're talking about and I was like,

291
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,159
I'm not going to search for this because I like, you know, Google is going to think I'm

292
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:12,320
a,

293
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,510
remember

294
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,799
-- what you're talking about
-- now,

295
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,280
that's what I feel like that's like with youtube,

296
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:21,619
I remember one time somebody sent me a link and I clicked it and it was like some gun,

297
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,260
a gun, I forget it was some gun channel showing something off.

298
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,210
I don't even remember what it was now.

299
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:32,809
And like youtube decided I liked guns and I had nothing but guns in my feed for months.

300
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,179
It's like, I like,

301
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,950
I don't really care if you stop showing me gun stuff.

302
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,619
I accidentally clicked.

303
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,880
Uh, I used to watch some of those, um, oh, this week in World War One

304
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:42,950
fun

305
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,890
and, and it's pretty cool but it's over,

306
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:47,010
stop it.

307
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,840
I know exactly how that goes.

308
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:49,000
Like,

309
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,380
just because I watched two videos doesn't mean I

310
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,460
want to see only these videos forever now.

311
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,419
But, I mean, that's the thing, right?

312
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:59,380
Is these A I algorithms are,

313
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,020
goodness knows what they're even doing and normal people have no idea.

314
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,260
And, and to tie this back to your comment about the credit reporting,

315
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,570
I think the difference is, that's a, that's a subject people understand

316
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:13,546
and care about because credit reporting can be understood. A is

317
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:15,616
they really aren't understood.

318
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,935
My, my current understanding and, and of course,

319
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:19,495
we can't prove this one way or the other.

320
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:21,676
But my current understanding is that these a,

321
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:24,556
is organizations like Google and Facebook and whoever

322
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:26,986
have no one even knows how they work

323
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:30,935
at this point because they've been kind of just off on their own for so long

324
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:31,885
and it's,

325
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:34,521
-- it's magic. I mean, for
-- real as an example,

326
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:36,481
could Twitter tell me

327
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:41,911
what data did they base this on? Is it my profile data? Is it data from a third party?

328
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,411
Is it,

329
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,492
did I exchange tweets with somebody who's fluent in French?

330
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:48,992
And so they decided even though I never

331
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,411
wrote in French

332
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:54,171
that somehow I speak French or can read French and which I can't

333
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,440
apart from some very basic words,

334
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,409
you know, that's, I

335
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,989
think that's where people are,

336
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,090
are gonna get especially angry and frustrated because

337
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,080
not only do they feel judged? Why was I judged?

338
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:08,330
And especially if they feel the judgment doesn't

339
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,179
match or shouldn't apply to them.

340
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,674
Like I, I'm, I'm more amused than annoyed that it's showing me these ads in French

341
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,635
because the funny thing is now, I know

342
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:20,924
I, my mental brain filter for ad blocking on Twitter is very simple.

343
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:24,554
-- If it's in French, I don't read it because it's an app because
-- I can't.

344
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,155
Yeah, exactly.

345
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:29,075
You know, I wish Google Mail had a filter for that. Whereas, like

346
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:34,294
I, I wish I could whitelist languages in the sense of if this email is not in English,

347
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:36,515
don't display it to me because

348
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:37,674
I don't speak

349
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:42,000
Korean or Mandarin or basically I don't speak any

350
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,599
language other than bad English and even worse German

351
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,729
-- Swabian.
-- Right. Right.

352
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,039
It's,

353
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:51,809
yeah, I don't know, I don't know what the answer is to any of this stuff,

354
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,539
there's no incentive for them to really,

355
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,969
-- I think, provide this because,
-- well, not yet.

356
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:01,460
-- I mean, so here's the thing and this is
-- until there's some legal or regulatory thing.

357
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:06,169
-- Right?
-- Maybe. And, and this is where I put my security hat on always. And I think about

358
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,039
no one really cares about security because why should they,

359
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,799
but I feel like this stuff

360
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:16,760
they might care about because people freak out

361
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,280
when something is out of their control,

362
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,190
granted everything is out of their control.

363
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:26,440
But this feels especially outside of your sphere of influence. And I think

364
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:30,739
this is one of those things that people might start asking questions about.

365
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,419
Well, like the sur

366
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:35,062
bubble stuff people are finding finally beginning to notice search bubbles

367
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:37,403
or the fact that like,

368
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:38,403
you know, when a

369
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:41,033
lot of those, what was it, those congressional hearings where those

370
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:43,403
politicians were extremely angry about,

371
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:46,213
like you type my name into Google and it says bad things about me.

372
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:47,013
And it's like,

373
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:48,273
well, yeah,

374
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:50,963
because a lot of people are saying bad things about you and that

375
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:54,453
seems to be the prevailing sentiment and that's what our A I measures and

376
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:55,882
right. Well,

377
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,125
and let's face it,

378
00:15:57,135 --> 00:16:00,695
that's how you get change is you just need to make sure that the politicians

379
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,835
are affected by whatever terrible thing is happening

380
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:04,346
and now they care for some reason.

381
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:04,666
Right?

382
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:09,145
-- But if it's, if it's not them, whatever, it
-- doesn't matter well, or their family.

383
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:13,426
Yeah. Attack a politician's kids and find out how quickly they make that illegal.

384
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:14,065
Right.

385
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:20,786
I feel like we are bubbling up into something where people are noticing things

386
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:24,505
the way they are as opposed to the way they used to be.

387
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,570
And this always amuses me from the security perspective because it's like

388
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,770
we've been telling you this for ages and they're like, yeah,

389
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,520
but you're crazy and we don't like you.

390
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,570
It's like, well, that's fair. So you're finally figuring it out on your own.

391
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:38,679
I think a large part of it is security people.

392
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,929
We, we are often very good at telling people we should be concerned about X. Right.

393
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:44,760
Ok.

394
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,030
-- Why should I be concerned about
-- X

395
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:51,465
one could break into your house in the middle of night and smear peanut

396
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:53,905
butter on your door and then you could touch it in the morning and,

397
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:54,974
and it could happen.

398
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:56,424
It's like, yeah, get, get out

399
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:59,864
-- like,
-- yeah, exactly. So we're not really good at articulating.

400
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:00,395
Yeah,

401
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:03,465
these problems and their negative consequences and in fairness quite

402
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:06,625
often we don't really know the negative consequences that well,

403
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:08,954
because there usually aren't any negative consequence.

404
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:10,824
Well, exactly, like I would say,

405
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,505
yeah. Oh, it's a weird world

406
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,900
which, uh, and I think it feeds nicely into this other, uh, topic of, you know,

407
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,989
somebody figured out.

408
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,618
Oh, my goodness.

409
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,469
It looks like of the top 97 VPN providers.

410
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,889
They're run by 23 parent companies, which I always kind of assumed that they

411
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:35,129
rebranded because, you know, like price points, enterprise versus personal or

412
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:37,609
whatever. And it looks like a,

413
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,999
well, here's my favorite, the study shows that the top 97 VPN S are run by,

414
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,149
uh, just 23 parent companies.

415
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:47,724
Many of them, you're based in countries with lax privacy laws. Yeah.

416
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:48,364
I'm shocked

417
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:48,714
how

418
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:49,834
is that gonna work?

419
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,954
Like, where's that? You remember that spreadsheet?

420
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,555
That guy did and then I think it's, well,

421
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:56,875
it's an entire website now where it shows all the different VPN providers and like,

422
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:57,665
do they store data?

423
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:59,844
Do they keep data? Which jurisdiction are they in which?

424
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:01,895
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like, what is it? I forget the name of it.

425
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:04,375
We'll put it in the show notes because it's been in the show notes before.

426
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:05,515
Um

427
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:06,739
Anyways,

428
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,439
uh researchers at VPN Pro have pieced

429
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:10,839
together ownership information through company listings,

430
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:13,189
geolocation data, the CV S of employees and other documentation,

431
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:15,119
which I gotta say that is some awesome

432
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,319
detective sleuthing

433
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:18,219
work.

434
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,310
That's, that's exact. Like this is what annoys me.

435
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,000
This is what journalism is supposed to be doing, investigative journalism, right?

436
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,819
It's not just

437
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:26,650
clever

438
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,229
things.

439
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,040
And uh in some instance,

440
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,420
ownership of different VPN is split among a number of different subsidiaries.

441
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,579
So no big surprise there.

442
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,959
But anyways, the point is a whole pile of these VPN providers

443
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,239
or something like a third of them apparently are owned by Chinese firms.

444
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,300
I'm shocked,

445
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,810
I'm

446
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,359
only a third. Right.

447
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:52,020
And it's funny to me because China has a, like in the last I would say 5, 10 years,

448
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,390
really strong history of kind of running some of the more,

449
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,849
I don't want to say dodgy bits but some of the more messy

450
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:03,619
bits of internet infrastructure like Bitcoin mining

451
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,760
like that is a heavily

452
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,560
Chinese thing,

453
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:08,530
right?

454
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,250
Like of all the miners, my understanding is a big major, you know,

455
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,160
double digits proportion are in China.

456
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,489
That seems to be the case. Yes,

457
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,880
there's a whole bunch of this. But

458
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,890
so,

459
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,910
and I was thinking about this and, and my first thought was like as well,

460
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,609
especially for an intelligence agency.

461
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:27,530
I mean, the greatest example I can think of is, you know,

462
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,979
-- who here remembers to R and still uses it, remembers
-- it's still there, man.

463
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:32,400
It's Tor

464
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,449
-- is fantastic.
-- Yeah, exactly.

465
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:36,910
Well, do you, where did to R come from?

466
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:37,560
Uh

467
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,349
It was, it was,

468
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,209
it was some sort of university project, wasn't it?

469
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,010
Am I remembering correctly?

470
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,670
-- What was it
-- not? So uh hang on a sec. Uh

471
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,489
it was,

472
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,140
-- wasn't it the US Navy?
-- Was it? I don't know, I thought, I don't know the history

473
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,310
of

474
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,160
-- that.
-- Well,

475
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:56,760
DDDD.

476
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,339
Yeah, here we go. The core principle of

477
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,849
Tor onion routing was developed in the mid 19 nineties.

478
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:02,880
So that's pretty impressive.

479
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,199
Actually,

480
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,609
it's a while by the United

481
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,800
States naval research Laboratory employees mathematicians,

482
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,670
Paul Syverson and computer scientist Michael G Reed and David Gold Schlag

483
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,119
with the purpose of protecting us intelligence communications online

484
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:18,329
onion routing was further developed by DARPA in 1997 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

485
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,530
So the point is the US Navy came out with Tor

486
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,109
so that they could have secure communications online and

487
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,020
also

488
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:27,599
a way to gather and tell because I,

489
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:32,010
I remember working for an intelligence company that had a T one that they,

490
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:35,619
they didn't quite pay for it in cash, but basically they paid for it in cash

491
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,069
and it came into the office and had like no information about us associated with it

492
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,260
so that our virus guys could go browse the web and honestly.

493
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:45,729
Right, exactly.

494
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:46,060
You know,

495
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,989
without getting us nailed

496
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,369
the US Navy started this.

497
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,410
But the thing is, you know, if we know all the Tor nodes are being run by the US Navy.

498
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,209
Well, I, I don't think that's the case.

499
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:58,489
I mean, it sounds like the Navy created the concept of onion routing,

500
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,069
right?

501
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:00,280
They, they came up with Tor

502
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,250
and then they,

503
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,050
one of the big

504
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,270
reasons they made it open source in public is because they realized

505
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,310
it only is really valuable

506
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,849
if a whole bunch of people are doing this because,

507
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,420
and this is one of my favorite conversations.

508
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,900
Uh the are the really good intel guy had with me was he taught me about the difference

509
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,180
between hiding and masking and they are so very

510
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,540
different and I did not realize this or understanding.

511
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,719
-- Well,
-- then why don't you tell us what the difference is

512
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,420
hiding is actually hiding? So

513
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,880
you're doing something

514
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,209
uh say illegal for the sake of argument and you literally hide like you,

515
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:32,469
you need to stay out of sight.

516
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,010
You, you know, do it surreptitiously.

517
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,650
You, you travel around at night, you know, so nobody sees you doing it.

518
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,530
Masking is for example, if you live in a surveillance state where you cannot hide,

519
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,619
you can mask things.

520
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,130
You know, you, for example,

521
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,010
you go and buy a palm tree and then you go and buy nitrogen fertilizer

522
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,089
and then you go and buy

523
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,569
like an off road vehicle so that you have an excuse to go buy diesel.

524
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:56,099
And now you can,

525
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:57,459
you know, understand

526
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,319
a diesel fuel, nitrous, whatever bomb thing.

527
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,160
Sure versus hiding where you know,

528
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,839
you go and try and pay for it with cash from a guy who won't ask you many questions.

529
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,599
And so part of Tor

530
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,239
is Tor

531
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,939
doesn't work unless you can be part of a big thundering herd

532
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,420
of sort of quasi

533
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:15,609
anonymous stuff.

534
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,900
Right? Well, and, and part of the trick with Tor

535
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,979
also is it relies on one organization not controlling too much of it

536
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,250
because

537
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,709
-- it things
-- get otherwise

538
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,819
-- they can see
-- enough. You, you can, right?

539
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:30,890
Even though you may not be able to necessarily see the data itself,

540
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,930
you can start doing statistical

541
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,650
analysis on metadata. Exactly. And you can figure certain things out.

542
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,930
Well, I mean, that's how they got, remember the Silk Road guy,

543
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,020
they managed to localize his time zone

544
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,569
based on his activity

545
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,819
and then based on that they were able to monitor some, you know,

546
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:50,260
stuff and, and kind of work their way closer to him until they actually found him.

547
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,709
Well, he, he ended up getting caught because didn't he love

548
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,469
without Tor

549
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,520
one day? Right.

550
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,390
Uh, well, that was kind of, yeah, that was kind of the,

551
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,250
-- the break in the case as it was
-- now.

552
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,489
You know what, you know what I think about a lot actually.

553
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,119
So when they, when they caught him and they said, oh,

554
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,739
you logged in without Tor and we found you and I wonder if

555
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,060
they knew where he was because they had somehow figured it out using

556
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:11,775
-- parallel
-- discovery.

557
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:13,875
And it's like we know who this guy is now.

558
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:16,944
We just need to wait for him to make a mistake and then we can go get him,

559
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:19,895
which would not shock me in any way, you know.

560
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:20,954
But, uh, well, that's the thing,

561
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:25,285
that's one of the biggest problems with operational security is, uh, you

562
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:29,334
defenders only have to make a mistake once for an attacker to take advantage.

563
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:30,494
And

564
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:35,234
when, you know, let's, you know, if, if the local police is looking for you, yeah,

565
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:37,055
you, you may be able to get away with it.

566
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:38,214
But when the FBI

567
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:42,569
and the secret service and a bunch of other agencies are looking for you.

568
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,459
Well, they're gonna,

569
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,579
you know, I'm reminded of these investigations where it's like, ok, well,

570
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:48,500
all we need to do

571
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,540
is go talk to everybody with a red car

572
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:53,650
in the city

573
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,890
and, like, then they'll go do that totally doable.

574
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,290
It reminds me, like, uh,

575
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,010
totally tangent but the city court building in New York that

576
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,050
was going to collapse because they didn't weld the plates,

577
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,300
right?

578
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,810
Remember that whole debacle.

579
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,349
So they had to basically do an inventory of everybody that lived

580
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,959
in the shadow of the building if it were to fall down.

581
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:12,040
And so they did this like pseudo red cross survey thing where they basically,

582
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,810
like went out for a couple of months and like,

583
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,229
basically logged everybody that lives in the area

584
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,969
where they are what the building is like.

585
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:20,170
Right? I mean, that, that's a huge amount of effort,

586
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,369
right? Had to be done, right?

587
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,449
And that's the thing with law enforcement and stuff.

588
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:26,209
If you make them angry enough, they're going to get their scalp.

589
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,329
-- Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.
-- But I was thinking about this. So, you know,

590
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,829
I would, I would be almost more shocked and, and almost horrified to learn that,

591
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,949
for example, my country's intelligence services aren't running a bunch of tor

592
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,469
nodes because for one thing, they probably need to be using Tor

593
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,109
nodes

594
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,520
because it's, you know, for, for example, for, even if you're doing, like,

595
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,339
open source intelligence where you're just like finding public sources,

596
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:51,109
putting stuff together, you know, whatever

597
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,250
you still probably want to do that without exposing your IP address at

598
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,119
the government agency you work for.

599
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,510
Right. Right. Exactly.

600
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,880
So you're probably going to use a VPN or to R, right.

601
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,890
And let's face it.

602
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:06,680
Tor kind of slow VPN S kind of fast for, you know, five bucks a month

603
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,319
in some cases you get what you pay for.

604
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:11,150
So here's the thing, if you're going to use VPN S or Tor,

605
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,089
well,

606
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,300
how do you know that you're using it

607
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,959
correctly and safely unless you really understand it

608
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:16,729
because it's

609
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,329
hard

610
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:17,739
to do,

611
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:18,040
right?

612
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,060
And so I would argue that

613
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,640
in order to use it correctly,

614
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,229
you need to probably have run it or actively be running it to really understand like

615
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,010
the difference is between, say, you know, a VPN provider that does, um,

616
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,479
DNS masking versus one that doesn't, right.

617
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:33,839
That's,

618
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:36,270
you know what I'm talking about. I mean, a lot of people don't.

619
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,979
So if you're using a VPN? Great.

620
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:40,900
But what if your client doesn't use the VPN to make DNS lookups?

621
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:44,770
-- Well, boom, you're exposed.
-- Yeah. And that, that gets a lot of people.

622
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:46,410
This is why

623
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:51,839
actually, so I, I have a machine that I will use for a VPN for various reasons. And

624
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:58,260
I specifically set up IP filtering rules to just block literally all traffic

625
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,270
that doesn't

626
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,130
go to the VPN everything else 100% blocked.

627
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,140
And even then I'm like,

628
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,869
I probably made a mistake in these rules and it would not

629
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,099
shock me if there's things leaking out that I don't know about.

630
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,219
Exactly.

631
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:15,180
So, I, I think from an operational perspective, like I said,

632
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:18,699
I think these organizations and I don't mean just intelligence services but,

633
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:19,079
you know,

634
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:22,800
companies, right. I mean, as a company you probably

635
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,339
have people using VPN S. Do you kind of,

636
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:28,064
how do you intelligently shop for one? Do you know what to look for?

637
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:29,244
Well, I think part of it is

638
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:31,224
you can't have that expertise without

639
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:33,864
the operational experience of actually doing it

640
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,385
uh to a degree. I mean, honestly just quit using VPN S like that,

641
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:38,824
that's the answer.

642
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:40,704
Trust networking man.

643
00:26:41,354 --> 00:26:43,765
Well, I mean, but sometimes you want to mask

644
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:44,714
who you are.

645
00:26:44,724 --> 00:26:48,045
Like, uh remember Wikipedia, how if you're logged into Wikipedia,

646
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:49,464
it shows who edited the page

647
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:51,665
and if you're not logged in, you're being anonymous,

648
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:53,584
it shows the IP that edited the page.

649
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,770
And do you remember the whole, oh, the US congressional office, I think had to be

650
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,030
BERS still ban.

651
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:00,229
I don't know if they still are,

652
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:05,170
but they were right because the staffers kept updating Wikipedia entries of their,

653
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:05,449
the,

654
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,890
the people they work for, which is, which is awesome.

655
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,020
Yeah. And all they had to do was either VPN or log in and

656
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:16,500
those darn kids would have gotten away with it if it weren't for old man Johnson.

657
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:19,819
Yeah. But I, I bet most of them don't.

658
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:20,560
Right.

659
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,150
I mean,

660
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:23,939
because there's two sides to this is, first of all,

661
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:25,780
there's how much do you care and you have to care a

662
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,310
lot to actually turn on the VPN and then edit a Wikipedia page

663
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,359
and how many are competent enough to do it?

664
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:36,560
I mean, look, I'm not going to bash our, our leaders to band here, but

665
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:40,520
when it comes to technology, they're not the brightest bulbs in the pack here,

666
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,079
right?

667
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,780
And so it would not shock me at all if a nontrivial

668
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,040
number of their staffers don't even know what a VPN is.

669
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:49,170
Yeah, I would agree.

670
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,800
But so yeah, anyways, this goes back to the whole masking thing of, you know,

671
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,270
the VPN S are great for masking, hiding in a thundering herd of,

672
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,369
you know, there's, uh here's an exit note on a VPN provider with, you know,

673
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,670
say 5000 or 10,000 people coming through it.

674
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,979
Well, now it becomes much harder to correlate traffic metadata,

675
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:07,989
that kind of thing and more to the point these things make money.

676
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,020
-- Um
-- probably you figure you probably use a nickels worth

677
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:15,125
traffic for $5 a month because network traffic is free.

678
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:18,625
I mean, I, I, the last time I looked at,

679
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:21,354
you know, physical server when you

680
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:26,255
rack hosting with a Gigabit Ethernet, you know, 95% usage

681
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:28,869
if you really are

682
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,319
willing to go cheap and a bit, probably not super reliable, like,

683
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,239
-- like one or 200 bucks a month.
-- Yeah, probably.

684
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,949
But you still need staff to set it up and I bet the support is the real trick.

685
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:41,520
Right.

686
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,109
But, so anyway, anyway, we're, we're, we're nearing the end.

687
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,540
So, in summary, why don't you bring us home?

688
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,199
Well, I, I, why is anybody shocked by this?

689
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:54,260
This is and, and I don't mean just the VPN thing, I mean by the,

690
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,640
the Facebook A I photo thing.

691
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:59,609
And again, we've been, you know, if you give a company, your data,

692
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:00,819
chances are

693
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,810
they're going to hold on to it because it has value

694
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:06,819
now and it will have more value later when they can,

695
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,900
for example, interpret it and correlate it

696
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,969
and figure out that for example, you post family photos on Facebook. Cool.

697
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,435
Facebook currently identifies who's in the photo.

698
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:16,834
That's nice, right?

699
00:29:17,074 --> 00:29:18,954
But at some point it's going to notice in your back

700
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:22,625
of the photo that like you have a barbecue or you have

701
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:23,094
a

702
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:25,675
swing set or a dog.

703
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:29,724
-- Oh, I'd be shocked if they don't do that already. And
-- for advertising that would be,

704
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:31,425
you know, because barbecues don't last very long.

705
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,209
I finally learned why.

706
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,380
But um

707
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:35,969
because stainless steel doesn't

708
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,060
resist rust at high temperature,

709
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,780
I'm like he's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

710
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,079
That's true of most metals,

711
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:44,510
most metals struggle with high temperatures because they

712
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,699
start organizing and doing other scary things.

713
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:48,819
-- So,
-- Titanium barbecues, that's the answer.

714
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,739
Yes. That's right.

715
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,180
So, you know, and the thing is,

716
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,859
well, GDPR right, to forget aside,

717
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,719
generally speaking, these companies are gonna

718
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,099
aggregate

719
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,550
and store and mine and extract as much value as they can from that data because

720
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,849
their companies, that's

721
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:07,729
what they do.

722
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:09,469
Like, I, I don't know what else to say.

723
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:12,869
So, here's, here's what I would, I will, I will end on

724
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,829
people learn these things and they become

725
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,520
surprised and sometimes offended

726
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:23,239
-- or shocked or whatever.
-- I think offended is a really good word here.

727
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:23,939
It might be.

728
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,439
And we, we know this,

729
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,599
probably most people listening to this show are not surprised in any

730
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:31,140
way by any of the things we talk about right now.

731
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:34,550
I, I'm always reminded that normal people

732
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,079
are in a different place than people who do security

733
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:41,364
do you work are for example, and I'll just pick on security.

734
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,744
This is true of tech in general, but we'll specifically call it

735
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:44,295
plumbing

736
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:45,744
car mechanics.

737
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:46,935
-- Well,
-- and that's just it. Right.

738
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:48,714
Everyone has their own little circle of

739
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,204
knowledge and expertise and things like what,

740
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:56,625
how Facebook's a I might work is not in the realm of anyone's knowledge.

741
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:58,474
I still don't understand why.

742
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:01,944
If you overfill a car with too much oil that breaks the car. That makes no sense to me.

743
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,380
Are you serious?

744
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:05,880
-- I, why
-- it gets in the pistons?

745
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,229
Like then you have compression problems and you blow your head gasket.

746
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:14,680
Why can't they have like an overflow level thing? Like just poke a hole in the oil pan.

747
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:17,420
-- So if it gets too full, it's
-- a sealed system though. And

748
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:21,170
it's, the oil is self contained, it needs to be sealed and under pressure.

749
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,739
And so you can't have like an, I'm,

750
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,770
I'm sure they could add some sort of like magic release,

751
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:27,680
but it would probably add a

752
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:29,380
bunch of cost and then,

753
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:30,979
and then the problem fail,

754
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,599
not just fail.

755
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:36,459
Uh It, it's going to leak oil all over the freaking place when it does fail.

756
00:31:36,469 --> 00:31:38,510
And now you have a hazmat situation, right?

757
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:40,189
OK. Today I learned,

758
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,089
there you go.

759
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,229
And

760
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:44,619
-- I'm sure I got some of that wrong and someone will tell
-- me,

761
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,140
don't let Kurt borrow your car.

762
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,839
That is true. I have some funny stories about changing oil.

763
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,250
I could tell someday but not today.

764
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:54,140
So anyway, the point is people start to learn this stuff and

765
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,630
it changes the worldview to a degree.

766
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,420
And so I feel like we are at a point with

767
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,829
technology where there's too few people understand what's going on.

768
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,479
And I know you can say, oh especially

769
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:06,714
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

770
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,655
But, but I mean, for real,

771
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:09,915
like there's a certain base level like you need to

772
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:11,594
know how to work a light switch in your house,

773
00:32:11,604 --> 00:32:11,875
right?

774
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:12,295
Like you,

775
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,474
you have to understand electricity comes from a power plant travels over wires,

776
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:17,194
it goes to the light, it makes the light work.

777
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:19,655
And that's a great example because you know, hey Alexa,

778
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:22,474
turn the lights on and it happens. But

779
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:28,234
magic, I have a even I only have a cursory understanding of what's all is going on.

780
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:29,454
-- It's
-- magic all magic

781
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,459
but ignoring how Alexa

782
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:34,650
works, just understanding that when you give Facebook data,

783
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:37,310
they're not saying, oh wow. Thanks for the data.

784
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,609
You know, we'll take good care of this.

785
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:43,410
They're like, they're like this, this ravenous monster consuming your data and,

786
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,050
and like advertiser information comes out the other end of it.

787
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,250
Like they're not doing this to be nice to you.

788
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:49,900
Right.

789
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,119
And I,

790
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,489
I think there's a lot of people who don't get that yet and I think it's going

791
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,920
to be really hard to see meaningful change until we have a certain amount of people.

792
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,170
Right.

793
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,339
You,

794
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:01,339
you hit that tipping point eventually where people figure

795
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:03,660
it out and they become outraged and then,

796
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,530
then we can maybe see some change.

797
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,790
-- But I think we've got a long way to go still.
-- I think a big part of it too is, is

798
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,780
being able to explain this in terms

799
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,300
that average people can understand.

800
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,920
And I don't mean, you know, in the sense of, oh, they're dumb technically,

801
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,859
but in the sense of

802
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,199
like, why do I want to care about this?

803
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,140
-- Right.
-- Exactly. Exactly.

804
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,420
And,

805
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,260
and our stories are terrible because we always

806
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,500
concoct these ridiculous plots that never come true.

807
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,790
And so most people just think security people are insane and annoying and, I mean,

808
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,900
they're right, but like we also kind of know what we're doing.

809
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,500
So,

810
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,099
-- both are true.
-- Right.

811
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:40,380
Yeah, I mean,

812
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,000
fundamentally we need story or we need explanations that are

813
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,119
as simple as if we don't fix the sewer,

814
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,319
you can't flush your toilet.

815
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:49,810
Uh, that is a good explanation. And that's a huge problem.

816
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:53,170
I have 100% buy in. Now.

817
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,089
-- That
-- work.

818
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,750
Exactly. Exactly. But at the same time, technology doesn't work like that.

819
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,109
Like when the, ok, the internet fails that, that's bad.

820
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,219
And then the kids like, go crazy, but

821
00:34:02,405 --> 00:34:03,635
when your toilet fails,

822
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:06,915
you have way bigger problems than compared to when the internet fails, right?

823
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:10,094
And that's just part of how it works. So, anyway, all right, I've gotten this off.

824
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:12,635
That's enough. So, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
