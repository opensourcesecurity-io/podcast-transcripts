0
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:01,230
I'm always right.

1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,200
Put that. Keep that in the show.

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,229
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

3
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:15,010
Episode 158 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,779
Josh Bresser.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,629
Oh, my goodness. I finally have faster internet than Kurt. I am ecstatic today.

6
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:22,729
Allegedly. A good day. That's true. Allegedly, we,

7
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,190
we will. So

8
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,979
for, for listeners,

9
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,829
we use a service called Zencastr to record these shows where basically we

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,970
both connect to a website and we do our business and at the end

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,529
we upload the wave files from our respective computers.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,250
And

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,840
when I hit stop,

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,229
Kurt's upload is done.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,360
But by the time my finger comes off the stop button, I think,

16
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:49,159
and then my upload takes more than one minute and it makes me sad.

17
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:51,840
And I just got gigabit internet installed

18
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:55,040
10 minutes before we started recording this.

19
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,779
The tech left my home. So in theory,

20
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:00,865
-- I have extremely fast internet right now.
-- Yeah. No,

21
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,104
we'll see. I'm excited.

22
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:03,145
I'm excited. Yeah.

23
00:01:03,154 --> 00:01:06,065
And, and I mean, it sounds like it was really easy to get that internet too.

24
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:06,264
I mean,

25
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,194
they just dropped the fiber in your backyard and bam it was installed right away.

26
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:09,625
Right.

27
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:11,864
-- Isn't that what happened?
-- I could write

28
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:17,815
an epic tale of everything that happened as part of this process and

29
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:23,425
it's everything from my existing or my, I guess my old internet company now they,

30
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,974
the people who work for them tried really hard to help me,

31
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:28,444
but it's clear

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,559
they did not know what to do when I would say

33
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:32,809
because it's so,

34
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,449
I'll just tell you the beginning of it is I called them up and I said, look,

35
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,879
a new company just dropped Gigabit fiber in my backyard.

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,290
What can you do for me?

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,040
And they just said, we can knock $20 off your bill.

38
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,319
And I said, I don't want $20 knocked off my bill. I want Gigabit internet

39
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,680
and they said, well, we can't do that. And I'm like,

40
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,379
that's it. Like,

41
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,129
that's the thing though, like hard. Like

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,860
this is what gets me is a quote unquote, simple problem. Like

43
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,050
getting you potable drinking water

44
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,650
is actually really hard and expensive.

45
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,449
You know,

46
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,970
I know a guy that lives out in the boonies and the city he's near wants to force all the,

47
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,250
all the sort of acreage donors onto the city water system

48
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,699
so that they can essentially,

49
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,320
it looks like they want to force the existing owners

50
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,330
onto the city water system and have them pay for it

51
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:22,770
so that the new land developers can get water a lot cheaper

52
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,929
because guess what the city is going to be charging him the,

53
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,639
the sort of the cheapest plan to hook him up to the water city supply.

54
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:32,460
-- I bet it's outrageous.
-- It's about 45 grand Canadian.

55
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:32,600
Yeah,

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,380
that's about what I would expect for that

57
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,899
because running all that is very expensive.

58
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,380
Well, 45 grand Canadian to put in perspective, like that's

59
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,759
the back of the envelope that buys him about 200 years of water trucks,

60
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,009
which is what he currently uses.

61
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,880
Like he literally just has a guy in a truck show up once a week and fill up his cistern.

62
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,919
He doesn't have a, well, they have a well,

63
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:52,070
but they don't drink that water or cope with that water.

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,919
Right. So, yeah, they have a well for like

65
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,660
whatever, washing the cars and stuff, you know, that kind of thing,

66
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:57,479
watering the garden.

67
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,169
But yeah, no, they have a system because, you know, it's really hard water.

68
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,279
It kind of, you know, it's not nice.

69
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,639
Yeah. Anyway, so, I mean, that's the thing, infrastructure.

70
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:04,970
I mean,

71
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,139
this is why I think cell phones took off so rapidly is

72
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,669
because you only got to run infrastructure to cell phone towers,

73
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,270
not to every darn house.

74
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,970
-- But
-- even in that respect, I mean, especially in the United States,

75
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,589
we don't have a lot of options for cellular service

76
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,250
and internet is generally even worse in most places.

77
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:21,759
And

78
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,210
I mean, I guess this is part of the story that,

79
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,729
that I think comes out of this is the fact that

80
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,270
my old internet company

81
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,149
was the only game in town if you

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,449
wanted anything faster than just potato speed Internet.

83
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,070
And the new company runs fiber optic all over the place. And the old company is like,

84
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,470
we don't know what to do. We, ok.

85
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:46,554
-- And they, they tried to offer me,
-- you know, I have a hard time feeling sorry for them.

86
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:50,375
I, I don't, I really don't, it's, I don't really care for either, but whatever,

87
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:51,125
it doesn't matter.

88
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:52,585
-- I have gigabit Internet.
-- Well, here's the thing.

89
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,755
What gets me these companies, uh, no offense.

90
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:57,914
Clearly the future of the internet is faster. Internet.

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,259
Yeah.

92
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:01,639
But a

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,589
lot of these companies don't seem to get it or care, you know,

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,580
like for the longest time when I talked to so, locally I have Sean, tell us.

95
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:08,779
Right.

96
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:13,110
They, Sean owns the cable, tell us, owns the phone stuff, you know,

97
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,270
I would have said copper but now it's a lot of fiber

98
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,500
and so, like Shaw for the longest time.

99
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,959
I was like, ok, you have, you know, you have pretty good coax

100
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:20,588
cable.

101
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:24,259
Most of it's relatively, like, less than 30 years old you put in two way op amps.

102
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,408
So it's, you know, you can get pretty decent speeds. But like,

103
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:29,109
yeah, what, what are we going to do for, you know, how,

104
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,898
how's that a whole I PV six thing?

105
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:34,218
And how's that whole, like, faster than 50 megabits thing coming along

106
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,789
and for the longest time they didn't really have a good answer.

107
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,709
So I was like, well, ok, you know. Yeah, the, uh, the other

108
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,790
evil company dropped fiber in my neighborhood, you know, and they'll sell me

109
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:47,750
faster internet for cheaper than your plans. So, exactly. What can you do for me?

110
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,380
And they're like, again.

111
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,950
Yeah, they're like, we can, I think it was take $5 off your bill.

112
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,690
Yeah, it's like, I don't care. I want faster internet.

113
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,429
-- Well,
-- no, but it's like I'm still paying more

114
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,989
-- for slower internet. So, like, right,
-- and even at one point

115
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,339
they offered me

116
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,450
double the cost of the new company for almost similar speeds.

117
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:07,700
And I was like,

118
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,040
I would probably take that deal just because I don't have to

119
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:14,299
go through the hassle of an install and all the other nonsense.

120
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:17,160
And then they like, ok, well, it's turned on

121
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,760
and I said, uh, don't, I need new gear and they're like, oh, no, your gear is fine.

122
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:25,399
And I'm like, this is pretty old gear. I don't think you can do those speeds.

123
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,000
And of course, they,

124
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,290
they transferred me to the tech support

125
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:28,679
department and tech support people are like,

126
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,519
we need, we need to send a tech out to your house.

127
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,839
It's going to cost you $200. And I said, no, I'm not paying you to like,

128
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,089
right, new company has reinstalled like, just no way. And,

129
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,929
and it was funny they were completely unable

130
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,549
and, and I don't blame the people. Right.

131
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,190
I think the people who were trying to help me were legitimately trying, but, like,

132
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,809
they were completely unable to do anything about this

133
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,869
and at the end of the day it's like,

134
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,829
well, screw it.

135
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:51,579
I wonder what it's like to work for a company like that to, I mean,

136
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,750
do these people realize that they're basically on,

137
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,209
they're on a clock now?

138
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,010
I'm certain they know it and I'm sure they have ridiculous requirements

139
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:01,709
where they have to get off the phone after so many minutes.

140
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,059
And that's the thing, like at the end it's

141
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:06,260
says, oh, can you, will you take a survey about the person you spoke with? Right.

142
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,000
And even though they didn't help me, I gave them all like tens because it's,

143
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,799
I knew that if I rate them low, they're going to get freaking fired.

144
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,399
And that's ridiculous too because it's not,

145
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,670
it's not their fault that your company is a flaming pile of garbage.

146
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:19,019
They're doing their best. So anyway,

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,010
but then the story gets even better

148
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:27,540
because new company wants a credit check. Right. My credit is frozen

149
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:32,109
and I haven't unfrozen my credit in over five years. And actually

150
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,029
the, since then

151
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,399
the US government passed a law that says

152
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,850
credit freezing and unfreezing has to be free.

153
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:43,679
It used to cost me $10 per agency per action I took,

154
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,489
and I saw that as an advantage because no

155
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,459
fraudsters gonna pay $10 to unlock my credit.

156
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,760
Right. If they have it. So, anyway,

157
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,470
I go to unlock it. One of them, I couldn't even get it unlocked.

158
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,179
I have to actually mail them a bunch of paperwork now to try to sort all this out.

159
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,429
So I couldn't even get it unlocked with one of them. A second one.

160
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,390
they gave me like a pin. I'm supposed to have to use to unlock it.

161
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,149
Yeah, I totally didn't need that. I ended up.

162
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,869
Uh, so they're like, oh, you have to sign up for a website.

163
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,320
I sign up, I click. Ok. And it says

164
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,079
we can't, you know, we can't create your account.

165
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,549
Please call this phone number, something's wrong.

166
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,390
And I'm like, oh, this is exciting.

167
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,190
So I called them up and I'm on the phone for a long time, we'll say.

168
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,470
And finally I get a human,

169
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,309
which is nice because for company one, I can't, I can't even find a human to talk to,

170
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,690
to be like, what is going on?

171
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,290
What's up? Right.

172
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:31,630
So, I, I don't know, I don't know if there's like fraud in my account.

173
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,130
I have absolutely no idea what's happening there and I cannot get a human to talk to,

174
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,619
which sucks.

175
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,109
So, anyway, other company

176
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,070
I,

177
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,790
I call them up, I get a human

178
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,029
and I said I tried to create an account on your site and it

179
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,070
didn't work and told me to call this number and the guy just says,

180
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,269
oh, yeah, the account creation is down,

181
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,149
try again in a couple of days and I'm thinking what a couple of days?

182
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,799
This is

183
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:52,220
just what I mean.

184
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,209
Could you imagine if, if Google's login system went down and they were like, oh,

185
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,799
yeah, in a couple of days we'll have it working again.

186
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:01,700
Like, no, they would have fired three quarters of that company in a couple of of days.

187
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:04,809
-- Why can't they also have the website? Tell you this.
-- I don't know.

188
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,619
And that's part of it is, it's clear this website is a, a heap of trash,

189
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,709
unquestionably.

190
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,459
The fact that they, this guy didn't even skip a beat was like, oh, yes,

191
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,299
it's down try again in a couple of days.

192
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:16,279
It's clear

193
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,540
I was not the first person he talked to about this that day.

194
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,420
So anyway, then I said, fine, whatever

195
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,829
I need to unlock my credit with you. He's like, oh yes, that'll be fine.

196
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,959
And he's basically asked me like two or

197
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,230
three questions which are big in all seriousness.

198
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:31,670
They were pretty much public knowledge questions.

199
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,150
Then he's like, ok, your credit's unlocked. And I thought,

200
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,349
but no, what? No, I've got this number, I'm supposed to be

201
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,094
you. He's like, oh no, it's fine. I took care of it.

202
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:42,775
My favorite is, um, I got a piece of mail from Revenue Canada

203
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,544
it was a statement on my account, you know, showing what I paid.

204
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:47,054
So it's got my name and address on it

205
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:49,385
obviously because that's how mail gets to people.

206
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:51,885
And they had

207
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:52,854
at the top

208
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,179
my uh

209
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,700
social insurance number, it's uh in Canada,

210
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,539
it's a nine digit number and they'd Xed out the first, what is it?

211
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,520
Six digits or something? So you can only see the last three digits.

212
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,710
And I'm like, fantastic.

213
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,869
Except

214
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:10,159
these forms come in a standard, even if it's like a, even if you have like a zero

215
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,150
balance,

216
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,950
it's a standard Remittance form and in the standard Remittance form,

217
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,090
what do they print at the bottom?

218
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,440
-- Let me
-- guess your full ID.

219
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:17,960
Yeah,

220
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,669
I was like, well, they're trying, it's,

221
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,849
it's better because back in the olden days it just, it had like curtsy free,

222
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,570
you know, 123456789, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,219
-- So now you'd actually have to unfold the letter and look at the bottom.
-- Yeah.

224
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:38,539
In fact, I remember there was at one point it was, I think a gas company,

225
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,429
my account number was my social security number

226
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:45,719
and I'm thinking this is probably not. Ok. How's that legal?

227
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,409
It will, I think it was at the time. I don't think it is anymore.

228
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,419
Or even if it is still legal, they don't do it.

229
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:53,359
-- Well, no,
-- they just changed it on the back end to show a different number. But the

230
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:53,890
back end is

231
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,169
still

232
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:54,820
very

233
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:55,210
much.

234
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,359
Yeah, whatever.

235
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,400
Anyway, anyway, so it gets even better. Ok, whatever. They unlock my credit.

236
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't give them the magic number. I'm supposed to have to give them

237
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,520
and I'm like, I don't even care. Whatever. Ok,

238
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,489
so then third company,

239
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,289
the letter they sent me

240
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:14,960
long ago. This was like, I think 2007 was when I did all this.

241
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:19,289
So in 2000 it looks like it was typed on a typewriter by a human.

242
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,260
Like the thing they gave me because II,

243
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,369
I was looking at it and I was like, this really doesn't look like a computer did this,

244
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,719
which whatever I don't care.

245
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,239
Like I locked my credit

246
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,130
very early in this whole universe. So it is conceivable.

247
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,090
A human actually did a bunch of this one.

248
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,960
I go to their website and it, it looks like something out of the nineties

249
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:40,919
and it was ridiculous.

250
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,750
And right, I click around, I do my, uh,

251
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,919
it probably is out of the nineties but it worked.

252
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,280
It was the only freaking one that actually worked.

253
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,640
And I'm thinking, I don't even know what to say.

254
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:50,739
Yeah,

255
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,190
probably because it's the same mainframe running

256
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,559
from the nineties and it actually,

257
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,479
you know, some human updated of files.

258
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,739
It was just like I,

259
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,719
I get done

260
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,549
and,

261
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,080
and then luckily I sign up for internet and I'm thinking,

262
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,340
please don't use that one credit agency that I

263
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:08,580
can't figure out right now and they didn't.

264
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,190
And, and,

265
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,890
and then the here's the best part though,

266
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,609
the one shining light in this ridiculous story

267
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,520
is I click, you know, I click the button. It's like, great.

268
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,570
You're all set, pick a day for the install and freaking tomorrow,

269
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,570
which is today was on.

270
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,200
And I'm like,

271
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,929
this is insane.

272
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,229
I see it. Literally, I signed up last night,

273
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,080
the guy showed up 12 hours later

274
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,659
installed my internet and, and I told him I'm like,

275
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,840
I signed up for this last night and he looked at me and said,

276
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:39,559
there's at least a 10 day waiting period for almost everyone signing up right now.

277
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,229
So I'm like,

278
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,530
I'll take it, you know, finally for once the universe smiled upon me after the,

279
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,690
the pain and suffering I went through to get here.

280
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,090
No, it's, it's good. It's good.

281
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:48,349
It was,

282
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,400
it was really fast and I'm impressed by how all this gear

283
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,409
works because actually I was bugging the heck out of the guy

284
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,010
when he was doing the install.

285
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,909
And I mean, I remember back in the day when you ran fiber optic cable,

286
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,739
you had to be like, nice and straight

287
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,659
and you had to worry about, you know, if you, you clipped an end,

288
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:04,130
you had to do all this polishing.

289
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:07,659
-- Yeah. The new stuff is super squishy. Freaks me out. Yeah,
-- it's what he showed me.

290
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,099
He bent some of it like he broke it

291
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,690
and you have to bend it substantially before it works

292
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:14,320
like it was wild.

293
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,780
Well, the bend radius on the cable they installed internally in my house here,

294
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,809
the bend radius on it is literally a few millimeters like you can, you could,

295
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,570
you could pretty much tie it in a knot.

296
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:27,500
Pretty, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah, it's wild. It's nothing like it used to be.

297
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,619
I have a funny story for you after Equifax breach. Here's your next story. Weak pins.

298
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,900
So,

299
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:33,900
apparently the pin numbers they've been setting

300
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:37,539
on these credit freeze things are guessable.

301
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:42,570
Can't be reset. Always quite often don't work and so on and so forth.

302
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,890
That doesn't surprise me. And this is from September 2017.

303
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,859
Which, yeah, again, I mean, I wonder how many of them are? 1234.

304
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,109
No, no, they send you the pin. Yeah, that's what I mean.

305
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:54,020
-- They set a pin and,
-- but they're, no, it's not 1234.

306
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,330
Like mine are actually like 6 to 8 digit numbers. They're fairly long,

307
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,330
but I don't know how they generated them. I mean, it's conceivable.

308
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,489
It's just like a freaking hash of my last name or something too. I don't know.

309
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,450
But I would,

310
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,969
I would not trust their random number generators for these pins in any way.

311
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:10,000
It's just at the same time

312
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:11,330
it's enough work.

313
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,640
I don't think, uh, uh, unless like I'm being actively targeted,

314
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,229
I don't think anyone's going to care enough and let's face it,

315
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,469
I'm being actively targeted.

316
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:21,580
They could just come and hit me with the stick until I give them the documents,

317
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,320
which I, I totally would,

318
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,789
-- please don't hit me with
-- a quote from somebody in the industry is we

319
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,719
are engaged in a process that will provide consumers a randomly generated pin.

320
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:31,119
What were they doing before that?

321
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:39,330
I, I could, I could read that a couple of ways. It could be like a Atotp style token

322
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,250
or it could be a matter of quit picking freaking 1234. And here's some numbers.

323
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:49,210
See what gets me is it seems like that classic thing of like we gave you security.

324
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:50,239
Why are you complaining?

325
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:50,580
Yeah,

326
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,710
the security doesn't really work and it's horrible to

327
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,159
use and it's like you might as well,

328
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:55,119
you know,

329
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,130
it's like having somebody standing behind you with a plate and a fork going screech.

330
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,150
You know, the whole time

331
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,159
from my perspective, actually,

332
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:06,489
the intent of my credit freezes is just so basically nobody can steal my credit.

333
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,530
-- And I would say,
-- well,

334
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,679
they can still steal your credit, they can just

335
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,549
-- as easily.
-- Ok, that's fair, but it's very difficult.

336
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,479
So I think the bar of difficulty is even higher than I would expect it to be.

337
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:20,200
So, on that note, we're doing great,

338
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,289
but the reality is as a consumer trying to actually use these services,

339
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,090
uh they all get a giant for, well, the last company

340
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:28,869
they don't.

341
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,229
That was, I think, Transunion,

342
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,080
but everyone else fails. I fail the rest of them. Well, there's only two others.

343
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,159
-- Well,
-- it's not like you can take your business elsewhere. Right.

344
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:38,460
-- No.
-- Exactly. I have no choice. So,

345
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:38,809
whatever.

346
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,169
I mean, I think this is a fundamental problem is you can freeze your credit.

347
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,270
I can still very easily steal your data.

348
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,640
It's now just a little bit harder to use

349
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,539
your data And see that's what fundamentally this all,

350
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:49,659
uh, it's a lot harder.

351
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:50,479
Well, yeah,

352
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:51,695
compared to the average. Right.

353
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:53,885
But what frustrates me and this is what

354
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:56,005
gets me about this whole identity theft thing is

355
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:58,145
the problem isn't the stealing

356
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,244
of identities.

357
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:02,955
The problem is that it's so easy given a little bit of information about somebody

358
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,395
to then go do things like purchase a mortgage in

359
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,284
their name or get a car in their name or whatever

360
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,775
where these companies are like, well, basically we're going to

361
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,890
hand over this asset to you that may be

362
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,070
worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.

363
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:20,710
And, uh, oh, you, you seem to know your own address, phone number and date of birth,

364
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,059
mother's maiden name.

365
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,739
Yeah. Good enough close.

366
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,140
Right. Right. You know,

367
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,859
and it terrifies me,

368
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,340
you know, that we have these really major assets that you can then be on the hook for

369
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,549
and

370
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,010
there's no real and quite often there's not really

371
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,570
a good process to deal with problems in it.

372
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,890
Like the great example is that guy,

373
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,210
there's a story about a hacker who got the license plate of null. Null.

374
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,340
Yeah, that was a good one.

375
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:46,500
And he's getting like thousands and thousands of

376
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,739
dollars in parking tickets and speeding tickets and stuff

377
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,010
because when they don't know, like what the license plate is or whatever,

378
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,159
they just put null.

379
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,020
So they mail this guy, like this guy is getting all these tickets

380
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,739
and

381
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,080
the system isn't inherently

382
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,059
able to deal with this.

383
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,132
First of all,

384
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:06,172
don't do dumb stuff. And that guy was too so clever. He's dumb.

385
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:09,043
Well, I mean, this is like the time when my, my old ISP again, shaw,

386
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:10,492
not to pick on them too much.

387
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,093
But they used to let you pick your host name.

388
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:14,353
Right. That was kind of cool because they gave you a static IP.

389
00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:17,083
-- And you could pick a host name and
-- you pick something stupid. I remember this.

390
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,543
-- I
-- picked a local host.

391
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:21,132
-- You were stupid. It's your own fault.
-- That's not stupid.

392
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:22,562
-- It
-- was
-- fun. Kurt. It was stupid.

393
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:25,315
-- I have no sympathy for you
-- until my cable modem tipped over.

394
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,806
I have no sympathy for you. You

395
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:27,005
did,

396
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:31,445
it was fine for me. The problem is it broke everybody else's computers.

397
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:35,226
And so, you know, about an hour after I did this in the evening I told, um, you know,

398
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:38,565
I actually knew the guy that ran their network and I was like, hey, you know, Kevin.

399
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:42,315
Um, remember how you, like, restrict host names, like o admin and stuff.

400
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:45,676
He's like, yeah. And I'm like, you guys didn't reserve local hosts. He's like what

401
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,400
he's like, that explains the network problems we've been having.

402
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,940
Imagine you have an amorphous graph of bad ideas.

403
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,409
And there's a small band in there called Clever Things. OK.

404
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,520
-- Where, so
-- what you're saying is it's like shower temperature,

405
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,680
right? It's exactly like that. Yes.

406
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,108
Where it's a small sliver, it's not big but you cross the line from Clever to Dumb

407
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,550
and it's not a big line.

408
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,530
And the guy who set his license plate to know he crossed the line from Clever to dumb.

409
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,608
I don't feel bad for him. You know, these systems are not written terribly well.

410
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,910
They're not using, you know, the best developers in the world because let's face it.

411
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,209
If you're the best developer in the world, are you going to say?

412
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:30,449
I really want to write a ticket tracking system for the local police. No, you are not.

413
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,199
And this is the reality of it like,

414
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,859
yes, it's clever but it's so clever. It's dumb. I have no sympathy for that person.

415
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:41,060
You are you, you are getting the punishment you deserve for your cleverness.

416
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:41,520
Well done.

417
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,739
Well, I think what, what I find interesting about it is,

418
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,880
is it shows the real fragility and the lack of handling of corner cases,

419
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:53,020
you know, because a great example is when I told the guy, I was like, I grab local.

420
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,459
He's like, oh,

421
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,430
you know, I'm going to put that on the reserve list, like right now, like, yeah,

422
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,920
that's the correct response, like,

423
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:00,469
you know, and then, then they added a bunch and I'm like,

424
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,280
you probably want to grab a bunch of these other quasi

425
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,780
reserved names or, you know, common names or what was it?

426
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,130
There used to be something like it was like a default host name, something picked,

427
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,020
you know, a bunch of stuff like that.

428
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,209
And so it's like, OK, you know, they

429
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,579
basically updated their, their blacklist,

430
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:17,680
but that's what I'm seeing with null is a very weird and special case.

431
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:18,089
And yeah,

432
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,780
do you put in a specific corner case for null or do you maybe have a generic blacklist?

433
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,500
And like a great example is, you know, we just, I uh I took three of our older websites

434
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,530
that were, they just serve static content, you know, like font files,

435
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,420
stuff like that and I shoved them into an S3 bucket, put cloudfront in front of it,

436
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,069
cloud

437
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,300
in front of cloudfront

438
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:37,959
and then it broke and I'm like,

439
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,739
oh, why did it break? And it was because I forgot to put a Coors policy on it, you know,

440
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,640
is it cross origin requests?

441
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,989
Something what

442
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,140
I forget,

443
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:46,790
you know, doesn't matter.

444
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:50,099
And so then I was like, oh, you know, just for now to make it work,

445
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,739
I'll put a star in there instead of the actual host names of,

446
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:53,349
of the

447
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,209
things we do, which, you know, and that's on my list

448
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,719
to be clear. That's on my, to do list for today to fix.

449
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,609
So it'll be

450
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:58,869
fine.

451
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,869
I'm gonna ask you in a year if you fixed it.

452
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,800
-- I bet the answer is no,
-- no, because it's, uh, we're

453
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,920
anyways, but

454
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,319
the thing is what I'm really noticing is

455
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,079
lack of forethought.

456
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:12,640
And then when people do spot a problem, they almost

457
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,770
always just

458
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,719
spackle over the problem as little as possible to get it to go away

459
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:21,020
and then move on and I get that because, you know, we're all busy.

460
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,479
They don't do like an actual bit of investigation and go like, oh, whoops, you know,

461
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:27,750
we should also handle this, this and this and this and we can also fix this problem.

462
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,449
I don't know, like with this whole thing with security,

463
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:33,439
like this whole credit freeze pin number thing seems to be like,

464
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,650
well, what's the minimum we need to give these people to get them to, like,

465
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,012
shut up and to get the legislators to off our back?

466
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:43,473
Well, offer a credit freeze and like a secure, a long enough pin is a password. Folks.

467
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:47,942
Right. To me, a pin is like 12 is a four or maybe even up to a six digit number.

468
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:48,973
Anything longer than that.

469
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:51,493
We're starting to talk about passwords. I agree.

470
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:54,733
And it's so they did the bare minimum they could do to get these people off their back.

471
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,853
They showed them something that sort of worked back in the day.

472
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,786
And of course, you know, 10 years later it doesn't work like you phone, you can't,

473
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:02,225
your pin number is broken or doesn't exist or the,

474
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:02,495
you,

475
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:03,806
the file or who knows?

476
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:04,526
Exactly.

477
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,066
I don't know what to do or say because this is,

478
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:09,145
I feel like this is a boiling the ocean problem.

479
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:13,186
It kind of is, I mean, it's a really hard problem to solve. How do you, let's face it.

480
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:16,036
We need, I mean, this was, this came up in our conversation with,

481
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,755
with the clerk about the physical name book is

482
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:22,975
we don't have like a way to identify people beyond a reasonable doubt.

483
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:26,615
And so we make up all these hodgepodge one off crap systems

484
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,410
and, and this is just the result. It's,

485
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,660
and I don't even think it's that these,

486
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,040
these credit agencies are purposely trying to make my life miserable, even though

487
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,650
-- they do a wonderful job. It's all they have.
-- Well, they have.

488
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,170
Yeah, they have,

489
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,719
it's not even that their technology is bad is that they have like

490
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:44,859
a business model and a business process from basically the seventies or eighties.

491
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,729
Right. Exactly.

492
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:48,479
It hasn't changed and the world has, you know,

493
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,479
the world changes a few percent every year.

494
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,890
What I really noticed today, you know, I was in line at the Starbucks

495
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,040
and it was a long line because we hit it right during prime time.

496
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,280
So my son, you know, gave him my phone, he's playing Minecraft.

497
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,380
So he, he, he does not care how long we're going to wait playing Minecraft.

498
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,069
I noticed everybody else in line was like, had their nose buried in their phone,

499
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,910
their smartphone.

500
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,479
Right. And nobody really cared about having to wait in line because

501
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:10,989
I got the whole internet in my hand.

502
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:14,459
-- These things have only existed for 13 years.
-- I know it's crazy.

503
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,069
I, I actually, I had a conversation the other day about that with

504
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:20,310
it was, it was someone in Vegas

505
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,479
and I said, I mean, you think about it,

506
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,780
the smartphones have existed for a little over a decade now.

507
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,040
And could you imagine taking a trip without one? I mean, I remember

508
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,729
I would print out plane tickets. I would print out maps. I would have directions.

509
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:35,439
-- I would print out all my hotel confirmation numbers
-- because, oh,

510
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:36,300
I'm ignoring all that.

511
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,300
I'm just worried about being bored on the plane.

512
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:42,505
Oh, screw that. Like I don't, I'm not, I still read a book for that. I don't care.

513
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:45,425
But I'm just saying like I used to travel with a folder full of

514
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:48,795
paperwork and I remember I would show up at hotels and they'd be like,

515
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:50,035
I don't know who you are.

516
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:52,265
And I'd say here's my paperwork and they'd say, oh,

517
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:55,895
they misspelled your name in the system, you know. Now it's better

518
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,265
and it's just,

519
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,805
now I've got a phone and I look on the phone

520
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:02,625
and the app for the hotel says you have a reservation and

521
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,849
heck there was,

522
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,540
I think it was Hilton. I don't even have to talk to a human anymore.

523
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,390
I just show up, I click a button. It tells me my room number. I go to it.

524
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,150
I hold my phone up to the door and it lets me in and is it insecure? Probably do I care?

525
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,510
No, it's awesome. Like that's, that's the beauty of it.

526
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,939
Hotel security gets me the weirdest because, you know,

527
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:23,349
fundamentally if you want your room cleaned and you're not gonna haul all your

528
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:27,349
nice stuff out of there. You know, I, I honestly I got over that years ago.

529
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,500
I just leave all my junk in the hotel room, you know,

530
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,060
and if there's an evil maid attack then yeah, I'm up the creek.

531
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:35,619
I do not. I'm still very particular about my things.

532
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,819
In fact, when I was in Vegas, a lot of people I work with were like,

533
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:40,010
why don't you set your bag down?

534
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,670
And I said I, no, not here. I will stay on my back and yet

535
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:46,560
it sucks. But that's all right. It's, it's how it is.

536
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,569
-- I see
-- this is one of the things I love about how more and

537
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,739
more devices have biometrics because I hate

538
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,729
typing in passwords at these conferences.

539
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,290
I'm always worried somebody go shoulder surf a camera,

540
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,290
you know.

541
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,469
But I, I don't know what's the lesson to be learned here?

542
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:02,790
I mean, the, in this case they gave us, they gave us security with air quotes.

543
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,550
It doesn't seem to work.

544
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,089
The lesson is if you complain about a problem

545
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,130
on a podcast, you feel a little better at the end.

546
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,780
That's the lesson

547
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,489
I'll buy. I mean, let's face it, man. There's nothing I can do.

548
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,390
I can complain and wine, I can write my con.

549
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,939
In fact, I remember

550
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,979
some time ago I wrote a lot of letters

551
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:24,199
about all this stuff that the congressman I have.

552
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:27,130
And they were like, we don't understand what you're talking about and we don't

553
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,339
care to

554
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:27,469
go.

555
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,939
And it's like, what do you do?

556
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,060
Right. The people in charge don't know what's going on.

557
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:36,520
The companies that are lobbying for this don't

558
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,859
want change because change is hard and expensive

559
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:42,420
and as normal people, it's like, well, there's really not a lot we can do either.

560
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,670
So it's like,

561
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,239
I guess we just live our lives and accept

562
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,619
the fact that everything sucks except gigabit internet.

563
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,760
So like, yeah.

564
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,479
And I guess at the same time I have this ridiculous story. It took me

565
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,479
probably three days to get through all this.

566
00:23:57,489 --> 00:23:59,640
But at the end of it, did I get what I wanted? Yes.

567
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,959
Am I gonna remember this pain in a month? No.

568
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,829
So there you go. Yeah,

569
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:09,150
-- I don't know what else to tell you, man. It is what it is.
-- Well, I think that's sort of,

570
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,390
maybe that's part of the life lesson here is, you know,

571
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,469
people in security need a bit more perspective.

572
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,270
-- Uh,
-- what's, what's their perspective though?

573
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,910
Well, things are not as bad as things are.

574
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,560
We still have, you know, the whole world isn't actually physically on fire.

575
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:25,670
-- At least not yet. Give it a few more decades.
-- No, I agree with that.

576
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,000
I,

577
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,300
and, and I mean, this is one of our problems, right? Is

578
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,290
I, I have this discussion at work often where

579
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,010
a security person will say,

580
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,150
well, look at this terrible thing

581
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,729
and then someone will say it works right? Like it really isn't, it's been working.

582
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,849
It's not that big of a deal. We're not seeing anyone doing it.

583
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:45,510
And then, yeah, again, the security person's like, did you hear me yell doom?

584
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,819
I'll yell louder for you.

585
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,329
And it's like they don't care and they know probably as much

586
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,089
about the system as you do and they're not going to listen.

587
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:55,609
And

588
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,109
now at the same time though,

589
00:24:57,219 --> 00:25:00,650
the, the right way to deal with this is it is an opportunity

590
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:01,660
to

591
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,020
evaluate

592
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,300
what is happening

593
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,790
and come up with an appropriate response where I think historically,

594
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,390
the security answer has always been,

595
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,680
oh, no, we can't do anything.

596
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:13,449
You know, let's all go live in caves and,

597
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:16,219
and use smoke signals and throw rocks at people

598
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:21,140
when the reality is like, we might get hacked if we do this.

599
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,180
But the payoff

600
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:28,020
in the meantime is this and if we get hacked here's what we're going to have to do

601
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:34,920
and it's still significantly less risky and costly than not doing this thing.

602
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,060
And I know that was a bunch of weird descriptions. But, I mean,

603
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,520
it's, it's like, fundamentally, I would say it, it's like

604
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,280
I'm gonna,

605
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:47,310
I could put a ridiculous steel door on my house that costs say $20,000 and has

606
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:49,359
the greatest lock in the world.

607
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:51,959
But is there a payoff there if I do that?

608
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:56,550
No, not really. I have a normal, you know, couple of $100 door.

609
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,969
You'd have something to talk about at parties. Why?

610
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:03,170
Because I'm the freak with the big door. Like I'm already a freak for enough reasons.

611
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,709
Kurt, I don't need another one.

612
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:05,640
I

613
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:06,339
mean,

614
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,709
I've got, there's, yeah, I, I've got enough against me here.

615
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:13,699
I don't, I don't need to add to that pile, but like for real. Right.

616
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:17,140
Is there a payoff there? Definitely not. Is it more secure? Definitely.

617
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,099
But is it stupid?

618
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,589
Yes. Yes, it is.

619
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,410
And anyway, we should, we should stop.

620
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,369
I could complain about this for months and not run out of content. But I think,

621
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:30,369
I guess fundamentally, yes, that will, we'll make that our lesson.

622
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,189
We look at my ridiculous story. I have a, a silly story to tell and I will tell it.

623
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,310
I promise you.

624
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,449
I will tell it.

625
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,810
So, I've got my stupid story to tell. But at the end of the day, did I get what I want?

626
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,479
Yes. Yes, I did.

627
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,180
And

628
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:46,469
ok. Yeah, I lost a couple days of my life properly. But

629
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,150
whatever I got gigabit. Internet.

630
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,050
-- Any, I, I'll give you the last word here.
-- Honestly, people

631
00:26:54,729 --> 00:27:00,010
get internet. That's at least 100 megabits a second. It is vastly superior.

632
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,760
No, I'm not kidding. Like it's the difference is,

633
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:03,250
you know,

634
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,670
you don't necessarily need gigabit. But I mean, I remember when I went above 100. It,

635
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,020
yeah, if you can get above 100 get above 100.

636
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,310
-- It makes life so much, so much less
-- waiting right now.

637
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,199
-- I can watch my Netflix even faster
-- and then,

638
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:18,959
but the best part is web pages will still load slowly until you get an ad blocker.

639
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:24,050
Yes, that is very true. The ad blockers make an enormous difference 100%. Uh Cool.

640
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,660
All right. Good deal. Well, thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.
