Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,460
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,210
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,729
I miss thought Crime.

4
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:14,189
Those are better days.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:14,930
Uh,

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,030
that's what you think

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,500
anyway.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,790
All right.

9
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:20,629
So,

10
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,690
-- Kurt, what is the zero day?
-- Well, I can tell you when I see one but

11
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:27,360
the definition of it is basically terrible.

12
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:30,239
-- I don't think there is a definition of it.
-- Well, and that's the thing, right?

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:30,920
It's, it's

14
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:31,909
one of those

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,389
colloquial language

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,049
things of there's no formal body to define it and even within the text scene,

17
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,779
it has different meanings within different parts of the text scene.

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,119
All right. Well, we should first start by, why is this a topic

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,080
that we're even talking about today? And there have been

20
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,799
a handful of,

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,509
we'll say stories and incidents in the last probably two

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,709
or three months where people have called the question.

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,310
Is that really a zero day?

24
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:04,250
And then this big discussion erupts of, well, what even is a zero day.

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,349
And of course, there's generally no agreement

26
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:08,760
and

27
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:14,709
my answer is going to be the best non answers ever, which is, who cares?

28
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:16,839
Well,

29
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,290
you're not.

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,239
Yeah. No, I, I would, I'm gonna go with, you're not entirely wrong.

31
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,330
I mean, see, to me, part of it,

32
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,870
to me, I think that the,

33
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,519
I think the biggest problem with Zero Day is it kind of goes to this

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,839
intent

35
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,599
as opposed to actually defining what something is, right?

36
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,819
It's not so much of an observation of something,

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,360
but what is the intent behind that something? Right.

38
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,069
So, I mean,

39
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,000
basically the way vulnerabilities typically work is somebody finds it and

40
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,400
then somebody either tells the world at large or they tell

41
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,599
the vendor

42
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,480
kind of or the upstream project responsible for it or maybe they sell it to bad guys,

43
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,080
but essentially it gets distributed to some degree, right?

44
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,000
And then the problem is like,

45
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:04,239
I think it's clearly a zero day when only one human being on the planet knows about it.

46
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,370
But as soon as it starts to be distributed,

47
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:09,669
part of the question is what is the intent of that distribution is

48
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,309
the intent of that distribution to fix it or to exploit it?

49
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,770
And I think traditionally zero day assumes the intent

50
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:18,779
to exploit is what makes it a zero day.

51
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:19,089
So,

52
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,770
you know what's actually funny you just reminded me of

53
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:24,020
also in the way you describe that is zero day.

54
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,690
Some people call O day

55
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:26,600
and

56
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:30,013
you know what I came to realize is after talking to a handful of people and,

57
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:32,753
and I'm doing the, the hacker history podcast now.

58
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:34,662
Which is one of my other side projects because

59
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:36,533
I have copious amounts of free time apparently.

60
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:42,563
And I've realized that old people say, zero day, young people say, oh day.

61
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:45,492
That is. I've just, there's, I don't know where the line is yet.

62
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:46,983
I can't wait to figure this out.

63
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:51,873
But that seems to be what I've ascertained is the, if you're, if you're old like us,

64
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:52,802
it's Zero Day.

65
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:53,593
But if you're young and cool,

66
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,255
it's an O day. So that's interesting.

67
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:57,175
But anyway, anyway,

68
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:59,455
I don't talk to people much recently.

69
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:00,585
So I

70
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,526
just, but that's a good point.

71
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:04,145
I'm going to pay attention because one thing I noticed

72
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:06,755
at the playground at some point in the last few years

73
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,016
when the kids say, ok,

74
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:12,475
count from 1 to 10 and then the game starts and all the kids count 1 to 10, like 1 to 10.

75
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:12,955
That's it.

76
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:16,095
-- Right. And I'm like, oh, that's clever.
-- That's malicious compliance. I,

77
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,945
I suspect you're right because I have heard people refer to it as an old day.

78
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:20,645
But I never,

79
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:21,705
like,

80
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:22,335
I just

81
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,779
was kind of like, oh, that's weird. You know, nuer,

82
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,750
sure, whatever. N,

83
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,750
yeah, that's, that's the word.

84
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:29,800
I

85
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,199
know it's nuclear. I know.

86
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,589
I'm constantly correcting my one son because, and I'm like, there's,

87
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,820
and I'll write it out for him and I'm like, there's no, and he just, you know,

88
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,789
he's picked it up from listening to youtube and stuff.

89
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,750
Right. Right. Oh, man. Ok. So anyway, anyway, here is, I think where

90
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:44,873
I

91
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:46,893
would like to go with this and this is a

92
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:49,763
bigger discussion point than just zero day o day.

93
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,272
What is, what it is, what it isn't.

94
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:53,003
I think we exist in a place,

95
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:57,912
especially in the security world where we don't often have well defined terms.

96
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:01,953
This is kind of, one of my complaints is a lot of other

97
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:06,912
professions have like standards, bodies that help define a lot of these things.

98
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,466
-- And we don't always
-- have that,

99
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,416
you know what? It's actually a lot more subtle than that.

100
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:13,916
It's not just that the standards bodies define the

101
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:17,255
language but that they use the language consistently.

102
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:21,156
They may not even have like a dictionary or a glossary, but the fact that they

103
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:24,955
use a term consistently to mean one thing and then maybe switch it up

104
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:29,036
later that gives it that that sort of gravitas that that's what that is.

105
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,739
You know, it's like Schrodinger's cat.

106
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,769
It's been defined because we keep looking at it and agreeing that it looks like a cat.

107
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:33,809
Oh

108
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,549
man, I'm not,

109
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,940
don't get me started on Schrodinger's cat because the way we

110
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,019
describe it is the opposite of what he wanted to convey.

111
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,910
I know it's the ridiculousness of bla bla bla

112
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:46,140
anyways. But the point is if language is what people

113
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,410
say it is

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,230
right in

115
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:48,470
the

116
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:48,660
whole

117
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,029
versus Cracker debate, I'm like, sorry guys that,

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,309
that ship sailed sank and it's gone.

119
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,410
You know what my favorite.

120
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,880
And I think that's easier to understand these days is what is, what is crypto

121
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:00,869
in your mind.

122
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,630
Well, it depends what part of the world you're asking me about because

123
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,320
in my Blockchain world, what is

124
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,609
the question?

125
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,329
You know,

126
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:07,649
cry,

127
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:08,410
I'm banging

128
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,309
my shoe on the desk. Answer the question.

129
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,072
So crypto to me used to be just pure cryptography. You know,

130
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:14,433
I don't care what it used to be.

131
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:17,532
-- Answer the question, what I would say
-- if somebody said,

132
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:19,303
can you define what crypto is for me?

133
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:23,013
Now, I would basically talk about Blockchain cryptocurrencies.

134
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,072
-- And
-- I think that's what the vast majority of people would describe it

135
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,263
as and I'm sure we have someone listening who's yelling at there.

136
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:31,923
No, it's B GP or GP G or whatever.

137
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,532
-- No.
-- Well, no crypto used to stand for crypto

138
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:34,936
Gray

139
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,406
essentially, which was all sorts of encryption.

140
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:40,635
And eventually the word got co opted by the Cryptocurrency people.

141
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:44,436
And now when you say crypto, it basically means Cryptocurrency. And

142
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,795
like there's plenty of us that are going to die in this hill and don't get me wrong.

143
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,406
I will never use the word crypto on purpose to describe Cryptocurrency.

144
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:53,235
It always means cryptography in my mind.

145
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:57,976
But I mean, generally speaking, like society decided we lost, that's it.

146
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:02,145
Well, and my favorite thing is all these medical terms

147
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,825
but become insults,

148
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:09,869
right? Things like moron and imbecile used to have specific medical meanings.

149
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,899
So people use them to, you know, insult somebody

150
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:16,299
and they became insults and fell out of medical use.

151
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,279
You know what my favorite one is actually is the word Nimrod. Yeah.

152
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,940
Do you know the story behind this one?

153
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,220
-- Uh, no.
-- So Nimrod in the Bible is a great hunter, right?

154
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,359
In a looney tunes. Cartoon bugs bunny calls Elmer Fudd. A Nimrod.

155
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:35,339
Not, not necessarily to make fun of him but to like, be

156
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,619
the great hunter.

157
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,220
Most people decided that Bugs bunny was making

158
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,809
fun of Elmer Fudd because let's face it.

159
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,299
That's pretty much all he ever does.

160
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,700
And so Nimrod becomes a derogatory term

161
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,609
instead of meaning Great Hunter,

162
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,040
which I think is one of my favorite. Just

163
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,390
-- strained, twisting of the language.
-- Well, let's face it.

164
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,769
Bugs Bunny has a lot of pole.

165
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,489
I love bugs bunny man.

166
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:01,029
Like, you know, you want to talk about being an influencer.

167
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,329
Bugs bunny is an influencer.

168
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,209
-- I,
-- well, he used to be, I don't think he has quite the influence. He used to,

169
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,750
man. I love the loony tunes actually on Saturday morning.

170
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,959
Now, one of the weird, like over the air TV stations because like,

171
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,359
everyone has like 100 TV stations over the air.

172
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,309
One of them started playing looney tunes on Saturday mornings.

173
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,359
And so I'm forcing my Children to watch it with me,

174
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:23,269
which is lovely and they're just as good as they always were.

175
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,079
At least, I think so. But anyway,

176
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,589
zero day. Right. Let's focus on Zero day. Oh, sorry.

177
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
We actually have eight over the air TV channels locally. I had no idea.

178
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:32,880
Yeah, there's like tons of them now.

179
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,869
And you can actually, I use PLEX to receive the, the signal and on my pluck server,

180
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,730
I've got a little USB TV tuner thing.

181
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:41,730
You can do, I plug in

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,829
and then you can, like, you can even view it while you're gone.

183
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,510
Like I can, I can watch local TV when I'm like three states over. It's pretty cool.

184
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,510
Anyway, anyway, zero day. So I guess here's the thing

185
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,230
I've been noticing when zero days get described.

186
00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:00,209
The historical definition is very much a, this was completely unknown

187
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,559
and all of a sudden it's known and often

188
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,230
it became news because it was being exploited actively.

189
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:09,559
And I think most of the usage I see now is a

190
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,250
zero day means an exploit being exploited before there is a fix.

191
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,630
Yes.

192
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,029
And not just an exploit before a fix, but an exploit before knowledge of the exploit.

193
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,989
Like we ran into the exploit in the wild.

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,100
Not even knowledge, knowledge is irrelevant in this.

195
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:27,709
From what I've seen, I think it is if there is no fix, it is going to be called a zero day.

196
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,480
So even if they know they still consider it a zero day.

197
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,020
Yeah, I mean, there was, there's been tons of stuff, like,

198
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,679
look at that Microsoft Exchange thing.

199
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,090
-- Where that was.
-- Well today right now, the V eight thing,

200
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,119
there's a, there's an,

201
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,010
somebody just literally dropped an exploit for V

202
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,880
eight Cloud flare had actually a really good

203
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,080
response on hacker news about how they rolled it out in like 23 hours the update.

204
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:48,140
But all the browsers edge and chrome have not

205
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:49,000
done it.

206
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,710
And I'm actually, right now, I have the Tab Open in github

207
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:52,760
with the

208
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,320
javascript. It's 100 and 21.

209
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,770
Actually, it's quite well written and nicely.

210
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,679
It, it's, it's good licensed under the BSD two clause, which I don't agree with.

211
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,440
-- But, but wasn't
-- it, it was fixed in va a couple days ago though, right.

212
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,390
But that's not a zero day then, right? By the traditional definition.

213
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,549
Well, but it hasn't made it into my web browser yet.

214
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,359
So as far as I'm concerned, it's sort of

215
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,119
-- a zero day. Yes,
-- exactly.

216
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,179
I think the traditional definition of

217
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,390
completely unknown obviously is irrelevant.

218
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,770
It got fixed someone from, from what I've gathered and I don't have any secret

219
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,809
here, but from what I've gathered, it got fixed,

220
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,359
then someone wrote an exploit for it, right?

221
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:29,280
Which is, which is not how zero days are supposed to work. It's supposed to be, right?

222
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:32,690
The exploit, exploit, the exploit and then, oh ha ha. Look, we found a zero day.

223
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,000
But anyway, it doesn't matter though, right? Because who cares?

224
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,559
You have a functioning javascript exploit that affects Chrome.

225
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,210
Now, now mind you Fran, I mean, hopefully this will be

226
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,650
and

227
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
that's true because edges

228
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,080
edges chromium for anyone listening,

229
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,159
this will probably be fixed by the time this gets published.

230
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:47,440
But

231
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,359
it does

232
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,200
doesn't let you escape the sandbox.

233
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,640
So you also need, you need to use this exploit and then a sandbox escape.

234
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,140
So you need, you need to but whatever it doesn't matter.

235
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,690
So anyway, the point is the traditional definition obviously wouldn't be zero day,

236
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,289
but I'm perfectly comfortable calling this a zero day because this

237
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:07,760
is an exploit without a fix and people care about that.

238
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,119
Well, without a usable fix, I mean, I've seen exploits where somebody's like, and,

239
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,520
and

240
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,359
here's a code patch and it's like great,

241
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:17,580
but I need the actual code patched and a binary built and shipped to me because,

242
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,429
well, like a perfect example is open SSL, right?

243
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,419
Open SSL can issue all the software updates, like source code updates they want.

244
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,419
I'm looking suspiciously at my TV.

245
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,929
-- Yeah, that hasn't seen an open SSL update in a decade.
-- Right.

246
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,039
I don't think it'll actually my TV is dumb

247
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,039
enough that it doesn't even go on the network.

248
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:35,369
So

249
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:36,500
I,

250
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:36,690
I

251
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,729
it's funny my TV si buy them, I connect them into the internet.

252
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:45,239
I download the updates. Then I turn off all the network.

253
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,530
You never, you never need to talk to anyone ever again.

254
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:50,590
Well, honestly,

255
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,330
even as terrible as the experience of like a fire stick

256
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:55,645
now it's still better than whatever's built into a TV.

257
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,195
Oh, absolutely. 100% because I actually own, I have an LG TV, and a Samsung TV.

258
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:03,085
And they're, like, built in everything is terrible.

259
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:07,445
It is an awful experience and I know they're just spying on me constantly.

260
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:10,044
Well, that's the whole point of it is for them to make a few more dollars.

261
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:10,844
That's why those things,

262
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,505
there's a good thread on hacker news about why are there like

263
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:15,825
no tvs without all those crap reloaded?

264
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:19,164
And the answer is because preloading that crap is their profit margin.

265
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,140
Yeah.

266
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:20,830
Right.

267
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,640
Um, but back to the zero day thing,

268
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,500
one thing you mentioned and I think that it just tweaked for me is,

269
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,979
it's a matter of perspective

270
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,419
in the sense of

271
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,229
there are vastly different perspectives for the attacker

272
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:35,400
for the person who kind of owns and has to, you know,

273
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,979
update the software for the end user of the software.

274
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,239
And so I suspect part of the problem is what is

275
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,859
a zero day also depends on what your perspective is,

276
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,869
you know, and an extreme example, you know, my perspective as a guy with

277
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,280
two windows machines,

278
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,950
a couple of macs and some tablets and whatnot

279
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,109
is very different than a fortune 100 company,

280
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,349
I would hope so

281
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:00,059
well. But in the sense of if I have a car,

282
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,549
it doesn't matter if you have a fleet of cars or I have a single car a recall is a recall.

283
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,159
-- I
-- mean,

284
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:09,869
-- yeah, I guess
-- like that's one thing that always, I, I still,

285
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,710
I don't think I fully understand but with technology as

286
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,559
you get fundamentally different things at scale,

287
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,049
especially with numbers and diversity.

288
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,359
Yeah, without question.

289
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,500
And I think in a lot of instances,

290
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,880
the technology is very much like a monoculture

291
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,239
because you think you basically have Windows and Mac

292
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,950
and those probably account for 95% of the web browsers in use on well on computers.

293
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,469
-- I mean, a
-- mobile

294
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,380
mobile mobile is probably slightly different.

295
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:43,380
So thinking about this is part of it is what is the intent of zero day? What is it trying

296
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,729
to describe or get across?

297
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,690
And in my mind,

298
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,200
it was always here is something dangerous for which we don't have a

299
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,099
way to either fix it or deal with it safely because there are,

300
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:58,650
I remember there are zero days that popped out and it it was simple,

301
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:01,030
just turn feature X off and live without it for a day

302
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,820
or two or close off this network port or you know,

303
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,299
whatever do something simple, right?

304
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:06,700
And it was easy to live without.

305
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:08,109
And then conversely,

306
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,020
there are zero days like this chrome javascript thing where it's

307
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:14,859
OK. Don't browse the web well, OK. My web browser is not very useful.

308
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:16,650
Yeah, that's not gonna fly. I

309
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,260
mean,

310
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:21,739
II I think the your description of calling it like this is something important.

311
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,049
That's,

312
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:25,940
I think that's what it really comes down to is like the true meaning is long gone

313
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,159
and it's just, if something's called a zero Day, you probably need to pay attention,

314
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,659
you know.

315
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:35,020
-- Yeah.
-- I think there is value in, where is this bug in the life cycle?

316
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,619
Because I could, you know, I find the world's worst security flaw on windows 10,

317
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,770
it's remotely exploitable.

318
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,219
And I tell Microsoft, well, cool. but it's

319
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,460
going to take Microsoft more than five minutes to react.

320
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,179
Yeah, for sure.

321
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,010
And I mean,

322
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,330
that's why they have their co ordinated disclosure programs and even bug bunnies to

323
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,520
a degree because it's an easy way to say here's a couple of bucks.

324
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,419
Thanks for helping.

325
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,719
Yeah, we need like a

326
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,340
month or three to actually fix it.

327
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:01,039
Yeah.

328
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,320
-- Yeah. And I get that right. That's fine.
-- We were on the receiving end of that.

329
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,150
-- How many times at Red Hat? A
-- million?

330
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,520
I mean, and we were, we were pretty quick for sure.

331
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:09,919
But there were,

332
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,609
there were always things that the challenge there is always and this is, I mean,

333
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,280
this is one of the dangers with kind of zero day.

334
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,859
If you rush a fix, it's not uncommon at all to make the problem worse

335
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,094
than taking your time and doing it right.

336
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:27,114
Because I mean, shell shock is like the best example of this where they,

337
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,875
they rushed the wrong fix,

338
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,544
what, three times

339
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:31,155
and

340
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:34,044
then, and then it was finally like, please fix it. Right.

341
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:36,614
-- Well,
-- I, I remember the same thing with the uh the qac

342
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,434
stack

343
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:42,445
vulnerabilities many years ago. And uh here we go, found it. And originally Kace

344
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:46,195
was like, oh, we can fix this real easy. It'll be a one megabyte guard page and

345
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,169
this should work. Oh, that, right. And off the surface of it. Yeah.

346
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:53,549
No, no, no, that was fine. And then I'm spacing out the

347
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,520
flooring.

348
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:55,450
Um,

349
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,349
you know, looked into it and he's like, no, uh the stack

350
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,309
guard page is gonna have to be like, what was it like?

351
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,869
-- One or two gigabytes or something? It was
-- ridiculously large

352
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,950
and ok. Ok.

353
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,789
That's act ok. On 64 bit systems, we can live with that.

354
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,590
But on 32 bit systems, it means you can have three processes.

355
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,270
Right. Yeah, that's not going to work.

356
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,109
And I mean, this was back in the day when 32 bit binary still existed.

357
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:23,859
-- I mean, they're much rarer now,
-- but I super respect Apple for killing off 32 bit.

358
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:29,429
I was painful as it is for people. I'm sorry, folks. It's, it's 2021.

359
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,609
I've had a 64 bit computer for the better part of two decades.

360
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,190
Thanks a MD by the way. And prior to that deck alpha.

361
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,950
But you know, like,

362
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,940
-- you know what
-- makes this interesting though is on in the Windows Universe is games

363
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:44,869
because there's still 32 bit games being created,

364
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,349
but also all the old games that still run on Windows.

365
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:49,489
-- Those are all 32 bit in
-- Windows.

366
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,590
10, I can still run my D OS apps cleanly and my Windows 95 apps cleanly.

367
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,520
-- So, I sure that's not a problem.
-- What do you mean? It's not a problem.

368
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,229
-- They're running all in the 32 bit user space, but
-- they're running in a VM. Basically.

369
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,429
-- Do they
-- run in VMS? I don't know, I don't know how they do it.

370
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,890
-- Yeah,
-- they're basically running in a, like that, that, what is it?

371
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,580
Windows compatibility mode or whatever it's called. It's basically a VM.

372
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,679
It, I mean, if it is, that's great because that's the right way to do it for sure.

373
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,690
When you have technology that's 20 years old.

374
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,989
It's a lot easier to run it in a VM and have it as

375
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,940
its own separate thing than it is to properly integrate it into the system.

376
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:19,229
I mean,

377
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,219
I agree the fact that we still have reserved device names

378
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,369
and Windows like com and PR N and stuff like that.

379
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,570
So funny, it just breaks, like

380
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,049
there are so many applications that if you try and pass it as a file name, it just,

381
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,650
it just, wow, it just,

382
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,890
there was something you could, I forget what it is.

383
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,869
Now, there was, there was like a file you could open on Windows that would like,

384
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,630
brick the disk or something.

385
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:42,909
Oh, the NTFS thing. Yeah and no, no, no.

386
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,989
If you have a symbolic link, it was, it was pretty recent even. Yeah.

387
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,630
If you have a symbolic link and you open it and blah, blah, blah, blah blah. Yeah,

388
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,590
ntfs is really interesting and that they actually

389
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,669
I finally found some documentation on it from

390
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,659
a disc recovery firm because I looked into it about 20 years ago when I did

391
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,309
file wiping utilities.

392
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:02,419
Because if a file was smaller,

393
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,410
then about four kilobytes instead of storing it on the disk,

394
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:11,489
like a traditional data, it's stored it in sort of any leftover space in the, in the,

395
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,930
in the master file table.

396
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:14,368
Right? Because,

397
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,989
well, if I think the master file table entries are like four kilobytes.

398
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,420
So if there's a bit of data in there and then why not

399
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,280
just put the file in there instead of having a second thing,

400
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,170
right?

401
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,739
But the problem is if you touch the master file table improperly, yeah,

402
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,689
you have a dead system.

403
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,550
Your, your disc is like, it's, it's gone, it's corrupt.

404
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,150
Like that's how that, like when you start corrupting your, you know,

405
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,250
your disk system,

406
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,869
well, yeah,

407
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:37,229
-- it
-- breaks.

408
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:37,750
I mean,

409
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,550
yeah,

410
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,880
yeah, I buy that anyway.

411
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:42,140
And the funny thing is the response to that like in the

412
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,630
world is ok,

413
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,969
we're going to have multiple copies of these tables.

414
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:49,430
I mean, fat does that fat has a backup table because I know

415
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,310
in,

416
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:51,599
I forget what it was.

417
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:56,829
I had something, some, like we would call it iot now, but it was,

418
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,410
it was some device I had a long time ago that would only

419
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,010
update one of the fat tables on the like flash card it used.

420
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,089
And so every time I plugged it in windows was like

421
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:09,109
this disc appears to be corrupt. Do you want me to fix it? And I always click.

422
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,969
No, because if I click, yes, it trashed the disk.

423
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:13,250
So

424
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:17,290
it's like this works. I think it was a camera maybe. But anyway, anyway,

425
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,479
so

426
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,890
I think for the purposes of zero day, maybe that's the problem in that.

427
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:25,250
Not only is it

428
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:31,209
describing intent, but it's describing intent from different perspectives.

429
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:34,829
-- I
-- mean, to a degree, but I think honestly if we want to,

430
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:34,949
well,

431
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,540
the people with different perspectives

432
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,699
aren't going to agree with each other because they don't have

433
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:41,280
the empathy or the intelligence to go as an attacker.

434
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,530
I'm going to look at it from the defender's point of view and vice versa. Who cares?

435
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:45,439
I mean, so one of the,

436
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:48,400
I think this is one of those places where we have to just be like

437
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,160
it doesn't matter because the right way to

438
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,640
handle security vulnerabilities isn't to call them.

439
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,520
This is the Chrome Zero Day.

440
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,270
It's to have easy to acquire identifiers and basically

441
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,719
say like this is what this thing is called.

442
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,790
Is there a fix? Yes. Is there a fix?

443
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,349
No?

444
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,949
Right. And that's when you can start making decisions.

445
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:11,859
Because I think the term zero day has taken on so much, so,

446
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:14,869
so much importance because it's all we have and

447
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,189
it's a terrible solution to a difficult problem.

448
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,750
Well, here's another thought is

449
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,310
for more mature companies that are running bug bounties and are running, you know,

450
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,939
coordinate disclosure efforts.

451
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:30,199
A zero day effectively implies that their system has failed like this V eight bug.

452
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:31,000
How come

453
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:36,680
the guy or the person didn't go, you know how come V eight fixed it? And Google didn't,

454
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,099
to me that looks like a failure.

455
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,839
Maybe I don't know the story behind it. So I can't say for sure.

456
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,209
I mean, look even I don't think I would call it a

457
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,959
it might be a failure, it might not be a failure.

458
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm sitting here with a vulnerable web browser that's a failure.

459
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,319
Just don't run chrome

460
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,329
well. But,

461
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,910
and that's an option in this case.

462
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,410
But what if it was a vulnerability in Linux or Windows kernel?

463
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,780
It, it it can happen.

464
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,670
So in my mind, this zero day is an indication that the system

465
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,969
failed

466
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:06,540
that

467
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,989
I, I'm now vulnerable for potentially hours, days, weeks,

468
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,819
it will be days for sure. I mean, you probably can't build a new version of chrome

469
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,829
in under a couple of days because they just,

470
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,089
they do a lot of testing and there's all kinds of stuff that happens from

471
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:27,130
back in the day when I helped firefox out when I was at Red Hat.

472
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,579
I think it was three days was the absolute minimum

473
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:33,729
Mozilla needed to push a new Firefox.

474
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,530
And that was like, that was people working 24 7.

475
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,109
-- I don't buy
-- that from Google because they

476
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:41,670
can massively parallelize testing of this thing.

477
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,640
They probably do and it still takes a long time.

478
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,160
Also. Chrome is their cash cow.

479
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:47,989
That is

480
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,560
what directly

481
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:52,770
accounts and well not accounts enables

482
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,099
-- a lot of their revenue. It
-- is the hose from which we all drink.

483
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:57,520
Yeah.

484
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,199
So I,

485
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,589
in my mind if I,

486
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:03,109
you know, if it was vulnerable for minutes, sure.

487
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:05,880
Cool. Hours. Ok. Acceptable days.

488
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,430
-- More than a week,
-- I mean, more than a week would be unacceptable.

489
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:13,839
-- But I think days is within the realm of, well, it's
-- been almost a week now.

490
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,439
Has it.

491
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,869
That's, see, that's, that's a long time.

492
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,689
Well, and the funny thing is because it doesn't have a CV or anything.

493
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:23,270
-- I can't, it's a pain in the butt to, to track this down. Right.
-- Right.

494
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,229
Which again is where, I mean, calling it, the Chrome Zero Day is ridiculous.

495
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,630
Yeah, I guess the chrome Zero day of whatever day it was actually zero date.

496
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,589
It's not a name. Right. It needs, it needs a CV ID.

497
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,290
Which of course, you know,

498
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,770
we've talked about in the couple episodes ago about why CVS busted.

499
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,479
-- But, well,
-- the Legacy CV system project is busted. CVE, I mean, the,

500
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,439
is the barcodes work fine. It's the entity of signing the barcodes.

501
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:49,219
That's not being so awesome.

502
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,150
Yeah, that's,

503
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:52,099
that's true. They're too slow,

504
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,550
too slow, too complicated, too, too much of a whole problem. Go

505
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,390
listen to the episode, go a couple of episodes back.

506
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,229
We, we take care of that.

507
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,729
But anyway, anyway,

508
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,219
I think, ok, so we've gone to the marvelously strange place again as usual. But

509
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:10,219
I think fundamentally the takeaway I have from all of

510
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:13,209
this stuff and everything going on is that firstly,

511
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:14,689
language is going to evolve.

512
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,459
So what a thing used to mean,

513
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:19,329
it doesn't matter if it doesn't mean that anymore. Like who cares?

514
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,780
-- It's just how it works.
-- It's

515
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:24,050
like the consensus mechanism for a language is

516
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,890
if X number of people believe something,

517
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,180
something, it means something.

518
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,099
Yeah, exactly.

519
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:33,189
Like a perfect example is in English, if I say the word shit, that is a swear word,

520
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,500
the direct French equivalent. Mad, no big deal, right?

521
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,270
It's just, and like the French have agreed that mad is not a big deal.

522
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,380
But in English, there's,

523
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,729
there are literally words I cannot say on this podcast

524
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:45,310
because Josh will bleep out the fact that I even mentioned

525
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,430
the substitute that we use for that word. He would bleep that out, right?

526
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,609
And, and so, and that,

527
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,959
-- and then there's other cultures where that word is is fine and
-- I, I do detest the way

528
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,069
that

529
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,079
society treats certain words

530
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,810
because I mean, so, so the challenge is the real reason I care is

531
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:05,550
when you use a naughty word on a podcast,

532
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,109
you have to mark it explicit or Apple dings you

533
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:13,670
and once you mark one episode explicit, the whole podcast is explicit for everyone

534
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,239
and you can never undo that.

535
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,689
-- So do you think we've
-- accidentally said a rude word in some foreign language?

536
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:19,869
Hopefully?

537
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,569
I mean,

538
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:22,599
now I kind of start slipping them in.

539
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,380
It's, it's apple, they're an American company.

540
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm sure they don't care at all about any other language except English

541
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,400
and let's face it.

542
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:33,839
You know what it really comes down to and, and I think this is,

543
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:36,410
this is kind of part of this conversation a little bit is

544
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,040
if you use naughty words in America,

545
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,050
there is,

546
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,630
there are certain groups that will come and complain,

547
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,979
right? And they're an extreme minority, but they're really loud and annoying.

548
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:51,079
-- Well, not just complain, they will pitch fork and burn you down. I mean,
-- right.

549
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,300
Like Janet Jackson Super Bowl,

550
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,689
I remember that that was a big

551
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,329
-- deal.
-- It was marvelous.

552
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,469
But you know what I mean?

553
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:02,609
And, and I think you, you kind of to a degree, like, I think with crypto,

554
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:05,479
we sort of had this where there was a small vocal group that was like,

555
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,650
no crypto means cryptography and

556
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,880
it was just like whatever nerds, shut up. We don't care and they lost, right?

557
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,310
And it's always intriguing to me how some of

558
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,260
these groups managed to kind of carry this,

559
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,780
this,

560
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:20,109
this outrage around with them

561
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,170
and managed to get it somewhere. Well, hacker and cracker. Yeah.

562
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,079
But like that one, that one,

563
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:25,314
no one cared.

564
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:29,594
No people still, oh, man. Check the comments on the hacker news. People still care.

565
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:34,015
I'm sure some people do, but I don't think it's, I don't think it's enough to matter,

566
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:34,484
you know.

567
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:36,875
No, clearly not. I mean that ship sailed, but

568
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:38,074
here's the other thing is

569
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,255
people need words to describe things

570
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,380
and they're going to

571
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:45,069
probably take a similar word and, or co

572
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,859
opt something.

573
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:48,709
But what's interesting to me is that sort of laziness factor of shorting it,

574
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:51,170
shortening it from Cryptocurrency to just crypto.

575
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:52,699
Is that a common thing?

576
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:52,989
I don't know,

577
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,319
maybe we need to find a linguist who tracks

578
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,800
this because we have to invent new words constantly.

579
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,829
I love the German approach to it,

580
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,569
like the German approach to it. Ok. This thing, this thing flies.

581
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:04,540
So what do we call it?

582
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:05,040
Fluky,

583
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,920
literally flying thing?

584
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,453
You know,

585
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,932
this animal, this white animal with a white stripe down its back. It smells bad.

586
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:11,713
What do we call it? Ok.

587
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:11,902
Stint

588
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:12,253
you

589
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:13,792
stinky animal.

590
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:14,692
Actually, you know what?

591
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:16,613
You know what my favorite is my,

592
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:21,453
my daughter is learning Japanese because she wants to speak Japanese and she is 12

593
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:25,203
and she told me the other day that the word for penguin,

594
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,642
they don't have a word for penguin.

595
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,593
They call it business goose.

596
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:29,562
I'm like,

597
00:25:29,723 --> 00:25:32,233
that is the greatest word ever.

598
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:33,453
Yeah. Like cobra chicken.

599
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:37,745
-- What's a cobra
-- chicken? It's a goose. If there's a famous meme, some,

600
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:40,385
you know, farmhand is like, doesn't speak English well, and he's like,

601
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:41,686
I do not like the cobra goose,

602
00:25:41,926 --> 00:25:43,036
the cobra goose.

603
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:44,306
No

604
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,215
chicken, you just said?

605
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:48,826
Yeah, I get that because geese are horrible creatures.

606
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,125
Well, I love that they are fantastically aggressive.

607
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:54,086
Um,

608
00:25:54,395 --> 00:25:56,385
and also I'm just learning, there's actually,

609
00:25:56,395 --> 00:25:58,115
I didn't realize how many different kinds of geese work

610
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,906
because I've really only ever known about Canada geese,

611
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:02,189
the meanest of them all.

612
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,489
But it turns out there's actually about a half dozen kinds of keys.

613
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:07,579
So,

614
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:08,469
anyway,

615
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,189
-- anyway, anyway, I think
-- so,

616
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:14,920
basically zero day means you probably need to pay attention to this vulnerability.

617
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,170
Yeah.

618
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,099
People are talking about it and,

619
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,020
and that is interesting in and of itself

620
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,239
because most vulnerabilities do not get talked about.

621
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,859
Right. Right. And I think the, the way I will, I will wrap this one all up is to say that

622
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:32,000
language evolves and you can stand your ground and be opposed to

623
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,800
some strange new use to a word which whatever it's your decision,

624
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,739
it doesn't really matter.

625
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,219
But I think fundamentally this is one of those things

626
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:42,359
that if you're obsessed over the definition of zero day,

627
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:46,819
you are changing the conversation in an unhelpful way because no one cares what

628
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:50,760
the technical definition of zero day is they just want their web browser fixed.

629
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,359
And I think that's what, what one of our challenges is

630
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,010
that challenges is, that's weird. Anyway,

631
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,949
as security people, it is easy to turn the conversation into something unhelpful.

632
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,900
And this

633
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,420
is one of those

634
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:08,439
where these people end up arguing technical correctness instead of actually

635
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:10,770
trying to help fix the problem. And I see this

636
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,569
so much.

637
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,430
Yeah, like no one cares, you know what they're going to remember.

638
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:18,099
They're gonna remember. You weren't helpful. That's what's going to happen.

639
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:22,270
Well, worse. It's not that you weren't helpful. You were actively getting in the way

640
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:23,579
that too.

641
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:26,869
All right, I'll let you close this one out. Kurt. Final thoughts.

642
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,540
Language evolves.

643
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,270
We should too.

644
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,839
That's it. No, no, no.

645
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:33,510
And, and, and, and so does and,

646
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,910
and I also realize things like hairstyles and clothing styles evolve and

647
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,689
there's some stuff I don't, I'll be honest, I don't understand dabbing.

648
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:42,640
I have an irrational hatred of dabbing and I

649
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,119
know it's because I'm old and out of touch.

650
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:46,800
Right.

651
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,140
So,

652
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:48,810
but at least I'm aware of it and I just

653
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:51,000
choose now not to care instead of getting annoyed.

654
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,400
And

655
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,569
maybe, and that would be my advice to people is, you know,

656
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,520
-- just let it
-- go and that's the right way.

657
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,030
That's right. Let it go.

658
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,630
Now we're going to get a copyright strike. But

659
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:03,930
now

660
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:05,469
it in, that's too good.

661
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,209
All right.

662
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,170
