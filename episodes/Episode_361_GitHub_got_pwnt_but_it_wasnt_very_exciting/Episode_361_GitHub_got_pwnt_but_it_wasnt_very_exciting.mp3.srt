Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,670
Kurt Siefried and my partner in occasionally being congested.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,340
Josh Bress.

3
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,059
-- I'm
-- not congested. Kurt claims he's sick. I think he sounds fine.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:16,610
Uh,

5
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:22,280
my, the inside of my si my nose and sinuses feels very unpleasant. That's fair.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,200
It happens. Anyway. Anyway, I'll, I'll give you a warning.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,520
So I had to bring my son to the orthodontist this morning

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,200
and I, we got there like probably 20 minutes too early because it was,

9
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,529
I drop my daughter off at school and then we drove to the Elect.

10
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:38,860
I'm like, it's a little early

11
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,349
and there's a Turkish coffee place around the corner.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,279
-- So I said, oh, let's go grab some coffee.
-- Wait, how's your son now? 16.

13
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:46,880
I guess he's allowed to drink coffee.

14
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:49,439
I don't care. Any kid can drink coffee. What do I care?

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:49,819
I just,

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,729
I love how like in North America we have this like taboo of kids drinking coffee,

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,880
but apparently in South America it's like, like,

18
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,180
because what else are they gonna drink?

19
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,709
I have no issue with it. I mean, if they can stomach it, they can drink it anyway.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,229
I'm like, so wired from this coffee.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,230
We'll see how it goes. Anyway. Anyway, we have a topic today.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:05,779
We

23
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:06,510
-- do
-- github,

24
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:07,709
github

25
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:09,510
-- desktop.
-- They had a little whoopsie.

26
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,629
They did, they did it happens. Do you wanna

27
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,949
-- fill everyone in on what's going on or you want me to,
-- uh, code signing certificate?

28
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,550
Got stolen? Oops.

29
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:20,080
Well, it, ok. That's, oh, come on.

30
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:20,519
I

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,790
just, I can't, your story is terrible and you should feel bad.

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, but I mean, that's the thing, right? People like

33
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,639
-- fundamentally here,
-- this is not how the storytelling process works. All right,

34
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:36,400
I will explain what happened in a way that is entertaining and informative,

35
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,839
which is the whole point of us being here, right?

36
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,029
We'll say maybe more entertainment than informative. But

37
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:43,330
so it

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,800
is currently February 1st and I think this was released, what, two or three days ago,

39
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,360
maybe, I don't remember.

40
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,330
There's a blog post, I'll put it in the show notes from

41
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:53,849
github

42
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,800
and they're saying on December 7th.

43
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:58,519
So it's been nearly a month since they detected

44
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,419
what's going on and this is how it works.

45
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,870
Like security incidents, take time to understand, to do proper analysis.

46
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,529
So that's fine.

47
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,910
On December 7th, they detected unauthorized access to a set of repositories,

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,490
it says,

49
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,529
and I think that's the thing that everyone's obsessed with

50
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:17,509
the code signing certificates that were taken from the repositories,

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
but it means someone access

52
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,850
repositories right inside, get a private repositories.

53
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:22,889
Ok?

54
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:27,300
-- So I'll just read it from the, like the blog post because
-- anyway, I'm telling a story.

55
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:27,789
You don't get

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,100
to,

57
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,559
you had your chance and you blew it.

58
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:32,339
So what it is though? And because we talked about this previously,

59
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,820
we just

60
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,059
OK.

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,500
And other depreciated github

62
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:39,429
owned organizations were cloned by a compromised personal

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,250
access token associated with a machine account.

64
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,759
I will bet you a dollar

65
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,660
that, that personal access token

66
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,270
was kept in the last pass.

67
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,479
-- It would not shock me if that's true
-- because that was the same time frame that

68
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,720
the CS A got the warning email from github

69
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,020
saying one of our devs

70
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:59,080
-- tokens was used to access.
-- Ah, now it's interesting

71
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,389
and that remember because, and I, and I posted that on Mastodon

72
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:04,960
and there was a couple other people in the industry who are like,

73
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,460
reasonably trustworthy who

74
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,919
said, yeah, I, I too have seen this email

75
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,750
and so what, what I really like about this is clearly github

76
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:16,389
is like monitoring their logs with some automated systems and going like,

77
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:18,460
like a whole bunch of personal access tokens

78
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,320
were suddenly used in weird ways and they,

79
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,880
they slammed the door on it

80
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,800
and, you know, rotated them and everything.

81
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:29,460
But I, I will bet you a dollar. This is related to the last pass incident.

82
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,289
I would not take that bet

83
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:37,210
it would not. So, so, ok, so here's the thing. It is very like we are humans.

84
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,149
We love finding patterns in the noise. It's what humans do and

85
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,470
I think last pass is a plausible explanation for this,

86
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,949
but it could also be just like some random service got popped,

87
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:50,809
you know.

88
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:57,089
But the thing is ok, le let's uh, game this, you generate an access token for a,

89
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,679
like a system account,

90
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,970
you feed it into the system account.

91
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,869
Right.

92
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,669
Well, how does that get compromised? It doesn't, what gets compromised?

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,020
You make a copy of that token into a secure,

94
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,509
I don't know, some sort of secure,

95
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,779
like password like storage system could be so that, you know,

96
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:18,000
in future when you have to kick the system over or restart it or whatever,

97
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,149
or reload it, you have the token,

98
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:20,459
right?

99
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,269
No, I, I get that. I understand.

100
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,750
And I feel like people who work at github

101
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,779
and run this stuff probably aren't, you know,

102
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,589
putting it in notepad on a public Samba share.

103
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,309
I, so I would be less concerned with that. I think

104
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:38,339
I have a I, I last pass is totally plausible. It could be that.

105
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,519
Well,

106
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,489
the other thing is from a fishing

107
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,140
perspective like phishing somebody's personal access token.

108
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,519
-- Like this is like a recovery password style.
-- This isn't, this isn't fishing.

109
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:49,160
II, I have no doubt this kind of thing isn't with

110
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,130
fishing. This is

111
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,600
generally speaking,

112
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,579
when you have an access token like this taken, it's usually a service was popped.

113
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,070
Like when,

114
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,570
what was the one that just got popped circle C I right where everyone had

115
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:04,230
to rotate all their tokens because circle C I was holding a bunch of tokens.

116
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:06,660
So you've got that situation,

117
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:09,989
you see people accidentally check this stuff into github

118
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,589
or some other repository.

119
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,279
And I mean, this is why

120
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,040
github tokens now start with what, like GHP or something.

121
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:19,420
And there's, there's projects that scan all the commits for entropy.

122
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:22,320
-- So because I used to get that all the time with those email commits with the message,
-- I

123
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,040
don't happen as much anymore.

124
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:27,510
So Truffle Hog used to be the service that well,

125
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,790
the the the application that did that things would look for entropy.

126
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,399
And actually during there was a time

127
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,440
and it's been a couple of years, but it was I,

128
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,760
I basically spent more time than I want to admit,

129
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:42,589
looking at various sources of entropy

130
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:48,119
to determine if you can use that to deter figure out like is a line of code

131
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,339
nefarious, right? Assuming that you've got someone trying to hide intent,

132
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,350
trying to obfuscate

133
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:54,940
it,

134
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,179
not, not, not

135
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,540
just obfuscation, but like what do you call it when you're hiding in plain sight,

136
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:02,220
kind of like stenography of sorts.

137
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,179
But anyway, you get the idea,

138
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:05,089
I

139
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,769
I analyzed many, many things and

140
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,630
there is a shocking amount of randomness in nearly

141
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,440
every line of code just because of all the

142
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,160
weird characters and stuff we use. So to trying to detect just randomness

143
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,140
is less effective than looking for known strings, like known links,

144
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,750
known character sets like github

145
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,619
-- adding GHP at the beginning is
-- perfect. Like begin certificate.

146
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:35,440
-- Yeah. Right. Exactly. Stuff like that 100% 100%
-- SSH dash RS a space.

147
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,359
But I mean, for real, like that's the benefit of that. It, it works super well.

148
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:44,500
Absolutely. Absolutely. So, anyway, anyway, let's kind of bring this back.

149
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,910
So github

150
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,420
detects unauthorized access to repositories and the

151
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:50,940
thing they focus on in these repositories is

152
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,119
it says a set which I assume means two maybe, I don't know what's a set.

153
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,649
Can you have more than two things in a set?

154
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:59,850
-- Well, it was Adam and desktop.
-- Well, yeah.

155
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,429
-- Right. Adam and you get have desktop and Adam is what their text editor, I think
-- it

156
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:04,750
is.

157
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,920
-- Yeah, it's a really nice text editor.
-- Uh You know, I never run, I use Vim whatever.

158
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:10,549
Oh, you know what I was miss, remember

159
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:13,630
it's Adam that ends as end of life's not desktop.

160
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:16,959
-- You
-- can't just say I remember now. So before we hit record,

161
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:20,500
Kurt says while we're discussing, oh, get up, desktop is going end of life.

162
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,709
And I was like, wait, what?

163
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,369
He's like, yeah, I told you that I'm like,

164
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,910
if you told me I wouldn't be acting surprised

165
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,269
or I don't remember which is equally possible.

166
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:32,359
And anyway, then we spent several minutes trying to find the end of life warning,

167
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:32,869
I guess.

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,149
And we didn't find it.

169
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,970
Yeah, I tried to find a life cycle statement for this and it's, I mean, well,

170
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,010
one thing that's

171
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,160
the, uh, the, the github

172
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:42,959
web page now says community supported

173
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,670
so it might have end of life in the sense of github

174
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,880
is no longer, like, fully funding it and maintaining it.

175
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,640
-- And it's kind of been passed to the community.
-- You mean, Adam?

176
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:52,160
No github

177
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,899
desktop?

178
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:53,519
Oh, github

179
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,579
desktop is community supported.

180
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,359
Yeah, I think I misremembered the github

181
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:01,630
thing where it didn't end of life or, and like die. It's just github

182
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,549
stepped back and gave it to the community.

183
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,760
Oh, that could be. That could be. But like if they got rid of

184
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,799
github desktop on windows, that's the only good way I know of really for like,

185
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,450
non

186
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,649
technical people.

187
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, I'm technical and I'm trying to use VS code with GIT and I'm just like,

188
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,399
I'm still stuck using github desktop. It's just so much easier.

189
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,640
Yeah. It's not the most pleasant experience

190
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:24,959
anyway. Anyway. All right.

191
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Shockingly

192
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,000
so. Ok.

193
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,850
So a set of encrypted code signing certificates

194
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:33,409
where I like how they say ex filtrated.

195
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:33,558
I

196
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,469
don't know why. That just amuses me.

197
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,520
And it's important to note that these certificates were encrypted,

198
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,090
like you need a password to decrypt them to use them.

199
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,260
And that's a big difference.

200
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,179
-- It
-- is

201
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,330
here is

202
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,890
the way I've been thinking about this because Kurt and I have chatted about it

203
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,460
for a couple of days and I've been thinking about it a lot and obviously

204
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,669
is doing the right thing. They're revoking

205
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,010
the certificates,

206
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:00,280
which is going to break all of the old versions of github

207
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,729
desktop and Adam

208
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:06,729
for Mac. It says my understanding is, is it just Mac and Windows?

209
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:08,440
It does affect Windows also? Ok.

210
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,450
Ok.

211
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,989
But they're going to revoke this, which is very painful for them,

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,250
but definitely the right thing to do because there have

213
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,450
been multiple incidents in the past where people have said,

214
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,530
oh, the certificates were stolen but they have a long password on them.

215
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,719
So we think it's fine and that's,

216
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,789
that's not the right thing to do.

217
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:29,309
I heard

218
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,159
that you can build a password cracking rig now with some sort of multi

219
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:35,059
core

220
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,289
CPU like device that has lots of cores. Now, I think they're called A A GP U

221
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,789
and, you know,

222
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,830
and you can crack these things really quick apparently or so I've been told.

223
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,659
Ok. So I,

224
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:50,000
I have another podcast called Hacker History, which I want to listen to,

225
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,909
but there's an episode I did.

226
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:54,229
It's been a couple of months now

227
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,510
and the, the, it's a friend of mine, his name is Robert and he does password cracking.

228
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,210
He like team.

229
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:03,909
Hashtag actually, I just talked to someone else on team hashtag uh not too long ago.

230
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,270
Um

231
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,400
I forget their name off the top of my head anyway,

232
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:10,030
it doesn't matter like these password cracking people now have rigs

233
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,710
that are doing like literally trillions of attempts a second.

234
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,599
It is mind

235
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,739
-- boggling how fast they can go.
-- Now, I remember seeing one at RS A like,

236
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,299
I don't know, 5, 10 years ago that was like a quad GP U thing.

237
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:25,489
And they were using, you know, cracking land,

238
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,890
landman ashes at like some absurd rate.

239
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,289
It's, it's completely insane.

240
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:35,630
I was just looking at the video cards now and I mean, uh 18,000 cores.

241
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,429
That's

242
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:38,729
like, that's a lot of cores.

243
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:40,309
I know that

244
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,450
a

245
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,210
big number.

246
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Thankfully now that Ethereum doesn't use video cards, you can actually buy them.

247
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:48,294
But that's another story. Anyway. Anyway. Ok.

248
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:50,635
So, so certificates are ex filtrated. Github

249
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:53,755
sees no nefarious activity so far to date

250
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:54,784
and they're

251
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:58,594
revoking this as an abundance of caution, revoking it on February 2nd,

252
00:10:58,604 --> 00:10:59,664
which is tomorrow for us.

253
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:01,164
It'll be in the past for everyone listening

254
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:02,155
and

255
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:06,330
that's great. Like, so there's, there's two, there's a couple of pieces to this.

256
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,979
I want to talk about.

257
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:11,380
First of all, github has done everything correct in this instance,

258
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,880
in terms of how they've responded to this incident,

259
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,549
they detected a problem a day later, they started there.

260
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,270
Well, they uh the, the event happens a day later, they figure it out,

261
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,960
they do their investigation and then they tell everyone in public what's going on,

262
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,599
like great, good job.

263
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,200
That is exactly what should happen.

264
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,094
-- Well,
-- and what's interesting they have to make a trade off.

265
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:33,294
So there's, uh, yeah, so of all the certificates stolen,

266
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:34,854
only three had not yet expired.

267
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,965
So there was a bunch of certificates stolen, but they'd all expired.

268
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,465
So, like, who cares?

269
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:39,724
One ex

270
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:43,375
one certificate expired in the interim on January 4th.

271
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:45,684
And that was a Windows code certificate,

272
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:49,655
another one, another Windows code signing certificate expires on, uh,

273
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:53,455
February 1st, which is, well today, but

274
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,005
there's a third certificate

275
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,815
for Apple signing

276
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,989
that only expires in 2027.

277
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,219
Ah, that's why I kept hearing about Apple. Ok. That makes sense.

278
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,950
That's the one that's more useful.

279
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:07,219
And so what's interesting is, so obviously the window ones were like,

280
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,669
kind of being planned to roll over anyway.

281
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,059
So, no big deal. Who cares?

282
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:14,669
-- But that Apple one, they have to revoke and essentially
-- it is a big deal though.

283
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,950
And here's the reason.

284
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:16,710
So,

285
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,869
and, and, and back me up on this. I'm pretty sure I'm right, but I might not be, but

286
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:24,270
if the certificate just expires, but it's not revoked,

287
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,869
you can still install the old versions, right?

288
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,919
Versus if it's revoked, you're like, no,

289
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,349
there's no way out now. Like we are not trusting this in any way.

290
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:36,349
But the thing is you wouldn't, the, the certificate is expired now,

291
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,010
so you can't sign new releases.

292
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,109
Well. Right. Right. Absolutely. So to an attacker, it has

293
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,710
marginal value.

294
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:47,780
-- Well, no value
-- really. But obviously the Apple one is, that's, that's

295
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,760
that's very useful to put it bluntly.

296
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,609
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a couple of pieces to this.

297
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:53,700
I think we should talk about.

298
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,229
First of all, there are many people that are saying github

299
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:59,320
should have been using an HS MA hardware security module.

300
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,119
That is

301
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,539
absolutely correct.

302
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,320
Who knew?

303
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:09,280
Well, so, so here's the way I would, I would, I want to talk about this though is well,

304
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,580
but the thing is this isn't like some like little software project.

305
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,679
This is number one. This is very widely used.

306
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,919
OK. That's also true of a lot of open source projects.

307
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:20,640
But I would also point out github,

308
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,869
I believe

309
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:26,200
has some money, probably a bit more money than the average open source project.

310
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,119
Yeah.

311
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:31,669
And more to the point more insultingly, they probably own an HSM.

312
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,010
Like I would assume they, or, or they like use an uh an Amazon, what is it K MS,

313
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,090
you know, key management service or whatever.

314
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:43,719
I, I would be shocked if they, well, the Microsoft owns them. Are they, do they run in

315
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,349
Azure? Do they run their own data centers? I don't, I don't know the answer to that.

316
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,719
-- I,
-- I don't know where github

317
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,309
is running. I, I think they were out of Amazon originally.

318
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,640
-- Uh who knows, regardless
-- if they're in a cloud,

319
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,369
there are cloud HSM solutions and if they're on Prem

320
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,200
buy an HSM,

321
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,049
-- they're actually
-- not that expensive anymore.

322
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:02,869
-- They cost about as much as a small car
-- when we were at Red Hat, it was 40 grand,

323
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,729
which for the,

324
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:09,849
the amount of savings we got when Red Hat got popped. Totally worth 40 grand.

325
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,849
-- Unquestionably.
-- Well, see, that's, that's exactly the thing.

326
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:13,090
It's like,

327
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:16,780
that's why I have a spare tire is because I don't want to have to spend my day DP

328
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:19,570
and around trying to, you know, get towed to a tire shop

329
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,049
and of course, it'll be Saturday at like 6 p.m. So they're all closed and

330
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,229
blah,

331
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:24,789
you know,

332
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:25,799
so I don't know, they just

333
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:26,219
spare

334
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:26,409
time,

335
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:27,890
step up. You've got,

336
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,559
we're off the rails.

337
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,030
Here's what I want to say.

338
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:37,359
So this is where I think the perception and reality clash sometimes,

339
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:40,140
especially over HS MS and signing certificates.

340
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,179
There is a point

341
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,780
where you should be using an HSM and github

342
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,260
is well past that point.

343
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:50,940
But if you are a small project or a small company, there is zero shame

344
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,049
in putting a password protected certificate somewhere.

345
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,539
I mean, maybe don't check it in, but that's another story. But you know what I mean?

346
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,130
There is nothing wrong with having a file versus an HSM

347
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,609
if you are small because the reality is HS MS

348
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,340
are expensive and they come with a lot of overhead,

349
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:08,640
they need care and feeding.

350
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,130
They're like having a child and so small organizations, small projects.

351
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,859
There's no shame in not having an HSM if you

352
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,919
a large organization and you have a security team and you have security budget.

353
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,200
You should have one of these because it saves you.

354
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:24,659
Like what just happened to

355
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,380
github would be a non-event if these certificates weren't stolen.

356
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,299
I'm just looking at this number of custom

357
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,080
number of symmetric

358
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:34,059
national calculations.

359
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,419
I mean, you're looking at base. Oh, good Lord.

360
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,929
Um You're looking at literally dollars per month

361
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,700
to use Amazon web services. KM si believe that.

362
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,030
So I, I think at this point

363
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,510
it's more, I would say it's, it's not even a cost issue anymore.

364
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,229
It's more of an organizational expertise issue.

365
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,760
And if you're

366
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,020
like a Corp or a major nonprofit with actual funding,

367
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,080
then this is kind of like having locks on the front door.

368
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,599
I

369
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:07,000
agree. And, and look, the thing is it's going to save you pain and suffering.

370
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,789
Right?

371
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:12,510
Well, it's like, you know what the problem is? A K MS or an HSM is like backups.

372
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,710
You don't need it until you need it until you need it. They're useless.

373
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,590
-- It's just an
-- expense

374
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,190
when you need it.

375
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:18,739
Holy

376
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:19,390
cow.

377
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,630
And I think that's

378
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:23,729
again an organization like github who, you know,

379
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:25,820
talks about being a steward of your data and

380
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,479
providing services with how many nines of up time,

381
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,609
right?

382
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,030
This is, I kind of worry now, what else are they not getting? Right, because this is

383
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,099
so,

384
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:36,869
so this is part of the, the thing we should talk about, right?

385
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,969
Because it's easy to say, oh, Github

386
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,159
should have done this bad, Github.

387
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,070
Bad, bad, bad.

388
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,469
But the reality is

389
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,000
any reasonably sized organization and Github has what?

390
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,609
Literally tens of 1000 employees.

391
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,989
I don't actually know how many it's, it's, I'm sure it's a lot.

392
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,580
But the point is any large organization has lots and lots of projects.

393
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,450
They have lots and lots of divisions

394
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,559
and the security teams do their best to keep track of this stuff.

395
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,479
but you just can't find it all

396
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,709
-- and it is extremely plausible. They didn't know.
-- Yeah, but github

397
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,709
desktop is a flagship product.

398
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,719
-- I would agree with that
-- github

399
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:12,390
desktop is literally like how people use github.

400
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,880
Like I've been recommending github desktop for half a decade.

401
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:19,388
Yeah. Well, because it's on windows, it's like the best way to use github,

402
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:22,167
-- but,
-- well, even on not windows, it's still the

403
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:22,798
point is

404
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:23,958
ignoring that.

405
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,279
The fact is

406
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,868
it wasn't done.

407
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,119
It is quite likely the security team either didn't know

408
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,780
or they had like a transition plan because you also

409
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,000
can't just like say use an HSM now and the

410
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,239
next day you're using it like this takes time.

411
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,290
I'm kind of wondering is the security team actually

412
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,449
responsible for that because in a lot of organizations,

413
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,479
they've kind of tried to

414
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,099
kind of offload that cost by saying, you know, DEV se

415
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,640
ops, which if done properly is good and well done.

416
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,326
But the problem I find with a lot of devs Se

417
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:55,105
ops is, well, the SEC part, like most Devs don't have a lot of SEC, you know,

418
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,406
and that's something we're working on at the CS A with the working group.

419
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,326
But like the Devs, I suspect the Devs would be like, well, we have a certificate,

420
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:02,336
we keep it in a github

421
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:04,456
repo, which is pretty safe because, like, let's face it.

422
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,676
Github repos if they're private are actually pretty damn

423
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,895
safe until somebody steals a personal access token.

424
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:12,871
Obviously on and on the flip side, like, if the security team not responsible for it,

425
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:14,391
why are they gonna go looking for more work?

426
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:16,192
I would say

427
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:19,751
it is the responsibility of a large organization,

428
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:22,991
security team to be the steward of, we'll say

429
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,171
encrypted

430
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:27,671
content like keys and certificates and things like that.

431
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:32,261
And I think that would be expected and my suspicion is they didn't know about these.

432
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:35,312
That is my strongest suspicion about this because like

433
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,859
at the, the large organizations I've talked to

434
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:41,449
and the obviously anchor is very small,

435
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,829
but like elastic and red hat were of reasonable size.

436
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:48,469
And there were security teams who handled certificates and code

437
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:51,260
signing certificates in the HS MS and all that stuff

438
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:52,290
because

439
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,599
there's no way you're going to teach a developer

440
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:00,000
how to properly handle a certificate or a key.

441
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,189
-- They're going to leak it because it's just hard to do.
-- Well,

442
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:04,319
well, I mean,

443
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,910
yeah,

444
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,459
and that's what drives me nuts about these code signing keys.

445
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:10,920
Is everybody pretends somehow like they're hard to get

446
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,270
or you have to steal them or whatever.

447
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,699
And it's like you can get a personal code signing certificate for 40 bucks a year.

448
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,560
Actually, I don't know how the apple ones work.

449
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,209
So for in the windows world it starts at

450
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:25,115
40 dollars us per year for code signing certificates.

451
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,556
And because that's what drives me nuts is everybody's like, oh,

452
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,696
you can steal these certificates and use them to sign malware.

453
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:30,166
And I'm like,

454
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:34,816
-- or hear me out, you can just spend 40 bucks a year and buy one.
-- Yeah. Right. Right.

455
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:37,465
I mean, malware authors are caught doing that all the time

456
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:40,786
where they just sign their stuff because it's not hard to do.

457
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:41,135
Well,

458
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:44,255
it's really easy to steal these keys from small hardware manufacturers because,

459
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,215
like, again, remember that my webcams

460
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:49,436
literally are, like, download this software from some IP address in China.

461
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:50,735
And I'm like, God,

462
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:51,582
uh,

463
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:54,972
I think we're getting close to banning that one. Kurt, you know.

464
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:57,312
Well, but it keeps happening. Right.

465
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,521
Like, it's, it's, that's the one thing I really,

466
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,001
I don't understand with windows is this, like, weird, like, on the one hand,

467
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,572
they have like, good drivers from Intel and those people,

468
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:09,612
but then they have like this just giant gap where as a windows, you know,

469
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:13,062
I have to download all this weird dodgy stuff from Lord knows where

470
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,432
to make hardware that I bought in a store.

471
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:19,552
Or, you know, online from a, a seemingly reputable

472
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,939
-- Amazon reseller. It's funny
-- you say this. So,

473
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:25,099
you know, I'm helping that robotics team. Right.

474
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:25,709
And,

475
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,989
and we needed cameras to put on the robot because we're

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,989
pretty much of cameras on the robot that we're doing.

477
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,640
Like object detection. It's really cool the work these kids are doing.

478
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,270
It's amazing.

479
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,229
And

480
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,250
so I go on Amazon and I find an industrial camera

481
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,900
because this is gonna get beat up a little bit.

482
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,099
So it needs like a little bit of oomph behind it. Right.

483
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,119
And so I find this nice industrial camera and it's not like, it's 50 bucks,

484
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,540
nothing big, but we need five.

485
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,420
So, like, we need a lot of

486
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,709
and

487
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,689
yeah, well, whatever, it's fine.

488
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,410
So

489
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:57,849
we get the cameras and the kids open the box and there's like a, a URL that's like,

490
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,290
download drivers here and they go to the URL

491
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,260
and it's someone's like a Google Drive folder.

492
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:07,665
I'm like, do not download anything in that folder. Like we will not use any of this.

493
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:11,795
My favorite is when it goes to, what's the one from the new Zealand guy?

494
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:12,834
Uh, meta.

495
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:13,005
Oh,

496
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:14,834
mega download. You mean mega download.

497
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:16,074
Yeah, that's the one that's my favorite when I,

498
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,724
when I had to get drivers once and they were,

499
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,275
they, it went to Omega and I'm like, uh,

500
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:22,694
well, now,

501
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,185
and I check it through virus total and it seems clean.

502
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:26,744
Right. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair.

503
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:30,275
Anyway, now, for us though, the cameras work flawlessly on Linux.

504
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,704
They're running on a Raspberry Pi because we have a

505
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:35,344
12 volt battery powering a robot like we're not,

506
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:39,469
you're not running a PC. Here. It all works. But the point of all this is

507
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,920
the reason you sign this code is for like this reason.

508
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,709
So you're not distributing like random crap out

509
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,109
of random places and people are like,

510
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,469
who put this here? Did someone put this here?

511
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:51,640
And the certificate Glens will say a minimal

512
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,140
amount of credibility to the thing you're downloading.

513
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,790
-- I won't say
-- it's safe except that don't know the name of

514
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,959
the certificate to match up with the software from the vendor.

515
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:02,560
Well, but when you, when you run it, like Microsoft will say, oh,

516
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:06,760
this application is signed by the Microsoft Corporation or

517
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,260
yeah, and that's not the name of the Amazon reseller that sold me the camera.

518
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,880
Well, in your case, no, we know your software is like dodgy. That's obvious,

519
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,469
just like I'm sure there's other stuff.

520
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:18,959
But the point is if I have an executable and I'm expecting

521
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,329
it to be from github and the certificate says it's from github

522
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,949
theoretically, it's from github.

523
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:24,589
Well,

524
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,180
I think part of the problem is this works for websites

525
00:22:27,189 --> 00:22:30,709
because I tend to interact with websites repeatedly like walmart.com,

526
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,739
amazon.com, td.com, whatever, right?

527
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,489
I go multiple times.

528
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,310
I don't install my software that often.

529
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:37,579
That's right. You don't

530
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,140
but the point is it doesn't matter, whatever, this is hard. I mean, it,

531
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:42,359
ah,

532
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,130
-- oh, my goodness.
-- I, anyways back to the code signing thing is that so, I think github

533
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,239
made reasonable tradeoffs.

534
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,380
I would have kind of preferred that they expire,

535
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,969
they revoke the certificate rather sooner rather than later.

536
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:53,989
But at the same time,

537
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,689
they wanted to give people a window of opportunity

538
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:57,280
to upgrade the software so that they have that like

539
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,199
seamless kind of upgrade experience and don't have like this

540
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,660
basically where it slams into a wall,

541
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,270
comes to a screeching halt and they have to like manually reinstall it.

542
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,160
Well, you also have to warn people.

543
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,170
You can't like it's if,

544
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,619
if the certificates were just revoked one day and there was no message from github,

545
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:14,890
what would you think, Kurt,

546
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,239
-- they got compromised like they did.
-- I would expect

547
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,930
a devastating compromise though.

548
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,609
Right. I would,

549
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,959
I would not expect it to be minor anyway. Ok.

550
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:28,319
Before we run ourselves out of time,

551
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:32,550
I have one other point of this whole story I want to touch on and that is that

552
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,650
Attackers took

553
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:38,219
the code repositories that were private repositories

554
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:40,609
and no one gives two craps about that.

555
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:44,270
-- They're open source projects.
-- But the, the stuff they took wasn't open though.

556
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,079
Right. Well, but by definition, every everything running in the github

557
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,449
desktop is from

558
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:55,510
-- github.com/desktop,
-- except something taken was from a private repositories.

559
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,369
Hopefully it was just certificates and stuff

560
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,459
Well, I don't know what it is, but here,

561
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:02,609
here's the point of that though is no one's making a big deal about it.

562
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:05,650
And that makes me happy because I think a decade ago

563
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:09,619
if someone stole private repositories, everyone would be making a huge deal about,

564
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,689
oh, trade secrets.

565
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,770
And someone took your private repositories and they

566
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,300
might have secret source code and this,

567
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,109
that or another.

568
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,660
And I feel like we've reached a point in,

569
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,880
in the universe

570
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,959
where no one cares if someone steals your source code anymore.

571
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:25,839
Because I think we, we're starting to recognize, like the source code

572
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,520
has no value.

573
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,640
It's the people.

574
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,560
It's like you always, you always tell me if,

575
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,920
if someone gave me all of the aws source code,

576
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,910
I could do nothing with it and I agree with that.

577
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,239
Well, and especially this

578
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:40,635
github desktop is an open source software. Like it's

579
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:42,555
-- right.
-- Right. It's, it's open.

580
00:24:43,285 --> 00:24:44,515
But like, here's the thing, even,

581
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,035
even if the Windows source code was leaked and

582
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:49,194
I know it's been leaked at least once again.

583
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:52,834
But you know what I mean? Like, there's no value in that. It, it's, what was it?

584
00:24:52,844 --> 00:24:54,415
The, the, the Russian is it

585
00:24:54,515 --> 00:24:56,234
Yandex? It's called the Russian Google

586
00:24:56,805 --> 00:24:57,145
Yandex. Yeah,

587
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:58,964
Yandex. It's a 40 some gig repo.

588
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,180
-- Yeah,
-- there's like

589
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:00,630
two

590
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:00,819
years

591
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,839
old. No one cares.

592
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:02,020
Well,

593
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,260
actually one thing that somebody did a bit

594
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,689
of analysis that was kind of interesting was

595
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,810
how do they rank web pages and there was actually,

596
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,010
I, I would not have guessed this number. There's about 12,000 or 1200

597
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,969
signals they used to rank a web page. So that was kind of interesting actually. So

598
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,310
I imagine, um,

599
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,750
now this and this is one of those things

600
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,449
where like this is actually quite useful for Attackers

601
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,969
like seo people to kind of

602
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,219
help bump it.

603
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:30,510
But it's, it's not like the kind of attack that where you're gonna like hijack and E

604
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,569
or put something in your web page that dam it's at the front of the

605
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,540
pack.

606
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,390
And that's, I think that's one thing.

607
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,849
It's, it's funny because this is coming, um, this is, uh,

608
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:41,250
happening with the chat GP T and A I stuff is

609
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:41,859
like,

610
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:43,729
how do we notice these attacks where it's kind of

611
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:46,949
like I dial up a percentage point of car accidents.

612
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,540
Like, would we even notice that?

613
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,550
Or I dial down a percentage?

614
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,540
I make like the banking system a half percent less efficient.

615
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,300
Like there's a real cost to that. But is anybody even gonna notice it?

616
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,859
-- I, I
-- mean,

617
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:00,540
probably not something like that and even I think

618
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,910
knowing how a search engine picks their ordering or,

619
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,810
or, or cataloging or whatever it is,

620
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,500
like there's seo companies you can talk to

621
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,579
that, they've reverse engineered a lot of this stuff because

622
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:12,000
-- in fact,
-- they do

623
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,300
testing and whatnot.

624
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,339
And every time Google reorders their search, like what is it roughly every summer

625
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,420
there's like this giant apocalypse and they have to like re, you know,

626
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:21,939
it's a cat and mouse game like

627
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,260
it, they, they, they figure it out and I think that's,

628
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:27,439
that's what happens a lot.

629
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:29,300
I think in many of these instances is we used

630
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,770
to think of source code as somehow special in secret.

631
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,489
And I think

632
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,500
the world has gotten so good at reverse engineering,

633
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,550
-- whatever it is you're doing well on
-- fuzzing.

634
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,589
Even you don't even have to reverse engineer anymore.

635
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,060
You just like run American fuzzy

636
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:44,369
up and like out pops a buffer overflow in about a couple of hours.

637
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,640
Like no, I mean,

638
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,380
it's not that easy but it's,

639
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,010
it's not that hard either.

640
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,750
Well, and actually, I mean, so one of my favorite examples of that is

641
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:53,780
there are

642
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:59,060
this just came out so well, I'll start though Mario 64 was

643
00:26:59,650 --> 00:26:59,869
decom

644
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,709
into C

645
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,910
so you can take, they have,

646
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,250
they have Mario 64 C code that if you compile it with the correct version of GCC,

647
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,650
which they use GCC to compile Mario 64 back in the day.

648
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:15,839
If you compile Mario 64 you literally get the same

649
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,920
ram bite for bite,

650
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,550
meaning it is literally exactly the same

651
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,819
OK. Bite for bite. That's impressive.

652
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,859
-- I know.
-- Right.

653
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,380
See this is why we need reproducible builds is for old video games.

654
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:27,839
Well, abs,

655
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,199
no, now here's the thing though.

656
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,939
So people are now taking the source code and they're fixing bugs

657
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,000
like

658
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:38,560
they found, if you just, if you just build Mario 64 with optimism

659
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:42,405
on, they build it with dash 00 at the time because the compiler was so new,

660
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:43,525
they're worried about bugs.

661
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:45,704
But if you just build it with optimizations,

662
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:48,694
you drastically increase the frame rate of the game just

663
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,204
like it's hilarious

664
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:50,885
anyway.

665
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:52,685
And they just did this for the legend of Zelda

666
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:55,194
linked to the past where they now have C code.

667
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:56,765
-- Oh,
-- did they fix the graveyard bug?

668
00:27:56,954 --> 00:27:57,525
Did they? What?

669
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:01,045
Sorry, Legend of Zelda linked to the bat. What's the original one on the,

670
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:02,930
on the cartridge? From the,

671
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,130
-- the legend
-- of Zelda?

672
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:06,770
The legend of Zelda?

673
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,160
-- There's, there's been so many I can't which
-- graveyard bug

674
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,589
with all the ghosts and then the whistle that one.

675
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,500
But you need that bug so you can cause arbitrary code execution to,

676
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:23,489
to beat the game in like seven minutes or whatever anyway. Anyway. OK. All right.

677
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,750
Let's wrap this one all up now. So like

678
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,020
github, I guess

679
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,839
we'll say a bad thing happened.

680
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:32,500
I won't say they, they didn't do anything wrong, right? I think this just happened.

681
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,489
I think there's a,

682
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:35,410
an even worse problem here, which is

683
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:39,729
why the heck is that code signing certificate valid through many, many years? Like

684
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,640
this is one thing that lets encrypt, for example,

685
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,770
has fixed is you get three month certificates.

686
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,930
So the impact of a compromise certificate

687
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,869
is just drastically reduced. Because remember

688
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,979
when web service certificates they used to,

689
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:54,630
you could buy them and they would last for years, multiple years.

690
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,670
And then the web browsers have pushed back on that now. And you're about max one year

691
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,489
with like, let's encrypting it properly at three months

692
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,930
and I would pause it that well,

693
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:06,469
this is kind of is essentially it's enforced key rotation.

694
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,209
And I think there would be some real value in like

695
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:11,839
these code signing certificates only lasting a year or two,

696
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:12,400
not

697
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,880
-- seven years or 10 years.
-- This is, this is Apple's fault.

698
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,439
Then I'm going to blame Apple.

699
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,050
Well, yeah,

700
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,739
they could just arbitrarily say we'll only

701
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,290
accept one year certificates from now on.

702
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:25,910
And that, that's what they should do. I don't know, I don't know exactly how co

703
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,800
funding works in the Apple Ecosystem. I don't know how they,

704
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,430
if github

705
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,310
picked that date or the Apple Ecosystem tools

706
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,939
just generated that date or what happened.

707
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:34,829
But fundamentally,

708
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,160
I'll blame Apple for that, not github.

709
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,609
So that's fine.

710
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,189
And I would expect

711
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,819
any certificate,

712
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:44,079
user will create a certificate that is the maximum

713
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:45,810
amount of time they are allowed to create.

714
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:48,329
Well, it depends if you're paying for it because you're paying for it by the year.

715
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:49,109
Typically,

716
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,020
like when we did it, we did one year certificates because it's just simpler.

717
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:56,089
Um But also it depends on how you're doing it because for example,

718
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:59,670
you can just do it through the apple interface where they just sort of magically

719
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,890
like you generate the keys in the web

720
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,890
interface, you know, developer.apple.com/whatever,

721
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,030
you know,

722
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,150
create the keys, you know,

723
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,260
shove it into your test flight and then shove it into your well

724
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:13,900
into the cue of like can you pretty please let us release this?

725
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:15,989
And they're like, no because blah

726
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,260
and I'm like it doesn't do that like it doesn't

727
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,410
anyway. Alright, whatever dragging on, we're dragging on. Alright.

728
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,729
So all in all I think I'll give github

729
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,250
props for detecting this in a day,

730
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:28,349
which is great

731
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,550
then doing a proper investigation for expiring their certificates. You know,

732
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,680
you know, I wonder if this is what triggered them, looking at the rest of them.

733
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,459
So looking at the timeline, I actually think it's the other way around.

734
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:44,069
I suspect they noticed this because they say this happened December 6th, right?

735
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,530
-- That is what is in their blog. Yes.
-- Hi, Kurt Siefried.

736
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,770
We're writing to let you know that we

737
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,569
observe suspicious activity that suggests a threat actor accessed

738
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:54,369
your github organization through a compromised organization member or

739
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,410
outside collaborator account and downloaded private repository metadata.

740
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,520
We are in the process of notifying all identified

741
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,550
affected users and organizations and revoking associated credentials.

742
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:03,540
What happened?

743
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:05,050
We do not believe the attacker obtained these

744
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,050
tokens via compromise of github or its systems

745
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,290
because the tokens in question are not stored

746
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,209
by github in their original usable formats.

747
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:11,989
At this time,

748
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,150
evidence suggests that the threat actors use compromised organizational member

749
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,170
and or outside collaborator accounts to access the following organizations.

750
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,150
Cloud security line syndrome.

751
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:20,260
Anyways.

752
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,030
And it's one of our Debs Wednesday, December 7th 1:53 p.m. that email from github

753
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,670
support.

754
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,109
So here's my suspicion, they noticed their personal access

755
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:29,319
to

756
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:29,800
and

757
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:32,589
accessing their private repos and went,

758
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,060
what the heck did this happen anywhere else?

759
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,550
-- And then it
-- did,

760
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:37,800
that feels related

761
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:42,489
because it's uncanny. But I would also say if they detected this on the sixth

762
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:44,369
and they mailed you on the seventh,

763
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:48,750
-- that is a top notch security organization right there.
-- This is why you use github.

764
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,319
Their stuff works

765
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,089
-- and they seem to care about security.
-- Yeah. No, absolutely.

766
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:56,689
And I mean, look, we, we talked to what, Jill a couple of weeks ago, right? Like github

767
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:59,209
security organization is, is the real deal.

768
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:04,290
-- Well, it better because, like, I
-- suppose they host the World software. Like,

769
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:06,709
I shouldn't be surprised.

770
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,449
So, anyway. All right. All right, I'm gonna call this one.

771
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:12,709
I feel like it's interesting to talk about if you're a small org,

772
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:15,880
don't feel bad if you're storing certificates and you get up repo.

773
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,489
But if you're a big organization, holy crap,

774
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,260
-- get an HSM
-- or just rent one online for like, 11 bucks a month.

775
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,640
That's what I mean, same thing. Like, you don't, don't own things anymore.

776
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,319
It's fine. Just rent it. Um, actually fun fact.

777
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:31,560
I have an HSM in a box in my basement from back in the Red Hat

778
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:35,030
-- days when they gave me one for testing
-- one of the PC R card ones.

779
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,040
Yes, it is.

780
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,439
And it's got all the black whatever that like,

781
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:41,239
like resin coating is over all of the chips.

782
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,260
The potting compound,

783
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,900
it weighs a ton. It probably weighs more than a kilogram

784
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:47,849
on

785
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:51,319
one card anyway. All right. All right. That's it. I'm calling it. Thank you, Kurt.
