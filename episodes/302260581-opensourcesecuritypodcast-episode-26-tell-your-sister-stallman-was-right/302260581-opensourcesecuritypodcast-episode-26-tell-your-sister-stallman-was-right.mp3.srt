Hello and welcome to episode 26 of the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,439
Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:12,859
Kurt.

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,500
This is the greatest week of the, well, maybe the first or second,

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,709
greatest week of the year.

5
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,059
Are you familiar what's going on right now as we speak?

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:21,860
Uh

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:22,850
You mean the snow outside?

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,139
Uh

9
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,579
No, it's actually raining here. It snowed.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,420
So funny, it snowed last night and then I went and shoveled and now it's raining.

11
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,620
So I'm actually glad I shoveled before it rained because

12
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:34,779
I'm sure uh rain soaked snow is no doubt,

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,840
very, very light.

14
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:36,290
But no,

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,819
right now there's a thing called awesome games done Quick Happening,

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,650
which is a speed running marathon for video games.

17
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:49,865
And these guys are like video game ninjas when you watch them play.

18
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:53,564
But the relevance to us being a security podcast

19
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:56,794
is the fact that most of these speed runs

20
00:00:56,935 --> 00:00:59,485
these guys hack the games.

21
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:03,994
And the reason they can get these insane times is they

22
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:07,035
find out what the exploits are in these video games.

23
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:09,235
They, they exercise them

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,220
and then they end up being able to beat a game and, you know,

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,669
maybe five minutes instead of the four hours, it would take a normal human being to do

26
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:21,620
and it is amazing to watch. But I thought it would be really cool to talk about it today

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,199
just because this is an example where people can actually

28
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,260
see hacking in action versus something we just talk about.

29
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,150
So to clarify, I'm assuming, uh, because I've seen speed runs before and,

30
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:37,349
uh, so these are speed runs where they're allowed to essentially

31
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:42,769
uh manipulate the game in any way that they can use sort of the normal controls.

32
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,400
Like I'm assuming they're not allowed to like, use a hex editor

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,809
by the binary or something.

34
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,930
So they don't modify the game and generally speaking, they,

35
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,010
they play the games on the original system, however.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,500
Right. Right. So the original system changes things quite a lot, obviously.

37
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,235
Yes, that's, I was assuming this was an emulator thing.

38
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:00,485
Emulators

39
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:02,724
are legally questionable

40
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:03,985
and so

41
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:08,684
they use real systems and, and they quite often play them on C RT S as well.

42
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,764
They don't use,

43
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:11,214
you know, L CDT vs,

44
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:11,445
you

45
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:12,964
have to otherwise the games look wrong.

46
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:13,195
Uh

47
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,595
Yeah, sure. We'll say that.

48
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,860
And in fact, there was one of the guys when I,

49
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:23,789
when I was watching was complaining about that the C RT is different than his L CDT vs.

50
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,880
So he was struggling with one of the game. But, but anyway,

51
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,889
so there, there's various rules and some runs are what they call glitch

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,380
less

53
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,429
where obviously you're dealing with.

54
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,630
I won't say

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,169
100% skilled because they still,

56
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,449
some games have like randomness and they've learned how

57
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,309
to manipulate the random number generator inside of it.

58
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,830
Or

59
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,190
they might have found,

60
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:49,289
you know, some bizarre way to play the game and like, like some insane ninja

61
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,089
but

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,960
-- essentially
-- some combination of power up items.

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,529
Right?

64
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:56,850
But, but when you say glitch list, that's kind of like, like no hacking,

65
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,190
we'll say is what glitch

66
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:58,899
really means.

67
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,130
-- And those are
-- like the pac Man thing where you can't like,

68
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,350
-- I think you what you get to the end and then the buffer overflows and you
-- can write

69
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,649
like level 255 right?

70
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,330
And then you, and that, I mean,

71
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:12,279
that's a great example of kind of one of the things that happens here.

72
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:12,970
And so,

73
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,580
II, I guess the, the reason I wanted to bring this up is, is again, like I said,

74
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,479
this is something you watch these guys play.

75
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,320
And apart from the awe of amazing video game players,

76
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,460
this is an example where you can see

77
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:29,649
real hacking, right?

78
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,910
Is these guys do something and they will manipulate the game in a strange way.

79
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,509
And it's actually really funny to listen to

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,550
them sometimes because coming from a security background is

81
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,649
they'll talk about doing something where they'll get like so many of an item

82
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,630
and it's like, that's an integer overflow. Right.

83
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,929
That's what I'm thinking and, you know, they have their own lingo for it all or,

84
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,389
or they'll do something that's clearly a buffer overflow.

85
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:53,529
Or they're, you know, they're, they're relying on an out of bounds reader,

86
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,589
right to do something.

87
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,089
And it's,

88
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,889
it's hilarious because

89
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,490
they're doing the things we talk about and

90
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,649
we understand and we defend against except it's,

91
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,529
it's a video game and, and a lot of them don't really understand what's happening.

92
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,509
They just learned if they do this particular sequence of actions,

93
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,740
you know, they can jump over that wall or go through that building or something.

94
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,449
And it's, it's hilarious man. It's crazy.

95
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,959
Well, I remember when I was younger playing uh oh boy,

96
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,320
this goes back what are called door games on B BS S for those

97
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,470
of you that don't remember this B BS S were bulletin board systems.

98
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,549
So the idea was you would dial into a computer

99
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,829
and then you could like download files or upload files or

100
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:34,339
play games on the computer, right? And some of these games were multiplayer.

101
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,670
And I remember this one, it was like a space Empire game.

102
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:37,570
It

103
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:37,820
was,

104
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,950
there was some weird logic in essentially the items

105
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,019
pricing.

106
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:47,329
And so basically the deal was as you,

107
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,910
it wasn't linear pricing,

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,850
it was like algorithm like logarithmic pricing or something stupid.

109
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,850
So essentially if you could pick an item and essentially get a monopoly on the item

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,480
um by just creating like

111
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,100
millions of these things.

112
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:02,920
You could like essentially corner the market on

113
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,640
it even if it wasn't a very important item

114
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:08,000
and then you could sell it back, like to the game, not to other players,

115
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,940
but like to the game,

116
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:12,489
you could sell it back and just, and get huge amounts of money, right.

117
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,140
So I would basically pick some random item that nobody cares about

118
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:19,480
and, and like turn my whole economy into producing that one item. Right?

119
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,579
And then I would be super weak, super weak, super weak for like,

120
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,579
you know, the 1st 90% of the game, which would take weeks

121
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,399
and then all of a sudden I would sell all these items overnight and like,

122
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,359
15 minutes later by like the biggest army possible and then

123
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:36,130
just go on a rampage and people actually got basically banned,

124
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,040
right? Because it's not fun the way I play it, right.

125
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:39,369
Because I would just do nothing for a couple of

126
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,320
weeks and then just rampage and win the game,

127
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:41,760
you know.

128
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:44,690
So, yeah, there's a lot of these things where you can just, uh,

129
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,799
exploit game logic or whatever.

130
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,040
It, it's completely crazy

131
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,320
and it's awesome.

132
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,950
Yeah, I know. Well, if you want to win, it's awesome.

133
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,720
If you, if you're looking for game play ability, it's like, you know,

134
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,519
it always reminds me of people when, when you play risk with friends

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
and if you're playing for fun, it's fun.

136
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,799
But if you're playing for fun, but one person is playing to win.

137
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:05,350
It just, it's a horrible game,

138
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,070
-- dude.
-- You never play risk for fun, right? You play to win

139
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:12,720
and because you hate your friends, those are the only two reasons.

140
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:18,510
Well, not only that, I mean, there are even examples of board games.

141
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,670
I'm, I'm trying to think of one off the top of my head

142
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:21,480
where

143
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,709
the rules can be broken

144
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:26,790
and if you, if you play it correctly,

145
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:30,790
you can essentially cause the game to kind of self destruct on itself.

146
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,829
Well, and that's one thing I like is, you know,

147
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,640
the better games like these sort of newer Cooper

148
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,369
games where essentially everybody wins or everybody loses type deal.

149
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:39,869
You know,

150
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,480
I

151
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,929
do to kind of avoid that,

152
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,809
-- that you can still hate your friends though. Trust me.
-- Well,

153
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:45,769
-- you
-- can still

154
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:45,929
throw

155
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:46,200
monkey

156
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,480
wrench

157
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,890
-- for this
-- but uh no back to the video games. Yeah, I mean, so that's interesting.

158
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:54,010
So you're saying that these people are essentially,

159
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:56,450
there's the glitching speed runs where it's what

160
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,950
I think of as a traditional speed run.

161
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,420
Like you just

162
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,700
like Super Mario being a great example, right?

163
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,529
You learn the pathing of the work pipes and which are the easy levels

164
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,950
for an expert player to like get through as quick as possible.

165
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:11,959
So if these speed runners man, if, if they can do the but you know,

166
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,380
even so you say this but even on the Super Mario Brothers speed run.

167
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,779
They've found a glitch. They use

168
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:22,510
to essentially get themselves to the end faster.

169
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,390
And, and what it is is it comes in handy on,

170
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:31,070
I, I think 41 is probably the biggest level, but they also use it in the last castle is

171
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,290
essentially what happens is the way Super Mario Brothers works is

172
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,119
you have like various,

173
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,230
I think they call them zones

174
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,670
where essentially like when there's a, there's gonna be uh like,

175
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,929
let's say on level 4-2

176
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,570
there's the little bean stalk that'll bring you up

177
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,170
to the warp zone to go to level eight.

178
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,250
Well,

179
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,869
if you can get to the pipe after the beanstalk and jump

180
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,700
in it before it loads whatever the zone is for the pipe,

181
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,489
you can go in,

182
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,730
you actually end up where the beal

183
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,709
brings you instead because

184
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,000
they've essentially,

185
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,070
you know, abused the mechanics of the game to get themselves to do something faster.

186
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,390
And in fact, this is how

187
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,130
there's something called the minus world in Super Mario Brothers.

188
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,179
And this is how you get to the minus world essentially is

189
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,739
you go into the warp zone area before it loads the warp zone

190
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:19,700
zone if that makes sense, which it doesn't.

191
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:23,339
And then by going down the pipe, the game like has no freaking clue what to do.

192
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,070
And so the world minus one

193
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,350
is essentially just like random memory that it turns into a world.

194
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,250
And that's why there's no end because you go in the

195
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,710
pipe and the games like I don't know what to do.

196
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,630
Go back to the beginning

197
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,570
which yeah, it's crazy. In fact, there is a youtube video I found that goes into

198
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,619
great detail explaining exactly why this happens

199
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:48,619
in Super Mario Brothers, which is that,

200
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,520
that is a weird way of loading the levels like it doesn't pause or something.

201
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:52,900
It just,

202
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:56,950
-- that's weird.
-- But you got to remember too, man. This is what like 1982?

203
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:57,729
It's

204
00:08:58,419 --> 00:08:58,479
amazing

205
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,190
when you look at Super Mario, right?

206
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,229
Uh The original Super Mario, bros if memory serves was

207
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,619
like seven people,

208
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,109
like seven programs,

209
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,429
artists and developers.

210
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,409
-- I mean,
-- it's crazy to think about.

211
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah, like it, it and, and now a AAA title is like

212
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,020
a

213
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,340
gazillion people.

214
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,489
Seriously, it's completely crazy how many people it takes to make a video game now.

215
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,429
But well, not only that these game, the Super Mario Brothers is what? Like like

216
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,419
-- 10-K of code. I mean, it's
-- crazy.

217
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,390
Yeah, they did all sorts of tricks to like the, the, the what is it?

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,659
The clouds and the blocks are the same bit map, just

219
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:35,570
-- the
-- clouds and the bushes are the same.

220
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,950
And well, not only that the,

221
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:41,150
the sound of getting the,

222
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,179
I think it's the one up mushroom

223
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:50,159
is the same sound as when you get the end goal posts just sped up like 200 times.

224
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,809
So they, they obviously abuse reuse significantly.

225
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,159
In fact, there's, there's an Atari 2600 game.

226
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:59,130
It's uh yars' revenge. I think it is

227
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:03,099
where all the sound effects in the game is just they,

228
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:06,780
they found random areas in memory that made cool sounds.

229
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:09,359
And so that's what they played because they right,

230
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,539
they didn't have room for sound effects.

231
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:16,219
So they just played random memory locations that happened to sound like something.

232
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,419
It's a solution.

233
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,770
It's crazy, man. I mean, it's amazing.

234
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,000
But, but I guess this is part of it too is you look at

235
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,109
the way the world of computing used to work,

236
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:30,849
the whole Y2K thing. Well, it was a simpler time, right. They shortcuts were taken.

237
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:34,349
You didn't always do things because it was the right way. You do

238
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,674
something because it got the job done.

239
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:39,775
Well, this is one thing people often forget. Right. If you,

240
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:44,455
if you take a risk and ship now, but take some sort of risk that might hurt you later,

241
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:45,955
it doesn't, you know, at least you ship.

242
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:48,434
Whereas if you don't take that risk and you don't ship, you're,

243
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,354
you're definitely up the creek.

244
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:50,955
Right.

245
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,039
Yes. You know, that's the reality of it

246
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:56,359
that, I mean, yeah, that's, that's exactly right. And obviously

247
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,770
that's how a lot of these games end up in this situation that they're in where

248
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,890
there are problems found, they know there's bugs

249
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,130
and they don't care. And in so in the old games,

250
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:09,530
no one no one gives a r, right.

251
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,479
Because look, you can make Mario jump through a wall and nobody really cares.

252
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:16,130
No one gets hurt. And now you have an awesome bug

253
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,880
that the speed runners are going to do crazy things with.

254
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:23,020
But games today are becoming a huge industry

255
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,440
and there's some, there's certain parallels with the,

256
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,809
the whole just world of it and, and computer security here I think is

257
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:35,770
you, look, now there's games where you use real money to buy things inside the game.

258
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,179
Right.

259
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:37,030
And so

260
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:39,750
-- Facebook game industry.
-- Right.

261
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,440
-- Right. Right.
-- Let's face it. Right. I

262
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,830
mean, and if you can cheat at those games

263
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,250
now there's real money at stake.

264
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,650
It's not just doing something cool with the character in the game.

265
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:53,229
It's the fact that the company that made the game doesn't get all of

266
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:57,690
their money because players can get something for free that they aren't supposed to

267
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,739
-- or rip other characters
-- off. But, yeah, that, I mean, that,

268
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,739
-- what was
-- it? Oh, yeah. The world of war thing, uh, arm tr,

269
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know what armor trimming is.

270
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,429
So, the idea was the armor things look stupid.

271
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,330
And so people would offer to trim armor and

272
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,119
the idea was that you would drop your armor,

273
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,880
they would pick it up, they would trim the armor and they would give it back to you.

274
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,549
Guess what happens?

275
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,309
Like

276
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,659
it's like, it's like my wallet cleaning service. Right.

277
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:26,200
-- You give me your wallet and I'll, I'll clean your wallet.
-- How do you fall for this?

278
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,590
This is obviously a scam.

279
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,960
I often wonder that. How do people fall for these things?

280
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:35,539
And, well, you know, like, what is it? The PT Barnum? You know, there's one born,

281
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:38,119
maybe, maybe, man.

282
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Oh my. That's,

283
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,989
that's completely crazy.

284
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:47,159
But, uh, so, and then, so you mentioned, so these glitching speed runs. So they,

285
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,020
I'm assuming that there's like, uh, some website or something where they trade or,

286
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,960
you know, kind of like a Wikipedia for these glitch.

287
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:56,380
There's these crazy communities actually where

288
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,179
these people work together to try to

289
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,909
understand what does a glitch mean and what can you do with it?

290
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,440
And

291
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,070
it's, it's surreal to read about some of this stuff and what they do.

292
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,250
I mean, like, so one of my favorite actually is

293
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,659
if you've ever played the original Legend of Zelda,

294
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:12,669
there is the, the graveyard

295
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,609
where there's these ghosts

296
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,010
that wander around, right?

297
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,869
And

298
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:19,520
now as you can imagine on these old games,

299
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,679
they had a static number of sprites that could be on the screen.

300
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,539
And obviously, they basically had a set array of sprites.

301
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,900
And

302
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:31,880
every time you touch a tombstone, another ghost appears, right?

303
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,260
Well,

304
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,679
basically you touch the tombstone enough times you get enough ghost on the screen

305
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,690
and now you filled up the number of available sprites that can be displayed

306
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:44,070
and the game is smart enough to not let you generate any more ghosts, right?

307
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,469
But you can play the whistle which makes a little uh tornado appear

308
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,400
and the game isn't smart enough to not show

309
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:54,080
the tornado or delete one of the other characters.

310
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,710
And so you end up essentially having an out of bounds, right?

311
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,130
A buffer overflow in this case,

312
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,929
and then you can cause execution to jump anywhere you want.

313
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,200
And so these guys have figured out how to essentially, you know,

314
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,679
set up the game prior to doing this.

315
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,559
So when the override happens,

316
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,335
you overwrite the right bit of memory that then jumps the game to the end credits,

317
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:16,544
which is considered

318
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:19,775
beating the game by the speed running rules, right?

319
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:20,554
So essentially, you know,

320
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:25,354
these guys have turned a buffer overflow into a game winning strategy.

321
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,994
So now it takes, you know, like seven minutes instead of two hours to beat the game,

322
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:30,474
which is, which is crazy.

323
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:33,840
Yeah, I remember the graveyard level. I really did not like that level.

324
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,880
It's not even the,

325
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,650
even the level you just have to walk around

326
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,309
screen or whatever you want to call it.

327
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:40,929
That was man, I

328
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,020
love that game

329
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,359
actually.

330
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:44,059
So funny enough,

331
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,099
the Zelda games are some of the most breakable games that they play probably because

332
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:51,070
they are, they're very complex games.

333
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,429
I mean, there's a lot of interlocking items and abilities and you know, they,

334
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,900
they were for their time like I remember

335
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,700
I got Nintendo thumb playing that damn thing.

336
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,900
-- Um You know, I had the dimple on my left thumb.
-- There you go. Awesome.

337
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:03,510
That

338
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:03,969
metro,

339
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:04,919
the

340
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,450
metro. So, actually funny enough you say Metroid

341
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,609
and at the end of the event, at

342
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:14,969
the end of a GDQ, which is the winter one, there's also a summer one called SGDQ.

343
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,599
Summer games done quick versus awesome games, done quick. Right.

344
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,330
They're all awesome though. I assure you.

345
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,359
So at the end

346
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,820
they play Metroid, Super Metroid

347
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:23,549
and

348
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,789
it's quite often a race where they'll have in, in this instance there's,

349
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,080
I think that today this week on, I think it's Sunday, maybe.

350
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,440
I think it's Sunday night or Saturday night. I forget which

351
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,179
there's gonna be four people

352
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:39,059
essentially racing through Super Metroid and in this case they're doing what's

353
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,900
called 100% where they're going to collect every single item and it,

354
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:43,739
it takes a while.

355
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,880
It's gonna take like, I, I think an hour or two

356
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,580
to complete

357
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,619
power up and every,

358
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:50,900
yeah, but they still do all these like crazy glitches and stuff where they,

359
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,140
they make jumps, you shouldn't be able to make and they,

360
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,200
they go around things and they, they do,

361
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:55,780
they, they,

362
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,270
there's all these bugs with Super Metroid for whatever

363
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,859
reason in the way the input works off the controller

364
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,770
and so they can like, you know how,

365
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,940
I don't know if you ever played Super Metroid but you can like,

366
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,940
build up speed and you get your super run boost thing.

367
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,039
I forget what it's even called.

368
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:10,179
But

369
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,359
so these guys have found a way you can tap

370
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,400
the run button in a certain frames on the screen

371
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,320
and

372
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,440
they can start running in like a third of the distance that you, right?

373
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,479
So you can obviously like,

374
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:26,919
it's amazing how broken these games can become when you like throw all the rules away

375
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,659
and this, but again, I'm gonna bring this back to security now is like,

376
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:32,440
this is how security works, right?

377
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,969
When the bad guys throw all the rules away,

378
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:37,419
the good guys,

379
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,559
what do you do?

380
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,719
Cause you, you couldn't even imagine a world where someone could do this.

381
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:43,940
And this is kind of like

382
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:48,320
when you can make Samus run in a third of the distance, normally,

383
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:52,875
the programmers and game designers never assumed that was possible.

384
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,684
And so the game becomes incredibly broken

385
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:59,395
when you uncover this, which is again, just like kind of hacking in the real world.

386
00:16:59,625 --> 00:16:59,974
Well, yeah,

387
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:01,965
I remember when you know the first cross site

388
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:04,055
scripting vulnerabilities came out and everybody was like,

389
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,125
oh that's, you know,

390
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:06,354
that's not so bad.

391
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:09,844
But oh wait, you know, online banking is a thing now that is kind of bad.

392
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:10,760
And you know,

393
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,050
now we have this endemic problem of cross site

394
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,930
scripting vulnerabilities in all software all the time everywhere.

395
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:16,839
You

396
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,410
know, you know, the other thing I'm always reminded of is

397
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:21,449
uh double free,

398
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,569
which

399
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,000
I if you're a AC programmer, you obviously have to male

400
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,630
your memory and make sure you check those returns.

401
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:29,729
And then

402
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:31,609
when you're done with it, you free it.

403
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,310
And there's a common security issue called double

404
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,489
free where you free the memory once and you

405
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,449
still have the pointer to the memory that is now freed and you free it again.

406
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:46,640
And GC uh GGCCG LIB C these days has some protections built in that.

407
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,180
Basically, if you try to double free, it figures out, hey, I've already freed. This

408
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,420
don't do that. Bad. Things can happen.

409
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,030
And I mean, I remember when double free was found, everyone was like, yeah.

410
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,790
Wow, what a silly bug don't do that.

411
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:01,209
And then solar designer one day figured out, you know, hey,

412
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:07,150
if I do some trickery here, I can essentially set up a fake memory structure.

413
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,599
So when it gets freed the wrong time now

414
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:14,750
we're overwriting whatever we want wherever we want in memory

415
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,069
and all of a sudden it's like, oh, crap, double free is a really big deal.

416
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:21,619
Yeah.

417
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,229
Well, it's like a lot of these things, you know, initially when these bugs come out,

418
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,189
it's like, oh, that's bad.

419
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:27,790
You can trigger a crash for sure, which, you know, it is not good.

420
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,530
But yeah, and then somebody figures out how to weaponize it easily.

421
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,189
Um, like my favorite was, um,

422
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,390
I forget which Microsoft vulnerability it was, but it was a one bite,

423
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,550
overflow,

424
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:39,660
one bite

425
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,349
and that was enough. Somebody weaponized it.

426
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,530
Oh, man, there have been so many instances.

427
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,209
I mean, I, I think Tavis just did this, what,

428
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:51,040
maybe a year or two ago where there was a one bite overflow in something and no one,

429
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,839
everyone's like, hey, it's only one bite.

430
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:53,829
What can you do with that?

431
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,040
It's like, well, you can do a lot guys and I think it was a null bite even so it was, it

432
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:00,099
didn't even look that bad.

433
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:00,650
But,

434
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:05,199
and that's the thing, right is if you give a smart person enough time,

435
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,599
they're gonna figure something out.

436
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,219
It, it's like even the,

437
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:11,770
the Chris Evans issues that were just found in which

438
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,520
in fact are video game related because it's those video game

439
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,260
uh sound file players. Right. Right.

440
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,959
And so, well, here's the really crazy thing about this and, and this is, you know,

441
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:25,319
since we're talking about video games, I'm quite happy to go,

442
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:26,599
go into this because I love it.

443
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,089
So these sound files are, they're not like audio files that contain audio, right?

444
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:38,010
They are essentially instruction code for the sound processor in this hardware.

445
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,180
And so

446
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,660
you, you basically,

447
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,060
it sets up an emulated chip and then it runs the instructions

448
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:47,140
through and makes the noise that is expected to be made.

449
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:48,630
And

450
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,449
I mean, essentially what Chris did

451
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:54,250
is he figured out that, hey, this emulator sucks.

452
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,939
And if I basically write a sound file that,

453
00:19:56,949 --> 00:20:00,709
that it will let me write memory to anywhere I want in the address space.

454
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,369
Of course,

455
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,280
that's the easy part because then he had to figure out where to write certain things.

456
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,099
And he ended up overwriting the free call, you know, back to free

457
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,910
to, instead of freeing memory running the system cis call, which then lets you run,

458
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,020
you know, executables.

459
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,719
And it's like this is the craziest exploit ever.

460
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:23,599
But again, you know, you let a smart person do crazy things and,

461
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:24,910
and they're gonna surprise you

462
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:26,000
and

463
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:28,280
it's, it's amazing and, and well,

464
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,880
what always gets me is just how complicated these systems have become, you know,

465
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,040
like you take something

466
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:34,880
air quote simple like,

467
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,459
yeah, like playing a sound file or opening an email,

468
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,569
I mean opening an email nowadays, you know,

469
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,400
you can have multimedia attachments,

470
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,979
you have it going out to the internet to download images, you have,

471
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,739
you know, you have any number of stuff going on

472
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,060
and you know, it's, it's gotten

473
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,540
so complex.

474
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,819
It, it boggles my mind, you know, like especially when I look at web browsers now,

475
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:55,900
like the fact that

476
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,979
for example, Chrome,

477
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:00,300
they have an extension so it can talk to USB

478
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,930
so it can do UTF authentication using USB hardware tokens.

479
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,540
And when I first heard like, you know, web browser talking to USB,

480
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:12,339
I immediately was just like, no, no that bad idea, really bad idea.

481
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:12,680
And then

482
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,520
when I heard the use case, it's like

483
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,420
is you and I

484
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,699
are broken

485
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,420
because we are security people and security people are always broken and

486
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,640
I love

487
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,800
taking a walk or something with my wife and I'll point out things and she's like, why,

488
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,040
why would you even think that

489
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,319
where it's about, you know, doors or signs or,

490
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:36,239
or things that they have in certain places that just aren't right or, you know,

491
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,000
you could, someone could, you know, take advantage of this thing over here,

492
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,160
this window, whatever.

493
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,959
And

494
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,699
when a normal person thinks of USB in a web browser,

495
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:49,150
they think that sounds neat because now I can

496
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,800
do all this cool stuff with my USB devices.

497
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,839
You and I see that we think how can we abuse USB to make the browser do terrible things.

498
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,439
Yeah, exactly.

499
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,489
You know, I'm thinking ransomware on removable USB storage, like the time machine,

500
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,640
hard drive and my Mac.

501
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,089
Uh, you don't,

502
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,030
you shouldn't you be using like some remote Wi Fi Deo

503
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,810
for time machine? Don't you have one of those? Do they still make that weird

504
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,199
-- thing?
-- The capsule thing?

505
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,609
No, I don't, I don't like those because they're,

506
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:20,469
they're just not fast enough because the problem I

507
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:22,939
have is all the V MS on my machine change

508
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,369
and then it like, wants to back up a 40 gig file.

509
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:25,770
I

510
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:26,849
can, you

511
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,020
know,

512
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:28,939
this crap up,

513
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:30,750
but I want it back.

514
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,719
Well, that's fair.

515
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,170
-- That's the whole
-- point of

516
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,310
this

517
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:34,640
time.

518
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,560
I want a backup of my complete system

519
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:39,550
because, you know, then if, well, for example,

520
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,199
I actually did break my laptop once during an up, uh, a Mac Os update.

521
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:46,880
So, all I had to do was hold down. What was it? Command control?

522
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,150
Uh, what is it,

523
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,969
whatever the button is to do a R for recovery with the hard drive plugged in.

524
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:54,079
It's like, do you want to recover your hard drive and you click? Yes.

525
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:57,239
And then you go away for an hour and then come back and your computer's working.

526
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,160
That's pretty cool.

527
00:22:58,719 --> 00:22:59,040
Yeah.

528
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,010
Um but yeah, no, so I'm, you know, yeah, like, yeah, you and I,

529
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,640
when we look at something like that, it's like

530
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,800
not, oh, what a cool feat. And, and in fairness, the use case of having

531
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,780
native

532
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:11,380
like UTF authentication

533
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:13,880
through in your web browser is

534
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,770
really good because like let's face it, right?

535
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,300
One of the biggest problems with web

536
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,140
browser security is people typing their passwords in

537
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,439
when it's not the site that it should be, right?

538
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:25,359
Like a great example being the John

539
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:28,260
Podesta Democratic National Convention email hack,

540
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,949
right? That's these,

541
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,800
this is a real problem that is massively

542
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,680
exploited through phishing emails and spear phishing emails and

543
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:37,260
all that other stuff. So,

544
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:40,510
you know, having UTF authentic, for example, you know,

545
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,810
if every Gmail user had one of these and used it

546
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,250
in theory, basically, you know, bam, no more gmail hacks,

547
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:47,800
right?

548
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:49,979
-- You know, via
-- password

549
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:53,050
it would, it would definitely make a difference.

550
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:53,770
Yeah.

551
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:54,849
And so

552
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:59,130
in this case, I think that the benefit will definitely outweigh the cost

553
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,849
until somebody finds like a ransomware hack and like every single chrome,

554
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,050
you know, running on a machine with a connected USB hard drive all of a sudden,

555
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:09,300
you know,

556
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,599
encrypts that hard drive and we all got to go pay

557
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:13,900
like 50 bucks or 100 bucks to get our data back.

558
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,170
Maybe,

559
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:15,930
maybe

560
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:16,489
I

561
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,729
hope it never happens. I really do because I use Chrome and I mean,

562
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:23,010
it looks like other browsers are going to be doing this.

563
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,510
So we don't really have a choice in the matter.

564
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,869
-- I
-- know Firefox and Chrome both support U two F and

565
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:31,609
I mean, I have one because at one point github

566
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,930
was selling them for like five bucks.

567
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,479
And so I bought a couple of them

568
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,560
and this was before

569
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,920
the UBK four came out which does

570
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,770
like regular UB key stuff plus U two F on one.

571
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,920
at five, I don't even know what they call them but, but the little devices

572
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,050
and,

573
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,569
but now at the same time,

574
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,290
there have been

575
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,010
phone based authentication options for gmail for a really long time.

576
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,810
-- And
-- yeah, but they're a pain to use.

577
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:01,030
You have to type stuff in, you have to know how to use it.

578
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,140
This is a little thing and you just touch it.

579
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:03,430
Yeah,

580
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:07,079
but if people can't be troubled to take out their

581
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,410
phone and type in a number like once a month.

582
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:10,800
Why are they going to

583
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,040
do?

584
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,599
There's a lot of people who use public computers, for example,

585
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,359
which

586
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,839
you shouldn't do.

587
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,949
Listeners, do not use public computers.

588
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:24,459
All right, you are a bad person if you're checking your email. But people

589
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,869
who don't have the money for their own computer,

590
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,000
you know, there's ii,

591
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,329
I know some people that work for the government and work with lower

592
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,199
income people and literally these people don't have a computer or a smartphone

593
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:37,300
and they, they, they use the, you know,

594
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,270
there's computers at these government offices

595
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,599
for public use for checking your email and stuff and they have to because, you know,

596
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:43,699
they want to get jobs and

597
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:45,270
in the modern world, how do you get a job?

598
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,699
-- You get it by email in that
-- instance is somebody giving them

599
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:51,459
U two F keys because if you're not giving them away,

600
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:53,300
they're not going to buy one.

601
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:54,319
No.

602
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:55,229
Um,

603
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,189
but I'm just pointing out that there are a lot

604
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,500
of people that use public computers still and have to.

605
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:02,489
Ok, that's fair. I think if you have to use one,

606
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,699
you can do that.

607
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:08,040
But there's nothing that makes me sadder than when I'm in the lobby of the Marriott.

608
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,449
And I see a guy in a suit using that computer and I just wanna like,

609
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:16,260
run up to him and grab him and shake him and be like, why are you doing this to yourself?

610
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,729
Don't you know what that thing is going to do?

611
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,750
Yeah. And, uh,

612
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,959
you know, in fact, I remember one time I walked past the, the computer in the lobby

613
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,790
and there was a USB drive sticking out of it and I'm like,

614
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,430
someone's gonna take that and they're gonna plug it into their computer and,

615
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,469
like, oh, my goodness. I should take it and throw it away.

616
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,910
I didn't, because I didn't want to touch it. But you get the idea.

617
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,459
Yeah. Could be Coton Strick name.

618
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:41,260
Right.

619
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:45,609
Well, no, I'll be accused of stealing trade secrets from some company or something,

620
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:46,010
you know.

621
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,229
-- So,
-- yeah.

622
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:51,000
-- Anyway.
-- Yeah. No, it's, um, so, you know, and that's the thing, right?

623
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,630
There's always these tradeoffs when we make the, uh, security decisions and,

624
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,020
you know, realistically, you know,

625
00:26:57,469 --> 00:27:00,300
like I said, you know, password stealing attacks, that's a big,

626
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,060
big current problem that's, you know, it's endemic, right?

627
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:04,699
Like it's,

628
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,449
and the only way to make it go away is to sort of,

629
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,849
you know, have two factor authentication.

630
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,290
Really. That's, that's the only way to solve it.

631
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,270
But now at the same time though, like the attack that was

632
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,489
leveraged against Podesta,

633
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,300
you could still do that sort of attack

634
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,739
with two factor authentication. Maybe not. You two f could be trickier.

635
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,219
-- But,
-- I mean, well, you could still do a man in the middle attack and have,

636
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,119
but you wouldn't have continued access to their,

637
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,939
not even just man in the, you don't need continued access depending upon your goals,

638
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,189
but it's, it's not really man in the, it sort of,

639
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:44,819
it sort of isn't right where you bring someone to a fake site,

640
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:47,540
they type in authentication credentials.

641
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,150
And then you essentially take all that data

642
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,270
log into the real site and then ferry information back

643
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,510
to them to make it look like everything is fine.

644
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:56,469
But

645
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,189
and then obviously, you have some access for a limited amount of time.

646
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:03,609
You're right, you couldn't log in a second time,

647
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:07,569
but it would give you certain advantages. This is actually where

648
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,319
and this is one area, for example,

649
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,160
where I really like what Apple has done with their two factor authentication.

650
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,189
You told me about this,

651
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,250
like I love this because um

652
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,199
it not only like,

653
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:21,119
so basically the way Apple does their two factor authentication is you,

654
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,579
you can register a phone or whatever,

655
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:26,260
but essentially it sends a request to another one of your devices.

656
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,829
So for example, like when I was setting this up,

657
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,550
I set it up on my phone and then I started setting it up on my laptop

658
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,839
and you know, so my Apple is like, oh, you know,

659
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,839
somebody's trying to like log into your account.

660
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:36,359
Um

661
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,270
So they send an alert to my phone. And

662
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,439
the best part is it showed a little map saying

663
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:42,760
somebody's trying to log into your account from you know,

664
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,400
Edmonton Alberta with a little picture of it.

665
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:44,910
Now,

666
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,050
Edmonton Alberta is where I live. So, like, obviously. Cool. That's awesome.

667
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,630
That's me.

668
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,540
But, you know,

669
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,130
if I get one of these alerts in future and it's

670
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,949
like some dude's trying to log into your account from China,

671
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:55,449
I'm going to be like, oh, like time to panic.

672
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,959
That would be a great time to panic.

673
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,660
And it made it so much.

674
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:03,810
Yeah. Exactly. And so it made it just so obvious, you know, it's, it's just

675
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,520
because the reality is if somebody hacks me statistically,

676
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,709
they're probably not in Edmonton.

677
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,530
Right. They're probably in like Russia or China Lord knows where or they're,

678
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,140
you know,

679
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,750
and having said that now they're going to be smart enough to buy, you know,

680
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,270
-- to buy VPN access through a provider in Edmonton or
-- just find an IOT device with an

681
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,829
IP address

682
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,420
and then,

683
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:23,060
but, you know,

684
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:25,540
at least it's a really good start because it's a very simple

685
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,390
piece of information for me to consume and it's very intuitive.

686
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,880
Right. Like I, people tend to know where they are usually,

687
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,089
you know, they've been drinking heavily,

688
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:35,119
um,

689
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:36,680
you know,

690
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:39,280
or they're so jet lagged like me once I was in Ireland

691
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,199
and I thought I was in an Irish bar at home.

692
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,420
That's impressive.

693
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,949
They all look the same.

694
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,160
You.

695
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:45,900
Jet lag

696
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:46,579
is

697
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:47,630
a

698
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,010
combination

699
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,079
of jet lag and Guinness.

700
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,619
But the bathroom in the hall to the bathroom looked exactly like one at home.

701
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,280
But anyways,

702
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:57,800
um, you know, and then I have to type in a six digit code. Right.

703
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,020
It shows me a six digit code on my laptop or my

704
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,140
ipad or whatever that I then have to type into my phone.

705
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:02,869
See that.

706
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,750
So that makes it the bar

707
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,510
there, I guess the barriers to entry there is really high. Which is fantastic.

708
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:13,430
Well, and it's very easy to use.

709
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:16,069
And again, like I said, it's, it's really intuitive because I, I,

710
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,170
you know, it makes life, it, it adds a significant step for the attacker.

711
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,469
You know, they now have to

712
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:26,609
kind of figure out where you are and then log in from a machine at that location,

713
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,430
you know,

714
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,400
-- do they enable this functionality by default or is this something
-- you

715
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,410
had when I turned on two fa that's what I got.

716
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,959
I was like, because I was at first, I'm like,

717
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,550
why is this thing showing me a map of where I am followed by?

718
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,569
Oh, that's cool.

719
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,420
You know, like

720
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,260
as far as I can tell, there are no settings I can change. It's just on or off,

721
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,910
you know. Well, and Google does a similar thing, right?

722
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,910
When you are not able two factor authentication on your Google account

723
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,050
and you enable, you know, device specific passwords,

724
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,880
which I love because then I can, you know, have my Thunderbird or whatever, you know,

725
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,290
log in all the time.

726
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,209
Um

727
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,250
But for example, if I go to a significantly different network,

728
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,140
like I log in from China or something, it'll be like, oh, you know,

729
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,040
I kind of know who you are but you're logging in from China.

730
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,699
So could you please enter your password again?

731
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,439
Like your, your master password? You know what I mean?

732
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:16,719
And it's like, you know, great. Yeah,

733
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,719
let's do that.

734
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,880
Um, and so I think these systems because, you know, let's face it.

735
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,920
The majority of people don't

736
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,400
travel a ton,

737
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,790
you know, they tend to use one or two compute devices in whatever city they live.

738
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:29,550
Uh,

739
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,489
and quite honestly for the people that travel.

740
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,310
Well, I'm sorry,

741
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,719
-- you're just gonna have to remember your password and type it in on your devices
-- that

742
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:35,459
you

743
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,040
get a password safe

744
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:41,920
and you use it to store the 10 bazillion passwords you need

745
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:44,310
and you keep it somewhere safe

746
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:48,479
and hopefully you have a really good password for your password safe.

747
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,920
Yeah, it's ok. We'll say it's,

748
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,900
I guess the way I look at it is if you steal my password safe,

749
00:31:57,189 --> 00:32:01,500
you have a level of access to me that is so substantial.

750
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,089
My primary concern isn't going to be that safe.

751
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:08,959
Uh, see, I use, uh, last pass which, uh, luckily it's a zero knowledge one.

752
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,420
So they basically, you know, it's,

753
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,219
they store it but it's encrypted on their end using my pass phrase.

754
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,349
Yeah, I don't, I don't trust those people and So, I, well,

755
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,060
-- not only that I
-- actually too convenient.

756
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:23,199
I, it's so like between my, all my mobile devices and my laptops and everything,

757
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:24,810
it's just all, everything magically works.

758
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:27,000
I enjoy the lack of convenience.

759
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:28,050
Uh,

760
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:29,060
well, not only

761
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:30,839
-- that, the thing that
-- you, the true security

762
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,160
person. I know. I'm crazy.

763
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:32,780
Whatever,

764
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,060
whatever. It's true.

765
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:37,349
But the thing I really like is I use something called PW safe,

766
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:41,750
which is a password safe. No, no. There's a reason for it though. And there's one,

767
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,550
there's one aspect of it that I've yet to find in any other password safe.

768
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,839
And it is so important to me

769
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:55,030
that I'm unwilling to change, even though it is of questionable quality, we'll say.

770
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,540
So. Here's the deal is I've got my password safe and it's full of crap.

771
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:05,510
And when I type in, say my, I want the password for, let's say, you know, yahoo.com.

772
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,989
Yes, they've been in the news. So,

773
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:14,109
so I, I, you know, I basically say, you know PW safe dash up which means user name,

774
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:14,719
password.

775
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:15,989
And then yahoo.com.

776
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,270
And what it does

777
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,189
is I type in the password,

778
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:21,229
I unlock things and then

779
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:27,030
it waits for something to request the password out of the X clipboard.

780
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:31,989
And then when it does be it, you know, I basically go to the website, I, I middle,

781
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,140
click over the user name, field it paste the user name

782
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:37,609
and in the terminal where I ran this command

783
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,199
it tells me which window received the paste

784
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,250
and then it switches to the password.

785
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,989
I, you know, click on the password field,

786
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,369
middle click and it tells me which window received the password and then

787
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,170
it clears the copy and paste buffer of all of my data.

788
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,170
So that password can only be pasted one time.

789
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,229
And

790
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,109
that is it.

791
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:02,489
Whereas a lot of password managers just stick the password into the paste buffer

792
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,770
and then literally anything that can access it,

793
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:05,750
they've got it.

794
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:08,510
Yeah, that's a good feature. I'm wondering how

795
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,270
some of these other ones handle it.

796
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,540
-- Like, do they clear the clipboard after
-- most of them have a time out where?

797
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,270
Well, no, they, they don't pay attention to it at all.

798
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,228
They basically dump it into the clipboard

799
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,270
and then

800
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:24,149
they'll say after 10 seconds or 30 seconds or 50 se whatever you,

801
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,310
whatever you said they will then wipe it.

802
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:30,099
But no, I mean, because last pass uses, for example, they have a browser extension.

803
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,309
-- Uh,
-- I would imagine if there's a browser extension,

804
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:36,418
they're probably just doing some magic on the back end where it's not involving the,

805
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:38,259
the clipboard in any way, which

806
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:44,049
in most instances I would say is safer than using a clipboard based option.

807
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:45,518
Well, yeah,

808
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:49,549
because there's all sorts of javascript shenanigans to yank the clipboard out and,

809
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:49,908
you know?

810
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:50,158
Right.

811
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:50,518
Right.

812
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,108
Exactly. Well, and this is,

813
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:55,089
this is one of the problems I had actually is there was,

814
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,549
I was running a AVNC viewer.

815
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:01,388
VNC is like a remote desktop type virtual network computer. Yeah. Yeah.

816
00:35:01,638 --> 00:35:02,249
And

817
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:06,589
the VNC viewer I was running basically was just waiting for things

818
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,789
to go into the clipboard and then it would steal them.

819
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:12,418
And so I'm like, crap, you know, every time I do anything with password safe,

820
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:14,819
like the VNC viewer is just stealing it all.

821
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:15,860
And it was driving

822
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:16,229
the

823
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:20,870
clipboard functionality. Does that? I think it does that on virtual box as well?

824
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:23,040
-- I think that's kind of how it was.
-- I have no idea.

825
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,120
But anyway, I, so obviously I, I don't use that

826
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,270
and it was,

827
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,760
it was half funny and, and half made me sad.

828
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:32,280
Well, and then the, the,

829
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,820
the thing that really ticked me off too is

830
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,280
the way they were reading the clipboard was clearly broken

831
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:37,629
because password safe.

832
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,350
Also, you have the ability to say, like,

833
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,750
never let this application access the data

834
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,199
in the clipboard because apparently the way

835
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:48,110
the X clipboard works is you can tell who is asking for the data

836
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:49,610
that is there, right?

837
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,149
And well, I, I don't know if this was a bug in VNC or a bug in X.

838
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:56,669
I never really investigated it enough to figure it out.

839
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,909
But essentially

840
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,149
I, I would try to tell password tape,

841
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,790
like never let VNC touch the clipboard and it didn't matter.

842
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,310
It still got it every freaking time. And I'm like, oh, crap. This, this blows.

843
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,030
Well, the thing,

844
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,419
you know,

845
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:10,260
I've noticed about all things like VNC and

846
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,989
virtual boxing and everything is always the,

847
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,500
the guest tools or whatever, always run with like a ridiculous amount of privilege

848
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:16,614
and they,

849
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:17,205
and they quote

850
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:18,675
unquote, just work because they do.

851
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:19,915
-- This
-- isn't even

852
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:22,844
inside of the thing, right? This is on the outside

853
00:36:23,235 --> 00:36:24,225
where, right, where,

854
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:30,044
where the VNC viewer application is just like listening to my host clipboard

855
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,824
and waiting to steal whatever is placed in it.

856
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,919
And then of course, when you're in the gas,

857
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,870
things are even crazier when you try to do any

858
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:38,969
of this stuff because you're right with the tools and,

859
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:39,949
and just all that.

860
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,679
So

861
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,840
needless to say

862
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,239
I do not use a password safe inside of any of my virtual machines,

863
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,399
which is also a good thing because let's face it.

864
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:48,399
They, they don't need to be there.

865
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,550
So moving on to another topic that's uh kind of

866
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,469
related but not really is uh that whole bad review situation

867
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,879
-- of that Ham radio song.
-- Oh, man, I heard about this. What is, what a crazy story?

868
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,229
Yeah. So I read,

869
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,570
-- I read the whole Reddit
-- Post.

870
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:11,399
So why don't explain this for anyone who doesn't know what this is?

871
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,820
Ok. So there are ham radio enthusiasts

872
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,300
now.

873
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:18,685
Am radio. Is that like, like tasty smoked hams

874
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:19,824
amateur?

875
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:23,114
It's, it's a shortened version of AM amateur radio. Yeah. Yeah, I know.

876
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:23,544
I know.

877
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:27,574
I know. When I was a little kid I was like, this bothered me in ways you can't imagine.

878
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:32,254
I'm like, that doesn't make sense like we eat ham. Like, that's not amateur.

879
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:33,024
Yeah.

880
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:34,264
So there's, um,

881
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:37,745
in most of the world there's a bunch of spectrum licensed

882
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:40,675
to amateur radio operators and so people can do things like,

883
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:42,885
you know, use their CB radios or,

884
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:45,604
you know, um, more powerful systems

885
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:50,939
and, um, obviously a lot of modern radio equipment is uh you know,

886
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,350
computer controlled or computer managed.

887
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,199
Uh And one of the cool things you can do with ham radio

888
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:57,020
is, you know, packet radio.

889
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:01,790
So rather than like say actual voice or, you know, like the old timey Morse code,

890
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:04,300
you can actually send data packets over,

891
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:08,510
you know, AM and FM and long range transmitters. So you can actually

892
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:12,260
send data to like, you know, completely random parts of the world

893
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,239
and, and basically not have to pay for it, which is pretty sweet.

894
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,500
Also things like in disaster relief and whatnot.

895
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,989
When you know, all the cell tower batteries have died or, you know,

896
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,550
gotten clobbered by hurricanes,

897
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:26,149
you can now, you know, get maps and stuff uh from remote places that, you know,

898
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,389
have the satellite imagery.

899
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,810
Uh So anyways,

900
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,909
there's a whole bunch of software obviously to, you know,

901
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,959
interface with all these different devices.

902
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:40,989
Um And not surprisingly, a lot of it is uh open source and

903
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,379
there was a really famous uh open source package that,

904
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,750
uh, essentially the maintainer was like, I,

905
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,540
I just don't have the time to deal with this.

906
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:52,459
And he basically handed it over to this other group that, uh,

907
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,199
formed a company around it

908
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,419
and took it commercial

909
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,840
and started selling it, you know, nothing too strange there.

910
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,169
But what's interesting?

911
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:02,840
So they had, you know,

912
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,300
their standard sort of terms of use and user license agreement and one of the clauses

913
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,260
was basically we can end your access to the software for any time for any reason.

914
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,739
We want blah, blah, blah, no recourse,

915
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,169
which I hate to say is actually a reasonably

916
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,909
normal clause to have in a lot of software.

917
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:21,169
Um, and user license agreements in terms of service,

918
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:24,199
like if you've ever looked at terms of service for a website or anything, you know,

919
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:25,840
that, that clause is almost always there.

920
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,250
So what happened is this guy gave a negative review of the software, uh due to some,

921
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:36,219
there was a software bug that, you know, um wasn't being fixed

922
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:39,469
and the uh tech support people were a bit snarky

923
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,760
with him and he was a bit snarky in return.

924
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,409
And anyways, they ended up blowing up a bit.

925
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,350
So they

926
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,399
licensing server for this thing.

927
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:51,580
So basically the software you run it, it connects to a licensing server and then it,

928
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,050
you know, the licensing server says basically you're allowed to use this or not.

929
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,149
And the software, you know, works or doesn't work based on that

930
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:01,629
and they blacklisted him, they basically disabled his software.

931
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,590
Um,

932
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:03,550
and so,

933
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,330
well, and here's where things get really messy.

934
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,750
So, like if this isn't bad enough, it gets way worse.

935
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,669
So he posted about this and essentially the company kind

936
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,800
of got even more riled up and more rude.

937
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,729
And what's interesting though is other people came forward saying? Yeah, me too.

938
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:23,689
I've been, you know, my version of this software got bricked as well.

939
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:28,989
And now what's really fascinating is the original guy, if you read the email thread

940
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:32,250
or the ticket thread or whatever the support request,

941
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:37,659
he says I bought this software. I own this software.

942
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:41,189
You have done me wrong, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, oh,

943
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:46,939
I see where the problem is because this guy thought he actually owned the software,

944
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:47,510
not that

945
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:51,360
he had a license to use it that was limited to, you know, whatever,

946
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,040
essentially the company decided.

947
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:55,949
And so the company basically pointed out, no,

948
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:58,429
the software is licensed

949
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:03,439
to, uh, your ham radio call sign, which I find kind of weird but whatever

950
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,290
those guys love their call signs. In fact,

951
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,520
I remember when I worked tech support a million years ago,

952
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:15,219
there was a, a ham guy who would call up to the ISP I worked for and this guy, like,

953
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:17,899
I hope his radio skills are better than his computer skills.

954
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:18,729
We just say that.

955
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:22,500
But he insisted I call him by his ham ID.

956
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,899
I couldn't use his, his name was Bob,

957
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:28,300
which is obviously a fairly easy name to remember and pronounce.

958
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:32,100
But no, no, I couldn't do that. I had to call him the string of letters and numbers.

959
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,860
That was his ham ID.

960
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,340
Yeah, it was great.

961
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:36,570
Yeah.

962
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,929
So anyways, um, and this is, this is what gets me is fundamentally,

963
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,689
I hate to say this, but, you know, this software company is not wrong.

964
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:46,780
They did license the software and this guy should have

965
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,189
read the terms of the license when he purchased it.

966
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,219
Does it

967
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:50,679
say

968
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,229
negative

969
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:57,429
-- reviews will get you bricked or?
-- No, it says any reason we feel can get you bricked.

970
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,360
-- Any reason we
-- feel any reason we feel

971
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,209
and, you know, and that's the reality.

972
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:02,520
Like,

973
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:06,379
uh web servers or web services are a great example of this because not only are you,

974
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,040
you know, it's somebody else's software, it's,

975
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,100
they're running it for you and making it avail,

976
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,510
you know, the service available to

977
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:12,080
them.

978
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:16,139
But that's so true. That's actually one of the things I'm terrified of is

979
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,219
with using things like Google for picture, like storing,

980
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:24,459
picture backups and stuff is it can go south if they decide,

981
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:29,139
like you've done something wrong, all your data is gone and it's never coming back.

982
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:31,320
Yep. Yep. Totally gone.

983
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:31,939
Yeah.

984
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,879
It's, um, this is the modern world, you know, Richard Stallman,

985
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,080
for those of you who don't know, the,

986
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,989
the open source proponent from way back in the day, you know, turns out he was right.

987
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,879
Stallman has always been right.

988
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,520
I mean, let's face it. This is not the first time this has happened.

989
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,000
It certainly won't be the last.

990
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,219
Yeah.

991
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,780
And so what's really fascinating to me is that, you know,

992
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:56,219
although I must point out you, you say Stallman was right,

993
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,379
as we record on a Mac, right. Right.

994
00:42:59,840 --> 00:42:59,909
now

995
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,300
it's, you know, tradeoffs, worst case scenario though,

996
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,649
I could get myself boots strapped into a Linux environment without, well,

997
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:08,080
it would take me about 20 minutes

998
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:11,260
and then I'd have to learn how to use uh you know,

999
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:15,580
-- whatever audio program
-- I I'm telling you, man, I use pulse caster in my end.

1000
00:43:15,669 --> 00:43:18,699
It's fantastic. It's awesome for recording.

1001
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:19,909
Yeah.

1002
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,870
But uh anyway, so

1003
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:26,860
it really raises some questions, you know, especially for say, security software.

1004
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:30,820
You know, what happens if we enter a realm where, you know,

1005
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,530
security vendors start bricking people's antivirus or, you know, firewall

1006
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,500
-- or
-- I'm sure that happens now.

1007
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:37,760
I mean,

1008
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,290
you got to think how many of those

1009
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,110
antivirus applications that come pre installed on someone's computer

1010
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,439
where they work for what,

1011
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:46,629
like three months and then they start begging you for money.

1012
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,060
-- Well, that's a little
-- different because that's more of a passive thing.

1013
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:51,969
It's like this thing

1014
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,689
will stop working at this date automatically

1015
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:56,149
unless you do something.

1016
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,250
It's a little bit different when the company takes an active

1017
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:02,219
step and says you have the software, it was licensed,

1018
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:05,850
it was working correctly and we've now decided to remotely disable it

1019
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:11,290
and see one thing that's interesting to me is in the past easy, just firewall it.

1020
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,889
So can't talk to the licensing server,

1021
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:13,850
you know.

1022
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,719
And of course, the solution there was that they made the software, you know,

1023
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:20,560
it has to check the licensing server X every X number of days or whatever,

1024
00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:20,959
you know.

1025
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:22,610
So then you entered into the thing where people

1026
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,449
would like roll back their system clock and stuff.

1027
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:24,719
Right.

1028
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:29,250
However, now part of the problem is a lot of these apps

1029
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:31,729
really do need to talk to the,

1030
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,939
to the internet, you know, to these end servers to, to do useful things,

1031
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:40,429
-- you know, to download updates or to download, you know, whatever,
-- not even that,

1032
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:42,320
what if it's like software as a service

1033
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,729
where you're literally using someone else's computer?

1034
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:47,489
I mean, they have total control over what's happening.

1035
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,189
And I mean, the reality is this has always been true of many, many,

1036
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:55,570
many services and products we consume.

1037
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,560
It's just generally speaking, these companies would never turn it off,

1038
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,879
you know, like the power company, you can be,

1039
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:02,120
I,

1040
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:04,389
I can't even imagine how abusive you'd have to

1041
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:06,060
-- be towards your power company for them
-- to cut,

1042
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:09,000
there's regulations that govern things like power.

1043
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,610
I mean, they can't just, I mean, if you don't pay your bill. They can turn.

1044
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,050
But, although even then, you know, you and I live in cold climates,

1045
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,679
they can't turn your power

1046
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,020
in the winter.

1047
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:18,879
Uh,

1048
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,120
actually what they do here is they install a special meter that only allows

1049
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:25,320
a very small amount of electricity through which is enough to run a furnace.

1050
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,629
Interesting. Ok. So we'll use gas then maybe as, as the excuse of,

1051
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:33,629
I know if you don't pay your gas bill, at least where I live.

1052
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,439
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Natural gas.

1053
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:40,570
They, they cannot turn off your natural gas service in the winter.

1054
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:44,040
Like, that's just, you could not pay your bill, of course. Now come spring,

1055
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:44,889
they will turn it off

1056
00:45:45,104 --> 00:45:47,375
and they don't have to turn it back on when it gets cold.

1057
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:50,495
Like it's assumed like you're on your own now. But,

1058
00:45:50,905 --> 00:45:53,975
I mean, this is, this is an example of regulation, right? Because

1059
00:45:54,155 --> 00:45:55,215
I'm sure these,

1060
00:45:55,225 --> 00:45:59,485
these companies would love to do nothing more than to show up at your door, you know,

1061
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:03,975
on December 24th and turn your gas off because you haven't made them in two months.

1062
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:05,735
But the government said

1063
00:46:05,854 --> 00:46:09,195
I don't do that because people freezing to death is bad press. Right.

1064
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:09,975
So,

1065
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:10,885
it's also expensive.

1066
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:11,814
Right.

1067
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:15,860
I, I kind of get that and maybe I, you know, I,

1068
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,080
I hate claiming regulation is the solution to anything.

1069
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:25,949
But as we enter into a world where there's more and more as a service going on,

1070
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,659
we're gonna need some sort of consumer protections here because today,

1071
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,520
in virtually every instance,

1072
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:36,679
the supplier of the service holds all of the cards.

1073
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,429
See, and I think part of the challenge there is though,

1074
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:42,270
if you make the regulations too onerous, let's face it,

1075
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,270
the companies are going to gain them and move

1076
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:45,969
offshore.

1077
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,739
Um I mean, Russia actually has done this,

1078
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,969
remember with the linkedin thing where Russia passed a law and, you know,

1079
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:56,070
I actually don't totally disagree with this law, but the law basically states that

1080
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,979
if you're going to hold data on Russian citizens,

1081
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:01,389
the data has to be held on servers in Russia.

1082
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:05,750
Now on the face of it, that's not actually a terrible law because you know,

1083
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,590
this data about your citizens now

1084
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,949
is residing in your legal jurisdiction.

1085
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:14,110
-- So you can then do things about it
-- and it's out of the jurisdiction of your enemies.

1086
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,290
Exactly.

1087
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,659
Now, obviously being Russia and the,

1088
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,610
the challenge being that this law is a two edged sword too because obviously that

1089
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,080
leads to all sorts of things like it makes it easier to do warrants,

1090
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,219
it makes it easier to do censorship and all that other stuff because again,

1091
00:47:27,229 --> 00:47:28,870
it's in your legal jurisdiction,

1092
00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:31,580
you know, the guys with guns can show up at the data center and say

1093
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:32,979
do this or else.

1094
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:37,780
Um And of course, you know, linkedin is afraid that I'm guessing, you know,

1095
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:41,189
a this is going to be abused and B it's going to be kind of a pain because

1096
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,550
one of the challenges being is if you let people set that precedent,

1097
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,070
you don't have to have data centers in every single,

1098
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:48,629
well, in every

1099
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,149
single country you want to operate in

1100
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,590
and potentially in every single legal jurisdiction,

1101
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:52,959
you know,

1102
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:56,959
-- and there's hundreds of
-- those Amazon is basically starting to do this though where

1103
00:47:56,969 --> 00:48:01,590
they're opening AWS data centers all over the place for this exact reason.

1104
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:03,229
Yeah. True.

1105
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,870
Um, and there it becomes, you know, a marketing thing where, you know,

1106
00:48:06,879 --> 00:48:09,810
your data is beholden to say European Union

1107
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,070
law because the data center is in Frankfurt.

1108
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,709
That was their most, or I think they did, what was it?

1109
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:17,840
Frankfurt and London were their two most recent announcements.

1110
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:19,409
Um,

1111
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:21,310
you know,

1112
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:25,300
and yeah, and so it really, it's, it's a new world we're entering into because I know,

1113
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,889
for example, like I will,

1114
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,280
uh,

1115
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:33,370
I would be very hesitant to be rude towards Google because, yeah, they host my email.

1116
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:34,540
-- I'm
-- like
-- a

1117
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:34,870
-- lot
-- of

1118
00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:38,729
-- my and a whole bunch of other stuff. I'm
-- terrified of the day.

1119
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:40,739
They decide I've broken their ya

1120
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:43,229
and, and what then?

1121
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:47,469
And yeah, like they're gonna really miss that 50 bucks a year. I'm giving them.

1122
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:48,110
Right. I mean,

1123
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:49,270
-- let's
-- face it.

1124
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,939
And what's even more scary to me is even if we say, let's say, for example,

1125
00:48:52,949 --> 00:48:53,919
they pass a law saying, you know,

1126
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:57,149
if you essentially turn off somebody's blank service.

1127
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,790
You have to like, ship them a DVD or a CD of their software or of their data,

1128
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:02,110
you know,

1129
00:49:02,229 --> 00:49:04,389
well, without the

1130
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,260
whatever software to process that data, I mean, what use is this right? Like,

1131
00:49:08,649 --> 00:49:11,030
I don't know what format Google keeps my email.

1132
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:11,370
So

1133
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,510
Google has a service called take out

1134
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:19,389
that lets you download all your stuff and they give you a gigantor

1135
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,860
inbox of all of your mail.

1136
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:27,510
It's huge but you can get it and it's a standardized format, which is awesome.

1137
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:27,959
I give them,

1138
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:28,330
for

1139
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:28,699
example,

1140
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:31,500
what about my Google documents?

1141
00:49:32,189 --> 00:49:32,449
They

1142
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,010
come as word docs,

1143
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:37,419
-- they just exported
-- as

1144
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,439
they did this, right?

1145
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:44,610
I mean, I give them loads of credit for this because they could have just been like,

1146
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,540
yeah, screw you guys.

1147
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,330
We don't care but they, they, they did it right. They did

1148
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,570
-- happen,
-- for example, when it's stuff like sales force and tickets

1149
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:55,159
and

1150
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:55,649
that's, you

1151
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,370
know, that's fair.

1152
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:00,610
And even if there was, I'd still have to, you know, find some sales force competitor.

1153
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,870
And I mean, as far as I know sales force, you know,

1154
00:50:02,979 --> 00:50:05,129
especially if like what happens when you're using

1155
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:07,300
tie ins and other applications that are,

1156
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:07,629
you know,

1157
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:09,449
tied in, right? Like

1158
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,280
um you know, same thing with like, well, any of these online, you know, software,

1159
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,110
the service guys, right?

1160
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,620
There's part of their value is that you can tie everything together, you know,

1161
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:23,179
slack can talk to Jenkins can talk to signal, you know, can talk to a

1162
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:25,010
whole pile of stuff

1163
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:29,409
and great, you know. So if they did give me an export of this data, it would be like

1164
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,189
an Irc chat log.

1165
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:33,149
Great. Now, what,

1166
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,060
so

1167
00:50:36,189 --> 00:50:37,560
the reality is, I mean,

1168
00:50:37,669 --> 00:50:40,260
these companies are gonna end up holding a lot of power

1169
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:44,560
over their, you know, customers with this sort of unintended lock in. Well, not,

1170
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:46,580
you know,

1171
00:50:47,229 --> 00:50:48,639
it's pretty intentional lock in.

1172
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,649
And um, yeah, I kind of wonder, you know, how, how are we going to do this?

1173
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,939
Are, are we gonna end up with laws passed that saying, you know,

1174
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:56,719
email providers have to

1175
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:00,979
give you a grace period or have to host you at a certain size. You know,

1176
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,699
-- I
-- don't know, man, it's,

1177
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,830
it's crazy to think about

1178
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,750
it. It, it's a tough problem to say the least and I, I have no idea

1179
00:51:09,729 --> 00:51:12,510
because one thing that really gets me is similar to this is the whole, you know,

1180
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,040
self driving cars as a service problem

1181
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,159
because right now, for example, Uber, because they're not a taxi, you know,

1182
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:22,659
taxis have to be accessible to disabled people or if they're not accessible,

1183
00:51:22,669 --> 00:51:24,280
they have to help the disabled people in and out

1184
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,090
and they have to allow their service animals in,

1185
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,229
right?

1186
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:30,899
You can't refuse a fare with the service animal. You know, it's a protective thing.

1187
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:35,929
You can't refuse fares based on like what is it like race age, you know,

1188
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:36,629
things like that.

1189
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,429
But, you know, Uber has in past, been found

1190
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:41,800
to, you know,

1191
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,629
been doing these type things where they made, like,

1192
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:46,120
service animals ride in the trunk, for example,

1193
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,169
or not pick them up at all.

1194
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,600
And, you know, I say this and now I, I hope that my Uber app still works.

1195
00:51:52,129 --> 00:51:53,560
Right. Exactly.

1196
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:54,600
You know,

1197
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:57,270
but, you know, especially once these things are automated, you know, uh,

1198
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:00,360
there's sort of, uh, some implicit biases, like, you know,

1199
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,459
people without credit cards.

1200
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:02,120
How does that work?

1201
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:04,300
Yeah, we've talked about this one before.

1202
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,540
-- Yeah.
-- So

1203
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:07,330
anyways moving away back to it.

1204
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:09,540
But as far as Stallman goes, I,

1205
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,360
you know, these other service and these cloud providers are just so,

1206
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,899
you know, economically I can't, I just can't, not use them. Right.

1207
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:19,939
I can't do my own email for 50 bucks a year.

1208
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,379
You know, with my own servers

1209
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:22,250
you can't

1210
00:52:23,209 --> 00:52:26,560
and spam filtering and calendaring and documents and everything else.

1211
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,919
Unless your time is worthless,

1212
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,719
you cannot do it. But if your time has no value

1213
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:35,889
-- which there
-- and even then, I mean, the minimum would be like, what,

1214
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:37,760
five bucks a month for a VP,

1215
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:39,209
a virtual private server.

1216
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:42,879
So it would be $60 a year.

1217
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:43,919
Yeah.

1218
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,709
But, you know, I wouldn't, you know,

1219
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:49,000
one of the problems with modern email is if it's not coming from a major provider,

1220
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:50,560
you tend to get scored as spam.

1221
00:52:50,989 --> 00:52:57,750
Well, you can make sure you set up the various anti spam things on your domain and

1222
00:52:58,389 --> 00:53:01,600
whatever other ii, I forget, I don't even call it anymore

1223
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:02,810
and

1224
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,110
all that stuff

1225
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:07,320
and that works well enough. So,

1226
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:08,570
yeah. Anyway.

1227
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,250
All right, man, I think the, the moral of the story is, uh,

1228
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,530
tell your sister Stallman was right.

1229
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,270
I wonder what else he was right about that.

1230
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,850
-- We're going to find out in the next five,
-- 10 years. Everything, everything.

1231
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,889
That's why Richard Stallman looks like he does.

1232
00:53:19,899 --> 00:53:23,649
You know, when you see the pictures of the old prophets from the days of your Yeah,

1233
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,409
there's a reason they all look like Stallman,

1234
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:27,699
-- right? Because they're so stressed
-- out

1235
00:53:28,889 --> 00:53:31,330
because no one listens to them and they know they're right.

1236
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,270
All right, folks. So

1237
00:53:33,379 --> 00:53:35,429
thank you so much for listening.
