Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast

1
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,840
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in real crime. Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,329
-- Ah,
-- man, I'm getting more nervous about you in this intro.

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,430
I feel like if, if one of us goes to jail the other is going to

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,899
and while I don't plan to go to jail, it still concerns me.

5
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:27,069
-- The other one will have to be extradited
-- unless

6
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,020
one of us travels to the other location,

7
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:33,979
-- the crime spree. I don't know, but
-- you'd still have to be rested in all that.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,610
-- But
-- I'm concerned you're going to slowly nudge me into a life of crime.

9
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:42,060
And I, like, I won't even know what's happening because that's, that's how it works.

10
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:42,470
You know what?

11
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,799
Maybe I'll just give you a, like a,

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,939
I'll replace all your American nickels with Canadian nickels.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,000
I think I can spend those in America as if they were us change. I think there's an

14
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,580
agreement between the United States and Canada coins are the same.

15
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,500
-- Well, but
-- like, what about dollar coins?

16
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:04,129
That's probably different because we don't have dollar coins because, yeah,

17
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:06,660
-- you do, Susan B Anthony,
-- it's complicated.

18
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,720
So for people who don't know because a significant number of

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,660
our listeners do not live in North America about half actually,

20
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:15,129
which I'm very proud of, but

21
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:15,580
he

22
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:16,889
doesn't know this.

23
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:17,569
I

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,809
show you statistics. You don't pay attention.

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,889
Anyway. Anyway,

26
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,540
I want to see that line moving up into the

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,099
-- room.
-- That's

28
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:23,459
right.

29
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:29,069
-- So, anyway, in America we have dollar bills like
-- paper. Yeah.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,550
-- And they smell terrible.
-- They do, they stink and I guess they're full of cocaine.

31
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,230
According to tests, we'll look, we'll look it up in the show notes,

32
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,769
but

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,029
they have tried repeatedly to use dollar coins in

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,809
the United States and it has never worked.

35
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:44,790
And the very, so originally we had this thing called silver dollars,

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,440
which were these like gigantic coins.

37
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:47,540
And they're actually really cool and they're

38
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,809
really hard to find now because obviously

39
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,639
they haven't been made in like 50 years and I have a couple,

40
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,169
I love them.

41
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,169
But then they, they switch to a smaller coin called the Susan B, Anthony dollar.

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,805
And it looks like a United States quarter. It's only slightly larger.

43
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:04,254
It is the same color. And you can imagine how this happened. In fact, I still,

44
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:08,264
I still get some as quarters every now and then when I go to the store, like,

45
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:09,054
it's pretty rare.

46
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:09,744
But, yeah.

47
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,705
-- So, anyway, I
-- just, I love how, like,

48
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,425
when it comes to change people super don't pay attention.

49
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:16,945
-- Yeah. No one does. Exactly.
-- Literally.

50
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:20,085
I'm pretty sure you could give them a fistful of, like German coins or Euros

51
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,455
and like, they're round and shiny.

52
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:24,645
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So,

53
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,389
then they tried making a US dollar coin.

54
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:33,149
That was a gold color, but it was the same size as the Susan B Anthony coin.

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,520
And so, like in a vending machines, for example,

56
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,360
you could use either coin interchangeably.

57
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:39,440
They, in fact, they, they even passed a law

58
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,399
where they,

59
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,889
-- that's
-- not, that's actually kind

60
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:42,619
of pretty there.

61
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,110
There's a bunch of them and there's all different

62
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:45,789
presidents on them and they're very nice coins.

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,919
I have quite a lot of them

64
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:47,720
and

65
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,054
they, they even passed a law said, you know,

66
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:53,725
the US mint has to mint X number of coins a year or whatever.

67
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:54,145
And

68
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:57,335
like, the people just hated them and didn't use them. So

69
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,654
now we have warehouses full of coins.

70
00:02:59,664 --> 00:02:59,815
Well,

71
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:02,375
my understanding is the primary use case for these dollar

72
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:04,115
coins was you bought them on your credit card and

73
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,285
then took them to the bank to pay off your

74
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,134
credit card bill to rack up your credit card points.

75
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:07,225
Yeah,

76
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:09,455
that's basically what everyone did because the US mint

77
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:11,235
would ship them for free to your house.

78
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:13,434
I cannot imagine the cost on that. I,

79
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,610
-- they were, they were trying to get people to use them.
-- I understand.

80
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,289
But I mean, like shipping that stuff

81
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,399
-- and
-- don't get me wrong. I love dollar coins. I love going to Canada and Europe.

82
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,169
And having

83
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,399
a, a coin that is of a, we'll say useful quantity.

84
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,199
Well, and I'll be honest, I've lived in Germany where, you know,

85
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,089
they had back in the day up to five mark coins, like a, basically a $5 coin,

86
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,270
which was great because, like,

87
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,119
vending machines could actually sell expensive stuff without you having to, like,

88
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,539
like,

89
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,970
what always gets me about the US is if I want to buy something at a vending machine,

90
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:49,070
-- I better have a lot of quarters.
-- There are some that take bills now.

91
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:51,169
Well, now they take credit cards and stuff.

92
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:54,979
-- Mostly they have the adapter
-- and to make it even more obnoxious in the US.

93
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,529
-- All of our bills are the same size.
-- Well, we also do that here but

94
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,720
-- we have braille on them to identify which is, which
-- are Canadian.

95
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:05,869
Canadian bills are all the same. I haven't actually seen Canadian money.

96
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,339
Canadian bills have historically all been the same size. But his story

97
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:13,143
because we don't want to be jerks to blind people. There was braille coating on them.

98
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,902
There was raised bumps. I get that.

99
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:18,273
So you can, like, you can actually even, even you and I can feel it like there.

100
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:23,502
-- It's quite, it's really obvious.
-- I bet the last 10 times I've been to Canada

101
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:27,502
-- because I usually get there a couple times a year. Not
-- anymore. I'm not.

102
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:28,433
Yeah, exactly.

103
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,653
I've not had cash though because credit cards are

104
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:33,342
so pervasive and easy that it's just not worth

105
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:37,506
-- cash.
-- Wait time out. When you say, don't you also use debit cards down there.

106
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:41,335
They exist. I don't use debit card. There's a whole pain in the butt reason.

107
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:43,696
So, the problem basically comes down to the United States.

108
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:47,205
-- If someone steals my debit card number, they can drain my money.
-- Yeah.

109
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:48,936
-- Yeah, we talked about this on a show.
-- Right.

110
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:52,605
Whereas if it's credit card it's not my problem. So, debit cards exist.

111
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:53,846
I never use them.

112
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:57,226
So, in my brain, I just say credit card because that's how it is anyway. Anyway.

113
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:57,615
All right,

114
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,170
I've got a question for you.

115
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,380
Is the moon a star or a planet?

116
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,779
Well, it is a light source so clearly it's a star

117
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,260
or maybe it's a moon

118
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,260
but you can't use it. So it's not a light source.

119
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:14,779
It reflects light.

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,609
Yeah, that makes it a light source. So I took my bike ride this morning.

121
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:18,869
I actually take a bike ride every morning

122
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:23,269
because pandemic was, like, making me fat this morning. I saw Venus in the sky.

123
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,799
Is that, is that a sun?

124
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,559
It's a light source.

125
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,440
No, it's a,

126
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,929
it's a planet. Planet Venus.

127
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,450
Yeah. It's also bigger than a peanut.

128
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:34,410
It was not bigger than a peanut if I was holding a peanut at arm's length.

129
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,529
No, I meant the real thing.

130
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,750
-- I meant the actual, the actual star is bigger than a peanut,
-- is it?

131
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,500
Yeah.

132
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,010
-- You don't know that.
-- It's true. I haven't been there but if I have a

133
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,239
really big peanut.

134
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,720
Yeah, that is true.

135
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:47,760
I, you know, I've always wondered about this, like,

136
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:50,070
what would happen if you like Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy?

137
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,309
Tried to make a planet of some arbitrary material like cotton candy or, you know,

138
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,989
egg white.

139
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,209
There is a, what if I will find it and put a link in the show notes. The XK CD guy

140
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:03,654
Randall Munroe, his name is, he's got this site called, what if, where you people,

141
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:04,934
I don't know if he still runs it,

142
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:07,714
but people would ask ridiculous questions if someone asked about a

143
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:11,375
mole of moles and a mole is like some enormous number.

144
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:13,695
So what if you had an enormous number of moles?

145
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,445
And he talks about like the gravity and the fact

146
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:17,524
that you just end up with this gross meat planet?

147
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:18,415
And so anyway,

148
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,320
I will look it up and, and,

149
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,839
-- but it's, it's more horrifying than you would hope it is.
-- Oh, I imagine.

150
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:25,920
Yeah, it's six,

151
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,989
-- it's six times 10 to the 23rd,
-- which is a

152
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,100
big number. A male of males is a lot of malls.

153
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:32,959
So,

154
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,000
-- anyway,
-- well, and related to this, I've, I've been looking into because

155
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,100
I've, so I've recently installed a ring security system in my house.

156
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,470
And then my question is when I sell the house, number one,

157
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
does it come with the house or not?

158
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,959
And depending on how you

159
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,600
define, you know, fittings and attachments in the house.

160
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:50,160
So, like, you know, the cabinets in the kitchen are probably staying,

161
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,799
I'm not going to rip them out and take them with me.

162
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,760
You know, typically the major appliances like the fridge and the, you know,

163
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:56,040
washer and dryer stay.

164
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:56,440
Right.

165
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,170
They can, it depends how you sell your

166
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:58,880
-- house.
-- Exactly.

167
00:06:58,929 --> 00:06:59,239
So,

168
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,410
but the question then becomes most people typically leave

169
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,000
the refrigerator and like whatever kind of stuff that's,

170
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,779
you know, permanently affixed, right?

171
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,959
But the question is with the ring security system, how do I,

172
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,399
how do I transfer ownership

173
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,230
in a way that

174
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:18,239
person receiving it can like knows that they actually have ownership of it.

175
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,109
-- The worst thing is too, is now smart appliances. Ok.
-- These are all related.

176
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,260
So let's tie them up before we go off into the tangents.

177
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,440
So there is a QVC clip,

178
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,640
we will put a link to where the people on it are trying to decide if

179
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,720
the moon is a star or a planet and it's fun to laugh at them.

180
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,230
But it is interesting to talk about because these people lack the,

181
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,320
we'll say vernacular to actually have this discussion

182
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:44,230
and this is completely related to security

183
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,609
in general because obviously when we talk,

184
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,570
we have a certain vocabulary

185
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,309
that normal people don't have and then we can tie that into

186
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,519
kind of there's a story we'll obviously put in the show notes,

187
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,010
man, we're gonna have a lot of show notes this time.

188
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:56,510
But, uh,

189
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,489
a story we'll put in the show notes where basically a person sold

190
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,559
-- their house and they didn't lose access to their security system even
-- better.

191
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,720
They tried to cancel access to the security system. They called Viv

192
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,920
and they, a long story short, they still had access and when they finally kind of,

193
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:13,239
the thing started to hit the news and stuff and it phoned Viv

194
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,350
and like VT turned it off in 30 seconds.

195
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,649
Exactly. And so like this, this all comes together into one kind of

196
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:23,070
thing to think about inec security is

197
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:28,160
there's ways to talk about things that most people don't understand

198
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:32,960
and it can create problems because for example, I bet this person called

199
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:33,570
Viv

200
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,950
and they probably tried to explain what was going on and

201
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,219
I have a very strong suspicion there was a communication problem.

202
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,159
Well, the point is they shouldn't have to explain what's going on.

203
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:49,929
It's the guy sold his house called Vivan to cancel his security contract. And

204
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,359
thus, you know, the, the smart home security system.

205
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:53,219
And

206
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,390
Vivian said, yeah, we'll cancel it.

207
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,929
But the problem is these companies have their cancellation stuff set up so

208
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,799
that it's really more about customer

209
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,349
retention than actually canceling the account,

210
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:02,869
right?

211
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,900
And so they essentially didn't actually like turn

212
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:07,830
off his access to the devices and stuff.

213
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,520
So he had access to, for example,

214
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,469
cameras that also had a microphone and speaker on it.

215
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,159
The guy did.

216
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:16,270
What, in my opinion is kind of the right, well, the best right thing he could, which is

217
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:20,953
he notified the existing homeowner by basically scaring the bejesus out of her.

218
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:21,372
Right.

219
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:24,153
I'm not sure if I agree with that necessarily,

220
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,112
but how else is he supposed to contact her?

221
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:28,833
But anyways, it also as, as much as it scared her,

222
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,513
it also gets the point across that this is a real problem, you know,

223
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:33,182
like those baby monitors that were insecure

224
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:34,593
and people were hijacking them and like,

225
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:36,192
-- they're still
-- insecure.

226
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:36,422
Yeah,

227
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:39,812
I, I think this guy did the best job he could, you know, with responsible disclosure

228
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:42,755
or given a company that's a total bage of weasels.

229
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:44,966
But I'm thinking so with the security system it's

230
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:47,695
relatively easy to make people understand that it's like,

231
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:50,916
look, your home has a security system that somebody else has control over.

232
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:54,346
Well, ok, that's probably, you know, a normal person would say that's bad.

233
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:56,476
But what about your fridge or

234
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:59,036
there was just an article today in the reg about, you know,

235
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,596
hacking old coffee makers to turn the burner on and, you know,

236
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:03,395
either attack other stuff in the house or,

237
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,270
uh, I'm,

238
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,349
I'm guessing that a lot of those things

239
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:09,340
don't have physical safety cutoffs and could experience.

240
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:12,549
What's the expression, an unanticipated thermal event?

241
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,070
Like a fire?

242
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:16,109
Yeah,

243
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,330
I think about this problem a lot

244
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,469
and I think

245
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,429
it is

246
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,590
80% communication and 20% engineering. And the reason I say that is because

247
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,880
it's easy to talk about, oh, you can ransomware someone's coffee potter,

248
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,000
you can hack their coffee pot or you can do a bad thing.

249
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,690
So what ends up happening is for example,

250
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,760
there's a story that just came out of someone put ransomware on

251
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,849
their coffee pot and they were using it as an example,

252
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:45,239
but like the attack is relatively impractical in all seriousness.

253
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,530
And so now we end up in a situation where

254
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:51,450
you have what appears to be a very sensational story

255
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:55,080
that quite frankly no one is believing because I think it's just been like,

256
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,849
we've cried wolf so many times you've got the security people being like, oh,

257
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:02,000
it's not that bad and the normal people are like whatever nerd we don't care.

258
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,909
Well, here's a, here's a more concrete example,

259
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,719
I'm actually planning to buy a new TV.

260
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:08,640
One of my biggest concerns is having ads shoved down my throat.

261
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,059
-- You just don't ever connect that thing to the internet,
-- right?

262
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,229
So, but looking at, for example, Samsung apparently has been updating their tvs to

263
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,630
show more and more ads like on the user interfaces

264
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,390
that you like have to use to use your TV.

265
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:21,979
No, you don't.

266
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:24,950
And this guy showed a picture of one where it's like

267
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,909
the bottom half of the screen is an ad for,

268
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,830
I think it's

269
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,450
-- Butter or yogurt. Maybe
-- it wouldn't surprise me.

270
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,119
So I have a Samsung TV and I bought it, I connected it to the internet.

271
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,950
I installed the new firmware because I assumed there would be magic update

272
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,859
or something.

273
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,260
And then I disconnected it from the internet and

274
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,359
it has never been connected to the internet since.

275
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,450
And I use fire TV on it.

276
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,739
My plan is to go to Costco get like the cheapest,

277
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,750
decent looking TV and just never plug it into the internet.

278
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,219
-- That
-- is
-- exactly what I did

279
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:56,280
and actually so fun fact, all of my tvs, I've,

280
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,380
I think I might have talked about this on the show a couple episodes ago but every TV,

281
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,619
I've owned last me about three years and then they just die

282
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:03,630
and

283
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,429
you can go to Costco and if your TV costs less than some amount,

284
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,929
I don't remember what it is even

285
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,450
it was, you get,

286
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,159
you can get a warranty for like 30 bucks for a five year warranty then from Costco.

287
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,130
So when my TV dies in three years, which I totally expect it to do,

288
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:20,359
I can bring it to Costco and they'll give me a new TV.

289
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,869
So I'm looking forward to that.

290
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,739
Well, and because the other thing I've noticed, for example,

291
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,859
every rental car I've driven, you scroll through it and you all see these,

292
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,369
you see these people's phones.

293
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,049
Yeah,

294
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:31,130
all paired and in some cases,

295
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,409
some of their contact list got dumped into the car's system.

296
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:37,289
-- So
-- that's a good example of most people don't know.

297
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,799
That's actually a problem because why would they,

298
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,849
they probably unpaired it on their phone.

299
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,409
Well, it's a very unapparent problem.

300
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:44,940
Right.

301
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,330
It's not,

302
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,609
it's like the same thing as a security flaw

303
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:50,969
where until somebody actually goes looking and poking around.

304
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,969
-- Yeah, you're not going to notice it. Now,
-- here's how I would explain that one.

305
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:56,330
How do we tell that to a normal person?

306
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:57,301
So,

307
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,481
when you pair your,

308
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,351
we don't, the answer is we don't, what we need to do is so this is,

309
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:05,000
this is where we frame communication.

310
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,291
We need to tell the developers of cars don't freaking save this stuff.

311
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,841
Like have a rental option or something, right? Like this is a pure techno

312
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,510
-- problem,
-- like have a rental mode for the car entertainment system.

313
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,351
Yeah, like when, when you know, you haven't seen the, I don't know, maybe I don't,

314
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,971
I don't know exactly how to do this, but you get the idea is I always,

315
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:26,992
I bucket these communication things into different places

316
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:28,721
and sometimes you need to talk to people,

317
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:30,372
sometimes you need to talk to engineers,

318
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:32,512
sometimes you need to talk to other security people.

319
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,892
And I don't think we ever make that determination.

320
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:38,081
We're like, oh, your coffee pot can be poked and burned on your house.

321
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:40,882
-- And it's like, ok, well, who are you telling that to
-- the other thing too?

322
00:13:40,892 --> 00:13:44,192
Is I keep coming back to is why are we allowing users to

323
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:47,492
make dangerous mistakes when it is actually

324
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:50,411
reasonably possible to engineer the system.

325
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:51,831
So those mistakes aren't possible.

326
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:52,531
Well,

327
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,572
it should be actually so funny enough,

328
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,802
you mentioned that I just read a news story this morning where Nist apparently is

329
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,552
coming up with some guidance on like

330
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:03,492
determining if something is a phishing attempt when

331
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:04,473
like

332
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,302
the first thing I thought of in reading, that is just,

333
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,872
this is just another way to shame users.

334
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:14,153
The answer is just fix the freaking technology. So fishing isn't a thing anymore.

335
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:14,732
Don't,

336
00:14:14,802 --> 00:14:19,002
-- don't try to bucket fishing attempts into a category
-- problem

337
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,422
with fishing is so you have what I would,

338
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:22,383
I would classify fishing into two main buckets,

339
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:25,883
technical and sort of non technical technical fishing would be like I

340
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:28,643
send you a password reset link and I intercept it and blah,

341
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:29,283
blah, blah, blah, blah.

342
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:33,234
And then there's non technical phishing where it's like, hey, you know, this is Bob.

343
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:36,294
I'm in a Mexican prison. I don't have access to my regular email address.

344
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:39,633
So I'm emailing you from this weird Gmail address and I need you to send me 500 bucks.

345
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:41,973
You're never going to make that go away. Exactly.

346
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:44,494
And then there's actually, you know what I would say, there's,

347
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:47,463
then there's sort of a third bucket which is the process fishing where it's,

348
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,544
you know, so for

349
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:53,325
locally that university based on an email reset the payment information for

350
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:57,155
a large contractor and sent like $10 million to some random bank account

351
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:59,484
and, you know, a big chunk of it went missing. Strangely,

352
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:02,164
that's just good old fashioned fraud.

353
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:06,794
Well, I was gonna say that that is weak internal controls because to me, if,

354
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:08,655
if I'm paying somebody on, like,

355
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:10,844
when I'm doing an electronic transfer to somebody online for like,

356
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:12,494
more than 20 bucks, I'm like, double checking.

357
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:13,775
Their email address is correct.

358
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:15,075
And if I'm,

359
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:17,476
if I was paying somebody 10 million dollars

360
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:20,166
and they supposedly sent me new payment details,

361
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:21,286
I would verify that.

362
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:23,625
I mean, I would hope so, but at the same time,

363
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:26,635
like if you're a company doing transactions of this size,

364
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,866
you probably have insurance to help protect you from this sort of problem.

365
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,616
And your insurance company is going to say

366
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:35,745
-- you have no internal controls. We're not insuring you.
-- Exactly.

367
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:38,015
And so, I mean, again, that's that

368
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:42,185
how was one person able to change or maybe not one person?

369
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:44,656
But how were these people able to change these payment details

370
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,200
in a way that was clearly wrong. Like there was no verification done.

371
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,409
There was no right.

372
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:53,280
You know, and again, that to me speaks that the business process is, well,

373
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,299
their internal controls are so fundamentally broken.

374
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:59,369
-- I have a hard time blaming the user at that point. No,
-- it's not the user's fault at all.

375
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,179
And again, like let's, let's, let's think about how you communicate this. Right.

376
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,109
It's easy to tell the story and laugh and be like a ha ha. They're so stupid

377
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,059
and you could blame the user for being stupid.

378
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,580
You could blame the company for being stupid.

379
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,460
You could blame maybe if they have insurance, the insurance company was stupid.

380
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,119
But

381
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,109
-- like who are you talking to? And what's our message here?
-- Right.

382
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:18,070
Well, and is the message actionable?

383
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,030
Right?

384
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:19,940
Because that's one thing that always,

385
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,739
every time somebody says check if links are safe before you click them,

386
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,109
I want to punch them in the face.

387
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:28,030
Yeah. What does that mean? Because they all go to a URL shortener. Yeah, exactly.

388
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,690
I just actually started paying for a Ur shortener to do some

389
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,010
testing because we have some long URL that I want shorter.

390
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,650
And one cool thing is URL shortener.

391
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,950
Of course, now can do things like, oh, based on country of origin,

392
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,450
we can send them different URL S based on time of day based on browser.

393
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,776
Oh my goodness. Right. Well, but that's the thing, right?

394
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:46,906
Like so somebody clicks on your shortened URL and you want to say like, OK, well,

395
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,505
if they're from Germany, show them the German ad.

396
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:50,625
If they're from England, show them the English ad.

397
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:54,276
If they're from America, you know, show them the American ad based on time of day,

398
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:56,606
you know, we want to show them the lunch special versus

399
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:59,575
for example, here's a, here's a shortened URL to our menu.

400
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:00,065
Well,

401
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:03,325
I'm going to show you the brunch menu or maybe the lunch menu or maybe the dinner menu,

402
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:03,955
right?

403
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:04,845
And so

404
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:05,595
I'm like,

405
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:09,165
this is actually this could be very useful for like advertising type stick.

406
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:11,720
You know, now, I don't have to build it in my application on my web server.

407
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,901
I can just do it at a rules level at this, you know,

408
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,020
$20 a month. URL shortening service.

409
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,099
And again, like, so, you know, here's the URL that goes to t.co slash bla

410
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,300
bla bla,

411
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,880
right? So I saw, what is that Twitter? I think

412
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,080
Twitter,

413
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:24,720
you know,

414
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,080
I was listening to a podcast where they were

415
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,570
talking about to this company and this company is,

416
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:27,730
you know,

417
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,181
they have these malware exploders where you basically run the document in

418
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:33,620
a sandbox and see if it like makes changes to the system.

419
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,620
And it's like now we have URL exploders where we actually like go and

420
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,358
download the URL and see does it drive by attack or something horrific happened?

421
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:43,628
We have phishing detection, you know, like keyword stuff and blah, blah, blah.

422
00:17:43,637 --> 00:17:44,968
And I'm thinking like, you know,

423
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:48,328
it reminds me of what Google gmail did where remember we used to put

424
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:51,147
like tracking beacons in email to see if people opened their email or not.

425
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,637
And Google had the response of cool,

426
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,458
-- like we're just going to download all those images and cash
-- them

427
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,358
exactly, which is awesome.

428
00:17:58,488 --> 00:17:58,767
Yeah,

429
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:00,078
they solved the problem.

430
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:04,517
And so it occurs to me that like if you send an email to me in a web page,

431
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:07,917
I kind of at this point want my, like, back end

432
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:10,793
them to, like, go grab that web page, render it,

433
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:14,994
make sure it's reasonably safe and then somehow serve me a cached copy.

434
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:17,593
-- If I click that link, I
-- would be comfortable with that.

435
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:21,343
Because what's the, there's no safe alternative other than don't click the link,

436
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:22,963
which is not going to happen.

437
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:27,213
I got to get my job done. Yeah, exactly. I mean, people send me links to things.

438
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,163
I have to click the links and

439
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,774
I do and, and not only that, let's face it.

440
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,053
How many, how many probably

441
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,813
trillions and trillions of links are sent every day

442
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,260
and what percent of them are actually malicious.

443
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,219
It's a very low percentage for sure.

444
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:44,310
Well, it's a very low percentage that gets through the initial spam filters.

445
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,109
I suspect on the back end there's a ton of traffic but it's just so dumb.

446
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,079
-- It gets filtered easy. I mean, and
-- there's definitely some of that for

447
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:50,540
sure.

448
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,660
Like I've really noticed spam filters have gotten better but I still get

449
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,760
a ton of spam for attendee lists and that key phrase right there,

450
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,969
attendee lists, right?

451
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,119
They're always spam.

452
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,130
I don't understand how this stuff gets through

453
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,780
-- Google's filters
-- unless people don't think it's spam.

454
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,910
I consistently market as spam and it keeps coming in.

455
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,109
And the other thing is I get a lot of Japanese spam and I

456
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,479
wish there was a way in my brow or in my gmail to say,

457
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,000
look, I only speak bad English.

458
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,150
-- So if it's not in English it's probably not for me.
-- Yes,

459
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:23,560
I know. I know exactly what you mean.

460
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:25,959
-- Oh,
-- and an uptick in Spanish spam,

461
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,119
I think. Yeah, that's Spanish. Yeah, the accent.

462
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:33,560
But anyways, so I just, yeah, how do we,

463
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:36,930
especially when the interface is opaque or the

464
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:42,869
the sort of failure mode is very subtle or hard to, you know, my smart TV,

465
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,260
somebody still has an account on it.

466
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,699
There are smart tvs that I have built in

467
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:47,900
cameras and microphones for doing Skype or whatever.

468
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,280
So that's, you know, a surveillance device. And so that's understandable.

469
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:54,329
But what if it doesn't have a microphone and camera like, oh somebody can like

470
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,439
view my Netflix

471
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:59,609
-- preferences or something? Like do I care?
-- Yes, you have to care.

472
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:02,993
So, OK, so that's another topic another day about.

473
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:07,682
Should I care about what seems to be minor information about me?

474
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:12,042
And the problem, the answer to that is yes, because if enough of it gets out,

475
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:14,812
you can paint a very disturbing picture of what's going on.

476
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:17,402
But that's a story for the other day. I'm not talking about that today.

477
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:20,833
So here is what I would say to round the square.

478
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:25,692
When we communicate about these security things,

479
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:31,076
we'll say be it an incident or a problem or an attack or whatever it is.

480
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:35,696
We're really bad at first explaining it in a coherent and reasonable manner.

481
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:39,235
But then there's also the question of like, what now? Right.

482
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:42,176
How do we, how do we look at something like? So let's say there's an attack.

483
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:42,926
Yeah.

484
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:45,176
This also presupposes that the technical

485
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:47,086
person explaining this actually understands it.

486
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:48,326
And I'll be blunt, I've met

487
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,875
a lot of people who think they understand something.

488
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,329
Um, but they're on that Dunning Kruger curve of like, no, you really don't.

489
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,729
Is it a star or a planet?

490
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,489
And the answer is it's a moon.

491
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,010
It's neither of those things.

492
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:02,689
Yes,

493
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,410
that is part of the problem is you have to understand

494
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,680
how to communicate about the thing you're talking

495
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,290
about if you don't have the vocabulary.

496
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,530
Well, you have to understand the thing you're communicating about.

497
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,489
-- Yeah,
-- I mean, that's part of it. Right. That's kind of step one.

498
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,410
And it, it can be hard to know if you do or don't understand

499
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,640
what's going on around you. And I don't know a good answer to that necessarily.

500
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,839
Well, I'll be blunt, how can anybody

501
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:29,359
possibly truly say they understand what smart TV S are and do unless

502
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,000
-- they work in a smart TV manufacturer
-- even then you probably can't.

503
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,839
I've used smart TV. S and it's clear that there's a lot going on under the hood

504
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,979
that I'm not aware of at all. Like the fact that some of them now have an antivirus.

505
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:44,949
I was like, what? But, oh, it is a computer.

506
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,290
No, like

507
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,270
it is.

508
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,400
The fact that I hadn't considered that proves that I'm

509
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,910
not really all that competent to talk about smart TV.

510
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,770
S and that's fair yet. We are so,

511
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,979
well, I hate to say, but we're probably the most competent of the least competent.

512
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:02,430
-- We have a
-- podcast. We could talk about anything we want with authority.

513
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,989
We have authority because we said so.

514
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,849
So, ok, so anyway, like this is all part of the story though, right?

515
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,540
Is, is there's an amount of understanding,

516
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,319
there's I think a difficult thing to do is just to say, I don't know.

517
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:18,530
-- And I don't think that happens very often
-- again, back to Dunning Kruger.

518
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,739
A lot of people don't know the bounds of their knowledge.

519
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:24,339
No one does. No one really knows the bounds of their knowledge.

520
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:24,900
I mean, this is,

521
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,219
I feel like this is the most important skill I'm teaching my Children is,

522
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:30,115
it's ok to say, I don't know

523
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:31,985
because my son will like, start making crap up.

524
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:35,645
And I'm like, do you know this or are you making this up? He's like, I'm making it up.

525
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:39,895
I'm like, so what is the actual answer to my question? He says, I don't know.

526
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:42,235
And you can tell he's like, God, dad got me again.

527
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:44,406
I know I do the same thing with Felix and Wolfe

528
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,225
-- and it's like,
-- it's important though.

529
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:48,395
Well, it's, and here's how I frame it.

530
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:52,391
-- I don't know, is the beginning of, but we can find,
-- yeah, exactly.

531
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:55,112
Like, let's look it up instead of making garbage up.

532
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,391
Let's just look up the answer and find out.

533
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,582
-- The
-- funny thing is there's a whole thing about this, you know,

534
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:00,732
confidence intervals.

535
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:01,911
There's like a whole

536
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:05,391
chunk of math and statistics to basically say how to,

537
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:09,391
what degree are we certain that this is correct or not correct necessarily.

538
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,771
But that this is a factual statement, you know, and, and I,

539
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:13,442
because I worked with a lot of ex-military

540
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:14,891
and law enforcement people back in the day.

541
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:18,989
And the one guy literally qualified almost every statement he made.

542
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,030
Like, if you literally, he gives the example of like my wife asked me,

543
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,939
is it raining outside?

544
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,680
And he will look outside and it's like raining outside and he'll be like,

545
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:27,959
I am highly confident it is raining outside.

546
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,079
It just, it was so ingrained in him because he was an intelligence officer,

547
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:34,319
even if you like know something is a fact,

548
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,920
maybe it's the other side playing tricks with you.

549
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,959
And like, it's a fake fact. I mean, that's fair.

550
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,280
And so he spent his whole life training this and training people. And so

551
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:42,785
actually,

552
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:45,685
I really enjoyed talking with him because you kind of

553
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:49,604
knew where the conversation stood on a factual basis of,

554
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:51,114
ok, he's very confident about that.

555
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,505
So it's pretty much guaranteed to be correct.

556
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,665
But on this other stuff he's saying, yeah, I'm not sure.

557
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,344
Or I'm not confident,

558
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:03,025
I would say this leads itself to a second half of our point of saying, I don't know,

559
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:05,285
is when you think, you know,

560
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:07,885
if someone questions your knowledge,

561
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:09,444
it is ok

562
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,290
and saying, well, let's look it up and make sure I'm right.

563
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,569
There's because I know so many people that if you say,

564
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,290
are you sure they become offended that you question their knowledge.

565
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,969
And it's like,

566
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,449
that's not how

567
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:23,569
-- truth works
-- and stuff changes,

568
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:24,849
it sometimes changes,

569
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:26,290
people remember things wrong.

570
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,069
I used to think I had a phenomenal memory

571
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,229
and I don't know if I just got older.

572
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,949
It was probably more likely I was just like a young a hole,

573
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,599
but like there's so many things now I look at them

574
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:40,655
and it's, it's, I think that is not what I'm remembering at all,

575
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:44,655
but it's obviously it's obviously not true what I remember.

576
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:47,944
So this is the real thing. And so, I mean, this is something important, right?

577
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:51,814
Is just that I don't know and being willing, willing to accept

578
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:55,275
a challenge to what I mean, essentially it's a challenge to your authority.

579
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:55,935
-- Let's face
-- it.

580
00:24:55,944 --> 00:25:00,305
I actually double check a lot of my knowledge now because part of it is also,

581
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:02,935
it's so easy now, like back in the day it was not easy.

582
00:25:02,944 --> 00:25:03,765
Yeah. Right. Right. Right.

583
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,719
I wanted to look up facts. You had to go to the library and hope they had a book on it.

584
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:08,949
Exactly tangent.

585
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:09,160
But I,

586
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,969
we just got our new downtown library just opened last week

587
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:14,670
and it is gorgeous and they have like 3d maker space.

588
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,859
They have a music studio.

589
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,170
They have, it's just the children's area is beyond amazing.

590
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,739
And they still have a bunch of cabinets with microfiche

591
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,849
with all the old microfiche stuff. Right.

592
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,020
Because it's just too expensive to digitize it all.

593
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,849
But the thing is the microfiche machines they have now. Holy cow.

594
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:32,224
They fancy looking

595
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:34,204
like the old ones where, you know,

596
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:38,714
you had like the plate and a light source and like the, the, the lens and a screen.

597
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:43,505
This one is like, oh man, it is all the way fancy. That's pretty cool actually.

598
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:45,045
So I'm actually looking forward to using them.

599
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:47,344
But, you know, I didn't want to touch stuff because in this time of COVID,

600
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:48,944
anything you touch,

601
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,464
the library has bins all over where you have to put the stuff in the bins and then they,

602
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:55,015
like, quarantine it for two weeks to make sure the surfaces are clean.

603
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:58,125
You can't wipe a book down with Lysol.

604
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,790
Well,

605
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,319
you can,

606
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,880
-- you shouldn't.
-- Yeah, but then your collection gets small fast, right?

607
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,839
So they're just taking the tact of, you know,

608
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,199
every time somebody touches a book it goes in a bin it goes in a room for like, yeah,

609
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,359
like one or two weeks

610
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,160
-- and then it goes back in the stacks.
-- That's wild.

611
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,984
Anyway. Anyway. OK, we're, we're running out of time.

612
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:21,755
So I don't, I don't wanna, I don't wanna dwell on COVID. So back to

613
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:25,295
like, like, how do we start all this stuff? And I would say step one,

614
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:28,454
I don't know, even if you think you do, it's OK to say, I don't know

615
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:32,155
because knowledge is a journey. But then we have to find ways to, to

616
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,400
understand the audience and understand who can help us.

617
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,760
Because like, so favorite example,

618
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,819
let's talk about the coffee pot burning down your house.

619
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:39,770
The story,

620
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,400
you tell the person building the coffee pot is going to be different than the story.

621
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,579
You tell the person buying the coffee pot,

622
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:46,420
right?

623
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,500
And in some instances,

624
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,050
the person buying the coffee pot might not even know or

625
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,939
care or need to know depending upon what's going on,

626
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,300
-- right?
-- In theory, every electronic I buy should be

627
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,140
or whatever listed so that it literally specifically does not burn my hose down.

628
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,849
-- Yeah,
-- but you can,

629
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:04,381
you can get a listing because they aren't going, I mean,

630
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:08,202
they might try to hack a coffee pot, but it's highly likely

631
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:09,952
they're not going to get that far.

632
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:12,562
And there's, there's also going to be things you can do.

633
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,552
Like for example, let's say it has a cut off switch,

634
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:17,641
-- but if you can disable the cut off switch in software, well,
-- well, for example,

635
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:20,381
-- you could just have a thermal fuse
-- and that's the right answer.

636
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:23,901
-- But at the same time, so let's say you don't,
-- that's an extra 10 cents per unit.

637
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:24,891
Well, not just that.

638
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:28,741
Does anyone even know you might think? Oh, my software cut off switch is just fine.

639
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:29,421
Well, is it,

640
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:34,043
who's there to tell you? It's not, how are we going to even even learn?

641
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:34,864
That's a problem.

642
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:37,303
Does the insurance company know to ask questions like this,

643
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:39,484
does underwriter labs know to ask questions like this?

644
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:41,823
And the answer is probably not, not right now.

645
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,823
And not only that, how many,

646
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,953
how many legitimate coffee pot attacks are going to burn down someone's house?

647
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:47,193
Right?

648
00:27:47,203 --> 00:27:51,784
The number is probably zero right now and my guess is in 10 years which Lord forbid,

649
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:53,043
we're still talking about this.

650
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:56,313
-- It's probably still going to be single digits. Most
-- likely. I agree.

651
00:27:56,323 --> 00:27:57,984
I mean, I just, I keep coming back to that,

652
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:00,745
that concern that self driving cars are a

653
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:04,465
computer with 1000 pounds of mass and velocity.

654
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:08,676
And so while coffee pots may not, you know, run you down, there are going to be

655
00:28:08,826 --> 00:28:12,745
systems hooked up to the internet that that can and, and that's fair.

656
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:16,755
I think part of my concern is I don't necessarily think the whole industry

657
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:18,066
that makes anything that attaches to the

658
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,005
internet needs to really think about safety.

659
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:23,416
But a perfect example of this, this is why I won't buy a smart door lock is,

660
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:24,985
I'm not concerned about somebody hacking it.

661
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:28,047
I'm concerned about that thing not letting me my house when it's minus 40.

662
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:30,758
-- I understand that completely
-- because that has happened,

663
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:34,427
-- like across all of Britain at one point,
-- people who live in nice places are like,

664
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:35,878
what's he talking about?

665
00:28:35,887 --> 00:28:36,868
Minus 40

666
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:41,958
fun fact for the audience minus 40 is the same in Celsius and Fahrenheit,

667
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:43,387
it is minus 40.

668
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:44,488
Another fun fact for the audience,

669
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:46,137
there's only one country

670
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:49,228
-- that we have to use that disclaimer
-- for. Is it my country?

671
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:53,378
-- Liberia and Myanmar went metric
-- a few years ago

672
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:53,767
for them.

673
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:54,277
Good for

674
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:54,437
them.

675
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,098
You're the only

676
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:55,849
left out

677
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:56,890
there.

678
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,270
There's a video I will put in the show notes where there's people like to say, oh,

679
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,819
there's two kinds of countries in the world.

680
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:04,890
There's countries that use the metric system and countries that

681
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,920
went to the moon and this youtuber made this this.

682
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,430
But no, no,

683
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,949
it's funny though because this youtuber made this

684
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,229
brilliant video talking about Werner Von Braun,

685
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,319
who was the German who actually built a rocket that brought us to the moon

686
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:17,750
and he's, and Von Braun starts talking and the guy goes,

687
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,670
listen to that thick Alabama accent.

688
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,670
I've not, I've not laughed that hard

689
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,031
in a long time and actually Von Braun insisted

690
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,151
on using the metric system for everything he did.

691
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:30,102
Well, I think NASA still does, don't they?

692
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:31,871
Anyone reasonably uses it?

693
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:36,391
-- And I know the US military does and
-- English units are insane.

694
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,682
How many inches is two miles? I have no idea.

695
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:41,952
-- Well,
-- foot pounds of torque, everything.

696
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:43,261
-- It's all, it's all
-- ridiculous.

697
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:45,072
And if you want to read a really great

698
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:48,232
shenanigans is go read about operation paper clip.

699
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:52,232
-- I don't know what that is.
-- That's where basically the US decided, hey,

700
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,560
as bad as some of these people were,

701
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:57,359
they scooped up 1600 German scientists post World War two.

702
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,000
Von Braun and his V two rocket team.

703
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,719
-- Alright.
-- Alright, I'm gonna, I'll give you the last word on this one man.

704
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:05,989
-- Take us home.
-- I just honestly,

705
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,579
the way I buy electronics now is by buying them

706
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,569
at a place that offers a one year money back.

707
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:13,569
We don't care because I'm reasonably certain they're not going to sell me garbage.

708
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,510
And that's all I got like because there's

709
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,959
I I work in this industry and I am in no way qual

710
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,479
like how is Costco going to let me borrow like 20 different TV.

711
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:23,640
S and run pen tests on them to find a secure one.

712
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:27,439
And more to the point I'm not going to ever do that because like I have a life to live.

713
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,270
That is also true. The answer is just don't hook up to the internet.

714
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,390
Well, the answer is basically admit defeat in a way and just say, look,

715
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,520
I don't trust or like this TV, the supposed capabilities it has built in.

716
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,579
I'm going to reasonably trust Apple or Amazon firestick and use that instead.

717
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:44,709
I mean, that's probably fair.

718
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,479
That sucks because that's, you know,

719
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:48,969
that's an extra 102 100 bucks on the top of the TV.

720
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,890
And I've also got this giant chunk of electronics that's not being used.

721
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:54,150
I mean, that's fair.

722
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:57,489
I think if I was going to give the message to normal people, it just don't,

723
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,969
don't trust it no matter what it is.

724
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:01,369
You buy a house with the security system, don't trust it.

725
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,430
Call the company, make sure it's yours. You know, I'm going to

726
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:04,770
end it.
