0
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,150
So one thing I wanted to work on the show couldn't figure out a way to is so, you know,

1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,150
c sis the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,110
Uh, sure.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,939
So they have a parking problem. Their big office out in, uh, wherever it is in Ontario

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,310
doesn't have enough parking.

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,829
So they've been parking on the side streets and getting tickets.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,030
And so they were asking homeowners to like,

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,670
let them pay to park on their like driveways and

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,350
some of the homeowners actually, like, paved their backyards to provide parking.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,549
And so of course, the city then got pissed off and like,

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,700
you can't sell parking on private property without like this huge

11
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:36,750
list of insane stuff and like a million dollars of insurance and

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,110
blah, blah, blah.

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,270
Anyways, it's in the papers here. It's awesome.

14
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:48,430
Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast.

15
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,709
Episode 181 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

16
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:53,919
-- How are
-- you doing, Kurt?

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,319
Pretty good. Pretty good. It's not minus 30 anymore.

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,259
-- Minus 30
-- seven doesn't really matter. It's minus 30 F is also cool.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,599
It's really cold,

20
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,910
like, just below freezing and I'm just I'm so looking forward to,

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,589
-- you know,
-- you know,

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,330
what pleases me about these conversations about the weather is somewhere someday

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,730
someone is going to be listening to this in a lovely place

24
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,360
that never gets cold is going to be like,

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,839
why do these idiots keep talking about the weather?

26
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:24,050
I'm not sure that's going to be the case because,

27
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:24,279
uh,

28
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:27,147
you know, with all the CO2 it as a species,

29
00:01:27,156 --> 00:01:29,207
I'm not sure there's going to be any nice weather anymore.

30
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:31,857
Well, there, there might be,

31
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:35,067
but it's probably where we live because it'll go from just

32
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:40,967
hot to less hot as opposed to dangerously hot and murderously hot. But anyway,

33
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:43,586
so, sim swaps that's been hot on Twitter.

34
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:47,626
Yeah, man, I, it's one of those things that I have a suspicion, the,

35
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:51,384
the idea of SIM swaps and S MS two factor off and just all

36
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:54,103
the dangers behind it is going to keep coming up and keep coming up.

37
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:59,844
One quick note, it's not just S MS two factor, but there's also the, you know,

38
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,204
where they actually phone you and read out the six

39
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:03,134
pin number. So

40
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:06,433
let's use the term S MS off because I think that's what everybody knows it does.

41
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:08,083
But just to be clear to everybody,

42
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:12,501
we're also talking about the more general case where your phone number is,

43
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,220
they're sending something to your phone number either via voice or via text and,

44
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:17,481
well,

45
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,731
-- hopefully it's you and not some bad guy receiving it
-- and we can discuss it more later.

46
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,240
But it's even more than that because for example, you could call the bank and be like,

47
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:28,341
oh, I'm Josh to prove it's me, call me back at the number on file

48
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:32,201
and then they call my mobile and it's like not Josh, but whatever, we'll,

49
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,680
we'll get to that.

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,740
But anyway, yeah. So,

51
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,580
so sim swaps are hip again.

52
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,600
-- So we figured it's probably a good episode to talk about it
-- in fairness.

53
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,979
Those people actually have some data, right?

54
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,550
And this is one of my biggest complaints about

55
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:47,059
all these whingey complaints about cybersecurity and information security.

56
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,660
My comment is always ok. So you've made some conclusion, what data is it based on

57
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,740
and the answer is they, they

58
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,580
went out and it's not a ton of data.

59
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:56,839
But this is one of those things where it's kind

60
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,220
of a pain in the butt to generate the data.

61
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,940
So I'll give them that,

62
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:01,779
but they actually went out and what was it something like 20 different providers?

63
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:02,259
And they,

64
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,330
they basically went and tried to execute some swap attack

65
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,369
against an account on each of these 20 providers.

66
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,759
That was pretty cool.

67
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,720
And they were and what and also to clarify,

68
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,350
minor thing is they executed like a social engineering type of attack, right?

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,860
Like they,

70
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,649
they basically called in and you know,

71
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,759
I am Josh,

72
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:27,250
I want to change my SIM card to this guy in Canada it's totally legit. Yo. Exactly.

73
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,479
So, because I think we mentioned in a previous episode,

74
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,929
I forget about Laura Shin talking about her SIM swap experience where

75
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,289
this attacker basically

76
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,395
fished and compromised a, uh,

77
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:40,904
like a phone company employee,

78
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:42,294
like somebody who works at like one of those mall kiosk

79
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,425
style phone stores

80
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:50,005
and then use that access to get on a PC that to do, like they do mass sim swap attacks.

81
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:50,455
Like they just,

82
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:53,835
it's like, um, it's like credential stuffing. Right. They just,

83
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:55,695
they, they get into, you know,

84
00:03:56,115 --> 00:04:00,595
dozens or hundreds of people's phones, phone numbers rather not into their phones.

85
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:02,535
Their phones are, I'm gonna say, hopefully safe.

86
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,500
And, um, and then as I understand it,

87
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,509
they literally just go to Facebook and go forgot

88
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,050
my account and plug in all the phone numbers.

89
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:08,410
They've just

90
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,990
hijacked.

91
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,119
Yep. Yep. So we should

92
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:16,040
maybe start by discussing like, what is a SIM swap attack?

93
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,369
Because I'm sure there's some people who don't know what that is.

94
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,510
-- Well, let's back it up real quick. So, what is a SIM card?
-- That's

95
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,359
true, actually.

96
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,700
Well, I, you know, it's one of those things where everybody has one but like,

97
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,000
do you know how to change the transmission flute in your car?

98
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,140
No, nobody does.

99
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,730
-- I do know how to do that
-- because you're weird

100
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:32,149
and

101
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,450
I know how to change my SIM because actually funny enough

102
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,470
now, I mean, everything has it in the US for the most part now,

103
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,959
but there was a time when we had

104
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,140
-- iphones, they have virtual sims
-- now.

105
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,570
That's different.

106
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:44,010
But I'm,

107
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:47,250
I'm talking about CD MA technology which did not use SIM cards and

108
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,380
there was GSM technology which did in Europe was full of GSM.

109
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,769
And I remember I was very specific about like I want a GSM phone,

110
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,839
obviously meant I had to use a GSM phone provider so I could

111
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,010
go to Europe and swap my SIM cards out while I was there.

112
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:00,720
Which was awesome.

113
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,000
The idea is basically a cell phone and I'm going to say a modern cell phone.

114
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,269
So let's not talk about CDMA because who cares? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Who cares?

115
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,850
Basically if it was, if it wasn't GSM or later, it didn't happen. It was terrible.

116
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,079
That's right. So as a complete aside, I was watching this documentary on at and ts

117
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,720
early cell phone technology where they had like

118
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,209
10 radio channels for all of New York.

119
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,489
And so basically only 10 cell phone calls could happen at a time.

120
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,410
But what was most fascinating about this documentary is they show

121
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,640
everybody using these giant brick phones or not even brick phones,

122
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:29,720
but like phones built into their

123
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,029
while they're driving and like staring down to like use a rotary dialer and stuff.

124
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,950
And it just made me laugh because we've gone from like all these people saying like,

125
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,959
oh, this is the most convenient thing ever.

126
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,369
I can make phone calls while I'm in my truck.

127
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,359
My work truck going from site A to site b, I don't have to pull off and, like,

128
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,660
find a pay phone, blah, blah, blah.

129
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,850
Now, as I understand it pretty much everywhere in the western world is like, yeah.

130
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,059
No, you can't be holding your phone.

131
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,410
That's like here it's, I think it's 170 bucks and three points on your license.

132
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,630
Like, it's, you know, they're, they're pretty serious about it.

133
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,109
They were simpler times.

134
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,779
Yeah, it's kind of comic to me how it started out

135
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,220
and now we've gone full pendulum. But anyway, so a SIM card, the idea is your phone

136
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,519
has, well, basically a Mac address, right?

137
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:10,359
An IME I number something mobile, something, something I forget what it stands for.

138
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:10,959
I don't,

139
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,929
I couldn't tell you what it stands

140
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,809
-- for either
-- international mobile equipment identity.

141
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,559
So it's basically a Mac address for the phone.

142
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,679
And the cool thing is, for example, with that, if your phone gets stolen,

143
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,910
you can register that.

144
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,989
Iiime I number as stolen and in theory,

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,619
no legitimate provider will then provide service to that phone.

146
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,619
So if somebody buys it, they can't use it. So that's cool.

147
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,399
The phone has an identity. Cool. But

148
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,510
the phone is not necessarily me, like if I drop and smash my phone,

149
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,510
I probably want to go get a new one

150
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,350
-- and have and not change phone numbers.
-- I mean,

151
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,170
-- that's the idea or
-- more to the point, like you said, if you're traveling to Europe,

152
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,589
right, you maybe want to take your phone.

153
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:45,859
And,

154
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,309
you know, my mom does this every time she goes to Germany, she pops out,

155
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,100
her SIM card gets one from like, well, T Mobile actually,

156
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,619
because that's who you buy stuff from in Germany

157
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,000
for like 10 or 20 bucks.

158
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,500
And then she texts me and she's like, you know,

159
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,059
this is my new phone number for the next three weeks or whatever.

160
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,339
And it's super convenient and cheap

161
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,149
because I remember actually this is only even 10 years ago with my

162
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,670
most phone providers in Canada,

163
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:11,420
it would basically be cheaper to buy a phone free and clear in Europe than it is to,

164
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:13,859
like, use my, my roaming plan over there.

165
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:17,670
Oh, I have no doubt roaming used to be ridiculously expensive.

166
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,160
I mean, I remember probably

167
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,024
-- 10 years ago
-- you forget Canada,

168
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:24,554
we paid the most amount of money for cell service anywhere in the world.

169
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:28,975
That is sad because actually I have, like, I have European roaming now.

170
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:32,035
It's, it's a couple of bucks a month to add on to my plans.

171
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:34,954
So when I go to, in fact, when I was in Canada, just

172
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:36,674
what was it like, three or four months ago.

173
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,579
Yeah. Like my phone worked as if I was in the United States.

174
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,140
You probably paid less for Rome here than I pay.

175
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,820
I paid, I paid $0 to go Roman Canada Curt, because it was just included in my cell plan.

176
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:52,299
It's lovely and same thing in Europe. I go to Europe. My phone just works.

177
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:54,299
It's, it's awesome. My only complaint

178
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:59,649
is that when I'm in Europe my phone knows it's on roaming and every time I,

179
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,730
I have a pixel three, every time

180
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,070
the

181
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,029
pixel. Oh, no.

182
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,769
What's that?

183
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:05,339
That's like a

184
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:05,709
Google

185
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:05,989
Android

186
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,109
-- phone. Yeah, it's
-- a Google phone. No, it's pixel two. I apologize. Not the three.

187
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,100
It's a pixel two.

188
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,609
And when it's in roaming

189
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,899
it is trying very hard to find a home tower. And so my battery drains very, very fast.

190
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,959
But other than that,

191
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,320
oh, because it's trying to find your native carrier. Not like, oh my God, who's this

192
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:22,470
guy?

193
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,500
I wish I could be like, I'm in Europe. It's cool. Stop.

194
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,970
-- Can
-- you, I know in an iphone you can set your preferred provider. You can reset that.

195
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,359
So I, I kind of, I can pick

196
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,979
a, like a, I forget what they call it. Like this

197
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,063
name of a provider.

198
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:40,693
But when I'm walking around towns, I jump between different providers

199
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:43,254
and it's just, it's really wants to phone home.

200
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:43,854
Right.

201
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:47,614
So it would, if I, if I said, like, only use this one provider,

202
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:50,664
it would almost certainly cut out at some point because I would stop using

203
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,133
that tower and need to switch to a different tower and it wouldn't,

204
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:53,273
it

205
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:53,593
wouldn't

206
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:55,914
-- work. But
-- whatever in Europe, they're pretty dense. Yeah.

207
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,653
Right. So, anyway,

208
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:00,294
so that's the phone. And then the SIM card basically has

209
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:01,909
your identity,

210
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,349
like your identity, like in the form of like your phone number.

211
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:11,000
Because theoretically speaking, if you, um, so phones can be locked to carriers,

212
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,260
which is what they used to do

213
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,090
to, well, basically get you to pay your bill. Right.

214
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:15,940
So you couldn't just, like,

215
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:20,369
get a phone on a plan and then like hop over to some other carrier that's cheaper,

216
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,799
you know, because they're subsidizing the phone by having you on the plan,

217
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,369
whatever that's all changed in Canada.

218
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,739
I don't know about the US. It

219
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,650
kind of in the US. You can't sell locked phones anymore. Yay.

220
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:35,719
They, it's, I don't know, I think they can sell them but you can get it unlocked.

221
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:36,900
There's some weirdness.

222
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,973
-- It, I know the
-- same in Canada used to be, you could get it unlocked,

223
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:41,732
but like they would charge you 50 bucks to unlock

224
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:42,853
it and they would only do it if you were,

225
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:46,853
you know, you were paid for, but now it has to be unlocked because it just,

226
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:49,192
it was way too abusive to consumers.

227
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:50,973
Yeah, it's terrible. The SIM card

228
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:54,843
also has data storage and that's kind of the cool thing because for example,

229
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:55,552
I remember

230
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,533
my first phone with a SIM card and then I upgraded phones,

231
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:01,302
popped my old SIM card into my new phone and boo,

232
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:04,616
there's my context there's all my addresses and all that stuff.

233
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,416
I remember those days, you know,

234
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:10,976
trying to enter all of your address book into like a T nine smartphone

235
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:15,116
-- like, oh so T nine is oh yeah, let's go back way in time here folks. What?
-- No, we're

236
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:17,726
no, we're talking about sim swapping like

237
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:21,736
we're going to end up talking about iron ore pretty soon at this rate.

238
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:25,236
So SIM cards basically separate your identity from the physical phone,

239
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:25,875
which is good,

240
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:26,495
you know.

241
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:27,375
And so

242
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,479
the problem becomes though is that the SIM

243
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:31,179
card separates your identity from the phone.

244
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,750
So if I can

245
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,929
essentially, I can go buy a SIM card for like what five or 10 bucks,

246
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,969
like a blank SIM card

247
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,260
with pretty much any carrier will sell them now for five or 10 bucks.

248
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,820
And then, well, the trick is I need to get your phone number pointed at it.

249
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:45,849
And

250
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,609
well, there's a couple of ways to do this.

251
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:49,270
The, the I'm not going to say the easiest one,

252
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,030
but the most straightforward one would be a social engineering attack

253
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,280
where you phone up the phone provider and you say like,

254
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:58,489
oh, my phone got stolen or lost or whatever, right?

255
00:10:58,716 --> 00:10:58,846
When

256
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,575
AWOL I need, you know,

257
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:04,216
you to direct my phone number to this SIM card which has this serial number and

258
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:07,935
it's got like some really tiny print on the back of it with a serial number.

259
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:12,255
And you know, they, they quote, unquote, verify your identity, big air quotes here.

260
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:13,995
You know, usually, like, what's your name, date of birth?

261
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:15,625
If you're lucky, maybe they'll ask you like,

262
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:17,616
how much was your last cell phone bill or something?

263
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:21,145
They're not going to have a ton of great ways to authenticate you.

264
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:24,226
But honestly, most people can't, you know, find out about you on Facebook.

265
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:28,202
Right. And that's, I mean, that's super common where, I mean, what do they call it? Os

266
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:31,461
N open source intelligence where you just do searches about people

267
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:34,901
and you can generally find an insane amount of information.

268
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:35,132
Yeah.

269
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:37,892
-- And so
-- then I get your phone number pointed at my SIM card, put my,

270
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:40,091
put the SIM card in a phone and I

271
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:43,221
can start recovering passwords and accounts and whatever.

272
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,552
And that's that there are people with accounts that are protected by two

273
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:50,081
factor authentication in the form of S MS or phone message or whatever

274
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,229
that are, you know, that literally have a lot of money in them like bank accounts,

275
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,510
-- brokerage accounts,
-- Cryptocurrency exchanges, man,

276
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,250
I was going to say Cryptocurrency exchanges

277
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,369
because once that Bitcoin leaves the wallet,

278
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,429
it's gone.

279
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,330
Yeah, exactly. And like it's never coming back

280
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:09,559
and what gets me, what kind of annoys me. So I, I like that this is resurgent on twit

281
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:11,640
because they actually did some work and studied

282
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,130
it and got some data and that's great.

283
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,109
But like my local police, the Edmonton police service who you know, is not

284
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,380
some super high tech FBI NSA C si whatever crime fighting force, like they're,

285
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,559
they're technically competent but, you know, they're not cybercrime, they're,

286
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,989
they're like city police guy.

287
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:28,539
They

288
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:31,960
not only have had multiple warnings about SIM Swap,

289
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:34,229
they have a giant web page dedicated to it.

290
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,000
That's pretty cool. Yeah.

291
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,669
So they talk about SIM swap fraud.

292
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:37,830
You know,

293
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,380
identity theft and identity fraud are on the

294
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,780
rise and oftentimes fraud or fraudsters will override your

295
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:43,309
privacy rights by gaining control of your cell

296
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,479
phone and stealing the valuable information in it,

297
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,919
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

298
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,880
A. So here's one, I'm not sure if this is correct.

299
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,299
But anyways,

300
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:53,799
they say a SIM card does not contain highly personal and sensitive information,

301
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:54,739
like pictures and videos.

302
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,539
I'm actually pretty sure modern SIM cards,

303
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,210
some of them have a lot of storage and can actually store that data.

304
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:01,390
I would be shocked if any of them do though.

305
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,690
I mean,

306
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,859
you can store phone numbers on SIM cards but I have never heard

307
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:10,570
of a SIM card storing anything other than text messages and phone numbers.

308
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,330
I would like.

309
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,539
The problem is I was trying to Google SIM card and storage,

310
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,210
but it keeps coming up with like cell phone plans.

311
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, that doesn't,

312
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:20,380
you know what this is a good task for the listeners.

313
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:26,219
Someone knows of a way to store anything other than phone numbers and text messages.

314
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:28,179
-- I'm
-- pretty sure one of my early phones.

315
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,979
Let me store my pictures on my SIM card because that was one of the,

316
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:34,289
also the selling points is the SIM card had a couple of megabytes of storage.

317
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:35,059
I seem to remember

318
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,590
maybe it's a false memory.

319
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:39,770
I don't know anyways and, and then they talk about what a SIM card uh

320
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,640
does contain which is yeah, your text messages back up a bit.

321
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,750
A SIM card also does not contain, they say your home address,

322
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,700
your bank account number, your doctor's name or other details.

323
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,000
Unless you specifically write those details into a text S

324
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,229
MS message or specify those details in your contact list.

325
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,479
And the reality is

326
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:58,229
I'm pretty sure most of us have our home address in our contact list because well,

327
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:58,789
we just do,

328
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,049
I wonder if I do actually, I don't know if I do. I probably do.

329
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:08,669
It's well uh with an iphone now Siri data minds and you know, does suggestions,

330
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,159
which is kind of cool because like I get a phone

331
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:12,750
call and it says probably so and so based on a,

332
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,750
you know, email and it's like in the footer of email, the person's phone number.

333
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,210
And I'm like,

334
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,219
that's actually pretty nifty. I like that. Thank you.

335
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,080
Yeah, I don't, I don't have my doctor in here but I,

336
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,479
but then they say what it does contain, which is like, yeah,

337
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,960
it's all your text messages.

338
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:28,960
So that's, you know, especially for younger people. That's,

339
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,799
that's everything your phone contacts, history of calls, blah, blah, blah.

340
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:38,059
Certain cellular carriers state that application transfer over certain cellar

341
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,020
certain,

342
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,890
ok, they mangled the sentence. I don't know what this means. Certain,

343
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,030
I'm assuming cellular carriers state that

344
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,479
applications transfer over maybe onto the

345
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:47,770
SIM card. Whatever.

346
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,190
Anyways, the last location of the phone,

347
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,289
which is often useful in locating missing people.

348
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,010
Cool.

349
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,020
Yeah, if I can hijack your SIM card, I don't care about the date on it.

350
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,210
I care about getting your phone number so that I can be you. Right.

351
00:14:58,219 --> 00:15:01,609
But that's harder to explain. I suspect when you're

352
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,729
not a security weirdo.

353
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,609
I mean,

354
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:06,489
I, I understand

355
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,799
why they wrote that stuff down because it's technically true and I

356
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:13,049
think it's more relatable to more people because if I tell someone

357
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,169
I can sim swap your phone

358
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:20,599
and I can basically make and receive phone calls from your cell phone number,

359
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:22,919
most people would be like, who cares?

360
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,039
They talk about how to conduct a SIM swap,

361
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,549
you know, talking about like the social engineering side,

362
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,080
how to instructions for future criminals.

363
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,330
-- And
-- then they also talk about signs of a swap,

364
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,090
which I think is pretty fascinating because this seems to be a universal thing is if

365
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:37,030
your phone receives no signal or says emergency

366
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,669
calls only even after restarting the phone,

367
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,929
then use another phone to call your provider

368
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,219
and have them check the status immediately.

369
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:45,400
And this is a common thing I hear in all the SIM swap cases is everybody's like, oh,

370
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:45,570
yeah.

371
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,890
You know, my phone went kind of wonky and like, oh, whatever,

372
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,650
I'll deal with it in the morning.

373
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:49,590
So I went to bed

374
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,109
or, luckily they're like,

375
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:54,929
I didn't go to bed and I called my provider to figure out what the heck was going on.

376
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,710
And they're like, oh, no, it's cool. You, you changed your SIM card?

377
00:15:57,984 --> 00:15:59,294
Yeah. Right.

378
00:15:59,455 --> 00:15:59,905
Yeah,

379
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:01,054
they talk about,

380
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:04,255
here's what fascinating they talk about how to prevent phone takeovers.

381
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,515
And they basically, and this is the number one thing that

382
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:07,744
pretty much is,

383
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:11,284
I think the only real piece of advice is putting a pin number on your account.

384
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:13,155
And what's fascinating is about a month ago, I was

385
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:16,505
doing some cyber hygiene stuff and I went into my account,

386
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,950
didn't have a PIN number. So,

387
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:21,700
so I have a pin number that I never remember

388
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:25,739
and they always reset it for me when I call the cell phone company.

389
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,140
It's embarrassing.

390
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,059
-- I put mine in last pass now.
-- I don't even know what mine is, nor is it in last pass. And

391
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,099
so actually I think I feel like we might have

392
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:38,140
talked about this on the show a couple episodes ago,

393
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,789
but I had an incident where I needed to log into the

394
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,650
website for my cell phone and I didn't know my secret questions.

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,929
And so I called up the company and it ended up being

396
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,469
a huge weird snafu because I actually know the questions but whatever

397
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,619
I called the company.

398
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,530
And I'm like, I don't know these questions like, well, we can't help you.

399
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,820
I'm like, what do you mean? They said we can't reset these.

400
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,809
I said, well, what do you accept me? Expect me to do that? And they said,

401
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:02,609
oh, you have to register like a new account with a new email address.

402
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,290
I said, I even said, I said,

403
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,858
I'm literally going to switch cell phone providers before

404
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:09,089
I create like a Gmail account just for this.

405
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,170
Like for real.

406
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,469
And they, they, they didn't care and they couldn't do anything about it.

407
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,560
And then funny enough,

408
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:16,459
I tried logging in the next day and it didn't ask me

409
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:19,050
the security questions and then I changed them to something I knew.

410
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,880
But it was like this is been beyond ridiculous.

411
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,280
And so, well, at least with my provider,

412
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,890
I can only set a four digit pin and I'm

413
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,810
guessing you get three or four attempts to guess it,

414
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,599
which means

415
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:31,270
there's a reasonable chance you can get somebody's pin number.

416
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,530
-- It's not great, but it's not impossible,
-- whatever. Let's assume not.

417
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,229
Yeah.

418
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,420
And then I love this second piece of advice.

419
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:42,290
Do not publish your phone number on your public profile on social media,

420
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,709
which I agree with in principle.

421
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:48,569
But you know, some people kind of have to like, say my lawyer

422
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,530
for some weird reason, my lawyer puts her cell phone number on, like,

423
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,050
all of the website and stuff.

424
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,640
-- Wow, that's wild.
-- She travels around a lot. Right.

425
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,390
She's not stuck in her office all the time.

426
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,300
-- But
-- if I was a lawyer or really any sort of business person,

427
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,599
-- then
-- how would you get your phone calls from your paying clients?

428
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:07,089
I would have like, some sort of answer.

429
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:07,349
You know,

430
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,420
there's those answering services you can essentially use where like it can

431
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,170
bring your cell phone or you'll just go to a voicemail.

432
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,189
I guess that would be a solution.

433
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:14,949
But honestly, I,

434
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,010
I feel like it's a lot less hassle to just have people be

435
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,069
able to call you on your cell phone like a normal human being.

436
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,270
-- And that's,
-- I mean, sure, I, I'm not going to argue that one hardcore either way.

437
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:28,550
And, and look, man, I would say I'm a, I'm a great example of my mobile.

438
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,189
I've had the same mobile phone for like 20 years now

439
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,030
and

440
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,270
I've met

441
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,130
a lot of people, I've handed out a lot of business card and honestly finding my,

442
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,489
my cell phone number isn't very hard at all.

443
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,290
And I bet if someone like DM Ed me on Twitter, it was like, hey,

444
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,050
what's your phone number?

445
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,920
I want to call you.

446
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:49,880
I bet there's a 99.9% chance I'm going to reply with my cell phone number.

447
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,329
-- So
-- what's interesting to me is I actually do

448
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,650
keep a tab on my cell phone number to make

449
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,930
sure it's not showing up in Google with my name.

450
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:00,729
Now, obviously, my phone number shows up in all the

451
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,310
reverse directory searches,

452
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,819
but it doesn't have any data other than the

453
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:06,689
generic which carrier belongs or used to belong to.

454
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:09,469
So I've actually been pretty successful with that over the years.

455
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:12,109
But anyway, so number three is review your credit card bills,

456
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,989
bank statements and phone bills if something doesn't add up,

457
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,869
report it immediately.

458
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:15,150
Yeah,

459
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,760
except I don't get those for like 30 days and sometimes Attackers

460
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,650
will line that up at the beginning of a billing cycle.

461
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,109
So that you, yeah, it's like four weeks later. You're like, whoops. Yep. Yep.

462
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,290
So, and then number four, I actually like,

463
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,250
but I don't think they took far enough is do not

464
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,619
use the same user names and passwords across several websites.

465
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,209
Make your passwords long complicated and difficult to guess. No.

466
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,310
-- Use a password manager.
-- Well, yes, but

467
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,969
don't. Yes. Yes. Yes, I agree.

468
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:42,930
So, honestly not the worst advice and then general tips to keep your device safer,

469
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:44,170
you know, password protect your device.

470
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,150
I'm always shocked when, like,

471
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,520
when my kids were younger they would pick up anybody's phone and start, you know,

472
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,239
trying to play with it.

473
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,329
Right. Because phones are awesome

474
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,849
and the number of people where

475
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,239
their phone wasn't

476
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,329
like locked,

477
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,739
like they didn't have a PIN number or anything. I was just like,

478
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:03,119
-- what, like, who are
-- you? I still know a lot of people that don't

479
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:03,920
and

480
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:06,660
I think the fingerprints and the biometrics have

481
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,040
made that a lot easier because I've noticed

482
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,329
now most people I know with a biometric sensor will at least have their phone locked.

483
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:13,949
But, yeah, I mean,

484
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:17,449
a couple of years back I knew lots and lots of people especially will say

485
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,160
people of a certain generation.

486
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,079
Yeah. Ok.

487
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,849
But,

488
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:27,359
but they, uh, they often did not put locks on their phone and whatever. Either way.

489
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,329
I,

490
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,300
that's one of those situations where

491
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,880
if you, as long as you have your phone, it's not a huge deal. Yes.

492
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,020
If you misplace it or someone steals it or whatever.

493
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,890
-- But
-- I feel like it's in the same category of not locking your front door.

494
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,859
People should not go into your house and stealing your stuff.

495
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,920
But at the same time I personally feel a bit stupid and embarrassed if I just left my

496
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:49,373
door unlocked and got robbed.

497
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:52,032
Well, your insurance company isn't going to pay for anything either.

498
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,733
-- They're going to be annoyed
-- with me. Right.

499
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:57,213
If you're like, oh, someone broke in and stole my TV. And I didn't lock my front door.

500
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:01,012
They'd be like, well, that was neat. You know, you're on your own.

501
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,892
What really gets me with the SIM swapping thing is that there's a

502
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:08,243
large class of SIM swapping attacks that I cannot protect myself against.

503
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:11,296
They're done at the carrier level. Right. Like that case with,

504
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:12,696
you know, where they, they fish,

505
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,676
an employee of some phone reseller that

506
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:17,245
where the phone reseller legitimately needs to

507
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:20,916
be able to go into carriers and reassign SIM cards and stuff because,

508
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,666
you know, people want to port their number over.

509
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:22,855
Right.

510
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,515
Like the last time I actually changed cell phone providers a couple of years ago

511
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,536
and, you know, ported my number over

512
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,089
and got a new SIM card along with that.

513
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:33,729
Yeah, I mean, that's,

514
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:37,099
and now granted I went to like the phone store of the phone carrier.

515
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,489
I didn't go to like some independent one.

516
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:39,290
But

517
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,770
so there are very legitimate cases where you need basically like

518
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,319
random 18 year olds to have access to port SIM card,

519
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,750
you know, to port sim numbers.

520
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,349
Otherwise they can't sell SIM cards or phones

521
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,630
with, you know,

522
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,109
porting the number over which is nobody wants to give up their number.

523
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,140
Like my parents have had the same phone number since, well before I was born.

524
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,209
It's like literally one of the three phone numbers. I know I can dial 911. Pizza 73.

525
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:00,989
And my parents

526
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:03,000
wait, did you say pizza? 73

527
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,109
pizza, 73. Dial 4737373. Pizza 73.

528
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,510
Boom,

529
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,300
dude,

530
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,859
they're open till four in the morning.

531
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,050
That alone makes it worth knowing that number.

532
00:22:16,689 --> 00:22:17,599
It's terrible. Pizza

533
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:18,709
doesn't matter,

534
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:22,329
-- but they're open till four in the morning
-- as long as there's two important things,

535
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:25,089
if you're a pizza place, people have to know how to get a hold of you

536
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:28,699
-- and that you have to be open late because you have to be
-- open past bar close.

537
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:28,729
Yeah.

538
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:30,579
Exactly. Exactly.

539
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,060
-- Especially when it's minus 40 outside.
-- Especially when it's minus 40 outside.

540
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:35,459
That's right.

541
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,099
So,

542
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:40,430
-- you made my daycare? That's awesome.
-- Yeah.

543
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,290
And it's also the phone number I use when I don't

544
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,020
want to put my real phone number in a form,

545
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,229
those poor people, you better tip them well, for all the crap.

546
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,449
Oh, they've got some giant call center that works from home thing going on.

547
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:53,560
It's actually pizza 73 is actually, well,

548
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:56,290
I don't want to say an early technology adapter but they've been pretty,

549
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,329
like they have their own app.

550
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,010
They have, you know, their call center people work from home, like they're,

551
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,750
as I understand it.

552
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,250
They're pretty on the ball. Yeah.

553
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,459
Anyway,

554
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,579
so, you know the question because so right now at the,

555
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:09,842
at the cloud security lines actually looking at this because basically to

556
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:12,812
protect a whole bunch of accounts or just for billing info,

557
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:14,421
they require a phone number which

558
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:17,702
I don't have the choice of not using for account recovery.

559
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:20,421
Like, that's just how they do it, right. These various vendors.

560
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,862
And so we're trying to find a phone carrier that has, like,

561
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:27,411
really strong security so that our SIMS don't get swapped.

562
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,102
I doubt that's possible.

563
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:30,112
Doesn't exist. Yeah,

564
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:31,034
doesn't exist.

565
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:35,014
So, what we came up with is essentially we're going to go with cash to like,

566
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:36,114
7-Eleven or whatever.

567
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,134
Buy some, you know, essentially buy a burner phone.

568
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:41,703
Like a drug dealer would from some random carrier,

569
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:45,514
a couple of them and just never publish the number anywhere, you know, and just,

570
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,463
and just use social security through obscurity basically.

571
00:23:49,423 --> 00:23:53,083
And that's all I got. I mean, if anybody wants to, you know, email

572
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:55,426
-- and tell me I'm wrong and there's a better way to do it, please
-- do.

573
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:55,806
I mean,

574
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:58,645
maybe the only problem I could see there is if

575
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:01,326
for some reason somebody forgets to pay the bill,

576
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:03,595
it goes on a corporate card and actually with the prepaid,

577
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:06,176
it's even better because my son has prepaid through 7-Eleven,

578
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,605
the money expires after one year,

579
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:10,605
but you typically have to top it up every six months or whatever.

580
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,005
So it doesn't run down to zero.

581
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:13,845
So I just have like a monthly email to

582
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:15,885
check his account and make sure it hasn't expired.

583
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:16,599
So

584
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:17,920
I have to put money

585
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,380
-- in
-- that part isn't the issue. The problem is going to be if you get the emails

586
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,260
and then you get hit by a bus.

587
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:25,640
Well,

588
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,699
that's why and that's the other reason for centralizing

589
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:28,810
it is because right now that's the problem,

590
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:28,930
right.

591
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,579
All this stuff is hooked up to my personal phone.

592
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:32,650
Well, and that's fair then. Right.

593
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,380
And so, for example, we're going to,

594
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,060
I know you're not supposed to share user names and passwords, but in this case,

595
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:39,479
we're actually going to share the user name and password amongst, you know,

596
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:42,579
the two or three tech people so that we can all make sure that, that, yeah,

597
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,540
-- that phone is paid for
-- Lastpass Enterprise is full.

598
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,880
-- Exactly.
-- And that's what we use. Yeah,

599
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,599
that's fair.

600
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:50,579
-- That's fair
-- because exactly, that's the other problem with cell phones.

601
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,859
Cell phones in general are locked to a person.

602
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,530
Yeah, I mean, that's the idea.

603
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,819
Well, and especially I'm up in Canada, they're down in the US,

604
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,689
like them trying to deal with my provider

605
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,180
because like me trying to deal with my provider is enough of a pain.

606
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,300
-- Yeah,
-- they're all terrible for the most part.

607
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,900
So, you know what part of this is as well is that

608
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,140
this is, I,

609
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,189
I love it when this happens because there was a problem

610
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:15,140
that needed to be solved and it basically resolved around identity

611
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,060
and somebody realized what's the one thing basically everyone

612
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,390
has now in that a cell phone number and,

613
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,550
and we built this infrastructure around a cellphone number, right?

614
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,719
And it totally,

615
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,819
it, I understand why. But obviously, like the cell phone

616
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,250
infrastructure and networking ideas were never designed for all of this. Right.

617
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:36,270
Well, neither was the social security or social insurance number, right?

618
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,599
There was meant to be your tax ID.

619
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,344
Not, well, you actually have to give that up to get a cell phone. General.

620
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:44,055
-- Well, used to when they were on plans I don't know about now.
-- Right. Right. Exactly.

621
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:47,665
They still ask, but at least in the US if I don't give it to them,

622
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:49,974
they get grumpy but you still can pull it off.

623
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:52,974
-- But, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly
-- right.

624
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,564
What alternative do we have the answer is we don't have one.

625
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:55,994
No,

626
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:59,344
that's the other thing is phone numbers tend to be unique. I say 10

627
00:25:59,795 --> 00:25:59,844
unique.

628
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:04,135
I did some research into this and it's not necessarily 100% true. Always.

629
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,810
But by and large they're unique.

630
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:07,589
Right. Right.

631
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:07,869
Well,

632
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,109
I think it's better now because I don't know how

633
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,069
it was in Canada when you were a wee lad.

634
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,369
But in the US

635
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,069
area codes were a huge part of phone numbers. So obviously

636
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,630
you'd have seven digit dialing in most locations.

637
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,849
Whereas now it's 10 digit dialing because everyone

638
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:23,589
just uses area codes all the time.

639
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,449
We had that happen a few years ago because Alberta used to be one area code 403.

640
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:29,829
And then we split Northern Alberta became seven.

641
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:33,494
All of Alberta was one area code a

642
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:35,984
million people. It's enormous

643
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:39,764
and it's like we have two cities and a bunch of farms

644
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:40,923
and some nice mountains.

645
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:41,963
That's true.

646
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:46,624
And now we've got 78 0, the 587 and then a new one I can't remember for the life of me and

647
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:50,303
who cares even because with, with cell phone portability now

648
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:52,524
it's always funny because

649
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,994
I live in one area code and myself

650
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:55,157
one

651
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:59,057
from another. And so any time I start telling people my number, I always start with

652
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:02,777
area code first I say area code and then the area code because

653
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,657
otherwise they just assume I have the same area code as everyone else.

654
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,427
I haven't heard, like, even locally, well,

655
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:10,708
locally everybody does area code because pretty much

656
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:12,868
all the new cell providers use 587,

657
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:13,817
not the 780.

658
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:14,817
got you.

659
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:18,998
See, I'm in a location that still primarily is one area code for the most part. Right.

660
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:19,338
Right.

661
00:27:19,547 --> 00:27:20,177
But no, I get that.

662
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:21,511
Yeah, but you're in a big city.

663
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:23,671
-- I mean, I'm
-- not, I mean, honestly, like,

664
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:25,991
when I went into my account and found I didn't have a PIN number.

665
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:26,131
Yeah,

666
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:29,271
I went and set one and honestly beyond setting up your

667
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,952
pin number on your account and not having it be 1234.

668
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:35,352
I don't really know what you can realistically do to quote, unquote,

669
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,011
protect your phone number to protect your,

670
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:40,391
there's actually something I've been meaning to do

671
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:40,991
that.

672
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:42,722
I, I haven't even verified if this is real,

673
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:45,342
but I use T Mobile as my provider here in the,

674
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:47,375
and according to rumor,

675
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:51,505
I can call them and basically tell them you have to put a special setting

676
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:56,005
on my account that I can only go into a store to make changes.

677
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:57,566
I cannot do it over the phone.

678
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,796
I don't know about the specifics of it, but Laura Shin talked about that.

679
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:04,206
How there are various carriers now have like this phone number is like a,

680
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,566
there's a safety risk or a security risk.

681
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:09,715
And so there's extra precautions put on it to prevent porting or

682
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:10,566
swapping.

683
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,180
And yeah, I honestly, here's what's going to happen. If you do do that,

684
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:16,280
It's going to be great until you travel to Europe and

685
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,520
break your phone or lose your SIM card in Europe.

686
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,420
-- And then you're going to be so annoyed
-- maybe.

687
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,939
But then if that happened,

688
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:25,680
I would be shocked if I can buy a SIM card in Europe and

689
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:28,660
call T Mobile in the United States and get them to enable it.

690
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,719
You probably could because

691
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:30,989
you have Mobile in Germany.

692
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,439
They're different companies though, even though they have the same name,

693
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:34,439
they're technically different companies.

694
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:38,515
Which makes, because it's funny last time I was in Berlin,

695
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:42,755
I was not connecting to T Mobile Towers, even though I was in Berlin,

696
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:44,214
which obviously has like t mobile,

697
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,194
like every phone you see has a t-mobile sticker on it.

698
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:48,755
Well, t for telecom, right?

699
00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:50,385
Has a T sticker on it.

700
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,704
And I'm like, this is hilarious because I, I think I was using Orange

701
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:56,604
Towers maybe. But yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't t mobile.

702
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:58,035
It was awesome.

703
00:28:58,699 --> 00:28:59,969
But anyway, anyway,

704
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:02,349
-- this is
-- what I really frustrates me is that

705
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:05,609
a lot of vendors have extra security but it's hidden

706
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,650
because it incurs an extra cost on the vendors. Right.

707
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,800
It would be a huge cost on them. Could I mean, you know what I always think of?

708
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:17,140
I always use my parents as like the test of if my parents had this feature enabled,

709
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,180
what would that look like?

710
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:18,969
And

711
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:19,369
yeah,

712
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,089
if they couldn't call the cell company to do anything like God bless the

713
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:26,420
poor person that has to deal with them when they walk through the door.

714
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:26,719
That's,

715
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:31,189
that's all I think of because it's like, oh my goodness, every,

716
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:35,030
every time my dad says the computer's networking, I just say what you do.

717
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,750
And he's like, I didn't do anything.

718
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,540
And then after five minutes of asking him questions,

719
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,500
I realized he totally did something.

720
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,430
But

721
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:46,060
anyway, we are nearly out of time. So we should wrap this one up.

722
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,420
-- I,
-- I think put a pin number on your account,

723
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,060
try not to advertise your phone number too widely.

724
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:52,979
If you're using it for things like crypt,

725
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:56,560
I would say crypto exchanges are probably the highest value target now

726
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,089
because it's just so easy to disappear the money and it's gone,

727
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:01,339
like with a bank, they can kind of claw it back.

728
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:02,400
They, they can totally, I mean,

729
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,930
-- it'll take a while but they'll get it back
-- unless

730
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:06,319
you move it through a money mule or whatever.

731
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:09,500
-- But beyond that, I don't
-- know. I, I think, you know what I would say to this

732
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:10,579
is that

733
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:13,682
everyone's gonna tell you to get a UB key and to use

734
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:16,781
two factor authentication applications on your phone or

735
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,602
whatever and don't use S MS and,

736
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:22,962
and I'm ok with all that advice, but the reality is S MS is here to stay.

737
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:27,041
Well, my bank doesn't give me an option. It's like I can use S MS or, or they can call me

738
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:29,761
on my phone number. That's my option for two

739
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:29,901
A

740
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:30,572
and I'm like,

741
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:31,322
I have

742
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,232
so many UB keys and I just bought the Google Titan,

743
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:35,531
which is actually the Bluetooth on.

744
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,661
The thing is really sweet.

745
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:39,362
-- I don't have one. I haven't tried it yet.
-- I highly recommend it.

746
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:43,984
I, well, so going off on a tangent, the Google Advanced account protection.

747
00:30:43,994 --> 00:30:44,683
Honestly,

748
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,473
if you're willing to live with a little bit of hassle, totally worth it.

749
00:30:47,634 --> 00:30:50,443
They do some stuff that would definitely apply

750
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:52,254
to people who are being targeted attacks.

751
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:53,673
So for example, under o

752
00:30:53,823 --> 00:30:55,673
off they disable some of the more dangerous API S

753
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:58,473
reportedly like things like access to your actual email content.

754
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:01,624
But basically by and large is what I love is they, they

755
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:05,423
don't force but they strongly encourage you during set up to have two keys

756
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:08,713
-- like a master and a backup.
-- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, everyone should do that.

757
00:31:08,723 --> 00:31:08,803
Yeah.

758
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:12,206
Well, and because I hate the providers that do two factor authentication

759
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:17,265
with Fido or UTF or whatever, good thing that I can use with my UB key or my Titan key.

760
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,046
But I'm only allowed to register one key because

761
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:19,355
he

762
00:31:19,495 --> 00:31:21,515
guys, I'm just like, well, I am,

763
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:24,286
I guess we're falling back to my phone number.

764
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:25,686
-- Exactly.
-- So

765
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:27,206
that was a useful exercise.

766
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,975
-- Yep. Yep. That's, that's good advice.
-- So, I guess

767
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:31,826
if there's one thing I want to say is if

768
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:34,605
you're going to support two factor authentication with hardware tokens

769
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:38,505
for the love of all. That's holy. Please let us register more than one token.

770
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:39,046
That's right.

771
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:41,119
That's right. Ideally three or four.

772
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,099
Because I now with Google, I've got five tokens registered on each of my accounts

773
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,869
and I can put one of them in my safety deposit box and forget about it.

774
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,510
Five seems excessive.

775
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:49,819
Well,

776
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:52,540
I have three UB keys because I used to have a personal one and a business one

777
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,180
and then I bought a spare one that I never was going to give to somebody maybe.

778
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:56,550
And then

779
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,989
the Google pack comes with, you know,

780
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,270
the Titan USB Bluetooth key and then a regular USB key.

781
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,609
So here I am with five,

782
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:06,079
I'm just gonna end it there.

783
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:07,770
Thank you, Kurt. Thank you

784
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,709
