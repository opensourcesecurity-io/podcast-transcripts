00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,500
Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,810
-- Kurt Siefried and my unwilling life coach partner, Josh
-- Pressers.

2
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,750
Oh, you actually used it. I didn't think you do that.

3
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:14,550
Yes.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,590
-- Yes. And
-- we're talking about potholes today

5
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:21,850
and no, we are not talking, oh my goodness, not potholes. Well, you're in a pothole

6
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:23,434
pothole.

7
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:27,995
I will, I will preface this by saying it is July 10th when we are recording this.

8
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:34,294
So basically one full week before the show is going out and PP just sent

9
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:38,935
the email to the top 1% Python projects saying you have to enable to vector

10
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:40,194
off. And there has been

11
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:43,674
an enormous amount of discussion about this particular issue.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,259
And our favorite co-host,

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,139
Kurt found himself embroiled and we'll say an annoying argument.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,500
I wouldn't say it was annoying.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,759
Ok. Well, it wasn't totally annoying.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,819
You were accused of something that wasn't your intent, we'll say,

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,689
and it's because you could have worded it better,

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,340
but

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,200
we will not dwell on this point. We will just stress the fact

20
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:04,019
that

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,209
sometimes Twitter is a bad place to have discussions.

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,849
Part of the challenge is it is 100 and 80 100 and 60 characters and

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,019
it's like 240 now,

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,739
whatever. It's still short.

25
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:15,910
And,

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,580
yeah, I know

27
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,830
that, like, Totp doesn't need your phone number. I

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,800
-- was talking about like S MS two fa or
-- I understand that in general,

29
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:27,639
if you're going to ship something to somebody,

30
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,480
you generally need to know where to ship it.

31
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,819
-- And I know that you don't plug your address into your hardware key.
-- I know.

32
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:34,440
Anyway, anyway, doesn't matter.

33
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:34,919
I don't,

34
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,910
I do want to talk about Python though because I think

35
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:42,120
what pipe is doing is fascinating for a number of reasons.

36
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:47,035
OK. So basically they are requiring two fa for the top 1% of packages.

37
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:49,485
And I assume by top 1% they mean like by

38
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:52,724
-- uh download popularity
-- by bi weekly downloads,

39
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:53,995
that's how they're measuring it right now.

40
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,845
It's in, it's in their blog post.

41
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,205
-- OK?
-- I got, I got to go write a script then and get in there,

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,370
right.

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,970
So just target the top 2% now and you're fine.

44
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,779
They're basically mandating two fa for this top 1%.

45
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:10,649
And let's preface the show by saying I support two factor authentication.

46
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,929
Look, I'm going to preface it with saying I support what pa

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,929
pa is doing.

48
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:15,815
Yes, I was about to go there.

49
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:18,604
-- I
-- just think there's larger discussions around it and

50
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,235
what I

51
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:22,184
was getting to is I also support the idea of two

52
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:23,714
fa for things that matter.

53
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:26,714
And also for things that don't matter that much because in general two

54
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,274
fa good not to fa bad

55
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:33,020
and to be even more clear hardware, two of a best

56
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,690
software. Two fa on your phone. It's ok. It's not great. It's not bad.

57
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,979
I mean, the one advantage is you can back it up and

58
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,100
that's hard to do with hardware tokens unless you have multiple tokens and

59
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,639
keep them off site, blah, blah, blah.

60
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:44,460
So

61
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:48,660
to be clear, I I want do we did the show on N PM?

62
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,240
What was the other one that was forcibly doing two fa was it?

63
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,110
So anyways, and we like, we agree with this,

64
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,740
but it's clear that the, the how is uh we need to work on that?

65
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,710
Well, OK, look. So I think there's a couple of pieces to this

66
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:04,470
and,

67
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,110
and,

68
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:10,380
and there's the angle of the logistics and difficulty of developers using

69
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,669
two fact Roth because there have been a number of developers,

70
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:15,710
some high profile developers who basically came out and said, OK,

71
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,389
so you're making me do this. I don't really want to

72
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,710
um someone deleted what one of a very popular package as a

73
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,830
at all my crew, right?

74
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,869
And but in fairness, he also said that like you shouldn't be using it,

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,509
you should be using, there's like two system built ins now that do a better job.

76
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,369
And he was like, and also he didn't mean to actually delete it.

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,889
He's like, I wanted to archive it or whatever and it like the,

78
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:35,399
like

79
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:36,460
in fairness,

80
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,270
stuff like archiving it or removing your package.

81
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:42,699
-- Most people don't do that very often before you died
-- down this rattle.

82
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:43,460
So

83
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,509
there's the just logistics of dealing with the developers, right.

84
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,190
And that's its own conversation. I think

85
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,990
there's the question of

86
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,169
what are the attacks this will solve because there's a lot of people,

87
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:54,350
especially like on Twitter.

88
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,759
-- So,
-- what's the benefit?

89
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,229
-- Well,
-- well, basically, yes, they're, they're decrying this

90
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,080
as a pans.

91
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,949
And it's like this really only solves one very narrow

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,100
-- set of attacks.
-- It actually solves two attacks on the same thing which is quasi

93
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,630
three if they choose a really bad password. But basically it solves

94
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:15,544
account takeovers via bad passwords or revealed passwords.

95
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:19,095
So that means uh number one brute forcing or stuffing the password. So, like

96
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:21,053
they reuse a password or something or

97
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,915
1234, don't do that.

98
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:27,165
Number two, they somehow reveal or leak the password, for example,

99
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:27,915
through phishing.

100
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,674
And number three, just good old brew forcing,

101
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:35,135
which if you're choosing even a remotely same password is not a problem nowadays.

102
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:36,424
Right. Right.

103
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,274
And, and

104
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:42,730
many of the, uh, well, some of the stories in recent, we'll say months

105
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,489
have revolved around account takeovers.

106
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,829
Some, we know some we don't,

107
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,200
but like one was a researcher that found

108
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:51,540
all these N PM packages with expired domains.

109
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,720
But if you have a, an account recovery process for two factor

110
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,170
off which piye does. If you take over the account,

111
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,209
you just recover the two factor codes like it, it doesn't fix that.

112
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,040
So,

113
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:03,910
and that leads to something I've been talking about a

114
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,970
lot and I actually have previous threat models on.

115
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,559
So for example, at the CS A, we allow

116
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,440
you to uh well, when you, when you

117
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,559
start working here,

118
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,390
we have to email you your like user name and password so you can log in and do your job.

119
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,399
So we obviously need your personal email and password.

120
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,630
And we allow

121
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,290
people to link that to their CS A account for

122
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:26,799
recovery and also to apply their own phone number for recovery

123
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,239
because it's less work for me. So I like it.

124
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:34,260
Um, but it actually turns out that that is, that is basically the biggest

125
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,799
threat that we have is

126
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:39,880
somebody attacks the person's personal account and then uses it to do

127
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,700
account recovery because otherwise the CS A is super locked down.

128
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,609
But there's like this back door that

129
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,549
has to be there for account recovery.

130
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,910
And, and that's the thing is, I don't care how good your security is.

131
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,329
If you have an account recovery mechanism that is weak

132
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,649
and they are all weak because they rely on

133
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,690
an email address.

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,440
That's

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,269
like it's

136
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,140
99% of these account recovery systems boil down to.

137
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:04,179
We have your email address,

138
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,700
we send you an email with a link or some secret or whatever, but it boils down to, if you

139
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,690
have access to that email address,

140
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,859
you can do a recovery of whatever is using that email address.

141
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,890
U usually the only ones going kind of beyond that are one of my

142
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,540
favorite stories is with Instagram where like you will basically hold up a picture

143
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,600
with like a number written on it because they have

144
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,649
like a pile of photos of you so they can like

145
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:25,785
make sure it's you.

146
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,445
Facebook is doing the thing with the social

147
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,875
graph where it's like you can nominate like,

148
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:30,545
OK, three of these five people

149
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:32,494
can be allowed to, you know,

150
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:33,334
so like

151
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:34,135
look,

152
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:37,424
identity is super hard and I don't want this to turn into an identity discussion.

153
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:41,424
-- Let's just say it's really hard.
-- So the reality is recovery is

154
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,380
a massively weak link. But yeah, two of a doesn't do crap or,

155
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:48,670
and that ignores the fact that also normal people

156
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,500
don't register domains and run the rain email.

157
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,790
A lot of devs do

158
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,149
weirdly who knew,

159
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,899
right? It, it is true. I both of us have our own domains.

160
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,790
I'm sure many of our listeners do as well.

161
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,500
My domain is old enough to drink.

162
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,470
I

163
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:04,869
registered mine in 2001. 0, wow. Mine is 21. Wow.

164
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,750
-- Anyway,
-- well, a great example of this is, I mean, yeah, like you said,

165
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,420
somebody went through the note data and found how many domains that were expired,

166
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:13,760
linked to packages

167
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,809
-- it
-- was thousands

168
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,799
like like bit rod is real.

169
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:21,559
Like I'm just going through the CV data and there are now 25 CV S that

170
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,369
link to the GSD because I registered some domain names and pointed them at the GSD.

171
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,140
You know, there's,

172
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:30,420
there's a ton of dead domains or non working domains and CV like that,

173
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:33,940
that's just a thing like this data is 5, 1020 years old.

174
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,380
It happens, right? The other challenge is two fa

175
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,725
definitely prevent things like fishing. But

176
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:43,295
we've seen cases where, you know, somebody hijacks the developer's workstation.

177
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:45,454
-- I don't
-- want to get into all the attacks.

178
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,464
There, there's one other really important piece of this though.

179
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,345
Kurt, you haven't, we haven't gotten to yet

180
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:51,364
and we're, we're going to run ourselves out of time.

181
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,904
I think the attack thing we need to do a little more work on and

182
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:57,934
we should discuss that because I don't think we know all the attacks and I think

183
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:58,975
there are,

184
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,869
I, I feel like we need something like, you know,

185
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,690
there's like the miter attack framework, we need that for the supply chain.

186
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,390
And I don't know if someone knows of this.

187
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,470
-- Like, please let me know
-- technically it should fall under attack.

188
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,709
-- But yeah, it's, it's, I think
-- it's, I don't know if it does.

189
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:15,269
I think supply chain is important enough and special enough to be its own thing.

190
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,070
I agree. I agree. I think it should have its own

191
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,230
and, and the third thing is one of uh there was a developer,

192
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,630
um I think an alpine dove basically said,

193
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,890
what, what, what comes next and it's, it's that concern of

194
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,750
like this dial only goes one way. So it's two factor off today.

195
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,299
What is the next thing

196
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,030
that everyone's gonna say

197
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,640
I should do as an open source developer. Is it signing things? Is it SIG store? Is it?

198
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,270
You know what I mean?

199
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,229
Well, like are we gonna,

200
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,030
are we gonna force to have store an endpoint control

201
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,989
software to make sure they have up to date antivirus?

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,760
Exactly this, like where does it stop?

203
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,549
And I think that's also a very legitimate concern

204
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,843
because it's easy to say, oh, you're just fear mongering.

205
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:56,622
-- But like this again, this dial goes one way for the most part to
-- me.

206
00:08:56,643 --> 00:09:00,672
Two fa is a natural extension of passwords and I think passwords are

207
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:02,643
kind of well established that we have to do that.

208
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:03,942
Like whether we like it or not because

209
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,112
people will try and access other people's accounts and

210
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:07,802
they didn't learn the lesson in kindergarten of

211
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,903
don't touch other people's stuff without permission.

212
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:13,543
But on the other hand, yeah, I mean, do we get to a point where they require devs,

213
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:18,216
they were talking about how some projects now require your

214
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:23,306
background checks for new developers of kind of core things.

215
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,265
And I mean,

216
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,515
Josh and I are old enough that we come

217
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:28,375
from a world where you just started submitting patches.

218
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:32,176
-- That's, that's how you got in.
-- That's still how it works in most projects.

219
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:36,335
-- I mean, that's just the reality of it.
-- Almost no projects can go that far. They just

220
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:41,375
like, if let's be real, if you send me a high res scan of your US passport. Cool.

221
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:43,135
Like, I guess it looks like one,

222
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,530
like how, how

223
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,940
I think they're blue,

224
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,580
like, right. I don't know how to validate a passport from America.

225
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:52,570
And so that's the other challenges even if a project

226
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,659
has the capability and has the resources to do this,

227
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:58,690
like or not the capability but has the wherewithal to do this.

228
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,479
They now have to have the capability to do this.

229
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:01,960
And what do you do if one of your developers is in

230
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,260
like Kazakhstan or some random place and doesn't have a passport?

231
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,289
Like he's going to send you in his Costco card.

232
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,159
I, I've literally seen people use their Costco card as ID because it has a photo on it.

233
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:13,320
It's grainy but it's there. Oh, interesting.

234
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:16,520
The chances of somebody having a fake Costco card are like pretty slim.

235
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,200
-- Like it's
-- probably pretty low. I agree with that.

236
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,400
And that's part of the challenge here is it's,

237
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:25,599
it's we need to reel you beckon because you went too far and this is what you do

238
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,200
fly, I'm here saying endpoint, whatever like in I DS, they ignore that.

239
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,239
Let's just say it's multi factor off.

240
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,229
But in a year, you're gonna have N PM and pipe say, OK,

241
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,760
developers now you have to sign everything with SIG star,

242
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,659
right?

243
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,849
And that is going to happen. I I guarantee it.

244
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:46,390
And so now developers are like now I have to do more work

245
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,669
or even simpler. Hey, you know, your github

246
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,559
-- repos, they have to require, you know, signed
-- commits.

247
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,109
Uh And, and that will, that might happen too. Actually, we, we tried to do that at

248
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:59,400
Acor and it didn't go well. So we turn that off.

249
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,330
It worked with a DEV team of five people.

250
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,750
Let me put it that way, like with five people, you can do it.

251
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,460
But that was one thing with five people like doing this across.

252
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,510
Well, the top 1% of Python like

253
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,150
that.

254
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, that's probably not going to fly with a few percent.

255
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:18,880
And that's the other problem is this is dealing with large numbers, like we say,

256
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,809
1% of Python.

257
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,679
Like it's like what seven things, I mean, how much, really,

258
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,099
how many packages could there be?

259
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,460
But 1% of pie, pie is, how many

260
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,929
-- is it? Thousands or tens of thousands of
-- packages,

261
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,280
-- 350,000 packages in pi
-- pie. So 3500 packages,

262
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,479
that's

263
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,979
times more than one dev often per package especially.

264
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,719
Well, by definition, from popular stuff. They actually have

265
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,479
groups,

266
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,059
you know, same thing with note what 2 million packages, some of them have,

267
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,219
they're over 2 million now.

268
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,659
Jeez.

269
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,260
Wow.

270
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:49,659
And that's the thing, right. This is

271
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,809
3500 packages times. I don't know how many devs I'd have to look, I'm guessing 5 to 10

272
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:57,260
ish. I'm, you know,

273
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,239
that sounds about right.

274
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,280
-- No,
-- no,

275
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,859
-- no. Yeah,
-- exactly. I'm making stuff up.

276
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:03,460
I have a graph somewhere.

277
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,169
The V,

278
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,349
like half, half of these, half of those have one development.

279
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:12,659
I'm not surprised. So, I mean, you gotta keep that in mind. So 1500

280
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,820
developers plus

281
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,000
whatever the multiples are after that. And of course, there's some overlap.

282
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,140
But let's say, let's say 3000 developers, let's say 2000 developers.

283
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,619
It doesn't matter.

284
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,210
That's a lot of freaking people.

285
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:26,200
Well, and probably 1% of them are on vacation right now.

286
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,090
Hopefully more actually now that I say that,

287
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,219
I mean, we've talked about this on previous shows but it just,

288
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:33,330
these are large numbers, these are people.

289
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,219
It's complicated

290
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:35,219
here.

291
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,090
We, we're proving our point

292
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,130
because

293
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,929
there's a lot of moving pieces in this. There's a lot of complexity.

294
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,739
Some people are going to see two factor, I should be everywhere, no questions asked.

295
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,359
Some people are going to say, I don't want this crap, take it away. I I don't want it.

296
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,380
And then you've got people in the middle that are like,

297
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,929
what's actually going on here?

298
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,929
Like what does this, what is the problem we're trying to solve?

299
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,289
How does this solve it?

300
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,409
And what are the new problems it creates when we do this?

301
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,859
See, and that's the thing that came up on Twitter is people are like, well,

302
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,190
but shouldn't more security be.

303
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,299
It's a

304
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,469
good enough argument and it's like, well,

305
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,270
you could glue your doors shut and that would be more secure. But

306
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,049
that's a dumb argument. I have a better one.

307
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,979
So, in my city I think I've told this story on the podcast before.

308
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:16,179
So if you've heard it, I apologize.

309
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,570
We in my city we have a what we call the large item drop off where like if you have a big,

310
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,450
like a couch or something,

311
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,414
you need to throw away you and bring it to the city

312
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:25,275
and they have the big dumpster and you throw it in,

313
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:25,594
right?

314
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,804
And it used to just be, you could drive up and chuck stuff in and leave no big deal.

315
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:30,534
And then people were complaining

316
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:31,065
that

317
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,984
individuals who didn't live in the city who weren't citizens were

318
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,934
coming and dumping their stuff off. And so

319
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,400
the solution

320
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,960
was they now you can only drop stuff off two

321
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:44,299
days a week and they have a person sitting there

322
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:45,479
that's checking I DS.

323
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,039
And so the question becomes,

324
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,400
is the price of like employing and paying

325
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:53,619
this person larger than the additional garbage.

326
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:54,640
You know what I mean?

327
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:54,840
Like,

328
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:57,239
I don't know the answer to this and I asked them

329
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,559
-- and they won't tell me
-- and some people would argue,

330
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,119
you know, there's the moral aspect, the ethical aspect.

331
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,280
And also it's a,

332
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:07,479
it's a slippery slope like you let one guy dump a couch from out of state and it's like,

333
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:09,119
oh, pretty soon you're like, knee deep and

334
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,390
finding tractors or whatever people are dropping off.

335
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,109
Like, from my perspective,

336
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,909
I really only care about the cost, whichever one is cheaper. Do that one.

337
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,409
Well, and also the convenience.

338
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:23,570
Like it sounds like when you just had a big dumpster that you went through stuff in.

339
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,190
That's true. It is inconvenient.

340
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,369
Now,

341
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,559
we have sort of these micro eco stations locally where it's

342
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,609
like 40 or 50 dumpsters that take like paper box,

343
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,000
cardboard, blah, blah, blah.

344
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,200
And there's lots of signs saying this,

345
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,609
you know, it's video monitor, no dumping, blah, blah, blah.

346
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,400
And it's great because I

347
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,700
it's less work to just because I happen to live really close to one.

348
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,500
It's way less work to throw my cardboard in the trunk of my car

349
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:46,780
and throw it in there than it is like try and cut it or fold it up and,

350
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:47,940
you know, stuff it up.

351
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:48,929
The

352
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:49,539
same thing

353
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:51,700
we have, we have the same thing.

354
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,940
We have a place I can bring my cardboard and yeah,

355
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,460
my cardboard all goes there because it's a pain in the butt otherwise.

356
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,760
So, but back to this, like part of it too is I think people are conflating.

357
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,700
Prevention is often better than the cure and if we can prevent things,

358
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,070
bad things from happening, that's,

359
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,059
well, that's good.

360
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,859
Yeah, I don't want a ton of account takeovers in us having to clean up

361
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,559
ungodly messes where, you know,

362
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,099
somebody slips a back door into a popular package and it gets deployed to 1000.

363
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,119
Right.

364
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,739
Different things that depend on it and all your,

365
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,409
basically all of our IOT light bulbs try to kill us on Thursday

366
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,179
part of it is there's a difference between a black swan event and

367
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,960
should we build a fence to keep out the black Swans?

368
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,969
Because for example, one argument uh I was

369
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,349
looking at is

370
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:38,780
we know that there are account takeovers that is through password shenanigans.

371
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:39,429
Let's call it.

372
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:41,690
There's definitely

373
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,669
for the sake of argument,

374
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,340
let's say there's at least one documented case per major ecosystem like pi pi node,

375
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:47,460
whatever, right?

376
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:47,619
Github,

377
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:48,340
whatever.

378
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,869
But there's not many, there's like literally,

379
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:52,979
it's a very

380
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,039
small and I was thinking about this and I'm like, well, OK, number one,

381
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,469
couldn't you then argue that like they're doing a

382
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,390
pretty good job keeping the bad guys out,

383
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,369
right? Like, I mean, if there's only like one, then

384
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:05,630
apparently we're not doing that terrible of a job.

385
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,349
But number two is I was then I was like thinking, OK, well, incentive wise like

386
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,479
is pi pie?

387
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:14,919
Are there account takeovers happening that we don't know about?

388
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,010
Well,

389
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,510
maybe

390
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,609
are there account takeovers happening that we,

391
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,979
but the security PP, people know about

392
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:24,950
that. They're not telling us and I find that really improbable.

393
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,869
-- I mean, I, I would hope that they'd be proud of that and talk about it.
-- Exactly. And,

394
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,960
and, and it's, you can't hide this stuff. Like

395
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,070
when, when somebody puts in, you know,

396
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,830
a thing in the code that says infinite loop back door, it's kind of,

397
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,150
it's kind of obvious, you know, when somebody takes out the authentication,

398
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,669
it's like that's not, these attacks are not

399
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,309
quiet. It's not like

400
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,929
what like solar winds like what?

401
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,809
Like it blows my mind that solar winds looked at this and like, oh whatever,

402
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,239
just like smash that install button and ignore the signature being all screwed up.

403
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,020
These are not quite attacks,

404
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,280
not, not in the open source world. I think the vast majority of

405
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,309
attacks like this that have happened have been caught very quickly open source.

406
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,300
-- And I think it's one of the superpowers open source has
-- we've talked

407
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,550
about three or four of them on the show over the years.

408
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,400
Yeah.

409
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,819
Yeah.

410
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,900
And I mean, I'll, I'll,

411
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,699
I'll take that message to the grave is just like the

412
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,939
open source has a superpower and this is it because people,

413
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,060
people notice this stuff.

414
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:21,140
Well, not that they, you can notice it and,

415
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,079
and there are generally channels to shout about it.

416
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:24,939
Channels, Twitter,

417
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,300
I mean

418
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:27,368
it

419
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,540
but

420
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:30,859
right, I, I agree. I agree. Well, although github

421
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,939
is now going to include malware

422
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,099
in their advisories,

423
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,020
which is great.

424
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:38,770
I, I love that. CV just categorically refuses to cover backdoors in Malware.

425
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,619
-- It's like cool
-- because no, we're not talking about that today.

426
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,819
That could be another episode.

427
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:46,459
That could probably be a series of 700 episodes, but don't do that.

428
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,859
So, ok, now here's, here's what it comes down to, I think and, and, and

429
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,410
I don't wanna, I feel like we've been all over the place on this show.

430
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,140
But I think at the end of the day,

431
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:02,709
the question is really what, what is pi po developers? And what is PPO users? Right?

432
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:04,069
Because you can make the argument

433
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:04,709
that

434
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,560
not enforcing multi factor

435
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,750
off is doing a disservice to the users.

436
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:09,729
You can make the argument,

437
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:12,829
enforcing multi factor off is a disservice to the developers.

438
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,630
But at the end of the day, the way I see it,

439
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,030
Pie Pie is an open source project that gets to do what they want to do.

440
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:19,430
And if you don't like it,

441
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:21,709
like go build your own pie pie.

442
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:22,520
You know,

443
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,170
-- you
-- and I come from the world before Pie Pie. I remember when I first ran into C pan

444
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,439
-- the Comprehensive Pearl Archive Network.
-- Oh

445
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,219
-- my
-- goodness. C

446
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:30,969
is so

447
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:31,890
so good.

448
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,390
-- Like if I wanted something, I went and found a tar ball and you know,
-- that's right. C

449
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:36,709
A was magic when C

450
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,050
A came out, I was like,

451
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,359
do you remember there was a whole

452
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:40,594
Riley book just on C

453
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:40,805
A.

454
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:41,515
Yeah.

455
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:42,944
Well,

456
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:45,364
I remember installing Paarl dependencies manually and

457
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,594
upgrading them manually and managing them manually

458
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:51,395
and using that tar wrapper program that would basically like look at your system,

459
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:52,515
you would install something

460
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:54,094
and it would look at your system again and then

461
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:56,505
build a tar ball of like those installed binaries.

462
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:56,714
So the

463
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,994
poor man's binary packager,

464
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,810
you know, like the challenge is,

465
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:04,640
and I think the one developer wrote a really good blog post.

466
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,760
And basically because I've had this happen,

467
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,209
I remember handling security vulnerability with somebody who started out

468
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:13,189
making documentation fixes and then basically six months later,

469
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,209
ended up as the primary developer of this package.

470
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:15,949
Yes,

471
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,880
I recall this, this poor person,

472
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,680
there was like a remote code execution flaw in this library

473
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,770
and

474
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,369
they're like 20 years old, 21 years old

475
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,300
and they're panicking. They're like, am I going to get sued? Am I going to get like

476
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:29,469
killed?

477
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,609
I'm like, I'm freaking out man and I'm like, it's OK. Breathe, it'll be OK.

478
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:37,170
Trust me, it's Thursday. This happens all the time

479
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:40,530
and this person didn't start out to

480
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:43,550
be in charge of a critical package.

481
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,109
And, and this other developer pointed out, you know, I wrote some software

482
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,390
like it's my fault, people like it and use it everywhere.

483
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,000
And now I'm supposed to be held to some

484
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,890
higher, like the same standard as Microsoft for Windows.

485
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:57,770
It's

486
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,829
like, really?

487
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:01,239
Have you ever seen some of the letters that open

488
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,364
source develop posted after log the log for shell an open

489
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:07,265
source project got a letter from like a, a bank that was like,

490
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,084
please provide answers to these questions.

491
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:09,685
They were like

492
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,385
no,

493
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:11,685
which, but you know,

494
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:15,675
I that's the thing is this is again where the knob only turns one way.

495
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:18,385
So Popeye says you have to use two factor off.

496
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:19,724
Then Popeye says you have to,

497
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:22,765
you have to sign your packages and Popeye says you have to sign your commits and

498
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:24,189
you know what I mean? It's gonna,

499
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:28,150
it, it, it adds up and, and as an open source developer at one point or you're like,

500
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,030
screw it, I'm just sick of all this crap.

501
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,199
I don't want to do this anymore.

502
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:35,750
I wanted to write a library and it was fun and now I'm doing freaking maintenance on

503
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:40,939
-- stuff. Pipe tells me I need to do well.
-- And this leads to two big things that

504
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,219
I haven't seen people talking about, which is number one is like,

505
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:45,569
could we do this better?

506
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,579
That's not what it is. And number two,

507
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,400
what about the companies? Well, no, no, I'm getting there.

508
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,219
I'm gonna throw them under the bus in a second.

509
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,880
So the first thing is like, could we do this better?

510
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,890
And could we talk to the developers and engage with

511
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,319
them and find out a better way to do this?

512
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,800
And here's the, the sad truth.

513
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:03,500
The answer is no, because there's like a kaji developers,

514
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,359
even if you sampled a statistically relevant

515
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,849
sample size of like 51 or 2%. That's,

516
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,560
that's thousands of people.

517
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,699
I, I have a great example of this. I want you to get 20 people in a room

518
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:18,510
and get everyone to agree where to eat.

519
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,130
Well, no, no, you don't have to get them to agree what to eat.

520
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,739
Get those 20 people to actually clearly describe what

521
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,099
kind of food they like and don't like.

522
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,680
Oh, there you go. That's fair.

523
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:30,609
Then you get to find three options to present to the group.

524
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,469
-- Ah,
-- that sounds exciting. And then not get beaten to death with chairs.

525
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:35,619
So,

526
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,040
and that's the thing, right.

527
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,959
And then, and the second thing is like, are there other ways to do this,

528
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,900
are there other ways to accomplish these goals?

529
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,449
I don't know.

530
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,839
And that involves a whole pile of threat modeling and sophistication and

531
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:52,099
-- stuff we don't have as a community.
-- I want to add one really important point.

532
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:57,640
Here is the poor pai pai people are on the, they're on the worst end of this stick in

533
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,119
every possible direction. And they're,

534
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,439
they are doing the best they can with the tools they have. And so by all means,

535
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:10,060
-- they're doing a fabulous job. No one pick on
-- them. I use pi pie daily like it.

536
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:10,689
It's great.

537
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:13,420
-- Yeah, it's amazing.
-- And then this leads to

538
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,699
none of this matters for

539
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,699
two simple reasons. One

540
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:19,589
companies like free stuff.

541
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,329
Right. They, they, they look like I can write a web server. I can use a free one. Great,

542
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,609
which has a corollary of

543
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:31,089
what they don't have a choice. They can't write a web server anymore.

544
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:35,729
Like they have to go download flask or Apache or engine X or whatever.

545
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:39,719
This assumes that they're coming into this. No, they're not. They're already here.

546
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:42,880
They, they can't leave. That's the second thing like they're

547
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:44,489
like, they're in too deep,

548
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:45,530
you know, they owe

549
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,010
$57,000 and the vig is due on Thursday and it's 75%

550
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,530
like they're stuck.

551
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,040
Well, and, and look, here's,

552
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,099
here's part of the thing that I think about on this all

553
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:59,000
the time is there's all these companies using all this open source

554
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,680
and

555
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,400
they're the ones demanding this kind of stuff

556
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:04,030
like open

557
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,489
source nerds aren't demanding multi factor

558
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:06,650
A,

559
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,660
it's, it's functionally companies that are worried about their supply chain.

560
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,300
That's one thing I was kind of wondering about because

561
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:12,380
here's the reality.

562
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,380
If, if this two fa was so awesome and so wonderful, Popeye could just say, hey,

563
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,775
we giving away free two fa tokens.

564
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:18,885
So the top 1% you know,

565
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:22,915
-- like here's
-- the form they literally are giving away free two fa tokens.

566
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:26,285
No, but what I'm saying is make it voluntary, not mandatory. That's the

567
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,625
D and because if this was so awesome, they would go do it

568
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,844
seven people would sign up if you did it

569
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,795
-- maybe less.
-- Exactly.

570
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,780
So clearly this doesn't make their lives better and less hassle and,

571
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,420
ok, whatever. That's a, that's a fair point. But I do think

572
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:46,810
this is one of those examples of, I'm comfortable forcing two factor oath on people

573
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,359
just because we can,

574
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,859
and it's not worse, but I also recognize it's, it's a hard thing to do.

575
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:56,780
What's ironic is the, the situation where the developer, you know,

576
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,650
gets fed up and leaves

577
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,189
is an existing problem we have to deal with,

578
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:04,170
like with the colors dot Js with the um what was the other one?

579
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,540
The guy nuked anyways.

580
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:07,939
So where these developers, you know,

581
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,829
either

582
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:12,459
put a back door in or, or more commonly just like,

583
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,750
don't maintain it because they have a life,

584
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:15,750
you know,

585
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,969
that was someone I think Tide Lift did a survey

586
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,170
of open source developers and it was like half of open

587
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,890
source developers basically said, like I'm becoming

588
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:28,560
incredibly frustrated managing my project and I want to quit.

589
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:30,569
I will never do an open

590
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:33,680
source project. Like I will never do an open source software project ever again.

591
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:36,410
Or rather I will, I, I do do open

592
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,829
source project. Like I have open source software that I release, but

593
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,479
I, I'm just absolutely done caring about what people want.

594
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:44,890
Like I, I really

595
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:45,140
sent

596
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,760
her the A PL two. Good luck.

597
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,599
Like, unless that bug fix affects me, I'm not fixing it, you can fork it.

598
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:52,260
I'm

599
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:52,869
not

600
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,300
like I will never be nice again. I'm just done.

601
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:57,079
No,

602
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,290
I,

603
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,430
I've seen too much abuse of these people.

604
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,880
I've seen too many people burn out and I've seen too many people just

605
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,719
like, come on. We worked at Red Hat.

606
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:08,189
We, we saw what some of these developers went through. It was,

607
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,560
I, I see it all the time now when you're, when you're dealing with, I mean,

608
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,229
there are projects where the developers are

609
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:17,439
very overworked and they're very underappreciated.

610
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,800
I mean, one of my, one of my favorite examples of that was

611
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:21,890
uh the guy who does Jackson data bin and

612
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,189
Tau,

613
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:25,479
he, he, he's, I don't know what he's doing now,

614
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,130
but I remember talking to him at one point

615
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,660
and he was just like, I don't have time. I'm busy, I'm burnt out.

616
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,079
Like I really don't care about this.

617
00:25:32,689 --> 00:25:33,540
And it was, I mean,

618
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,209
I was trying to help is what I was doing in that particular instance,

619
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:37,290
but like I totally get it.

620
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,939
And that's, I mean, Jackson data bind is used in everything.

621
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,199
Well, if it's Java and it's moving data around, it's

622
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,729
how is he going to do it?

623
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,829
And so anyway,

624
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:49,280
I think that's one of the angles of this that I'm not seeing anyone discuss is

625
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,160
adding

626
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,270
responsibility to open source maintainers.

627
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:57,890
It is a very lopsided agreement because you're saying you

628
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,530
should do this extra work that you're already doing for free

629
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,170
and you get no benefits from doing it.

630
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,969
-- Well,
-- the problem is responsibilities, create obligations,

631
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,160
right? Like

632
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,670
I want two fa so you have to do two fa

633
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,959
I've now created an obligation. I've created a work for you.

634
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:18,569
I've created something new for you to do.

635
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,229
And that's the challenge here is the security. Things are not simply

636
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:26,280
somehow just

637
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:31,260
there, but they don't impact the end developers. They do impact the end developers.

638
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,819
Everybody's like, oh, it's not that bad.

639
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,069
You just have to load like a piece of software on your phone, your

640
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,300
phone,

641
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,400
get a free two fa key. OK? Cool. Except, oh, wait, now I got to back up my phone.

642
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,359
So I have my two fa

643
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:45,790
well, but I got, I wanted the hardware keys because they're more secure. But

644
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,800
like what if my house burns down? Well,

645
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,979
so they, the pi pie fact they will send you two hard work

646
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,420
-- for that reason.
-- Actually. Fun fact.

647
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,729
That's how Google Titan works. The Google Titan keys come in a pair

648
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,660
full stop because Google's like they're engineers and they're like,

649
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,890
everybody needs two keys.

650
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,819
I bought one Titan

651
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,939
key when I went to buy it, they only sold them in pairs.

652
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,900
You got the, you get the, the, the like the big one and the little one.

653
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:14,640
-- No, when I bought it, I just got the white one that plugs into the USB
-- C

654
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,089
part.

655
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,020
I have one

656
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,969
in my case. I have a UB key at the bank.

657
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:21,829
I have a UB key on my key chain and I have a Titan key at

658
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:23,430
-- my desk
-- and I actually,

659
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,569
I have a calendar entry where I need to go get my safety deposit box, go into it,

660
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,579
get the UB key,

661
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:31,959
come back home, register it with a bunch of new services

662
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,910
and then schlep it back to the bank and

663
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,109
that is,

664
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,589
that's like an hour or two of my time.

665
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:38,339
Oh,

666
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,589
I bet it's more than that. But no, I, I agree. I hear you. It's, it's not free.

667
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:44,819
And I, I always think about uh

668
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,310
there was a time I was working with a developer on some TLS stuff

669
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:50,910
and we were discussing generating certificates.

670
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:53,270
They were like, I don't understand why people say this is so hard.

671
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,510
You just run a couple of commands and open SSL and you're done.

672
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,530
-- And I'm like, oh my goodness. No, that is so not what happens here.
-- Like

673
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,069
you gotta edit your Openness cell

674
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:01,560
con figure

675
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,979
-- first
-- you have to search stack overflow for how to generate a

676
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:08,219
certificate and then you copy and paste exactly what's in stack over

677
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:12,239
and then it fails because you're open as a cell.com wants the state and not the,

678
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,979
I forget what I always had to edit back in the day. And,

679
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,780
and, and this is similar, this is not as simple as people make it out to be.

680
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,859
It's simple for us because we're security nerds. We do this all the freaking time.

681
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,339
-- It's one of those
-- classic, it's easy. If you know how to do it,

682
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,589
it's still not easy.

683
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,290
Well, if you know how to do it,

684
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,439
you know what keywords to plug into Google to get the stack

685
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:32,739
over food

686
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,189
or you know what,

687
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:36,869
you know, what else is going to happen.

688
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,780
There are going to be people who only

689
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,170
publish their Python package once or twice a year

690
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,270
and they're going to completely forget how to do all this stuff.

691
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:45,569
You have to remem

692
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:47,560
where they kept the U BC. And

693
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:47,890
that

694
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,209
was my,

695
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,219
that was my biggest argument against requiring open source to become

696
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:55,930
like AC NA A CV numbering authority to do CV.

697
00:28:55,939 --> 00:28:56,449
S because

698
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,040
a lot of these projects do like

699
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,280
one security vulnerability a quarter.

700
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,089
Like, unless you're doing something at least weekly, you're gonna forget

701
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,180
every year.

702
00:29:05,189 --> 00:29:08,219
I have to kind of relearn how to mow my lawn because it's been six months and it's like,

703
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:08,819
uh,

704
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:12,369
you know, did I go around and then back and forth? Did I go and like, uh,

705
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:12,709
what

706
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,300
was the best way? And then I hit the tree root and I'm like, oh, that's right.

707
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,040
I go this way to avoid the stupid tree root,

708
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:18,300
you know.

709
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,250
Right. Oh, it makes a horrible noise when the blade of the mower hits it

710
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:26,800
-- that you just keep doing it. And eventually it is I
-- that, but the tree is growing.

711
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,060
-- Uh
-- not if you keep hitting it.

712
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:30,390
So,

713
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,349
and that's the thing, right is,

714
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:34,280
that's a great example of you,

715
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,089
you're requiring an additional action maybe once a

716
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,329
quarter or once a month from people.

717
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,310
And now that actually they have to look up how to do it, they have to blah, blah, blah.

718
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,739
And now, you know, something that

719
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,709
if you know how to do it, it's super easy and takes 30 seconds.

720
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,369
Now it's 5, 1020 minutes,

721
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,810
I'll do it after dinner if I get around to it.

722
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:56,619
And then I, I've done that. Oh, I forget, I've got some project

723
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,380
that

724
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:59,410
I forgot how to

725
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,489
cut a release or something on. And I just like, kind of quit because

726
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,180
I don't remember how to do it.

727
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:07,310
That was it.

728
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,930
But ok, so I wanna, I wanna wrap this one up because we've been all over the place.

729
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:13,969
But I think fundamentally at the end of the day, what,

730
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,130
what I think all of this really comes down to

731
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:16,969
is

732
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:20,300
if this is what PP wants to do and I applaud

733
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,569
them for taking initiative in this specific area because I think

734
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,790
like security is hard

735
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,520
and there's a lot of things we can do.

736
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:32,069
I do think we also need to obviously keep, keep tabs on like, what is this

737
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,239
like, how many attacks is it stopping? What does it look like?

738
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,910
Are the attacks getting better or worse or whatever?

739
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,229
But that, that's another conversation.

740
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,109
-- So
-- like some sort of global security,

741
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,390
database of things that are security related in a database, something like that.

742
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,189
But, but anyway, the point is like

743
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:47,670
pipe pie can do this.

744
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,270
And that's great. Like, and if you don't like it

745
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,910
either, start your own, get involved in pi pie and help them.

746
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,670
But here's a problem or failure to know is so when a Dev refuses to do this,

747
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,989
what happens to the package?

748
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,380
Do they forcibly

749
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:02,209
revoke ownership of it?

750
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:03,290
And

751
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:06,000
that's a great question

752
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,920
and, and it'll probably happen with the 3000 developers like

753
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,560
it'll happen more than once

754
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,359
and and not only that, here's the thing like,

755
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:23,479
so what happens if you have 3000 developers and let's say 1% of them 300

756
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,750
every month

757
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,319
or 30 not 300

758
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:29,060
but let's say 30 a month have to reset their two factor

759
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:29,189
off

760
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,040
and right now you open an issue.

761
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,109
So I mean, that's one of the other things you have to think of at the at the scale.

762
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,270
Yeah, that's how pipe pye is doing.

763
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,869
-- You open an issue with them to reset your two factor
-- odd.

764
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:40,160
-- So they do like a manual reset.
-- It's

765
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,140
-- probably
-- human. It's very human. It looks like

766
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:46,430
which is safer than automated because you can potentially weed out.

767
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,479
That's like saying because if we have humans do the code reviews,

768
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:50,400
they'll review the code.

769
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,859
No, they hit that like, yeah, looks fine button.

770
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,930
Well, and that's fair.

771
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,260
Well,

772
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:59,619
-- probably
-- we use a password manager at the CS A and every

773
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,140
time a new person signs in or does an account reset,

774
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,369
I get an email saying, like,

775
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,140
so and so wanted to set up their count or do a password reset.

776
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,260
And I'm like, ok, like, I don't talk to them and hunt them down and be like,

777
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,369
did you really mean to do that?

778
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,170
No, I just, that

779
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:11,420
I

780
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:14,020
-- don't have time to
-- actually that, that, that could be fair.

781
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,219
I don't know what their process will be. I hope it's not just click. Ok.

782
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:21,430
-- But it might be, which is obviously bad. But
-- what are they gonna do? Like,

783
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,060
like,

784
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:24,170
like the government send me a pin number in the mail

785
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,150
to make sure I still live there and then I plug that

786
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:26,550
into the

787
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:27,760
website anyway.

788
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,630
And to be clear, I'm not accusing pipe pye of collecting people's addresses.

789
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,349
-- Oh my God.
-- Stop

790
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,979
that. Why do you keep doing this?

791
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,910
This is, see, you're not allowed to talk about that anymore. That's your problem.

792
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,449
Just stop talking about that particular point and you'll be fine.

793
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,329
So the, the point is, but that's the point, right?

794
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,010
If you do account, recover properly,

795
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:50,550
-- it's a inexpensive, heavy process.
-- Yeah, that's true. That's true. And so anyway,

796
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,290
the point is the point of all this,

797
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,060
like,

798
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,530
I will be interested to see what this all looks like in a year or two.

799
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,729
Once I think it's maybe more scaled out than we're seeing because

800
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,969
we

801
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,790
as security people love to talk about like the incredible benefits of two factor.

802
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,670
Often there are many places that has great benefits. But I think

803
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,640
too much of what we do is what I call smart people. That think something is a good idea,

804
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:16,089
-- like
-- password rotation

805
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,969
if we do this. Right. And that's, that's exactly it right

806
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:20,925
where a smart person thought that was a good idea.

807
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:24,574
And once research was done and we had data, we can say no, this was a terrible idea.

808
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:26,494
And I think everything we're doing now,

809
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:31,255
it concerns me because there's way too much smart people think this is a good idea

810
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:35,895
and not enough, let's actually treat this as a scientific problem

811
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:39,390
and look at it using reason and research and the

812
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,540
-- scientific method and we are not doing that
-- well.

813
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,989
And it's actually harder than that because there's 2nd and 3rd order effects

814
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,569
that will only show up at scale. Because if something is,

815
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,569
for example, if something is one in a million, OK, that's two in the note ecosystem.

816
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,060
And maybe it doesn't matter.

817
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:54,319
And,

818
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:58,469
but maybe it does because those two packages are like left pad or shift or whatever,

819
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,449
right. And that's the problem is

820
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,859
part of this has to be sort of this experimental

821
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:05,689
like throw it at the wall and see what sticks.

822
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,639
But again, maybe we can do it a little more

823
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,100
gently. Like I, I perfect example,

824
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:15,489
I look at this and I'm like, why didn't they just make this voluntary?

825
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:22,208
-- And, and see if like, just see if did seven people sign up or 700 it is
-- voluntary today.

826
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,589
Well, it's voluntary in the sense if you don't do it, we kick you out.

827
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:29,148
Well, ok, that is not voluntary.

828
00:34:29,158 --> 00:34:33,208
But I'm saying like today you can turn on two factor off in your Pi Pye account

829
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:37,388
and like, I have a pipe Pye account and I haven't done it because it's, I,

830
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:38,388
I can't be bothered.

831
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:39,509
-- Like,
-- I, I think github

832
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:42,349
did it in a good way, for example, where you can apply

833
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,250
to fa at the organization level and at an organization level,

834
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,260
that's kind of

835
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,300
like more of a dunbar number of people where it's not so horrifying.

836
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,510
Maybe, I don't know.

837
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:54,300
And I think

838
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:54,668
maybe

839
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,459
I feel like part of the challenge here too is when you,

840
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,540
it's like, Sweden, when they went from uh right hand to left hand driving,

841
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,080
right.

842
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,100
And it was like, they had a massive plan, you know, at three in the morning,

843
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,439
all the traffic stopped and

844
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:12,189
stuff and like, you know, they had like, you had like 30 or 40 minutes to like,

845
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,629
basically do a u-turn with all your cars and like, and,

846
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,709
but you weren't allowed to drive, like,

847
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,290
you're allowed to basically do a u-turn point the other way, get everything ready

848
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,810
and then at like four o'clock or whatever in the morning traffic recommences.

849
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:23,050
And I feel like

850
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,260
that's,

851
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,489
it's not going to work real well or gracefully or painlessly.

852
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,229
And I think we need to find better ways to kind

853
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,659
of roll out these new security solutions to people because,

854
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:37,590
huh. Fun fact. One time.

855
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,540
Oh, my, this is, this is one of the things I will forever be shameful of.

856
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,530
We're getting a whole bunch of email phishing at the CS A, especially Office Docs.

857
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,820
So I had a bright idea. And what was that? Do you think?

858
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,179
-- You, did you block the office Docs? No,
-- I'm not that stupid.

859
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:53,739
I proposed that we block the office Docs.

860
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:54,830
And then

861
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,250
did you work for the CS A? I'm sorry. It's on the record.

862
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,570
I've apologized via email and in Slack it was a bad idea. Ok.

863
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,770
And yeah, like, luckily I wasn't dumb enough to just go block it.

864
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,489
I, I actually kind of floated the idea and how did it get slapped down hard fast?

865
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,270
I can imagine

866
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,959
they were right, because the, the solution would have,

867
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,300
the cure would have been way worse than the disease,

868
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:20,969
you know?

869
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,010
And that's what I worry here

870
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:26,139
is that I don't think they're going to do irreparable damage.

871
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:29,360
But does this solve a problem? Is this the best way to do it?

872
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:30,479
Well, it does solve a problem.

873
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:35,574
But is the, the question isn't that we know it solves a problem? Is the,

874
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:38,774
is the pain and suffering of implementing this.

875
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:41,385
-- When your data set is one that doesn't,
-- there

876
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:43,054
-- are
-- not a lot of these attacks. I agree.

877
00:36:43,064 --> 00:36:48,324
I think things like uh uh type of squatting is vastly more dangerous, but also

878
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:50,504
we literally don't know how to fix that. Today.

879
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:52,665
I actually had a thought about that and it was simple

880
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:55,590
when you register a corporate name in most jurisdictions,

881
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,010
they check for similar sounding or spelled names and and stop it.

882
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,580
And the flip side is that doesn't work across jurisdictions.

883
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,159
So for example,

884
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:04,739
there is a standard General here in Alberta

885
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,550
that is like a massive company that does paving

886
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,929
and there's like a Scheer

887
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,010
contractor out in eastern Canada that registered that name in his province.

888
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:14,209
And people think it's

889
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:18,070
like the same company because what's the standard general? Right? I got you.

890
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,580
And it's not, it's like some total Scheer

891
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,600
guy who's totally ripped off people,

892
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:24,449
but we don't have that problem. We have a single jurisdiction.

893
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:28,129
It's pipe.org like you want to live in that name space, you play by their rules.

894
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,439
And so for example,

895
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:31,879
they could implement rules that say things like, ok,

896
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,870
we're gonna deal with cosmic bit flips so

897
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:37,870
we're gonna generate every possible like off by one

898
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,370
name for your package

899
00:37:41,149 --> 00:37:43,580
and that's not allowed anymore. Like that's now reserved.

900
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:46,830
We could, for example, like do the Scrabble thing of like, you know,

901
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
these letters look too much alike,

902
00:37:48,979 --> 00:37:52,370
man. This is, this is a hard problem. We're out of time.

903
00:37:52,379 --> 00:37:54,949
I'm not, I'm not willing to say it is. I think you're done in Kruger

904
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,340
this, well, I'm pointing out that it's not impossible to solve.

905
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,370
I don't know that this would solve it. But

906
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:04,030
again, unless we sort of talk about it and try it in a

907
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,889
hypothetical situation, we don't know.

908
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,939
I think this is why we need a tech because we need the ability to

909
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,699
look at this

910
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:15,590
-- more holistically I think.
-- Well, here's a good example. No, no example

911
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:15,820
is

912
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,379
very simple. What if Pi Pie

913
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,659
actually logged all the requests for packages that

914
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:23,899
don't exist and published that data set?

915
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:26,459
That would be very interesting to be honest with you.

916
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,989
Number one Attackers would be like he,

917
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,500
-- yeah. Now I know it's a typo squat,
-- right?

918
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:34,179
But number two, we could actually see like how common or

919
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,449
-- problematic is this
-- typos

920
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,000
anyway. All right. I'm calling this one man. This was, this was fun.

921
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,689
