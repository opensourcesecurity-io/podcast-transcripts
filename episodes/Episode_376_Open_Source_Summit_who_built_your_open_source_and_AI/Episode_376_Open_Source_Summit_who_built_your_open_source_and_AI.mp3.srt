Hello and welcome to the open source Security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:10,689
Kurt Siefried and my partner in

2
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,710
a Thought Crime.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,890
Josh Pressers.

4
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,750
-- That was impressive.
-- It's been five weeks.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,399
I know it's been a long time since we've talked. I used to talk a lot and

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,559
it's been busy,

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,479
but I'm, I'm back from the Open

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,829
Source Summit and I just want to say there

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,969
were an enormous number of people who asked about you

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,110
-- and that made me very happy.
-- So,

11
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:31,520
like, do I owe them money?

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,490
No. Yes, they were shaking me down for money. You owe them, Kurt.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,259
No, they're worried about you. That's great.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,950
So we're back. Hello. Thank you everyone for the love. It's appreciated.

15
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:43,189
I actually hadn't told Kurt that till just now. So,

16
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,520
-- so
-- just to clear the air. So basically my ex wife is sick.

17
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:52,549
So I'm now full time taking care of my kids and one of my kids is um special needs,

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,430
has autism

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,430
and needless to say

20
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,069
both of my kids are horrifically stressed out by this whole situation.

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,150
Gee, imagine that.

22
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:03,389
And so

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,349
the, the, yeah, there's just a lot of challenges but uh we're doing ok,

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,769
we're actually all losing weight, which is good because we're eating better.

25
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,709
We're eating as a family and yeah, it's good

26
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:16,190
and um actually my one son is going to school like in the morning and the afternoon

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,550
and he's asking to go.

28
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,209
-- Oh, that's
-- fantastic.

29
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,430
That hasn't happened in years.

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,949
So things are actually better in some ways, but I'm just very sleep deprived.

31
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:26,569
Very, very sleep deprived.

32
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,639
That's like the worst thing ever, man.

33
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,239
-- It is literal torture. Right.
-- Right. Yeah. Literally, literally.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,559
Anyway. Alright,

35
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,720
-- I'm gonna, I'm gonna move straight along
-- now.

36
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,959
So the open source summer because yeah, I really,

37
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,900
that's something I would have loved to go to because it's only an hour flight for me.

38
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,235
So it was in Vancouver, Canada, which

39
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:46,714
is a lovely city for anyone who hasn't been. I've never been there before.

40
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:48,955
-- It's
-- like San Francisco but with healthcare

41
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:50,324
I, that's fair.

42
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:54,154
-- Yeah. Yeah, I mean it has that kind of feel to it, it
-- same climate,

43
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:57,434
it was similar, it was much warmer than San Francisco I think.

44
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,169
Well, that's true. We do have a heat wave across and like my province is on fire

45
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:03,169
like all of it.

46
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:03,930
That's true.

47
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,980
There was, there were no fires I could see while I was there but it was good

48
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,690
and,

49
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:12,139
and so I have kind of two big takeaways I thought we should talk about from the Open

50
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,919
Source Summit.

51
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,889
I Well, ok, let me kind of rephrase this for anyone who doesn't know because

52
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,130
I'm sure there's people listening that are like open source summit.

53
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,889
What the heck is that?

54
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,360
The Linux Foundation used to have a conference called Linux Con,

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,270
which was a lovely show.

56
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,149
Many years ago. I went to it a couple of times

57
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,550
and it was super nerdy.

58
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,630
What Linux Con was nerdy, obviously.

59
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,589
-- I mean, you fill a building full of Linux people and it gets nerdy. But no, no, no,
-- no.

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,320
I mean, like

61
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,250
if you look at a conference like Rs A or black hat,

62
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:46,039
I would say those are not nerdy conferences, those are marketing,

63
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,339
those are sales conferences.

64
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,009
-- Right.
-- Exactly. Whereas the open

65
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,679
source summit is still a very nerdy conference.

66
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,440
It is not a sales focus conference and that's great because I,

67
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,600
I enjoy that I enjoy the people there

68
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:02,100
and you have marvelous conversations and many of the talks are very good and you

69
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,559
see people that you've known forever because it's

70
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,410
just a bunch of old open source nerds

71
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,339
-- pretty much hanging out
-- at this point

72
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,029
people.

73
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,740
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's great.

74
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,820
But anyway,

75
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,399
there were kind of two themes I really latched on to from talking

76
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,580
to people and sitting through talks and I gave a couple of panels and

77
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,869
the first theme I think is

78
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,369
we are still focused on fear and security.

79
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,570
When,

80
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,229
when someone's trying to talk about like supply chain

81
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,309
security or build system security or application security,

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,589
they're all,

83
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,470
it's just about, oh, do you know who's building your packages?

84
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,169
-- Do you trust your developers? Can you trust your build system? And I'm
-- like,

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,850
how do you know there aren't peanuts in there?

86
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,669
It's never worked. Why do we keep doing this? That's what I keep thinking.

87
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,070
So

88
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:46,009
I'll tell you why

89
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,490
we keep doing this is because the alternative of

90
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,220
being empathic and patient and kind and listening to people

91
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,649
is really hard work. Like you have to fundamentally change who you are as a person.

92
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,449
That's it. No.

93
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,419
Like, and I say this like,

94
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:03,539
I have a special needs child who I literally drop him off school

95
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,410
in 20 minutes that I get a phone call from the school.

96
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,410
And she's like, I,

97
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,789
I'm having trouble understanding like what he's

98
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,410
saying because he's asking for a video.

99
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,770
She's like, and she's like, ok, can you say it again?

100
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:13,630
And he's like, blah, blah, I'm like, oh groceries,

101
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,589
he wants the grocery bag and it like you anyways,

102
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,160
the point is I've over the last 10 years have honestly fundamentally changed how I

103
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,510
listen to people because I've had to learn to listen to somebody very carefully,

104
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,049
very patiently, very kindly.

105
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,239
And that is a

106
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,959
really hard skill to develop. I won't disagree with that.

107
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,809
The majority of people don't understand my son.

108
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,140
And I'm like, it's clear he's saying this, he wants this like, duh, just listen to him

109
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,070
and I've actually got a document where I talk about like if he says this,

110
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,640
what he means is this, you know,

111
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,149
because he uses give and take, he doesn't say take,

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,500
just give like or like when he says,

113
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,209
I want to look at something that means also use or consume,

114
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,609
right? So he says, I want to look at your candy bar,

115
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,519
I'll be getting it back.

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,529
I mean, look, I say that all the time, I never give it back.

117
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,220
So

118
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,309
and that's the thing.

119
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,500
So learning to listen patiently and with empathy and with kindness and to,

120
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:07,000
and to really like that classic thing of like, OK,

121
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:08,929
what I'm hearing you say is this,

122
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:13,589
but maybe do you mean this or let's go level deeper, like essentially doing

123
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,799
therapy on the person of like, OK, you say you want an application that does X but

124
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,149
what you really do, you really want

125
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,790
maybe it to do this thing

126
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,950
and you're just kind of trapped in thinking it has to be done this other way.

127
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,829
And that's why you're asking for an accounting app.

128
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,709
I mean, OK, so I think

129
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,140
you are correct, but

130
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,989
I don't think

131
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,950
-- security
-- people, oh it's, this is not a solution. People won't do this.

132
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,809
Well, it's not even a matter of doing it. I don't think

133
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,089
we understand many of the problems enough.

134
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,470
And, and so I actually,

135
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,480
I have a marvelous example of this is I was sitting in a panel where people were

136
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:52,940
talking about like the salsa framework and the Fresca

137
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,480
framework and Microsoft's S two C two F,

138
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,769
it is Frescas like

139
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,239
a,

140
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,329
no, it's Fr CS A,

141
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:01,945
it's an open SSF thing. It is a,

142
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,174
what do you call it? The, it's like an example build system.

143
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:07,265
It has a fancy name that escapes me at the moment.

144
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:10,125
I'm still very tired from, from being gone for a week.

145
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,924
But anyway, I'm sitting through a panel and someone's going on and on and, and they,

146
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:18,445
they make the off color comment about, oh, if, if you have salsa,

147
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:19,565
you don't have to worry about

148
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:23,255
solar winds. I'm like, hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm, I'm in the audience.

149
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:26,045
I'm like, I'm like, hold on, hold on. I need to interrupt for just a moment here.

150
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:30,170
And I said, we love to hand wave

151
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,559
these

152
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,010
kind of attacks as, oh, if only you did this thing, this, this,

153
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,600
this thing I'm working on,

154
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,630
it would solve the problem. And it's like,

155
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:39,649
no,

156
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,329
and I did find out actually there,

157
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,100
there's a group in the open ssf called the end users working group.

158
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:45,929
They are doing work

159
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,480
on basically creating a li like, like taking these attacks, right?

160
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:52,959
Things like log for shell solar winds, whatever,

161
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,540
taking all these attacks

162
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,829
and kind of mapping them into. What part of infrastructure would this affect?

163
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,320
And then how could we change what we do

164
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,089
to have avoided that

165
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,399
in the past? Which I think is exactly

166
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:08,395
the right thing. To do.

167
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:11,825
Uh I feel like you should maybe tell them about the attack framework, which is,

168
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:13,355
that's the whole point of this,

169
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:13,876
right?

170
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:17,365
And, and the the the end user working group is kind of doing that, but that's just it,

171
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:17,585
right?

172
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:17,996
Because

173
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:20,436
like salsa is a cool idea,

174
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:26,536
but I think we often back it into places trying to make it work instead of saying, OK,

175
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:28,036
we have this framework,

176
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:32,361
let's like actually do an analysis of attacks and what we're

177
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:35,511
suggesting and what will work and then modify as needed.

178
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,562
And I think that is something security people are very bad at.

179
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,291
-- I
-- think
-- it's worse than that because yeah, they're starting,

180
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,951
I have a solution for your problem and they

181
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,191
haven't actually listened to or understood the problem.

182
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:50,062
And the second big challenge and failure I often see here is

183
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:52,712
they assume that salsa is going to be applied correctly

184
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:54,712
in some magical version of correct,

185
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,429
right? Like a perfect example is we had a cryptographic signing of bio

186
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,040
stuff because

187
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:05,290
duh, right, if you don't sign it, Attackers will make fake biases and blah, blah,

188
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:05,450
blah.

189
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,220
Well,

190
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,299
how'd that work out for M si and Intel last week?

191
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,489
They might have accidentally leaked a bunch of keys

192
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,130
and like suspiciously Intel is doing a microcode update for

193
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:20,429
-- every single currently supported CPU like
-- I

194
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,260
didn't connect those two dots actually.

195
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,829
-- That's funny. Oh, yes.
-- How did you not connect those?

196
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:26,200
I'm

197
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,250
maybe

198
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,500
I,

199
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,179
I was like,

200
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,239
I'm like, dude, you know, like, OK, let's be real shipping. A kernel update is hard

201
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,609
like when we were

202
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,280
microcode is harder because if you mess up a microcode update,

203
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,219
remember when we did that thing and Intel did that thing

204
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,059
and then a whole bunch of Dell servers got bricked.

205
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,789
I mean, micro code won't break your server, just roll back the micro code. It's fine.

206
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:50,419
So assuming you can get back into the buy off,

207
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,580
you can, you know microcodes applied at boot time is fine,

208
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:54,599
right?

209
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:57,219
Well, I'm just saying like it's, if you make a mistake in microcode,

210
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:58,669
you're gonna have a lot of angry customers,

211
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,070
whatever they got that. Right.

212
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,510
And the point is they're doing a microcode update for

213
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,119
every single currently supported cu the only way they would actually

214
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,909
do that is that there is an end of the

215
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,489
world like an extinction level event meteor headed for them.

216
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,559
I mean, maybe I don't know,

217
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,919
-- it'll be interesting to see why I hope they publish details
-- anyways. But

218
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,950
like that's the thing is they also assume

219
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,260
that salsa will be somehow applied correctly.

220
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,799
And, and the other thing that kills me is all, most, all of these solutions

221
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,960
have like a real heavy operational component

222
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,200
and it's not like um well, seatbelts are a good example,

223
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,359
seatbelts have an operational component in the sense of you have to put them on

224
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,000
for them to work,

225
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:44,340
but putting a seatbelt on is very easy. And I love that.

226
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:48,150
I've got my kids trained to the point now where, like, we sat down in the car and,

227
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:48,739
uh,

228
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,799
I forget what it was.

229
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:52,059
We weren't going to leave for a few minutes and Felix, like,

230
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,200
put on his seatbelt right away.

231
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,239
And I'm like, don't worry, we're not leaving yet and he's like, have it.

232
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,880
And I'm like, it's a good habit. I'm not going to argue with you. I agree with that. And

233
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,400
so something like the seatbelt,

234
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,020
the operational component of putting it on is acceptable.

235
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,169
And also the cart dings at me if I don't put my seatbelt on and so on and so forth.

236
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,909
But if I don't run salsa correctly,

237
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,200
everything looks fine.

238
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:15,510
Ah, so, so there's actually a solution to this that I think is quite acceptable

239
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,400
and that is

240
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,119
github

241
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:22,159
is putting a ton of work into making a lot of this stuff, just the default state.

242
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,640
And I think that's the key is you need places like github

243
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,799
-- that
-- is literally just passing the operational

244
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,479
buck to somebody who's hopefully competent.

245
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,369
I mean,

246
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,289
this is like, what I've done with electricity, I don't generate my electricity.

247
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,080
-- I pay up
-- cor

248
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:36,500
I'm, I'm a ok with that. I think that's exactly the right way to do it.

249
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,539
-- Well,
-- this is how cloud won because

250
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,770
let's be real.

251
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,340
Do you want Amazon web services in charge of your

252
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:45,179
servers or the random people you hired off the street.

253
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:46,809
They're not,

254
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:49,140
they're not random. You hired them

255
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,229
well, but you get what I'm saying? Right.

256
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,539
Like most places this is industrialization and specialization.

257
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,289
That's right.

258
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,150
I mean, remember when people would complain about, oh,

259
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,169
Cloud is just someone else's computer.

260
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,520
That's the

261
00:10:59,710 --> 00:10:59,849
point.

262
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,570
I mean,

263
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:01,099
-- that's
-- the

264
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:03,869
-- whole point.
-- That's the advantage. Like,

265
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,429
my water tap is just somebody else's sanitation plant.

266
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeah, that's,

267
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,429
that's exactly what I want.

268
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,969
You know, you just reminded me of what

269
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,789
there was uh another discussion I was having and someone makes a comment.

270
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,619
Oh, do you know who wrote that open

271
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,429
source software?

272
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:21,330
And I said, do you know, do you know who grew your lunch?

273
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:24,330
And I think they, they might have gotten it.

274
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,809
-- But it's like, it's literally the same problem.
-- Asked them to name

275
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,570
10 kernel developers past Luna

276
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,280
Stoltz.

277
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,869
I couldn't name 10 and I know like five or six,

278
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,760
I'd be like Great Crow Hartman,

279
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,169
Lynes

280
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:36,929
Tods,

281
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,429
-- Sasha
-- Levin, who, who work with the G

282
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,789
SD?

283
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,739
Oh, yeah. Is,

284
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,109
is he still a developer?

285
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:48,080
I don't know actually because Ted did the file systems a long time ago.

286
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,460
-- I
-- think there's a several,

287
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,559
-- is it several 1000 active Linux internal developers now?
-- Oh,

288
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,849
I bet it's at least that.

289
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,599
And so, yeah, that whole, that whole fear based of like, yeah.

290
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:59,950
Do you know where this came from? No, I like it. It came off of github.

291
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,750
-- It's probably fine
-- even in your company.

292
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,989
Do you know, who wrote the software, like, where, what country were they in?

293
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,929
I mean, well, this, like, reminds me of my mother because she, like,

294
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,799
she came to Canada, you know, she's German originally and came to Canada, you know,

295
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,559
and she had all her paperwork and all her stuff and her phd

296
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,489
and she went to work for the government and, like,

297
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,460
nobody actually ever asked her to prove that she had her phd,

298
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,460
like they just sort of took it at face value

299
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,690
and she had all this paperwork prepared and the,

300
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,030
the properly printed and everything ready to go

301
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,059
and like, nobody ever checked or validated it.

302
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,619
And

303
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,289
that's something like

304
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:35,739
with your developers

305
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,099
do. They,

306
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:38,770
like,

307
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,750
beyond being able to write fizz buzz.

308
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,830
Have you actually validated that they know what they're doing?

309
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,859
I bet a lot of places haven't. I mean, you know, this reminds me as well.

310
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:47,789
I remember when I graduated from college,

311
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:50,469
I got like six copies of my transcript.

312
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:54,469
So I would have them ready for like job interviews and potential. You know,

313
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:58,549
I have literally never shown them to a single human being one time.

314
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,190
I just have them. I still have,

315
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,479
everybody assumes I have a degree in comp sci

316
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:04,159
because I work in this industry and I'm like,

317
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:04,469
uh

318
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:04,650
j

319
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,099
-- let's go with that.
-- I don't have a degree in comp sci.

320
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:10,640
I was an electrical engineer and then I was like, well, I don't want to do this,

321
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,799
let me rephrase, everybody assumes I have a degree and I'm like, sure.

322
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:14,570
Yeah, you just keep

323
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,739
-- assuming that
-- whatever, who cares anyway. All right. All right.

324
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,010
Before we run ourselves out of time,

325
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,440
I want to flip over to the other topic that I found most interesting.

326
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:28,119
A, I came up an enormous number of conversations. Weird, who knew. Right.

327
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:33,710
But here's the part that I think I found the most interesting is half of the people

328
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,700
are saying a I is stupid and worthless and half the people are like,

329
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,539
it's literally going to fire us all and take over.

330
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:44,299
Now, what's really funny though is someone I work with was like, why not both?

331
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,650
That's the thing. It's gonna be a mix of all of the above.

332
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,385
There's, there's gonna like Wendy's is replacing all their order takers with A I,

333
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:53,145
-- well,
-- I mean, we'll see if that works.

334
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:54,426
So, you know, here's the thing,

335
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,966
there's a video from Tom Scott that I suspect you've seen,

336
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:58,986
but he chose that little like s curve.

337
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:02,786
And the challenge is where on the S curve are we? We don't know yet.

338
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:04,185
We won't know for a couple of years.

339
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:07,346
And I think self driving cars are my favorite recent example

340
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:10,185
where like five years ago we were talking about how,

341
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:12,106
like we'll never have to drive again soon.

342
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:15,745
And unfortunately I'm still driving myself around and I hate it and I'm,

343
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,546
I'm even angry because I know

344
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:22,231
that I, I was hoping I wouldn't have to do this by now.

345
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:27,932
And I, I did test driving so I feel like I've had the future I want snatched from.

346
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,632
Well, see, with the A I, and, and let's speak,

347
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:34,231
I think we're mostly everybody's talking about is a generative.

348
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:37,151
A, I very specifically the large language models because that is the,

349
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:41,981
where all of a sudden it turns out, oh, this is actually not hard to do. You just need

350
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:46,091
some big honking cards, lots of memory and lots of cores.

351
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:46,771
And

352
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,619
I love that open A I is like,

353
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,770
and part of our data set was every comment on reddit that got three or more votes.

354
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,419
And I'm like, oh my God,

355
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,250
like

356
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:54,690
uh

357
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:55,489
I

358
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:57,880
didn't turn it off Twitter like that Microsoft bought.

359
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:58,380
I

360
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:58,789
know,

361
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,099
but the thing is ignoring A I is stupid or A I is gonna kill

362
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:07,210
everything A I two day is giving people useful results and getting work done.

363
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:08,570
And it's also,

364
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,419
it's not just doing work more efficiently. Like my favorite example is

365
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,510
one of the people at the CS A used it to rewrite a whole

366
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,359
bunch of paper abstracts to be about the same length and the same tone,

367
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:20,020
right?

368
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,809
Rather because you know, everybody that submits paper,

369
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,849
submits their own abstract obviously.

370
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:28,450
And so the abstracts are anywhere from like 10 words to like a book

371
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,739
like even, you know, longer than the presentation itself, however,

372
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,659
they achieve that.

373
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:36,849
And of course, the tone and the writing style is everywhere from like

374
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,640
an English major to, you know,

375
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,820
somebody who I think fed it through Google translate from like Korean.

376
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,119
And so she basically had

377
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,619
open A I chat

378
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,590
GP D just kind of rewrite them all to be like

379
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,239
50 words and roughly the same tone of voice and boom done

380
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,719
in, you know, an hour.

381
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,250
It's also going to enable things like one thing I would like

382
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,760
to see us do at the CS A is take your resume,

383
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,630
take the jobs that you want

384
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:00,789
and find the gaps

385
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,270
that

386
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:02,669
find the gaps.

387
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,599
And

388
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,809
that's step one, step two is then how do you most effectively address those gaps?

389
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,010
Some of those gaps might be like, ok, look you just

390
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,479
to address this gap, it's, it's so much work if you really want to do this, like,

391
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:16,010
go ahead.

392
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,349
But,

393
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,715
but maybe you wanna like change your sort of what you wanna do a bit, right?

394
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:20,815
Or versus like, oh, you know,

395
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:23,075
here's like the top three courses to address this gap or

396
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:26,465
here's a resource to learn and address this gap or whatever,

397
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:26,885
right?

398
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:31,094
And we could do that right now and I could look at a resume and I could look at the,

399
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:34,575
the jobs they want to take and I could figure that out in an hour or two,

400
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,434
but we'd have to charge way too much money for this.

401
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:40,434
Whereas if we build a system using chat GP T to do this.

402
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:42,434
It's going to cost about a dollar.

403
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,510
Like, no, that's it. It's just, it's like an API,

404
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,210
it's gonna cost operationally like a dollar. Now.

405
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:51,150
We obviously we have to build this thing that does

406
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,169
this and that will cost more than a dollar,

407
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,719
a few dollars. In fact,

408
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,099
EPT

409
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,250
is, but the thing is once we build it,

410
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,130
that's the beauty of software, right? You're

411
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,969
like 100% of the cost is the first copy

412
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:07,329
or 99.9% of the cost is the first copy and then running it then.

413
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,810
So then if we can offer this as a thing for,

414
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,829
you know,

415
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,560
at a very affordable price or,

416
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:13,818
you know, whatever

417
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,250
all of a sudden we're doing something new

418
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,339
and useful in helping people get better jobs.

419
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:19,420
I would love to do that.

420
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,848
That's what I keep thinking of is

421
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,410
it is easy to try to disregard this.

422
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,239
And there are some just chef's kiss examples of how stupid A I is.

423
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,030
I've noticed a lot of people poo pooing it and I'm like, oh,

424
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,800
have you tried it? And they're like, no or they're like, oh, I tried the free one.

425
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,260
I'm like, oh, have you tried? Well, and this is less applicable now.

426
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,949
But Chat GP T Four, you had to previously pay the $20 a month to get access to. Right.

427
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,989
And I, I don't think it's still available for free but whatever.

428
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:52,520
Not as good. So, I, I don't, I haven't paid them. I've used the chat GP T website stuff.

429
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:57,400
-- Yeah. Chat GP T three and 35 are garbage compared to four is
-- four. Not the one you use.

430
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,000
-- When you use the website.
-- When you use the website by default, you're in 3.5.

431
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,199
Unless you're paying for chat GP T plus and selecting it, you're not getting

432
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:10,819
four and chat GP T +41 of the biggest things is for example,

433
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:14,680
it can summarize chat GP T +335 cannot summarize worth a damn

434
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,319
chat GP T four is like this. That's the one you want.

435
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,420
The chat GT.

436
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:22,180
And this is part of the problem is people haven't

437
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:24,260
spent 20 bucks and even tried chat GP T four.

438
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,869
They tried the chat GP T three and 35 from last year and they're like, oh,

439
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,459
it kind of sucks.

440
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:28,880
And I'm like,

441
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:29,540
yeah,

442
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,040
like,

443
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,739
like official policy at the CS A is everybody

444
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,109
pays, you know, gets 20 bucks a month to buy cha

445
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:36,520
GP T plus access

446
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,099
and

447
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:40,949
use version four because version three and +35 are garbage compared to four.

448
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:41,910
I

449
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,540
thought it was impressive.

450
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,619
-- The things I asked
-- three and 35 are super impressive,

451
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,500
but four is like perfect example.

452
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,869
We have to generate exams

453
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,650
for like the CCS K and CCAK and stuff, right?

454
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,709
And so we have to generate a ton of multiple choice questions you know,

455
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,189
with like four or five answers.

456
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,099
And it's hard to do these because, you know, to get

457
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:02,949
yes, it's,

458
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:06,359
I've helped put these programs together and it sounds like it shouldn't be.

459
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:10,199
But the, the questions at the end are like 80% of the work

460
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:10,739
and so

461
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:11,140
nuts.

462
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:13,599
Even when we have humans do this,

463
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:18,050
that we have to do a lot of manual review and massaging of the questions they submit.

464
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:23,650
Basically a PDF page of text is about 500 tokens, about 400 ish English words.

465
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,569
A token is about three quarters of an English word

466
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:26,859
on average.

467
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,359
So like the has its own token,

468
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:30,609
whereas a word like pedantically would be split up into

469
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,939
three or four separate tokens because it's a less common.

470
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,609
OK. Sure.

471
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:36,089
Because with neural networks,

472
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:39,489
like we only have 26 letters that's not enough and words,

473
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,290
we have too many bad words in the English language.

474
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,050
So tokens are this kind of happy in between, right?

475
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,619
So anyways, the point is

476
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:47,030
I can feed it

477
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,089
about four or five pages of PDF text

478
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:54,819
and say, give me 100 multiple choice questions with 4 to 5 answers,

479
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,650
including sets with all of the above.

480
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,609
And it spits that out in like a minute

481
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,770
and it the API calls like a buck or two.

482
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:04,729
Wow, that's wild man. And that,

483
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,750
that would take a human being the better part of a week.

484
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,219
It takes more than a week

485
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:12,140
-- Yeah.
-- Right. I mean, it's

486
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,890
just like I'm using chat GP T to program just to save on my RSI,

487
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:20,689
like, straight up. I just don't have to type as much because it's just like,

488
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,420
you know, de download web file and it's like, what

489
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,010
is RSI?

490
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,489
We should

491
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,050
stress injury,

492
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:27,839
right.

493
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,229
Hands and wrists make all sorts of crunchy noises.

494
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,530
Yeah. I got reduced mobility in my right shoulder and everything.

495
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,180
But, so the thing is what's killing me is all, most of the people I've met that are pu

496
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,729
a, I either one haven't actually paid 20 bucks to try chat. GP. T four.

497
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,290
Number two haven't even tried Bing Chat, which is free.

498
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,569
You just have to install edge and, like, log in with your Microsoft account.

499
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,250
And again, Bing Bing is search, uh, chat is

500
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:55,949
like,

501
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:01,069
give me the episode of, um, Chucking t Where Wilson Flies

502
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,430
and it'll suggest like one or two things,

503
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,770
you know, and get it right.

504
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:05,630
What is chugging?

505
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,270
-- It's a kids show. Look, trains.
-- Oh, trains. Ah, ok. I get it.

506
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,430
So, like, think of revamp of Thomas the train with less like capitalism and fascism.

507
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,880
Dude. They break up one of the engines in a tunnel and leave it there to die.

508
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,390
I've never seen that. Is that a real thing? I've seen a meme about that.

509
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,319
-- They really, that's
-- a real episode.

510
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:27,589
-- Holy
-- cow. That's

511
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,050
pretty

512
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,449
real.

513
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,359
There's a,

514
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,180
somebody did a deconstruction of that universe and it's dark.

515
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:33,420
Um

516
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,180
So anyways like,

517
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,609
and then the other thing is people are holding

518
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:39,540
a i to this perfection standard of like,

519
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,290
oh a I will confidently hallucinate and give you the wrong answer.

520
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,739
I'm like,

521
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,689
yeah. Have you met a used car salesman?

522
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:50,410
Oh, perfect example. Go to RS A talk to a vendor about their product

523
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:52,920
and they might say things that are like,

524
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,579
you know,

525
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:59,250
-- does it really do that, that easily,
-- whatever your problem is we can solve it,

526
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,260
just give us money.

527
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:01,010
Yeah, exactly.

528
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,140
So, I love how, you know what it totally reminds me of is

529
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,650
uh when PHP came out and everybody was like, oh,

530
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,930
this is like the worst thing ever because you don't have to

531
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,290
know how to program to write PHP scripts and stuff and the quality

532
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,810
PHP script is going to be terrible and PHP apps are terrible.

533
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:17,739
They were, they were all a horrific train wreck because

534
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,079
like, no good programmer would write in PHP, right? Only the newbies wrote in PHP.

535
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,329
-- He wrote
-- Pearl back then.

536
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,420
Pearl

537
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,569
has like proper train handling and Red Jackson blah, blah, blah,

538
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:29,589
you know,

539
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:34,030
and, and yet here we are, you know, 20 years later with wordpress and Facebook and,

540
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,810
-- and
-- no one uses Pearl anymore,

541
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:37,189
you know.

542
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:38,339
And so II,

543
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:43,010
a lot of the same arguments and sort of cultural things I'm seeing around A I

544
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,030
are exactly what we saw with like things

545
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,380
like PHP or things like all these technologies that

546
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,339
made things easier and more accessible

547
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,109
and it's like that. No, only, like, I only want a skilled artisan to do X and it's like,

548
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,770
-- that's not how the world works, like
-- certain things. Sure. But like

549
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:03,550
the number of people buying artisanal furniture is much

550
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,459
smaller than the number of people buying IKEA furniture,

551
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,349
-- you know,
-- and like here in North America Home Depot,

552
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,079
Lowe's and all those places do a ton of business with, you know,

553
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,530
casuals trying to fix their houses.

554
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,790
Like, should I hire a professional to do my electrical stuff?

555
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,239
Probably?

556
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,910
-- I mean, it depends.
-- Do I do a lot of it myself because,

557
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:25,510
yeah,

558
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,170
you know, but that I,

559
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:30,390
regardless of all that,

560
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,430
the thing that gets me is that

561
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,359
right now today A I is doing useful things for people.

562
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,790
Yeah, it does things, it does certain things. Well, I agree 100 percent.

563
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,339
It's like PHP. Is it kind of ugly and messy?

564
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:43,709
And we still have like,

565
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:47,310
we don't understand edge cases or how to make it really do it kind of good and safe.

566
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,660
Yeah. Who cares? I got my web

567
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:49,000
and,

568
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:53,780
-- uh, well,
-- you care when your application has a huge security vulnerability.

569
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,189
That's

570
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:54,939
problem.

571
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,219
That is definitely future Kurt's problem.

572
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:01,540
-- I'm getting revenue right now from
-- X and, and that's, I mean,

573
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:02,640
like,

574
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,459
I remember when

575
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,859
we worked at Red Hat

576
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,180
and we made an acquisition and the code was really bad, like, really bad.

577
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,770
You'd have to be way more specific. But

578
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:15,699
-- no,
-- I'm not, I'm not getting the specifics,

579
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:17,479
but we went to the lawyers and we were like,

580
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,739
can we review the source code for security problems next time?

581
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,489
And they're like, we literally don't care.

582
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,660
It doesn't matter what you find that isn't going

583
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,170
to affect the deal in any meaningful way.

584
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,239
So, no, no, you can't.

585
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,099
And we're like, I mean, I felt like it was like they kicked our puppy but it's like, oh,

586
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,670
ok.

587
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,599
I guess,

588
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,689
yeah, code quality.

589
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,750
Yeah, revenue wins, man. That's the thing.

590
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,050
And, and that's, I guess that's the whole point, right?

591
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,359
With like the whole A I everything. Even if it's terrible.

592
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:46,920
If people find a way to save money or make money on it, it's going, that's it.

593
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:47,390
You

594
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:48,160
seriously

595
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,849
anybody doing content creation now is going to look at two columns.

596
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:55,500
Column A is hire people to write the content for 5,

597
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,319
1015 bucks an hour or article or whatever

598
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:03,040
or column B is get content, that's, let's say for the sake of argument really bad.

599
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,010
Like only 50% is good or maybe 80% is good.

600
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,010
What cost pennies?

601
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,800
And,

602
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,869
and here's the other thing that people keep forgetting about A i

603
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,670
latency, latency matters

604
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,859
when I can get 100 multiple choice questions out of chat GP T in a few minutes.

605
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,229
I can massage my query and massage the text.

606
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:26,119
I'm feeding it and feed it different text or change the text

607
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:28,859
and I get that iteration loop going and I can

608
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:32,619
do multiple sets in an hour versus if I have,

609
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,880
if I task you to go generate 100 questions

610
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,420
and you come back to me in a week or two and they're terrible.

611
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,540
It's like, well, that's a week or two of my life that's gone

612
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:40,689
anyway.

613
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:43,670
All right, I wanna, I don't wanna keep, keep going on and on about this one, but

614
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,670
I guess I'll,

615
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,530
I'll end it with this and this is my takeaway is today the text it generates

616
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,750
is not going to be like good. Right?

617
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,969
-- Some people need good text. Some people don't.
-- I've gotten some

618
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:56,410
really good.

619
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,729
No, it won't be novel though. Kurt. That's the thing, right.

620
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,810
It's, it's only going to actually

621
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,349
generate

622
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,579
nonsense.

623
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,020
That's not

624
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:03,270
true.

625
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,310
No, I disagree with you.

626
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,650
See you confusing, you're thinking of the data in the training set.

627
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,489
You're forgetting that you can feed it new data.

628
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,640
And that's true. A human can put it down the path of a novel idea.

629
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,339
I've been doing this and I've been getting novel answers out of it.

630
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,520
-- I've actually had chat GP t surprise me. And
-- that's fair.

631
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,729
Well, no, you're not getting novel answers out of it.

632
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:26,180
You're tricking it into giving you novel answers.

633
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,239
For example,

634
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,089
I chat GP T actually can read and understand an

635
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:33,750
output mermaid text diagrams and I fed it our threat model

636
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,979
and asked it, you know, what's the biggest threat

637
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:40,119
aspect of this model? And it got it correct. It was the personal accounts recovery

638
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:45,410
and then I fed it again and it, not only it, it actually in a way got it wrong.

639
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,819
It basically gave me more than one answer, which I didn't want,

640
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:50,890
I wanted the biggest threat, but it gave me a list of threats, but

641
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,449
without being prompted, it gave me a list of workarounds and I had not asked for that.

642
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,969
-- I mean,
-- that's interesting.

643
00:26:57,219 --> 00:27:00,650
But I maintain no, the workarounds are, that's not, that's not a surprise

644
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,030
because the workarounds are

645
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,579
in the preceded Gigantor corpus of data that I think you have

646
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:10,459
to create the mermaid diagram to make it create a novel answer,

647
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:11,020
right?

648
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,079
That's the key

649
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:12,859
you need,

650
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:17,000
you need appropriate good human input to get appropriate good output.

651
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:19,750
I guarantee, I guarantee

652
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,989
here's a way to think of it, think of it like this.

653
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,099
If you or I gave chat G BT a prompt to write a story,

654
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,099
it would probably be acceptable on our level.

655
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,069
If someone like Charlie Strauss gave chat

656
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,579
GP T a prompt to write a story, it's probably going to be freaking epic

657
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:39,500
because he knows how to, he has the language and the capability

658
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:43,319
-- to start down that path.
-- I think that's what a lot of people are ignoring is.

659
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,270
It's just like power tools like you and me,

660
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,849
we could own the most expensive power saw in the world

661
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,540
and you still cannot cut, like,

662
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,760
you still cannot measure and cut a board to the exact right length on the first try.

663
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,619
And I've seen people on youtube that can, you know,

664
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,589
there's this Japanese master who does carpentry without speaking.

665
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,660
And he's just like, literally, what's those tape measures?

666
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,260
And then he just like cuts a board and he's like,

667
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,459
and it like slots in perfectly. And I'm just like,

668
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,670
oh, my mind is blown.

669
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,619
I think that's something people forget is that

670
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:13,410
these tools are only really been around for a few

671
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,209
months and people are already getting amazing results for them.

672
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:16,869
That's true.

673
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,810
Think about what happens when people actually

674
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,930
learn how to use these tools properly.

675
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:24,640
No, it's the Tom Scott S graph. It depends where we are in that graph.

676
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,890
If we're at the top of the graph in two years, it's literally going to be the same.

677
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,400
I don't, it depends. We don't know. That's part of the fun, I guess.

678
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:34,930
I think one of the most amazing aspects is all the places banning the usage of it.

679
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:38,260
And I also found, I felt like I was cheating at first, like,

680
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,410
am I really doing my job by getting this to do my job?

681
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,880
And then I was like, that's well, spell checks. The same thing.

682
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,530
-- I know the
-- banning the use is a risk conversation. We are not going

683
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:46,880
to have to.

684
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,900
No, no, but I'm just saying

685
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,449
what's interesting to me is some places are just outright banning the use of it.

686
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,369
And so there's a lot of people that won't even

687
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,010
get the chance or opportunity to really try it.

688
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,689
-- No,
-- I know again,

689
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,180
it's a risk conversation.

690
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:02,469
So I want to talk about one last thing

691
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,310
before we go. And that is the dot zip

692
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:05,869
top

693
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:06,750
level domain

694
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:07,910
from DNS.

695
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,109
There are a lot of security people going on and on

696
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:13,170
-- about how like the world will end because now dot
-- Zip.

697
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,569
So my,

698
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:13,989
ok,

699
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,900
the one new and novel thing it would result in is like

700
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,810
if I type a tweet with a file name F dot zip

701
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,349
and

702
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,089
that automatically haunt links

703
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,619
and that might also happen in email clients and other stuff. And I get that that's a

704
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,670
problem potentially. But

705
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,140
I mean, putting links and stuff is already kind of a known problem.

706
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:33,550
-- I
-- mean,

707
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,890
my suspicion is the the reason some of the people

708
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,510
are complaining is the terrible regular expression you're using to,

709
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:42,810
to sort through

710
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,880
content and emails and other things looks for dot zip and

711
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,140
now they're not gonna work because it might be a URL.

712
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:53,680
Well, I think part of the challenge is if enough places block dot zip,

713
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,150
then the domain doesn't become very useful.

714
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,949
That's true. That's true. That's like uh I know I have a friend who does,

715
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,055
he manages a hospital

716
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:06,925
and apparently.xyz is used by tons of scammers. So he just blocked that XYZ.

717
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,405
He's like, I don't know, I'm done.

718
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:09,104
Like I give up,

719
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:13,084
you win scammers blocked and maybe the same will happen to dot Zip if it's just

720
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:16,885
like a haven for malware and filth just block the whole fricking TLD and you're done.

721
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,560
Like, I just, I, I,

722
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,939
I'm trying to imagine like I get that it might

723
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:24,140
be useful for fishing or social engineering ish maybe.

724
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,420
But

725
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,089
fundamentally

726
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,739
like

727
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,880
it doesn't give you some new way to deliver a file to somebody short of it.

728
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,500
Hot linking,

729
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,290
they click the hot link and just accept the download

730
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,709
and that's totally uncontrolled which if that's the case,

731
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,699
then you've got big problems.

732
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:40,579
Yeah, it's my,

733
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,709
my suspicion is most of the whaling and gnashing of

734
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,449
teeth is just the usual like change is bad.

735
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:50,494
-- I have to, I have to learn new things and do more work
-- well. And also like.com

736
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:52,145
was a thing for a while.

737
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:55,055
-- I think in the, you know.com,
-- I've heard of that domain before.

738
00:30:55,064 --> 00:30:57,844
The other thing I think that was interesting was file

739
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:01,175
extensions have been hidden from people for over a decade now

740
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:02,194
by default

741
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:02,994
in most os

742
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:06,500
to the point where like I exported a bunch of data and it

743
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,540
was in the form of the file names were like email addresses.

744
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,430
So like fu at bla.com

745
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:14,400
and they were CS V files.

746
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,000
And because I'm interacting with this and using command line tools to do this all

747
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,640
the time I never thought to even put a dot CS V extension on them.

748
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:21,349
Oh,

749
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,000
-- I see.
-- Right. Because I'm just always interesting files all

750
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,160
-- had like.com is
-- the

751
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,459
-- Org
-- or.net or whatever. Right.

752
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:30,140
I do this, especially when I'm doing work with DNS. Right. Like,

753
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,300
where do I put the results for the scan of

754
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,099
cre.org? Well, they go to a file called

755
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:34,869
creed.org.

756
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:35,819
I

757
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:36,800
can do

758
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,650
because then I can do things like for I in star do

759
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:43,829
and pipe it back into dollar sign I or whatever dollar sign

760
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,560
I 0.2 and then move, you know, whatever.

761
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:46,140
And

762
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:49,439
I shared some of these files with somebody and they were like, what is this?

763
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:53,410
And I'm like, they're CS V files and I had to just manually tack on dot CS V to all of them

764
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,930
because I realize like, yeah, this person

765
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,550
like I'd have to walk them through,

766
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,359
basically messing around with their computer system to show

767
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:03,089
extensions and change them and blah blah blah,

768
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,770
right? Because they're using the gooey

769
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:08,410
when they double click on it, they're operating system is like

770
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:09,619
or

771
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:11,209
file like what do you want to do with this

772
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,130
or.com? It's going to execute it.com.

773
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:15,069
So

774
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,349
I think that's part of the NASH is the security people are like, oh,

775
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,410
this is dots it blah blah blah, but it's like

776
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:24,949
everybody on the planet just sees an archive file and it better be a dot

777
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,430
zip because if it's not R it's gonna fail and they're gonna have to like,

778
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:27,750
what's

779
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,920
RR

780
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:29,319
or

781
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,160
does it have to support R by default? Now, I forget that. No,

782
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:33,640
because I just had to,

783
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:35,719
some stuff I had like some old archives.

784
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:37,880
I was digging through the other day and I had to install Winrar

785
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,160
or like when I ship somebody at dot Tar dot GZ and I'm like, oh, right,

786
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,300
you're not a Linux person.

787
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,849
Ok. Here's a,

788
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:46,239
here's a dot

789
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,479
zip.

790
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:49,109
So I kind of get that. But

791
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,910
fundamentally,

792
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:55,010
I feel like this is just exposing existing weaknesses

793
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,170
and bad security.

794
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:57,609
I agree with that because

795
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,310
the thing, they keep coming back to

796
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,310
compromising one user and getting them to open one file and

797
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,270
run one thing on their workstation causes this much trouble.

798
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,189
Like what happens if they're malicious

799
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:10,030
or paid or,

800
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,349
you know,

801
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:13,510
like I'm reminded of the L TT youtube channel hack where it's

802
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,849
like it was just a PDF file that stole a token and

803
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,280
Yonk like,

804
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,859
but now I will say they were very transparent and

805
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:22,609
they claim they fixed a bunch of the problems,

806
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:23,270
which is very cool.

807
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,229
Like that's the right way to handle that situation.

808
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:27,760
Well, and in fairness, like I've dealt with youtube channel permissions and Hoy

809
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,099
like it,

810
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:33,310
it does not add like when you do really high level admin stuff to a youtube channel,

811
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,619
it's just like, OK, click.

812
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,469
Whereas like in github,

813
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:39,339
you know, it's like, oh, you wanna change this setting or add this, it's like,

814
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:40,770
stick your security key in

815
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,680
or your other two fa because,

816
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,660
like, we want to really make sure it's you.

817
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,369
Yeah.

818
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:50,119
Well, I, I just, I did that the other day where I deleted a repo and you have made me,

819
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,569
like, type in the Yes, I promise.

820
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:54,829
-- I want to delete this thing, like the string. Well,
-- oh, no, that's a classic thing.

821
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,400
Just so that if anybody complains.

822
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,579
-- But no, no,
-- no, then I had to put in my V

823
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,760
key as well. It made me do both of those things. I was like, wow, that,

824
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:06,354
well, the typing thing is so nobody can accidentally delete the wrong thing.

825
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:07,104
And if they do,

826
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:09,293
-- go ahead and it
-- annoys me that I used to be

827
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:11,445
able to copy and paste that text and I can't anymore.

828
00:34:11,455 --> 00:34:15,804
And I deleted like a really long repo name and it was, I was grumpy by the time I was done

829
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:17,524
on tying.

830
00:34:18,114 --> 00:34:19,603
But here's the problem is

831
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,239
the cost of support calls for people who

832
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,379
want their repos back versus annoying everybody.

833
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,080
Absolutely.

834
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,780
Yeah. No, I, I get it 100%. I'm totally on board, but I'm still gonna complain.

835
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,149
Maybe there should be a switch for that.

836
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,260
Just like turn off, turn off all the safety settings.

837
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,500
No, I don't want that.

838
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:35,649
They don't want it either

839
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,248
because you know, someone's gonna turn it off and then they're gonna complain, man,

840
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:42,509
they they restored the, all the repos they accidentally deleted.

841
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,717
No, man, I get it. I get it. All right.

842
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,217
All right. I think we should call this one.

843
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:49,299
I only have one more note I guess is uh I switched my Mastodon

844
00:34:49,428 --> 00:34:49,839
account to

845
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:53,329
Infosec dot Exchange. So that makes me happy. So, thank you Jerry Bell.

846
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:56,289
That's it. All right. All right. This is fun.

847
00:34:56,498 --> 00:34:57,188
I missed you, man.

848
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,489
It's gonna be ok.

849
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:02,049
Just, it's stressful, but it's gonna be ok.

850
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:03,849
And, and I'm, I'm, I will say though,

851
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:07,408
the remastering work I've been doing on those episodes, I'm going to keep doing that

852
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:11,669
because I find it fascinating peering back in time

853
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,590
and getting

854
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,260
certain things we get really wrong and other things.

855
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,560
It's like, oh, my goodness, nothing has changed in five years.

856
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,800
I was about to say, I'm a little sad listening to some of those episodes. I'm like,

857
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,500
when did we record? Oh my God. It

858
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:25,669
five

859
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:25,969
years

860
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,350
ago.

861
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,560
Yeah. The, the, the two episodes I've done so

862
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,419
hitchhiker's got to do the Galaxy and left pad.

863
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,479
Those are both five years, more than five years.

864
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:36,040
And it's like there's a little more real in these than I like,

865
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,199
but I'm really hoping

866
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:40,379
pasy fixed passwords finally.

867
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:44,010
I don't, we'll see. We'll see. I don't know. Well,

868
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:47,199
-- that's another conversation,
-- I guess all I can say is it can't get much worse.

869
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,570
Don't never say that.

870
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,239
And I say that and it can, but

871
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,340
-- it
-- can always get worse.

872
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,399
All right, I'm ending it. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you everyone for listening.

873
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:56,860
