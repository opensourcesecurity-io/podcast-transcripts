0
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,289
Hang on a sec, hang on a sec.

1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,309
I'll just record your typing and I can,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,399
-- I can play that minutes of
-- typing information wants to be free is

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,359
an expression that means all people should be able to access information freely.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,469
-- Dude, we're going to talk about that hacker manifesto.
-- Exactly.

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,389
It's more complicated than that.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,670
-- All right. Anyway, all
-- right, I think everything is more complicated.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,260
It's December 24th.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,459
It is Christmas Eve for those of you who celebrate Christmas, those of you who don't,

9
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,430
you are so lucky.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,879
-- It is so much stress.
-- Enjoy opening your presents.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,500
That's true. I,

12
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:37,648
I do, I get coal every year anyway, December 24th information wants to be free.

13
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,508
I think it's more that it turns out information is really easy to copy

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,738
-- it.
-- Well, that's part of the freedom of it.

15
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,269
-- OK.
-- OK. Pretty much since Gutenberg.

16
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:52,569
-- So
-- this is an old saying and I will put a link in the show notes to the hacker manifesto,

17
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,060
which is very old and was a very, we'll say inspirational piece in my youth.

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,180
But fundamentally, this is one of my favorite things to talk about is

19
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:04,629
there's people love to say information wants to be freed.

20
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:06,540
It means lots and lots of things to different people.

21
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,839
But I think the single most important aspect of this

22
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:13,739
and this is something people don't always understand is once something is

23
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,349
public on the internet and this is even true in general,

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,660
but we're going to focus on the internet once something is public on the

25
00:01:18,935 --> 00:01:20,486
that you can never take it back.

26
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:23,365
It is impossible to put that genie back in the bottle,

27
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,486
the copy ability of things once they're in electronic

28
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:28,765
format and another computer can access it is.

29
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:32,486
Yes. Well, and man, once it's on the internet, who knows where it's been?

30
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:32,625
Well,

31
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:35,846
-- and Google's going to find it
-- eventually in the internet archive

32
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:39,996
and who knows how many other archiving applications and your,

33
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:43,515
your document search that you're using in your company.

34
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:44,246
And it's just,

35
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:47,512
it's fascinating to me when people talk about taking

36
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:49,101
something down off the internet because I think what,

37
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,241
there's like all these right to be forgotten laws and stuff.

38
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:52,431
And while I agree,

39
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:54,512
I don't like that people's entire life

40
00:01:54,522 --> 00:01:57,052
history is necessarily cataloged on the internet,

41
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:00,472
taking things off the internet doesn't make them go away.

42
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,802
It's interesting because I've, I've been through that,

43
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:05,781
remember with the DWF project and I had this thing where to

44
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:08,231
make a request. You, I needed to get

45
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:09,832
an agreement from the person saying,

46
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,699
you know, your information is going to be posted in this github

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,929
repo so I would send them an email, not just a click to reply,

48
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,919
but I need you to specifically say I, I think it was you had to specifically type out.

49
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:24,419
I agree. Like I had people send ok. And I'm like, no, you have to say, I agree.

50
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,729
Like I need to know that you actually read to the bottom of this

51
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,990
and typed. I agree.

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,860
And one guy, like 23 years later was like, oh my, my email address is in there.

53
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:32,169
I'm like,

54
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:32,970
yes

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,970
for the email you agree to.

56
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,070
And he's like, I want you to take it down. I'm like, no.

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,520
And anyways, he got Huffy and went to github

58
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,520
and lawyers and so I'd ended up taking it down.

59
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,929
Uh And what amused me is, well, it's still in the github

60
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:45,729
history.

61
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:49,210
And that's the biggest thing too, is not only does information want to be free,

62
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,039
but it turns out data structures that preserve the past

63
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,729
change logs or,

64
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:56,089
you know, change history and your

65
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:58,225
Google Docs or your word docs or, well,

66
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:01,656
basically all the major document formats now allow you to undo

67
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,606
and not just within a session but to open up a document and

68
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:07,576
just hit control Z 1000 times until you got a blank page.

69
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,145
That thing you erased.

70
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,985
My favorite is always redaction where people you know,

71
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:14,565
do the black highlight as a filter layer and

72
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:17,055
then somebody's just like takes off the filter layer

73
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:18,755
and, and actually in all

74
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,861
is I think the intelligence universe has gotten this one right?

75
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:26,302
Because if you take the filter layer off, they're like, well, we screwed up.

76
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:30,462
They, you know, they don't try to throw people in jail or create other problems.

77
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:32,861
This is why I always take a document,

78
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:37,501
redact it and make a screenshot of it to know that I couldn't have messed up,

79
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:40,591
print a copy and then scan it in at low dps.

80
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:41,742
-- Basically
-- what I'm doing

81
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:43,080
-- to put it bluntly
-- that

82
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,649
who did? Oh, that was the Mueller report in the United States. That's what they did.

83
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,869
They, they basically redacted it, printed, it, re scanned it at a,

84
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,009
at a horrendous quality and then published it.

85
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,250
The problem is there's so many things that can give away.

86
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,130
There was that PDF where they blacked it out properly,

87
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,789
but they left the index and so they were able to

88
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,949
remember, they said, OK, well, this word,

89
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,229
there's an index of words and we know this word is on page 117

90
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,619
and there's only like seven words blacked out and only one of them is about that long.

91
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,710
-- Right now.
-- We know that word

92
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,119
and,

93
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:18,450
and, and again, this is all part of that whole information wants to be free story.

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,309
And

95
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,339
my kind of

96
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,869
argument here

97
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:25,429
is that it is easier

98
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,510
to make things public on purpose

99
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:31,679
than trying to keep it hidden because someday,

100
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,899
no matter what it is it is going to

101
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,600
get out because information is constantly trying to escape.

102
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:42,760
If something is secret, I can blackmail you. If you post it on your website, I can't.

103
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:43,640
Right.

104
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,739
You know, and companies have learned this now stuff they used to hide,

105
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,720
they now post kind of quietly somewhere

106
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,359
and when somebody comes along and you know,

107
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:53,450
threatens them with whatever their response is,

108
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:54,645
go for it.

109
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,365
The other thing is when you go to the press and say

110
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,355
I have the secret information and the press goes to the company,

111
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,545
the company is like, yeah, that's posted on our website for years.

112
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:04,705
You, you even if it's eating babies, you'll lose that initial shock.

113
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:06,026
And that initial power

114
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,686
-- of the
-- disclosure as we end this conversation,

115
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:11,846
I want to clarify one important point is I do think there

116
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:16,165
should exist a certain level of personal privacy for people because obviously,

117
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:18,765
I don't want like my whole web browsing history going out in the

118
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:21,342
-- people trying to flee abuse of exes.
-- Exactly.

119
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:23,342
So this is definitely a delicate balance,

120
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,411
but I would say from like the corporate perspective,

121
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,881
make things open because it'll save you a lot of trouble.

122
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:29,671
Corporations are not people,

123
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,011
they're made up of people.

124
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:33,361
And so please don't yell at them on the phone because that's rude.

125
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:36,562
Fundamentally, corporations are an idea. They're not actual people.

126
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,332
I don't think the protections we give

127
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,511
people should necessarily be given to corporations.

128
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:43,812
-- Yep.
-- I agree. All right. I will see you tomorrow.
