Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself, Kurt Siefried

1
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,960
and my partner in disclosing stuff.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,960
I'm not sure what word to use, responsibly coordinative.

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,318
We

4
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,520
don't like the word responsible anymore,

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:18,920
but

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,319
disclosure

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,479
disclosure,

8
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:22,559
I like that actually.

9
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:23,440
Is it.

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,319
Are we functional? I'm skeptical.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,530
Uh This unit is functional,

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,719
says you

13
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:32,619
all right. So anyway,

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,319
we're going to discuss a very unique

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,490
disclosure topic

16
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:39,330
that

17
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,709
if you, if you've been listening to us for a while,

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,490
Kurt and I have discussed coordinate disclosure or, or pick a term,

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,229
we don't like responsible for some historical reasons we can discuss later.

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,340
-- But
-- it also defend, I mean, who's defining the word responsible in that case?

21
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:52,509
Right.

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,650
Microsoft is,

23
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,509
and, and anyone who doesn't do exactly what they want you to do is irresponsible.

24
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,490
And in fact, funny enough back in the day in their advisories,

25
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:06,809
they would discredit people for not acting responsibly,

26
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,819
which I thought I always thought that was hilarious.

27
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,720
-- I was always
-- sad. I

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,870
that was a big deal because when I worked for eyesight and eye defense, right?

29
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:15,330
We, you know, bought vulnerable like we were the first,

30
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,989
it was the first company to buy vulnerabilities and report them to vendors quickly.

31
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:19,760
And

32
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,889
Microsoft Tuesday would roll around and we wouldn't know

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,559
until it went public if they were fixing our issue or not, like,

34
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:28,000
even an hour beforehand, they wouldn't be able to tell us.

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,569
And there were times where they were like, oh, yeah.

36
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,489
Yeah, it's going to get fixed and then it, it didn't

37
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:33,339
that month or, you know,

38
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:35,870
or we totally didn't expect our issue to get fixed that quickly.

39
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,250
So

40
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,449
my understanding of it, it was Microsoft was kind of doing the best they could, but

41
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,260
they were papering over a lot of holes.

42
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,400
Well, I mean, I'm sure they still do.

43
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,889
We all there,

44
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:50,160
there's some, there's some demons

45
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,519
beneath the surface

46
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,279
no matter who you are anyway.

47
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:53,919
So

48
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:57,699
there is a story, I will put a link in the show notes where basically this,

49
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,660
this researcher and now the story.

50
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:01,849
-- No,
-- no, no, not a researcher, a company, a

51
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:02,760
company, whatever.

52
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:03,080
Well, no,

53
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,949
that's different because companies have lawyers and

54
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,260
money and stuff and most researchers don't.

55
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,758
That's a good point.

56
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,679
So

57
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:11,688
basically

58
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:16,559
this company and now the blog post is like no legitimate details in it.

59
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,468
So don't think like there's anything exciting in this.

60
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,628
But basically they talk about, they found a,

61
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:23,559
it sounds like they found like an open database

62
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,679
or something from a company that writes stalker Warre.

63
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,279
And

64
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,438
then the question becomes, what do we do with this?

65
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,399
It sounds like they alerted the company

66
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,740
and the company did nothing.

67
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:37,259
And now the question becomes, what do we do with this information we have?

68
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,460
Because obviously

69
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,940
the the situation sounds like it is a victim database.

70
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,720
And I use the word victim in the context

71
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,220
of you have the stalker installing the stalker wear on

72
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:52,315
the victim's device. And I don't want to get into the argument of whether

73
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:55,925
stalker wear is ok or bad or you're a parent with Children or whatever,

74
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:59,455
-- like
-- very simple thing because I'm actually in the position now of I will be

75
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:02,464
having to use a product like this for my one son who has autism,

76
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,985
so I can keep an eye on what he's doing and make sure he's safe online.

77
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,975
But there will be full disclosure, I will tell him he may not understand it fully.

78
00:03:09,164 --> 00:03:12,684
But there's also the legal aspect of, for example, I'm his legal guardian.

79
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:15,369
And there, there's a big difference, for example,

80
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,020
there between then the uh the situation say between two adults,

81
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,559
right?

82
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,139
When somebody has a child

83
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,369
and is that child's legal guardian?

84
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,410
For example, this is a whole different ball game.

85
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:29,539
So there are some pretty, I would say pretty legitimate cases for this. Now, do I?

86
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,779
And here's the difference though, do I want to use the software on his phone?

87
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,990
No, I don't, but I don't have an alternative

88
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,649
and that's fair. And I think that's the difference. I'm doing this as a last resort.

89
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,339
Not as

90
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:40,500
a,

91
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,880
you know, this is easier than parenting him.

92
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,410
OK? That's fair.

93
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:46,800
So,

94
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,770
but in this case, this is a piece of stalker wear that's like,

95
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,320
well, and that's the other thing is

96
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,580
the nso group.

97
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,690
I,

98
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:54,660
I was thinking about the other day and I

99
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,509
realized they're just the ultimate in stalker wear.

100
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,130
I mean, basically

101
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:02,559
right now, now it should also go that we don't know which Stalker Wear company.

102
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,639
This is, it sounds like they're a little seedy from the blog post. But like we, we have

103
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,399
-- one that isn't see d,
-- well, that's probably fair.

104
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,690
It's,

105
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:14,139
-- it's definitely one of those areas.
-- Well, the best quote here.

106
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:16,048
Stock War operates in a legal gray zone,

107
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,428
which I find funny because it doesn't have to. Right.

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,529
There's corporate software that monitors end points that, you know,

109
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,489
people are fully informed and it's disclosed and it's not a legal gray area.

110
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,559
It's actually completely legal to do that.

111
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:31,670
And so that's what I really dislike about the Stock war software is it's,

112
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,970
it's something that could be done properly, but they choose not to.

113
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, yeah, because their markets probably 10 times bigger.

114
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,489
Right. So, I, I wouldn't say it's a gray area. I would say it's probably illegal.

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:42,899
-- Yeah.
-- Yeah.

116
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,600
And, and there's actually I'll,

117
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:49,589
the eff has some really good info on stalker wear and everything going on.

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,260
There's a, they have a lawyer.

119
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,130
Her name is Eva Side on Twitter. I don't, I don't, I don't know what her real name is.

120
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:58,950
It's funny how I know so many people by their hacker names or Twitter handles and,

121
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,269
like, no other information.

122
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:00,790
But anyway,

123
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,720
I'll put a link to her in the show notes and she's

124
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,119
done a ton of amazing work around stalker Warre and getting it.

125
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:06,709
I mean,

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,760
just getting it classified as malware in many instances has been a huge challenge.

127
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,010
-- Yeah. the Avida texts. That's, that's a huge win for people.
-- Yeah. Yeah.

128
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,279
Yeah, absolutely.

129
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:18,880
And, and it's like you say, it's one of those situations if you know it exists

130
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,019
and your A V picks it up like, OK, great.

131
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,160
Like I understand this is here but if you don't know it exists and your A V picks it up,

132
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,369
it's like holy crap, what is going on, right?

133
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,890
Ok. So anyway, anyway,

134
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,609
there is a company,

135
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,869
they report this and now they just write a weird

136
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,640
blog post instead of doing any sort of actual disclosure.

137
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:37,869
So I would say from the concept

138
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,959
of responsible disclosure or even coordinate disclosure,

139
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,769
-- there has been none of that.
-- Well, there's been no disclosure,

140
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,239
disclosure in general. You can't call it anything disclosure

141
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,570
-- when there's no disclosure,
-- there's no disclosure.

142
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,553
So anyway, it brings up a really interesting point though that I, I think gives us,

143
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,013
well, actually I got to walk that statement back.

144
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,703
Sorry, because they did disclose it to the company and the company then ignored it.

145
00:05:58,713 --> 00:05:59,102
And

146
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:01,252
this, the reporter is like, well,

147
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:03,173
ok, and gave up basically.

148
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:08,023
-- And,
-- and that's part of the story is what, like what happens if you report something.

149
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:09,553
But we'll, we'll get to that topic.

150
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:12,822
I just, I, I want to put our stake in the ground and say, ok,

151
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:13,792
so

152
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:14,822
we're going to

153
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:17,915
talk about disclosing security vulnerabilities and there's a

154
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:19,765
couple different hypotheticals we can go with.

155
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:23,776
But let's kind of start with where the stalker we story begins

156
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:29,696
where you find an issue that is potentially dangerous. And this is where you've got,

157
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:30,656
you know, P I

158
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:33,835
I, well, let's actually, let's, let's define that a little bit because

159
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:36,455
so to be clear, I think there's sort of three groups here,

160
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:38,036
there's the stalker work company,

161
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
there's the stalker aware companies,

162
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,880
customers who are using the stalk aware to generally do bad things.

163
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:47,399
And then there's the stalker aware victims,

164
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:50,079
right? And these are three very different groups, obviously.

165
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,519
And I would say in this

166
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,600
and you can define harm against these three groups.

167
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:56,679
You know, for example, that the company has to spend money fixing a vulnerably.

168
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,760
Well, that's too bad.

169
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,829
Um

170
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,299
The customers of the company that are using the stalker, we can maybe are, you know,

171
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:07,649
going to be exposed or their victims will find out and remove the stalker wear again.

172
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,649
I would say that's,

173
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,369
that's a,

174
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,739
that's what we want, not a bad outcome.

175
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:15,380
Uh And then finally, there's the damage to the victims

176
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,899
of the stalker warre and,

177
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,670
and those are the people I care about in this scenario or any scenario.

178
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:20,220
Really?

179
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,660
And so for example, like you said,

180
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,420
it sounds like there might be a database of data being exposed

181
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,440
and

182
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,369
yeah, that would

183
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,959
suck for them to have all their private photos

184
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,549
and all their S MS discussions and everything leaked.

185
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,690
-- Well,
-- and we don't know. Right. It could be photos, it could be just names.

186
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,309
-- I mean, whatever it
-- doesn't matter.

187
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:37,640
P

188
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,019
I

189
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,940
has been most likely in most jurisdictions illegally obtained. Right.

190
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,029
-- So,
-- well, that's really interesting actually.

191
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,519
So not, not to go on a weird tangent but like from the perspective of GDPR,

192
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,239
if you're a stalker war company and you're holding someone's data

193
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,239
like that, that's a strange

194
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:57,019
claim, the business requirement to hold that data, right?

195
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:59,359
Like you can't, you can't go to the tax man and say, hey, you know,

196
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:00,429
delete all my records.

197
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:03,399
I mean, can they, I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a lawyer

198
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,070
but, well, no, no, there's a business need exemption, right?

199
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,589
-- So, like the tax authority has,
-- but this isn't a tax authority.

200
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,399
This is a company operating in a legally gray area.

201
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,290
So the problem then is you need to lodge

202
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:16,239
a GDPR complaint and go through that whole process.

203
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,190
-- That's probably
-- true.

204
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,980
And the other thing is I'm assuming this company is not based in Europe,

205
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,160
but I mean, it could be.

206
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,700
Well,

207
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,290
probably not anyway. Anyway. Ok.

208
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,070
So,

209
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,329
so, so let's, let's think about this.

210
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:29,989
Here's,

211
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:33,169
here's where I think it gets interesting is from the perspective of a company.

212
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,599
Right?

213
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,500
You are a company, you tell another company you have a security vulnerability,

214
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,789
the company ignores you.

215
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,359
Ok.

216
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:41,630
They know it's you.

217
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,869
-- So there's no, like, let's just,
-- let's call it the reporting company.

218
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,950
Ok. Yes. The reporting company. Exactly.

219
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,750
So, if you're the reporting company,

220
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:52,840
you can't like, post this to the full disclosure mailing list now because

221
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:53,469
there's,

222
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,330
well,

223
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,989
and they're going to make legal threats.

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,849
But what are they actually going to like apart from slander and libel,

225
00:08:58,859 --> 00:08:59,559
especially in, say,

226
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,979
a jurisdiction like the UK where it's really like

227
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,739
truth is not even a defense over there.

228
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,150
But as a company again, you know, companies have lawyers,

229
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,760
companies deal with this kind of stuff all the time.

230
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,289
I guess

231
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,489
the real problem though is,

232
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,250
is what's the incentive to actually disclose this publicly?

233
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,929
Well, I mean, that's probably part of it too.

234
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:15,880
Right? Because

235
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,039
you run the risk of the company suing you,

236
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,409
you have the potential of, ok,

237
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,169
I've just essentially told the world where to go to find

238
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,809
a bunch of victim pi I which is of course,

239
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,809
insanely dangerous for the victims.

240
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,450
And, and you look like the bad guy here,

241
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,510
you could potentially have an instance where

242
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,960
you, you talk about this and now

243
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,919
the world's, I'm skeptical the world's going to see you as some sort of hero here.

244
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,099
-- It's, I mean, this is a weird, weird disclosure problem.
-- Stupid question.

245
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:44,239
So, for example, there's,

246
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,460
there's certain classes of problem where to give a horrible example,

247
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:49,419
child pornography, you can counter child pornography.

248
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,080
There's well documented avenues to report it

249
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:53,669
and they will go deal with it.

250
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,880
Now in Europe with PI, I, there's GDPR and the, um,

251
00:09:58,369 --> 00:09:58,380
oh,

252
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:01,710
I forget what the data is it called a data authority or whatever it is in the country,

253
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,349
you know, the enforcement thing in the country.

254
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,200
And my thought is if assuming, well, for sure, there's gonna be,

255
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:12,270
there's 100% chance that at least one of those records is a European

256
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:14,130
person covered under GDP.

257
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:19,715
And so my one thought is you could go to the GDPR authority with this,

258
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,554
but is there some authority you can go to for data breaches?

259
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:25,465
Now, my understanding is that the FBI and stuff are starting, you know,

260
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:28,934
Biden has made noise about that and saying that this is actually OK, we get it.

261
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:29,934
It's a problem now

262
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:33,025
and that the US government is going to start dealing with this a bit more.

263
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:35,445
But I don't think there's any well sort

264
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:38,244
of documented and actually responsive place to go

265
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:41,015
saying, you know, I found a pile of pi I

266
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,760
like, can you law enforcement people go deal with this properly?

267
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,520
Right. And, and they mentioned that in the post, I, I think it was in the post.

268
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,239
I, I read this somewhere but basically, like,

269
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,099
if you bring this to someone like the FBI,

270
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,080
there's,

271
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:56,650
there's nothing they're going to do about it

272
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,030
because it's not technically a crime in many instances.

273
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,900
And, I mean,

274
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:05,049
that creates a whole another weird problem

275
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:07,820
from their perspective of reporting vulnerabilities.

276
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,289
Yeah.

277
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:13,030
I, it's tough because on the one hand I generally prefer disclosure, like,

278
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,250
let's document all the bugs, let it out in public.

279
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:16,770
On the flip side.

280
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,929
I, I really don't want to hurt the victims of the stalker wear

281
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:21,869
and, and I think that's just it.

282
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,429
So, like, historically, if we go back in time, let's say 2030 years of,

283
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,000
of vulnerability to sculptures, it was usually,

284
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,929
I found a bug in windows. I took Microsoft Microsoft laughed at me.

285
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,570
So now I'm sending my exploit to the full disclosure

286
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,039
mailing list or the bug track mailing list or whatever.

287
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,869
And then Microsoft gets embarrassed and they're like, oh ha ha.

288
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,830
We were just kidding.

289
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,695
Actually going to fix it after all. Wink. Wink.

290
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:46,505
And like,

291
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,054
that's completely different because that's

292
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:50,145
basically researcher versus Microsoft.

293
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:50,354
Right.

294
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:56,395
There's no, like, third party of pi I of some victims that's getting leaked here and

295
00:11:56,775 --> 00:12:01,255
that's what makes it so much different and so difficult to just wrap my head around.

296
00:12:01,265 --> 00:12:03,494
Well, I think part of the thing is there, there wasn't,

297
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:05,335
there was like,

298
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:06,960
there were no

299
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,830
ba barely any malicious software or services on this level.

300
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,070
No, no, no, there was, there was nothing

301
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,570
they were, they existed but they were like, they were unicorn rare.

302
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:22,669
-- I,
-- I can't think of anything historically. That was anything like the stalker wear.

303
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,080
I mean,

304
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,909
potentially some, like zero day brokers but even that's super questionable.

305
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:29,590
Yeah.

306
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,179
So, I mean,

307
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,219
I think that's part of the problem is

308
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,669
also the scale of these things typically nowadays,

309
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,500
you know, these stock,

310
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,880
our products and these pi I breaches are

311
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,409
thousands and tens of thousands and millions of people.

312
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,099
It's in the millions quite often.

313
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,809
I mean, there have been some that have been billions of records and

314
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:47,679
I

315
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,320
mean,

316
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,309
it's

317
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,450
ignoring that though, right?

318
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,690
Like, let's not talk about the breaches because I think that's another,

319
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,460
another topic.

320
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:58,729
I'm just thinking from the perspective of disclosure.

321
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:02,270
I feel like I feel like there's a couple of different levels where if

322
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,359
I'm just disclosing to a company and it's just a bug in their product,

323
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:10,489
I'm gonna have no remorse just going public because they're being jerks to me.

324
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,929
Right.

325
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,690
But if it's, if it's like pi I is available, I mean, like there,

326
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,609
there have been these instances, there's this,

327
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,989
this researcher that I

328
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,320
um goes by Bob, I think it's the,

329
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,289
I can't pronounce his last name, so I won't even try. Um,

330
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,580
I'll put a link to his Twitter account but he,

331
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,200
he does all this research where he looks for like

332
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,739
open databases on the internet and when he finds them,

333
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,869
he contacts the company and then he usually does a little write up because, like,

334
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,099
that's

335
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,539
shtick is a consulting company and

336
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:36,950
like, this guy is super awesome.

337
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,979
And I've talked to him before about some things and like, I, a great guy and like,

338
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:43,380
this is an instance where I don't think he's

339
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,400
found a situation where he's reported the problem

340
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,700
to a company and the company's been like,

341
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,659
screw you go away.

342
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,289
Right.

343
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,289
And like even, let's say he did, like,

344
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:56,080
I just, I can't, this is such a hard problem to talk about.

345
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:59,799
Like, what do you do? What do you do if the company tells you to go away?

346
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:03,359
Well, I, I was thinking so there's not a lot of authorities you can go to,

347
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:07,179
but there are organizations like the eff who have lawyers and again,

348
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,700
they can offer if nothing else,

349
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,229
they'd probably be able to give you some reasonable advice.

350
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,140
-- You
-- know what you just made me think of.

351
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,299
So there, there is something you could probably do,

352
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:17,679
but you're going to need lawyers.

353
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,099
There is a very high probability that this data that was found is hosted

354
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:24,114
in a cloud

355
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:27,034
and so you could go to the cloud provider

356
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:31,875
and potentially give them enough. We'll say documentation

357
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:36,315
that compels them to disable access, be it shut down the machines,

358
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:38,424
turn off the internet access, whatever

359
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,609
and that could potentially work because you're dealing with a potentially illegal

360
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:48,559
-- situation. Yeah.
-- But then they just go stand it up on some other instance.

361
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,500
It is very probable. Yes.

362
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,000
You know,

363
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,969
the NSO group apparently is using a combination of Amazon web services

364
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:58,250
and OVH and digital Lotion and essentially a list of hosting providers.

365
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,390
-- I mean.
-- Right. If,

366
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:05,789
well, ok, so, but the NSO is also special because they're like literally

367
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:08,190
the best of the best when it comes to this sort of thing.

368
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,020
I assume we're talking about a company that probably has crap architecture,

369
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,760
crap software and it's probably barely functional.

370
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,349
Yeah. If nothing else shutting down their access temporarily,

371
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,679
I, I think that the problem becomes this.

372
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,880
Here's a good question. What does remediating the situation look like?

373
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,210
Because the company has the strongest possible incentive to not be like, oh, oops,

374
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:34,239
we, we didn't mean to disclose that data.

375
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,760
We're going to do the right thing and get rid of it. No, of course, they're not.

376
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,440
Their whole business model is predicated on being jerks.

377
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,940
Well, no, no, I would say from the simplest level,

378
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:47,719
just turn off public access. Assuming we're dealing with like an open data set.

379
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,484
What about warning all the users or the victims of the stalker

380
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:51,934
-- Warre? It's,
-- it's stalker

381
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:54,005
Warre. Their victims don't even know you're part of it.

382
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:55,164
They're not going to warn them

383
00:15:55,395 --> 00:16:00,135
because I'm looking at this and assuming, let's say hypothetically speaking,

384
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:02,065
I'm doing a bunch of research into Stalk Warre and I run

385
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,325
across a stalk work company and I scan their network and I

386
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:07,715
find an open Mongo DB instance or whatever with a whole pile

387
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:11,114
of records with obviously stuff that's been snarled off people's phones.

388
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,094
Do I maybe send them an email?

389
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,255
And I'm saying I, you know, doing this anonymously,

390
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,994
obviously not as myself because I don't want to get sued.

391
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:17,900
But

392
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,460
would I would, would that be something that would be helpful or harmful?

393
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:24,159
This is not a territory I'm in a position

394
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:27,460
to talk about because I think when you're dealing with

395
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,700
abuse

396
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,479
and victims of abuse,

397
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:35,659
it's often not the things we think makes sense often don't.

398
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:37,890
And I'm not an expert in this space.

399
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,809
So I would by no means attempt to contact any

400
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,669
victims or do anything involving victims of this sort of

401
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,229
thing because I think virtually anything I would do would

402
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,130
probably put these people in danger is my suspicion.

403
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,609
Well, yeah, I mean, and that's, and that's what I come back to is.

404
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:55,809
So number one, what does remediation look like? And number two, how do we,

405
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,349
how do we do no harm?

406
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,780
Right. Let's not make things worse.

407
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,820
Well, I I would say from the perspective of disclosure and what,

408
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,618
what we're talking about here,

409
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,140
remediation is closing the data set off to the public, right?

410
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,180
Plain that that's the simplest lamest possible answer to this.

411
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,329
I think if you want to go levels deep,

412
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,180
that's where you need to start involving people,

413
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,540
like the eff and lawyers and someone who understands, like,

414
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,348
how to interact with this universe in a way that doesn't,

415
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,209
like, literally get people killed.

416
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:29,089
The thing I just keep coming back to is I really wish

417
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:31,020
the A V vendors would do a better job of this.

418
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,540
And also, and actually that's a cop up because most phones don't run A V

419
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,280
and I've looked at A V on phones and it's a disaster. Like it makes things worse.

420
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,329
Like, I love what Apple's doing with, you know, on my phone now.

421
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:43,630
I get that annoying orange dot When my camera's on,

422
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,550
you know, I have that,

423
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:52,119
that feedback of no, this is actually like you, my device is recording me now.

424
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,420
But, oh, I meant to do that because I'm on a Zoom call or whatever.

425
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,079
And I think that's part of the answer is to make things like stalker.

426
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,859
We really, really obvious.

427
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:01,520
I love, you know, they've added the hardware cut off

428
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,430
effectively for the microphones and stuff if you have

429
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,689
a case with a little magnet in it,

430
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:05,900
right?

431
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,939
For your new ipads.

432
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,180
So your ipad can't be passively recording you anymore,

433
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,160
which was possible in the past.

434
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:14,979
Um And I don't even want to think about the Android ecosystem.

435
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,800
Yeah, exactly.

436
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,319
Yeah.

437
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:17,579
I mean,

438
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,380
if the company says we're not going to do anything

439
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,880
about it and going public would likely make things worse,

440
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,599
I feel like eff or possibly some investigative reporter is the way to go.

441
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,040
Because apart from that, I just,

442
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,400
I think what,

443
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,319
you know, what I think, what we basically are both in

444
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,744
is we on the Dunning Kruger curve.

445
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:37,905
We actually know that we're at the far left of the curve and we know nothing.

446
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,685
And I think the trick now is,

447
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:42,214
is you've got to go find somebody who knows something about this.

448
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:44,395
So honestly, now that I say this out loud, I would,

449
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,125
I would Google for a journalist who reports on stalker wear.

450
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,099
I mean, that's probably fair.

451
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:50,750
I think,

452
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,760
I think you're hitting on an important point is the world of vulnerabilities and

453
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,520
disclosure is changing drastically from the world we know because back in the day,

454
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,479
it was basically just throwing Microsoft or

455
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:05,270
Adobe or someone under the bus oracle oracle

456
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:05,849
oracle

457
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:06,189
or

458
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,310
they were. So

459
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:09,479
let's pick on Sun because they're dead now.

460
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,790
-- You
-- know, I never had a lot of trouble with sun

461
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,689
time. I interacted with them. They were pretty good.

462
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,949
-- Some
-- of their timelines though in their advisor,

463
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,219
like the the researchers released advisors,

464
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,579
right?

465
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,400
I remember man, there'd be like six years

466
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,270
anyway. Anyway,

467
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:28,500
the point is all of this as a service I think

468
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,030
creates unique problems because it's not as simple as just saying,

469
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,949
oh, I'm going to full disclosure this because

470
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,790
you're potentially affecting

471
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,849
people who aren't the company you're disclosing against.

472
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,660
You might be destroying small companies.

473
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,099
I mean, it's very possible you could be,

474
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:48,520
you could be making someone a victim of identity theft by by saying, oh look,

475
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,660
look at this data set like here it is or whatever.

476
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,709
-- And like this is a super crazy, super hard problem.
-- Here's a thought,

477
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:58,020
for example, and I'm not advocating this because it's illegal.

478
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,540
But remember when there was that

479
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:00,880
Mongol

480
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,739
DB thing where

481
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,140
they would go around and I'm not talking about the encrypting the Mongol DB to force,

482
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,599
you know, uh for ransomware.

483
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:11,829
But there was a period where somebody was going around and it was either Mongo

484
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,689
D BS or mem

485
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,050
Cash D BS or something like that

486
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,219
and just

487
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,459
wiping it.

488
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:17,380
Yeah.

489
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:17,800
Yeah.

490
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,520
So I,

491
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,260
I set up an elastic search honey pot to look

492
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,040
for this because it was happening at one point.

493
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,510
It was called meow bot.

494
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:24,790
And,

495
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,800
and the really funny thing that happened

496
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,680
was

497
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:29,479
I had my bogus data

498
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,420
and

499
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,780
it got ransomed, which of course,

500
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,180
it was funny because I was recording everything people were doing on

501
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:39,750
this honey pot and the ransom words didn't actually download anything.

502
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:40,920
So it's a

503
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,219
lot of

504
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,089
work man. So it was not ransomed.

505
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:47,364
They just deleted everything and added a, a little text that said, oh,

506
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,515
we're ransoming you ha ha.

507
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,984
And then it, and in fact, I'm,

508
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,285
I, I tried to contact the ransomers.

509
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,775
I'm like, oh I sent you the Bitcoin and they're like, we don't have it.

510
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:57,625
And I it was a little bit of back and forth and they,

511
00:20:57,775 --> 00:20:58,415
it was,

512
00:20:58,535 --> 00:20:59,425
I got bored of it.

513
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:02,015
But anyway, anyway, they,

514
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,900
then it got meowed, then it got ransomed.

515
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,020
Then it would just kept going back and forth between the not ransomers and the meow

516
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,599
-- bot deleting everything and it was a bit
-- hilarious,

517
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:17,180
but there's an example of wood wiping the database because that would also have the,

518
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,859
the effect of forcing the company to then deal with

519
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,689
it because they need that thing to be operational.

520
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,020
And I would argue that

521
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:23,699
you that

522
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,329
the potential for harm is minimized

523
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,540
because

524
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:33,880
you know, that there's less of a potential for data disclosure.

525
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,959
And as far as the victims of the stock aware, you know,

526
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:40,400
essentially being punished for this company's

527
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,890
issue by the, you know, by the stalkers

528
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,619
II, I would think that that is minimized.

529
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:50,079
Well, but here's the problem you get is so I report it to the company,

530
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,359
then everything gets deleted, right?

531
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm probably getting sued

532
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,699
and I think that's the challenge and,

533
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,780
and this is really where it comes from is when you're dealing with a company that is

534
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,319
of shady origins.

535
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:04,459
We'll say the, the real, I think the real ethical question becomes,

536
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:06,040
if you contact them

537
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:06,939
at all,

538
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:11,280
you've now put a great deal of responsibility on yourself.

539
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,770
Because now you, now the next steps you take,

540
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:16,719
you have to be very careful because if you report something and

541
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,550
they tell you to sod off and then their database gets deleted.

542
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:21,609
They're probably gonna come after you. Right.

543
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:26,239
Or it ends up on with a reporter at a newspaper or, you know what I mean?

544
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,000
Like, you become the target at that point.

545
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,819
And this is why when I've noticed issues in my banking or stuff, I've just

546
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,900
ignored it.

547
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,560
Just Kurt pay no attention.

548
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:38,910
You know, my money's insured, try not to think about it because I don't want to,

549
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,449
I don't want to deal with my bank possibly getting grouchy at me.

550
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:44,890
Well, and look, there's like, so something to think about is like,

551
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,250
there's a book I'm reading right now.

552
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,260
It's by Nicole

553
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,270
Plot. Who is, she's, I think, I don't know if she's still at the New York Times.

554
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,229
She's at the New York Times doing cybersecurity reporting.

555
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,689
She wrote a book called, this is how they tell me the world ends.

556
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:56,810
And

557
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,890
there's, I, I'm at the point of they're talking about like the whole,

558
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,560
like underground Zero Day exploit market and stuff.

559
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,410
And there's one point where a guy literally tells someone, like, if you,

560
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,170
if you leak this, you're going to get gutted and by gutted.

561
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,530
I mean, like someone's going to literally come and murder you

562
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,250
and like, you have to think about that, like,

563
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,930
some of these companies you're dealing with,

564
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,469
they're of the sort that you might have some legitimate

565
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:23,199
safety concerns if you're on the bad side of them.

566
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:23,560
Right.

567
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:24,650
Well,

568
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,939
and I think this speaks to maybe going to the eff or a journalist first because the,

569
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,160
to put it bluntly,

570
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,079
journalists who write about this stuff probably have better

571
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:35,020
operational security than most militaries because they have to,

572
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,859
they need it

573
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:36,750
like kidding.

574
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,380
I, you know, I mean,

575
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,300
in the last five years how many news outlets now use

576
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,290
some form of secure dropbox to receive anonymous whistleblower submission?

577
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:45,939
Right.

578
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:47,390
And I mean, let's face it,

579
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,989
like murdering journalists usually is highly frowned

580
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,219
upon and gets you loads of trouble.

581
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:52,800
Depends on the,

582
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:56,165
because recently there's been a lot of that in certain countries.

583
00:23:56,494 --> 00:23:57,494
I know it's,

584
00:23:57,744 --> 00:23:59,535
but, but you get the point right is,

585
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,145
I mean,

586
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:04,295
I think this is where as we venture into this universe

587
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:08,035
of everything is a service and all this information being available.

588
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:09,694
I, I kind of agree with you that

589
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,694
in many situations, like now look, if I found an issue with Microsoft,

590
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:16,015
I would have no reservations contacting them.

591
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:21,415
Right. But if I found something with like a company of questionable background,

592
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:21,699
I,

593
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:25,000
I do think maybe the eff or reporter might be a best

594
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,250
first stop because then you have a bit of a buffer,

595
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,630
a cut

596
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,000
out cut.

597
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:30,800
And

598
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:31,780
also,

599
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,030
well, the eff is going to be and here's the other thing,

600
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,410
the eff and a journalist are probably going to be able to do

601
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,800
an actual risk assessment of who are we dealing with versus you.

602
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,650
Well, now, at the same time though, I guess, like, this isn't the eff's job.

603
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:45,329
You know what I mean?

604
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:50,239
Like the eff if they suddenly get inundated with people reporting, like, you know,

605
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,650
stalker we data leaks.

606
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,050
Well, and they can say no.

607
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:53,699
Right.

608
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,050
Just, you know, like when you report bugs upstream they can say no,

609
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,020
we're not dealing with this.

610
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,410
Yeah. Yeah.

611
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,359
But then you can just dump it on full disclosure or some public

612
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:03,954
mailing list or something and walk away like you can't do that here.

613
00:25:03,964 --> 00:25:04,494
Oh, no, no.

614
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:07,375
But what I'm saying is it's up to the eff whether they say yes or no,

615
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:09,354
you have to treat them as an adult essentially

616
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:11,135
and give them the choice right to say that.

617
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:12,694
Oh, they might get overwhelmed by this.

618
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:15,665
Yeah, they might, but they're also the eff they're professionals.

619
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:18,555
I mean, they are, this isn't exactly what they do,

620
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,714
you know you and I have been in the same situation where

621
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,114
somebody literally emailed me.

622
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:25,035
He's like, I want 100 cvs for these fuzz cases and you're going to have to like,

623
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:26,964
figure them out and assign the cvs properly.

624
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:28,155
And my response was no,

625
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,800
I need you to do a root cause analysis and show me the vulnerable code

626
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,459
and then they come back like three days later and it's like, oh,

627
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:37,300
-- it's just one doss and one function and
-- that's right.

628
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,469
OK.

629
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:39,869
Sorry. No. Right. And

630
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,949
it's, it's always one function.

631
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,310
There's literally, it's the, it's, I would say it's the effs job

632
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:48,709
to talk to people about weird problems and then

633
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,069
decide if they're going to help out or not.

634
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,469
That's kind of their stick.

635
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:51,989
-- I
-- don't,

636
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,829
I don't know, man.

637
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,469
I, I feel like we're putting,

638
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:56,994
we're putting a lot of responsibility on the eff here.

639
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,484
If you look at the eff and journalists, historically,

640
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:01,885
a lot of them like this new weird stuff because

641
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,545
this is where their industry and their life is headed.

642
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:06,505
Like, look at you and me what we're doing with security, right?

643
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:09,444
Where you and I have completely changed how we look at vulnerability,

644
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:10,324
identification

645
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:13,525
and management from say 10 or 20 years ago.

646
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:16,489
I mean, it, it's true, it's completely different and,

647
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
and I think disclosure is completely different now.

648
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,390
I, I really,

649
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,329
so it's funny we came into this and I thought we just have a bit of a chat about, oh,

650
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:26,089
this is how disclosure works and, and look, this is a weird one.

651
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:26,609
But like,

652
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,449
I do think the whole,

653
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:31,949
like, like the whole universe of disclosure is completely different and,

654
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,939
and I feel like this is a different problem.

655
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:37,060
-- I would not,
-- it's an ecosystem now of different things.

656
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,910
I mean, to a degree, I agree with that.

657
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,930
Like if I think of historical disclosure in software,

658
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:45,750
like let's say we're working with a product from a company or a project on github

659
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,709
or whatever,

660
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,709
I think the disclosure there even if you go public

661
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,430
is drastically different from the sort of disclosure of,

662
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,709
I found a data set full of stuff.

663
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:58,390
What do I do now? Like, those are really different problems.

664
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:01,089
Traditionally, the closest thing we had was like, oh,

665
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,589
I found billing data for a company

666
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,390
and that's easy. The company goes and closes it up.

667
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,189
There's no

668
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,800
victims, there's no

669
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,630
malicious stuff involved.

670
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:12,369
But what I mean is there's no, like,

671
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,349
it's just legitimately a company made a technical error

672
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:16,890
and had a problem.

673
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,430
These,

674
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:19,109
I think part of the problem with disclosure now

675
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,229
is these are no longer just technical errors.

676
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,050
There's ethics and morality involved,

677
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,609
I mean, yeah.

678
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,040
Yeah, I, I agree.

679
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,369
And there's nothing saying that a company,

680
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,449
you could report their billing data and they could just be like, go away nerd.

681
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:32,209
We don't care.

682
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:36,810
And I, I would not shock me if that happens where people report something to

683
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,969
somebody

684
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:42,619
and they either ignore them or they threaten them or

685
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:47,489
the Australian who discovered that the bank was just using sequential numbers

686
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:48,619
and

687
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:53,219
he went through a whole legal thing with the bank trying to basically

688
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:53,920
destroy it,

689
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:54,920
you know?

690
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,599
Right. Well, and that's just it. I mean, you could,

691
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,859
this feels so much like the early days of old disclosure where

692
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:03,800
you could report an issue to a company and they were like,

693
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,609
we're suing you.

694
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,390
I mean,

695
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,020
what, what, what would stop a company? You saying? I found all your billing data.

696
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,930
What would stop them from being like we're suing you? Right,

697
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,540
man, this is, this is so

698
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,319
hopefully the, the bank would have a slightly mature enough process to,

699
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,939
to know that that's not the way to handle this.

700
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,699
-- I mean,
-- a bank is slightly different than

701
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:24,680
some other company. You know what I mean?

702
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,650
There's a huge spectrum

703
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,569
we're dealing with.

704
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:27,880
Well,

705
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,329
it's interesting because I've been looking for

706
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:33,189
some information around bug bounties and disclosure policies

707
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,790
that both protect the company and the reporter.

708
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,250
You know,

709
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,510
remember years ago when a couple of big auto industry players came out

710
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,699
and said we will accept security reports and we promise to not sue

711
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:45,250
you. And we were like, oh, that's stupid.

712
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,449
Follow by, oh no, no, no, that's actually really good.

713
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,959
You needed that. Well, because they were suing people like,

714
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:54,885
and I think this will be part of that maturity process of

715
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:58,055
companies will have disclosure policies that not just

716
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:00,175
define how the researcher deals with the company,

717
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,655
but define how the company will deal with the researcher

718
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:07,555
and they may or may not hold to that agreement, but at least it's a good signal.

719
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:08,035
You know, if,

720
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:10,954
if a company explicitly says here are the circumstances

721
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:12,875
how you report to us and how we don't,

722
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,135
we won't sue you.

723
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:16,775
But, and maybe for example, they do list if you do this,

724
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:19,074
we will involve law enforcement fairly, right?

725
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,074
Like if you break into our systems and go,

726
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,329
you know, touch stuff that you're not supposed to touch.

727
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,609
Yeah, we're going to involve law enforcement, so, don't do that.

728
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:28,790
And now the expectations and the rules are understood,

729
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,989
I guess the one takeaway I think I'd give to anyone listening to.

730
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,910
This is, this is kind of where the bug bounty framework excels is by having,

731
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,790
if you're a company and you have a bug bounty, you are creating a skeleton.

732
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,530
I mean, you need more than just a bug bunny.

733
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,130
You actually need security people and you internal policies and stuff.

734
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,300
-- But like, I think that they have a
-- complaints box, you put the paper in the box.

735
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,300
Exactly. It's full.

736
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,030
-- No one can fit anymore in it
-- and it, well, no,

737
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,939
it feeds the incinerator to warm the building.

738
00:29:55,949 --> 00:29:56,819
Oh, there you go.

739
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,569
But you, you get the idea, like when you have a bug bounty,

740
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:02,449
I feel like you at least have a skeletal framework

741
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,089
that sets you up to

742
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:08,199
make improvements in this space. You have to care. Obviously,

743
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,449
it's like the C I CD pipeline thing.

744
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,530
You, you can't do this without that infrastructure, right?

745
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,410
Any improvements you make will be ad hoc.

746
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:19,400
You need to actually formalize it and put it in a framework and document it and

747
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,229
-- well,
-- and that's where like this is a place if you're like,

748
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:26,069
I'll use hacker one because I work with them is

749
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:30,400
they do this all the time. So you can say, like, please give me advice.

750
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,109
What do we do in this situation?

751
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:35,729
And they generally have seen it because goodness knows you're not the first.

752
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:40,310
And so they can help guide you through some things. And like an easy example is

753
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,209
you could have infrastructure where you say like,

754
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:45,359
please do not denial of service us, right?

755
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:46,959
We don't, that's, that's out of scope

756
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,119
and you can have other infrastructure that it's like, yes,

757
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,079
we know this thing over here sucks

758
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,369
where we know like just please don't tell us about it, you know, so it,

759
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:00,040
it kind of creates some opportunities in that regard and

760
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,000
I mean,

761
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,199
I don't see dodgy companies ever wanting to do that,

762
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:08,160
but I guess it's the sort of thing that if you don't have this framework,

763
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,849
you don't have a bug.

764
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,839
B you don't have a disclosure policy listed

765
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:14,189
that is a signal to the people doing the research that

766
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:17,719
you are going to be a dangerous entity to interact with.

767
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:21,500
-- And so then they can look at alternative routes instead of trying to contact
-- you.

768
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,319
Yeah, talking about signaling, I think that's very important and

769
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,560
I would say by definition somebody making stock war is probably a software pariah.

770
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:30,130
Yeah. And

771
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:30,569
you know,

772
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:33,119
unless their stalker aware is a very explicitly

773
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,140
like warns the person that's being installed,

774
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,189
like some of the child control stuff actually pops up warning screens so that,

775
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:38,550
you know,

776
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,609
like every login you are being monitored blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right.

777
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,130
Which it totally should do.

778
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:44,560
Yeah.

779
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:45,989
But in this case, obviously that's, you know,

780
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,500
this sounds like proper stalker aware.

781
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,349
So that's not the case.

782
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:52,359
And I think you're right, it's, it's, and again, going back to those signals and

783
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:56,175
I'm still wondering though, again, what does remediation look like?

784
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:58,025
I mean, it's, it's good to get the victims

785
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:00,175
information off of the internet.

786
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,015
But I feel like in a way that's almost helping the company.

787
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:07,685
-- I mean,
-- well, it is obviously, I mean, this is such a weird one

788
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:12,364
and in a way you're helping the victims avoid some harm, potentially,

789
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:16,055
I guess maybe that's, you know, I think that's my concern is, is you have the definite

790
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:19,814
helping the company offset by the potential for offsetting harm.

791
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,630
And is that potential for offsetting harm with these stock

792
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,359
were victims enough to warrant being nice to the company?

793
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:30,199
I would say maybe because as you said, these, these, these victims are, you know,

794
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:33,270
not having the, the easiest of lives and days.

795
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,319
Well, here's, here's how I think we should end. This.

796
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:40,199
One is as happens more often than not.

797
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:45,770
I have more questions after discussing this for half an hour than I did coming in.

798
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,719
But I think that's good because obviously having

799
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:51,319
questions is how any knowledge journey begins.

800
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,270
And

801
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,319
I think

802
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,670
we have to start thinking about disclosure of this

803
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,550
sort of problem in a new way because trying

804
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,130
to apply the old rules of disclosure just doesn't

805
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,729
work because this is a completely different problem.

806
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,800
And so I think framing this as a disclosure

807
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,390
discussion is probably incorrect in the old way.

808
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:13,790
So we almost need like a new way to talk

809
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,510
about this and we don't even have the vocabulary today.

810
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,510
So in summary,

811
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,229
I have no idea.

812
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:23,359
However, I will say if you are a company, please, please, please,

813
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:27,709
please please have a disclosure policy and have a bug bounty program.

814
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,349
It is hugely important

815
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,180
that

816
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,060
you get on this train and you start setting this stuff up.

817
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:33,819
I'm just,

818
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:36,089
I'm going to actually disagree with the have a bug bounty

819
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,300
program because a lot of companies can't afford that or it's,

820
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,060
it's too much having a place to

821
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:42,780
report the vulnerabilities that is actually monitored.

822
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,569
Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.

823
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:46,939
When I'm not going to argue with you there, absolutely.

824
00:33:46,949 --> 00:33:48,359
Disclosure is more important than

825
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,219
Bag Bni they are related, but one does not replace the other necessarily.

826
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:55,819
I think part of it is, I would say for commercial products that you sell,

827
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:57,660
you should probably pay for a bug bounty.

828
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,410
That's like you have coffee and toilet paper in the office.

829
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,579
That's just the thing you need to do.

830
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:03,469
But for example, nonprofits,

831
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:05,510
nonprofits shouldn't have to spend money on a bug bounty

832
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,719
so that people can report vulnerabilities on their website.

833
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:09,889
They don't always have to though, I mean, you can,

834
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,668
you can utilize like the hacker one platform as

835
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,949
a nonprofit for free or very little money,

836
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:16,208
right?

837
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,208
But you get what I'm saying, right?

838
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,978
Like, or some, you know, some small and medium business that has a website, you know.

839
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:25,149
Right. Well, I mean, that's a whole another story, but ok, I'm calling this one. It's

840
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:25,708
on.
