Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:10,430
Kurt Siegfried and my partner and apparently

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,369
having the same youtube suggestion list.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,289
Josh Pressers.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,829
-- Do you mean because of the youtube link I put in there
-- and I was like, oh, and I'm like,

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,489
what is this?

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,649
And I click and I'm like, oh, yeah, I saw that yesterday.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,450
So I, I have to talk about this because

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,399
I enjoy sharing

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,290
amazing videos I find in a good podcast and things like that.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,989
So there's a video on youtube by

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,189
the channel is called Tech Tangents

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,439
and what this guy did.

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,209
I'm, I'm not even going to try to get all the, the model numbers, right and stuff.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,310
-- So don't worry about that.
-- But no, we have to do it.

15
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:44,150
It's the Phillips CM 100 CD rom drive, whatever. Why is it special?

16
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:47,250
-- Well, it's the first CD rom drive ever bam,
-- right?

17
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:51,020
-- Like when he said that I'm like, what I checked and I'm like, oh, it is,
-- right.

18
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:55,540
And this is one of those youtube channels where they like work on and review

19
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:57,610
vintage computer equipment.

20
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:00,909
-- And I love
-- watching these, I think antique might be the word to use at this point.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,370
Uh Maybe, I mean, sure. And like, I love watching repair videos.

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,050
Like, I love watching people, like Ben Heck,

23
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:08,940
and there's like the eight bit guy and Adrian's digital basement and there's like

24
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:12,309
this whole universe of people who work on and show off this old stuff.

25
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,589
And

26
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,120
the best part is I don't want to actually own any of

27
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,370
this because it's a lot of work to actually keep it alive.

28
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,849
And so I get to, well, it's not very useful either. Well, that too. Right.

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,959
I'd use it for five minutes and be like, well, this sucks.

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,760
And then I just have a pile of garbage in my basement.

31
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:26,330
And in fact,

32
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:28,089
I watched a panel with a bunch of these people

33
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,650
the other day at like a vintage computer conference.

34
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,360
It was on youtube

35
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,410
and they were basically talking about how they store stuff and they're all like, oh,

36
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:38,489
yeah, I have this, like, huge storage unit and I have a full of old stuff and I'm like,

37
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,779
I mean, that's really cool, but at the same time, like, what a waste anyway.

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,120
Ok.

39
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:42,900
So this video,

40
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,940
this person buys the first CD rom drive ever

41
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:48,419
made and unbeknownst to him when he bought it.

42
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,769
And I guess really it's not something you'd think about.

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,879
It doesn't plug into like ID E or anything. Right. It had a special port

44
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:59,150
-- for plugging it into a computer. Obviously it's
-- got, yeah. What was it?

45
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:02,599
-- Something, I forget that.
-- I don't know, it doesn't matter, watch a video,

46
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:02,949
a

47
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:03,410
video.

48
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,800
And so it's got this weird port and you need a special card because it's not like,

49
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:10,869
again, it's not a normal disc controller because why would it be?

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,149
It's the first CD ROM drive you've ever made.

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,800
And so this person is trying to find the card, he needs

52
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,789
to make the CD ROM drive work.

53
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:19,699
And they like,

54
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,029
don't exist obviously because we're probably like seven made or something,

55
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,509
you know, and they're all in a dumpster now

56
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:29,279
and he comes across another youtube channel where someone had

57
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,960
the same CD ROM drive and a card to make it work.

58
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,119
And this person showed it off, but the video was from like what five or six years ago,

59
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,380
right?

60
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,649
So this is in youtube days, that's

61
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,919
what like 700 normal person years.

62
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:45,059
-- So he emails the person and basically says,
-- no, no, he left a comment,

63
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,029
a comment.

64
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,820
What? Oh, whatever qui

65
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,794
this, right? And he's just like, it's a long shot, I'm going to leave a comment.

66
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,115
-- So
-- he leaves a comment on youtube basically saying like, you know,

67
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,264
can we talk about this?

68
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,925
And the person eventually takes a picture of the

69
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:01,195
front and back of the card and sends this guy

70
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:05,554
just a picture and all of the parts on the card are off the shelf stuff, right?

71
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,794
So this is like you can literally buy these chips.

72
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:09,675
Well, except for the ones that aren't labeled,

73
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,940
but they were able to make educated guesses on those.

74
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,979
No, those were just capacitors. Those are just,

75
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,399
-- that's easy. Capacitors are easy. The I CS are the hard part.
-- Yeah.

76
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,649
Well,

77
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,460
and the other thing too to remember is like these aren't multi layer circuit boards.

78
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,440
These are straight up, like the circuit board has a layer with, well,

79
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:27,020
they printed on both sides, right?

80
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,039
If, if it had an internal layer, there's no way they could have done what they did

81
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,919
-- unquestionably.
-- This is straight up.

82
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,880
Like if you take a picture of the front and the back,

83
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,289
that's all the traces except for the ones,

84
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:41,326
-- in fact, that are apparently covered by chips.
-- Oops, that's normal, that's normal.

85
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:43,145
But they could make educated guesses.

86
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,966
And the person who sent the pictures was kind enough to

87
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:48,966
do some continuity testing between traces to make sure that they,

88
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:52,005
the pins were in fact correct, which they were in any way.

89
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:56,705
So this guy creates a circuit board like in, in, I forget which tool he used.

90
00:03:56,716 --> 00:04:00,925
But you know, like one of the the circuit layout programs and then he gets them made

91
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:03,156
and then he puts the chips in

92
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:04,792
and he plugs it in and eventually,

93
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:07,671
and there was like some twisting and winding and it doesn't work.

94
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:10,882
Of course, well, not at first, but that was a driver issue funnily enough.

95
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:13,692
It wasn't because the hardware is bad and it literally works.

96
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:18,141
This guy cloned a freaking isa card from

97
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:20,772
like what it was the eighties or nineties.

98
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:22,671
The story is just

99
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:28,772
unbelievable and it made me smile and I was just, it felt so cool watching this girl.

100
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:30,832
And I remember starting it out and thinking

101
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:35,440
there's no way someone would make this video if it didn't succeed at the end.

102
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,089
I was hoping because if, if it would have ended with a, like, oh, it doesn't work.

103
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,470
I would have been, like, so mad.

104
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:41,970
But

105
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,670
it was, it just, it's so cool and it's so amazing.

106
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:47,429
And the thing that really stuck with me and

107
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,730
it's vaguely related to the topic of the day,

108
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,070
30 years ago, cloning a card.

109
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,970
Like this would have been out of the question. There's, it's just not practical.

110
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:59,260
No, it would have been like a state level attack.

111
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:00,179
Right. Straight up.

112
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,850
Like, what, like when the Russians were trying to clone American computers, like,

113
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,359
I watched a youtube video about that as well just the other day

114
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,160
and like,

115
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,239
like straight up this would have been the kind of

116
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,589
attack where basically the Russians could do it well.

117
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,299
And the Americans,

118
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:16,579
-- but the Americans didn't have to do it because they had Silicon Valley
-- and now some

119
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,320
random guy on youtube

120
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,720
totally did it. It's amazing. I love it.

121
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,119
Well, and my favorite thing is, you know, what,

122
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,760
what really helped him out was he used, uh, KDE the window manager to make

123
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,720
the picture of the circuit board, sort of opaque

124
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:31,480
overlay on his tool.

125
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:35,589
So he could like literally draw the trace, like he literally was tracing traces,

126
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:36,529
having to

127
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,809
resize it constantly everything.

128
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,230
And I'm thinking like, man, that would be,

129
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,089
that would be an awesome plug in for that tool where you could like

130
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,589
staple a photo essentially to what you're working on.

131
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,390
It's not an awesome plug in how many people actually do this?

132
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,920
-- Very few people,
-- I bet.

133
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:51,470
No, but the people that do it are probably very passionate about it.

134
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,489
Oh, no doubt. And they all probably run KDE. So it's fine.

135
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,779
Yeah, this is one of those like,

136
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,489
just obscure features that I suspect the tool will

137
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,059
get because it also is kind of cool.

138
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,019
Yeah. Ok. So let's

139
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,959
as much as I could spend the next hour talking about this.

140
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,799
We won't, but this ties it nicely to the topic we want to talk about,

141
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:11,470
which is some of the, I guess

142
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,269
-- anti obscurity tools, I would say where
-- it's not so much anti obscurity.

143
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,730
It's just that there's a lot of security that works quite well

144
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:24,260
-- until it doesn't work well. And then it feels terribly and
-- hold on.

145
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:25,980
We got to explain this better. You're, you're

146
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,000
no one knows what you're thinking.

147
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,950
I, I sadly do, but

148
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,559
there aren't no, no potholes. Holy crap.

149
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,309
Kurt, for anyone who doesn't know Kurt has been banned by me.

150
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
For talking about potholes and he still does it.

151
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,739
And I cut those stories out of the show and I tell

152
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,640
him this while he's telling the story and he'll still say,

153
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,480
oh, let me finish it.

154
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:49,959
I'm like, no. Anyway. Ok. So there are tools like, for example, the flipper zero

155
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,890
and there's now a tool to take pictures of like the inside of life.

156
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,299
There's like software defined radio.

157
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,700
Well, the,

158
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,079
but the difference is that has always existed as a

159
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:01,529
technology but it's never been like an off the shelf.

160
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,209
That's

161
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:02,769
right.

162
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:04,380
And that's a big difference. Right.

163
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,929
-- And,
-- and so hang on, hang on.

164
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,540
And so what's happening now is these tools exist

165
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,399
and they're in many instances being used to,

166
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,850
we'll say circumvent traditional existing security,

167
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:17,059
like where you can obviously just take some pictures of a

168
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,420
lock and cut a key and the key works in the lock

169
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:20,760
and it's easy.

170
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:24,119
Yeah. Right. That's just it, it's for normal people. Exactly. And it's affordable.

171
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,160
It's like you're talking hundreds of dollars. Right. Not thousands.

172
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,480
-- Well,
-- a great example of this technology, Josh,

173
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:33,440
go make a fire out in the woods with no tools, go find some rocks, bash them together.

174
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:36,640
You know what I mean? But versus here's a bit lighter. Right?

175
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:37,570
Like that's,

176
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,230
that's,

177
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:41,359
yeah, like I'm sorry, but I can't make a fire in the woods without tools.

178
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:41,690
I need a,

179
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,989
I need a lighter and probably some lighter fuel and some like dry kindling from home.

180
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,170
But that's the point. Right?

181
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:48,019
Is

182
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:49,559
decoding a lock.

183
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,059
Sure. You just feel it out like the lock picking lawyer.

184
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,739
But that level of skill is really high.

185
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,750
And now there's those, like, it's a little USB camera with a little mirror and it on,

186
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,209
on certain kinds of locks, like cheaper locks and by cheaper,

187
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,000
-- I don't mean like cheap, cheap, I mean, like,
-- like the,

188
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:05,029
-- the stuff we have at our
-- house, you basically just push it in,

189
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,890
it looks at the pins where they're resting and then you can read off the

190
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,269
bidding like the the depth of each key cut and then just cut a key.

191
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,149
I actually ordered a pair of key cutter,

192
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,399
pliers and um the mechanical Lishi block decoder tool.

193
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:16,589
Oh

194
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,940
but uh yeah, so the thing is, well, like the flipper zero is a great example of it.

195
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,100
It's a little, basically, it's a little computer with radio software,

196
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,440
defined radio capabilities

197
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:26,720
and more importantly,

198
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,959
a nice little interface and you can just load arbitrary software on it.

199
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,229
So people have written, you know, like, well,

200
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,320
a simplistic example would be like Hyundai

201
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,830
and um a couple of manufacturers apparently implemented

202
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,510
rolling codes so badly that like they use the same code or it's so predictable,

203
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:41,950
whatever.

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,219
And like if you load this on the flipper zero, you could just record it, replay it,

205
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:45,799
boom, done.

206
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,340
That's right. Like there's no,

207
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,679
there's no skill anymore needed. It's like making a fire.

208
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,280
If I give you five gallons of gasoline in a bit lighter,

209
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:55,460
-- like you're gonna be able to set something on fire
-- there.

210
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,520
I mean, there are still instances. So I actually have a really good example of this.

211
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,030
I have another podcast called Hacker History where I just have people tell

212
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,159
me old stories and I just talked to a guy who goes by hash

213
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,380
and hash does hardware hacking of smart meters specifically as a youtube channel.

214
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,539
I'll put a link in the show notes.

215
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,010
He was telling a story and this a little bit of the story made it on the show.

216
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,880
But he told me uh uh quite a bit more once we hit stop.

217
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,229
And so when the smart meters were created,

218
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:24,429
they use like a rolling code for the the frequency they listen to.

219
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,919
So obviously, if you want to send the smart meter information,

220
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,940
there's like a pres shared key

221
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,130
and the sender will like jump between frequencies at a

222
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,239
set interval and then the meter obviously knows that frequency

223
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:40,369
jumping as well. And so it'll, it'll hop back and forth, right?

224
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,099
And that's one of that's basically their security mechanism,

225
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,000
right?

226
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:47,080
What this guy did is he was hacking on a smart meter and

227
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,979
he has like an SDR that's like 3 305 $100 something like that.

228
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,460
I think it, it's probably the hack RF is my suspicion.

229
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:57,335
And I think, I think this, this meter had like 200 possible frequencies.

230
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,364
And so his solution to get his data into it

231
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,174
was to just transmit on every single frequency at the same time.

232
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,825
And so as the meter was jumping around, it was still receiving.

233
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,205
And the thing is

234
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:13,755
when this meter was created like 15 years ago, 20 years ago,

235
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:17,664
this was a perfectly reasonable security mechanism.

236
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:20,335
Nobody's going to buy 200 radios and transmit

237
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:21,750
in sync.

238
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,549
That's right.

239
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,729
That would be like literally hundreds of thousands

240
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:28,489
-- of dollars
-- transmitting 200 radio signals in sync.

241
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:31,989
Right. Exactly. It probably couldn't have been done

242
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,469
without, again, like a, a nation state doing the work.

243
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:38,630
But now for $300 you can totally do this.

244
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,140
And like this is another one of those examples where

245
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:44,890
we had this security in the past

246
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,289
that was sufficient,

247
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,340
but it's not sufficient anymore.

248
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,840
You think IOT stuff sticks around for a long time,

249
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,809
like stuff in the power system and infrastructure,

250
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,020
like that's not gonna get replaced for 50 years.

251
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:57,719
Well, so he said,

252
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,059
hash told me, I,

253
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,099
I love, that's the one thing I love about hacker history. I learned so much.

254
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,049
But he said the, the life of a smart meter is 15 years.

255
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:05,520
So

256
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:05,900
basically

257
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:06,780
short,

258
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:13,424
maybe, I mean, 15 years is pretty solid, I think for any, any piece of equipment,

259
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:14,875
I would guess 20 or 30

260
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:20,155
maybe. But whatever, 15 years. But you think what was 15 years ago? We're in 2022.

261
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:23,434
So 15 years ago was the dark ages of computing,

262
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:27,864
I think by definition, 15 years ago is always going to be the dark ages of computing,

263
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,195
I mean.

264
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:29,784
Right. Absolutely.

265
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:32,695
And now, obviously in the, in the world of power,

266
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:35,784
you have equipment that is 100 years old in some cases.

267
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,570
What was that, that fire in California that they, they think was caused by that line

268
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,840
falling off the tower because the, the,

269
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,390
the piece of chain rubbed through

270
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,150
and it's so old, they don't have records for it.

271
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,669
Like they think it's from the early 19 hundreds.

272
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,429
Yeah, exactly. Like, that's very normal

273
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:56,270
in that world. So, 15 years for them is zero years, basically.

274
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:59,229
Well, and that's why I'm so shocked that, like, although I guess in fairness it's,

275
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,849
it's, well, you would know that this thing is going to be, like,

276
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:05,090
e waste garbage in five or 10 years and you're gonna want some new capability.

277
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,229
So, you might as well,

278
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,030
like, I'm kind of the same way with laptops now.

279
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,179
Like,

280
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,669
I would never keep a laptop more than about 56 years

281
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,669
because it's just so slow time to get a new one.

282
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,549
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Well, and they fall apart now, like, they're built like crap.

283
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,359
I mean, I've got one here, the one I'm using now is like, what, two years old, I think.

284
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,710
And it's, it's definitely showing its age

285
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,059
but whatever, it doesn't matter.

286
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,940
Anyway, the point is when we're talking about security,

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,190
the technology moves ahead and, but what's, again,

288
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,450
what's really fascinating to me is

289
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,059
like, you can't Rekey

290
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:37,549
a large building without spending millions of dollars. You can't,

291
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:38,460
you know, like,

292
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:40,590
typically what you would end up doing is just installing a badge

293
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:44,289
reader system and like ripping out everything and a whole new technology.

294
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:49,070
No, no one cares is part of the problem and, and maybe the right not to, to some degree.

295
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,570
I mean, like, so keys are a good example.

296
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,330
How long have bump keys been easily available on the internet? 10 years.

297
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,090
-- They still require technique though a little
-- bit.

298
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:58,890
-- It's not like picking a
-- lock,

299
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,130
but it's not like just pressing a button on a flipper zero and the thing opens.

300
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,130
-- No,
-- absolutely.

301
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:03,343
I mean,

302
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:05,424
bump keys need a little bit but you get the idea

303
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:09,664
while it is easy to break a lot of the security.

304
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:12,924
Now it's still, I don't think common enough that anyone cares.

305
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:13,184
Well,

306
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,434
I know locally the big thing is you just jam a screwdriver in

307
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:17,924
the lock and turn hard enough and try to shear the pins off.

308
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:20,083
That works too because I,

309
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:23,223
I've had to now iii I know two people where I've

310
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:25,133
had to replace the lock to help them because that,

311
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:26,323
that's what happened to their lock.

312
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,223
Like somebody tried to jam it with a screwdriver.

313
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:30,703
I mean, it's a low tech attack but it works if you have a cheap enough lock,

314
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,247
it doesn't matter how good the lock is,

315
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:35,018
like an attacker that has a little bit

316
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:37,638
of determination can totally get through that lock.

317
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:41,458
Here's where I was thinking this is an interesting topic when we

318
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:44,107
look at kind of a lot of the world of security,

319
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,797
we harp about many things being too old.

320
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,768
I mean, you and I were just talking before I hit record about like the C language.

321
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:54,507
Why are we still using C? Right? Well, because it's, it's legacy and it will exist for

322
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:55,578
-- some cost
-- fallacy.

323
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:59,127
But in some cases when you have trillions of dollars of people,

324
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,627
years of effort in something.

325
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:02,932
Yeah. Don't just throw it away and replace it,

326
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:03,432
right?

327
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,361
I mean, look the Linux kernel just got rust right,

328
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:11,382
like literally days ago and it's I'm certain they will migrate many,

329
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,372
many things to rust.

330
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:15,052
But you're talking about measuring that in probably decades,

331
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,401
like C is not going away anytime soon, you know what I mean?

332
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:22,312
And I think it's similar with, we look at like the capabilities of smart meters,

333
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,012
we look at like what the flipper zero can do.

334
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:26,851
We look at these new ways to pick locks and make keys.

335
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,572
Smart meters are an interesting thing because there actually is an

336
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,866
incentive to replace them with newer technology that allows

337
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,625
them to have a more smart power grid.

338
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:36,015
And for example, cut your electricity

339
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:39,515
usage when there's like the possibility of a blackout, you know,

340
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,825
like all those people in Texas that signed up for that thing where

341
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:42,356
I'll get,

342
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:42,866
what is it?

343
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,466
Basically you'd get cheaper electricity if you let them kind

344
00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:47,666
of cut you off when demand was really high,

345
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:50,026
they couldn't adjust their thermostats.

346
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,185
Right. Sorry. Yeah, they, yes, they got free smart thermostats

347
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:56,515
and in return for it they had to live, you know,

348
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:58,426
they had to be a bit sweaty when it got hot out.

349
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,190
And of course,

350
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,890
they all lost their mind when this actually happened because none of

351
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,809
them had actually read or understood what they were signing up for.

352
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,859
And, and so there is an incentive for this stuff,

353
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:10,030
especially with the power grid because even locally,

354
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,750
like our power grid, we've had,

355
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,950
I think three emergency alerts in the last two or three weeks where it's just

356
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,500
like something was offline,

357
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,700
something else was down for maintenance as planned.

358
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,809
But then also it got like stupid hot

359
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,739
in like September and,

360
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:27,059
you know, the power grid is kind of like uh whoops,

361
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:27,849
you know,

362
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:30,520
we're getting there, it was like stage two alert. So,

363
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,219
I mean, and that's the thing, right?

364
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:35,760
So with smart meters there is that there is a good incentive

365
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,150
to replace it with newer technology that probably will be more secure,

366
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:42,080
at least, hopefully, especially if it's now controlling what I can do.

367
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,320
So here's, I think that the point you hit on

368
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,840
much sooner than I was hoping to, but that's fine.

369
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:51,710
Security alone, I don't think is an incentive for any of this stuff. Right.

370
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:54,820
There needs to be some other reason, like replacing smart meters,

371
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,820
like, straight up unless you're a bank and it's money, who cares? Right.

372
00:15:57,953 --> 00:15:58,333
Right.

373
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:01,122
And, and so I think when you look at, like, locks on houses,

374
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,812
even though they're trivial to generally get around,

375
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:06,692
I don't think you're going to see a major push to replacing

376
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:10,682
them because we have a technology that works basically for most people.

377
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:14,453
And it's not like you're seeing mass break ins or anything like that.

378
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:16,942
Well, actually we are seeing more break ins locally.

379
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:19,632
But one thing too is that it's not a

380
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:23,773
technology that's easy to really replace and improve significantly

381
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,015
because I also have windows.

382
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:25,806
But what I see,

383
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:27,846
for example is myself and everybody I know

384
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,825
is getting like ring doorbells and cameras,

385
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:32,776
you know, so that we can call the cops when somebody comes in or breaks in or whatever.

386
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,745
And that's the other thing is like a lot of security technology.

387
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:38,666
Like we're not going to replace seatbelts, you'll always have seatbelts,

388
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:40,616
but we also have air brakes and we also have

389
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,495
anti lock brakes and we also have collision avoidance.

390
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:42,955
-- So we, you
-- know,

391
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,676
I I don't like that example because I think

392
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:49,745
the point you hit on is with ring doorbells.

393
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:56,469
Security is often bad at prevention because prevention often requires 100%

394
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,789
Well, by definition,

395
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,650
to prevent something, you have to prevent it 100%. That's

396
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:02,070
what prevention means.

397
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,500
But once you have the ability to, like, monitor and observe an environment,

398
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,260
it changes some of what happens because let's say you do get broken into

399
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,969
-- with your house. That sucks.
-- Well, it happened to my neighbor,

400
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,670
my neighbor got broken into and my son noticed the next

401
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,219
day that his garage door was open and I'm like,

402
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:21,339
that's weird and it didn't even tweak to me that both

403
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:23,900
his cars were missing because they were away on their honeymoon.

404
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,780
So before we run ourselves out of time, I want to kind of tie this all together. Right.

405
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:29,339
So we know there's,

406
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:33,199
there's existing security technology that we'll say has never been

407
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,640
100%. We know that,

408
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,319
but it's always been good enough, right?

409
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:41,560
Be it, door locks, be it even our, our computer security is often the case.

410
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,020
Now we have all this tooling that helps you get around a lot of

411
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,280
just that we say

412
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,680
trivial security, maybe we'll call it.

413
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,630
And this is even true in the world of computers where there is

414
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,619
so much information. You've got things like metas

415
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,689
plait. Now you can buy exploits on, on various black markets like

416
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,989
the bar is lower than it's ever been.

417
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,829
Right? Well, and availability, right?

418
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,459
Like you were like, oh, you, you can't do that, Kurt like blah, blah, blah,

419
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:07,520
show me proof of this and I'm like,

420
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,469
here's a link to a commercial product with a how to video where they like.

421
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:14,449
-- No, no.
-- Ok. No, I want no, you can't do that to me. I'm not gonna let you.

422
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,479
So Kurt says he can pretend he's drunk and stumble up to a house and stick the

423
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:24,890
camera in and pull it out and then stumble away and then make a key later.

424
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,709
That's not how that works.

425
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:27,589
You have to,

426
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,560
no,

427
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,619
you have to pull,

428
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,449
you plug it in and it reads one pin and you pull it out and you have to twist the back and

429
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:38,410
push it back in and read the next pin and you have to do that for all five or six pins.

430
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,489
Depending upon the lock you're working with. That is not a practical attack

431
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:42,380
yet.

432
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,750
I accept that the day might come that you just stick it in.

433
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,949
It takes a picture of all of the pins and you pull it out and you've got what you need.

434
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:53,349
-- That isn't what exists today though.
-- Ok.

435
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,949
But, but I think part of it now is it's, that is clearly possible.

436
00:18:57,199 --> 00:19:00,630
It is. It is well, within the realm of reason. Yes.

437
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,069
Honestly, I'm guessing you could probably just do it in software now.

438
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,770
Just whip up a little A I

439
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,900
probably that video

440
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:08,449
and,

441
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,910
and that's the thing, right is that

442
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:11,839
I think part of it too is it's not,

443
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,099
it's not just that these tools are available it's that we

444
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,099
know they're available and we can buy them online for like,

445
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:16,979
2, 300 bucks.

446
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,930
Right. Like Flipper Zero is, is doing that and like, literally they have that.

447
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:25,040
They have like, us customs seized a shipment of 15,000 Flipper Zeros

448
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:28,109
and it's holding on to them. Yeah, it was on their Twitter thing a week or two ago.

449
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,410
I don't know if it's been resolved yet and

450
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,709
I suspect they're kind of like this is naughty.

451
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:34,550
But is it illegal? Well, if it's not illegal? Well, poop, what do we do now?

452
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,729
Because,

453
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,109
you know, I,

454
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:40,069
I'm guessing law enforcement doesn't look at these and be like, oh, cute.

455
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,859
A little, like wireless hacking toy to learn. No, they're like this.

456
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:45,589
-- It
-- has a dolphin on it. How could it be dangerous,

457
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:49,699
-- dude?
-- Have you read about how horrifically evil dolphins are

458
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,130
just Google it. It's no, seriously, they are not a happy fun creature.

459
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:54,550
I refuse to believe this

460
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,270
are friendly.

461
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,380
They are friends.

462
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,989
The US Navy uses them anyways.

463
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,150
But, so

464
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,770
the thing is, it's like, I, you know, II, I see this like, lock decoder thing,

465
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,349
you know, from the lock picking lawyer and it's like, go on my website and buy it.

466
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,510
It's like they start at like 30 bucks depending on

467
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,010
like which key way and which key system it is.

468
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,859
Somebody like me, I'm gonna actually document, like, I want to see like,

469
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:19,000
after an hour of practice 10 hours of practice.

470
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,630
Like, how, what is my progression with this tool?

471
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:22,260
Right.

472
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,359
And I've only done really basic lock picking in pass,

473
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:26,660
which basically consists of like, I bought a master lock and a rake and I was like,

474
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,380
zip, zip click.

475
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,160
-- I'm like, oh, these really are garbage locks.
-- That's not, that's not lock picking

476
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,339
but ok. Ok. So anyway, anyway,

477
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,910
the incentive for

478
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,310
security I think is never going to be enough by itself. Right.

479
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,670
Unless you are a secured location which like things like banks,

480
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,869
obviously that's a different casinos.

481
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,709
They care,

482
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:48,430
you know, military installations, they care.

483
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:51,189
But you know what they all have in common people with

484
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,949
weapons willing to enforce the rules with violence

485
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,010
because that's

486
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,979
because that's the only thing that's going

487
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,890
to ultimately stop a determined attacker because,

488
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:01,900
you know, like if somebody breaking into my neighbor's house,

489
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,800
like I could be out there on my lawn yelling at them, they're,

490
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,410
what are they going to do?

491
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,540
-- Run away? They don't care, like, until the cops show up.
-- Exactly.

492
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,760
So, anyway, security for normal people, I think by itself and

493
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:17,010
there are, there's always going to be this progression of, we'll say antis

494
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,380
security

495
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:22,979
-- stuff. Be it flipper zero, be it lock picking equipment, be it, what,
-- whatever.

496
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:23,849
Right. The anti

497
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,130
anti

498
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,349
-- missile.
-- Right. Right.

499
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:28,040
It's always been a cat and mouse game throughout history. Right.

500
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,709
Like forever and it will always be a cat and

501
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:32,560
mouse game and I feel like we've reached a point

502
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,369
in

503
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:38,199
just the pervasiveness of technology, the simplicity of creating product

504
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:39,030
and

505
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,640
everything that exists

506
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,430
where

507
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,109
the, the ability to, I, I guess, obscure this,

508
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,619
this security because I would say a lot

509
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,170
of the security is security through obscurity fundamentally.

510
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,989
-- Oh, dude,
-- remember when locksmiths were like, well, like magicians, like,

511
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,390
we can't tell you how locks it worked.

512
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,589
Like people would post basic diagrams of how cylinder locks work

513
00:21:56,719 --> 00:22:00,189
and people would argue with them that you can't do that. It's illegal.

514
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,829
You, you're like, dude, it's, it's simple mechanical diagram.

515
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,949
-- Like,
-- well, there, there's always been that though, if,

516
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,739
if your security relies on people not knowing how it works, you should

517
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,920
-- is terrible.
-- Like how many, how many computer security people railed about?

518
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,550
You can't tell people about these techniques or these, you know, secrets, you know,

519
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,819
like the magician's code.

520
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:18,560
I don't think there was a lot of that.

521
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:22,170
I think there was an attempt maybe for a short period of time.

522
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,560
I got death threats on some occasions from a vendor basically,

523
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,099
like, well, not death threats. No, I got death threats for that.

524
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:32,839
Ssh SSL tell like for Ssh, sniff when I wrote an article about it,

525
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:36,400
the end of SSH and SSL I got death threats from it.

526
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:37,199
Yeah.

527
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,790
And I also got threats.

528
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,089
I remember from a large company uh when I revealed a

529
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,890
security flaw in their product that I thought was super trivial.

530
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,329
And not a big deal, but they were under,

531
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:49,410
they were being acquired and so they wanted no bad news and they lost their minds.

532
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:50,969
Well, and, and there,

533
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:53,189
there have been many vendors that made a big deal

534
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,770
about security vulnerabilities and trying to keep them hidden and,

535
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,239
and there's still, that still exists.

536
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,790
I mean, bug bounties by a lot of companies aren't used to fix bugs.

537
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,569
They're used to silence researchers.

538
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,939
Right. Where if you don't shut up, we're not paying you money.

539
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:09,670
And that's, that's a whole another problem in itself.

540
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,250
But the point is right, we've got all this technology.

541
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:15,099
It's kind of caught up to a lot of our security and

542
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:17,069
now it's time for security to kind of make some of the,

543
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,770
we, we need another step.

544
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,520
Right? It's time for things like door locks to get better. It's time for things like,

545
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,310
you know, various RF ID

546
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:29,239
and infrared and whatever it is that the flipper zero can basically p now like

547
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,630
-- that stuff all needs to get that
-- flipper zero is in for it too.

548
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:32,719
Yeah, this infrared

549
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,540
when it was really cool actually. So when I was at uh Cipher

550
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,900
Con earlier in the year,

551
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,619
they had like this weird game with the badges and they used infrared to talk to each

552
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,310
other and people were like trying to capture the

553
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,369
data with their flipper zeros because Flipper zero,

554
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,099
like it was the,

555
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,050
the, the Kickstarter crew had just gotten them like,

556
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,890
literally days before this conference.

557
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:51,319
And it was funny because the,

558
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,609
the people, the, the people who built the badges,

559
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,430
they recognized this was going to happen.

560
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,459
And so

561
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,050
the, basically the badges were like, impossible to figure out.

562
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,369
They purposely made it, like, very, very difficult

563
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,260
that shipment gets released by us customs.

564
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,089
Right. Right. Anyway, anyway, but the point is right,

565
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,170
we, we need kind of need the next step now. But what, what is going to drive?

566
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,349
Right. Not just security like who is doing

567
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,420
new and novel research into door locks for residential areas, to

568
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,089
my knowledge

569
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,489
and part of it too though is to accept that maybe

570
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,010
door locks are kind of at an evolutionary dead end.

571
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,199
And for example, like

572
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,520
belts, a three point seatbelt,

573
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,380
people aren't going to accept five point or

574
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,430
eight point racing seatbelts in their car.

575
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:33,880
So

576
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,339
let's fill it with air bags.

577
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,489
I have quicks, set locks like I'm sure everybody in the audience is like, yeah,

578
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,040
I could pick those in five minutes like, yeah, you absolutely could,

579
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,630
you could also just kick in the front door,

580
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,430
but I also then have the, you know, the alarm system and the cameras and

581
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:49,579
I also don't leave my house much because I'm basically antisocial,

582
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,310
you know, so I'm always here, but that's the thing. Right.

583
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:52,630
So I,

584
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,290
I accept that locks are essentially unless I spend like 3

585
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,869
to 500 bucks per door to put like some you know,

586
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,869
RF ID badge system on it.

587
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:04,430
-- But I just get an alarm system.
-- Here's kind of the way I think about this.

588
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,829
Why do you have an alarm system?

589
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,949
Is the alarm system going to stop anyone?

590
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:08,170
No,

591
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,189
the alarm system is so that I know what's happening sooner and can call the police.

592
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:16,030
And more importantly, you can show it to your insurance company

593
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,819
and they can't claim

594
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,900
that your house wasn't broken into.

595
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,969
And I think that's part of it is you are actually correct and, and your,

596
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:25,089
your seatbelt analogy.

597
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:27,719
And I think like automobile safety and things like that are apt

598
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,449
is

599
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,020
you reach a point of just diminishing returns where for, for there's,

600
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,410
it might be money, it might be, people just want to accept it.

601
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,180
There, there's a million things hassle.

602
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:41,339
And then we, we kind of now we enter the realm of insurance

603
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:45,334
where you're acquiring insurance to basically fill that

604
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:49,824
gap where your protection or security or whatever stops

605
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:52,665
and reality kicks in. And this is why like,

606
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:55,395
you know, you're going to be safe enough in a car accident,

607
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:56,625
your car is gonna be trashed.

608
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:59,484
The insurance company is going to pay for the damage and take care of the problem.

609
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:02,584
-- Basically,
-- we, we talked about this many years ago, Tom, you know,

610
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,454
like should we build fireproof buildings or should

611
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,064
we just make everybody get smoke alarms?

612
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:06,364
Well,

613
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:10,920
the cost of making fireproof buildings is high like it's possible.

614
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:13,619
Like there are like no seriously like jails

615
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,160
and there are certain types of institutional buildings,

616
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,880
like I assume all concrete.

617
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,449
Yeah, I mean, so there are ways of building fireproof buildings, you know,

618
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:23,640
like a famous thing is most stables

619
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:26,989
are built now with steel, I beam supports and a steel roof.

620
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,859
So that if there's a fire, the whole thing doesn't collapse down because like shas

621
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:30,869
burn down

622
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:33,640
a lot because they're full of straw.

623
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,430
Like

624
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,800
no, like I just,

625
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:37,660
that's just how it is. Like

626
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,310
literally the best bettings for horses are like straw and shavings.

627
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,739
-- Interesting. I mean, that's fair.
-- Straight up.

628
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,400
We're talking multiple cubic yards of wood shavings in a building.

629
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,609
That's a fire hazard.

630
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,410
Yeah, like you end up with spontaneous combustion if you have a big pile of stuff,

631
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,810
I've seen that more than once,

632
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:56,329
you know.

633
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,770
And so the thing is like at some point you just don't like, you just accept that.

634
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:01,849
Yeah, it'll fail. So we ensure it,

635
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,250
you know, pull the risk.

636
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,290
-- That's literally what insurance is for.
-- On that note,

637
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:10,780
the insurance companies are generally very good about keeping track of what is

638
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,900
the acceptable and unacceptable products. I mean,

639
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,099
if you look at automobiles, that's a great example where

640
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:19,800
during the transition from

641
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,849
like, you know, no seatbelts to seatbelts and cars,

642
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,060
there was no doubt a point where insurance companies were like,

643
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:27,550
if you don't put seatbelts in your car, we're not insuring this car

644
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:29,040
and like,

645
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,469
that's a pretty good reason,

646
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,290
you know. And I imagine

647
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:35,640
it's probably very similar. I know when I got home insurance

648
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,219
they had me fill out this great big form, you know.

649
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:40,989
Well, you know, tell me about this, tell me about this. Like, who makes your locks?

650
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,839
Who does this?

651
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:46,069
-- And I get that,
-- I got a new furnace in ac and my parents and some other people

652
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:49,560
and as part of the standard thing now is they, they basically,

653
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,969
you're required to buy two carbon monoxide detectors as part of the package.

654
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,410
And that's the thing, right? They're like 30 or 40 bucks

655
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,020
and they absolutely 100% save lives.

656
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,780
Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

657
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,449
You know, we should link to that Reddit thread where that guy was, like,

658
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:05,420
I find these weird notes left around my apartment,

659
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:07,750
you know, and everybody's like, well, that's so,

660
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,719
and then it turns out to be carb monoxide poisoning,

661
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:10,640
right?

662
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:14,099
I will try to find that. It's, that's a really good story though. Ok.

663
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,439
So summing it all up.

664
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:15,949
I,

665
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:18,949
I think the interesting takeaway I have

666
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,520
from this conversation is that there's obviously

667
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,239
there's a point of diminishing returns on all security

668
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,589
and I think everyone can agree with that.

669
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,239
Right. Like perfect security obviously just can't exist.

670
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,540
It's like going the speed of light

671
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,069
and the closer you try to get to it, the harder it is.

672
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,239
Now we start entering places where we have to use other things,

673
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,729
-- be it like monitoring, be it insurance, be it whatever,
-- well, affordable things.

674
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:44,209
That's true. Things that, that have acceptable and under

675
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:45,755
return on investments

676
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:48,875
and especially insurance. So yeah, I I feel like

677
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:49,974
I feel like this makes sense.

678
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:51,724
When I, when I started this episode,

679
00:28:51,734 --> 00:28:53,224
I kind of expected us to just spend a

680
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:56,454
lot of time bashing most of the existing industries.

681
00:28:56,464 --> 00:28:58,405
Well, I mean, a perfect example of this is, you know,

682
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:00,604
we're finally starting to make the leap to hardware

683
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,814
two fa because we've discovered like we've reached the,

684
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,834
like we can't make S MS text two fa more secure.

685
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:06,895
It's, it's a dead end.

686
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,390
Yeah. Any

687
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:11,780
two factor authentication system that involves pushing something and

688
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,810
annoying a person is probably doomed to failure.

689
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,420
It has to be like a P system where they can't be annoyed so that they just send the code

690
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,989
-- to the attacker and make it stop
-- even though the

691
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,750
hardware two fa comes with its own set of challenges.

692
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,385
But the thing is, it's also going to take like a good decade or five for us to get rid of.

693
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:29,505
Totally. Like,

694
00:29:29,675 --> 00:29:31,625
well, we're still stuck with password rotation

695
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:35,285
and we're gonna be stuck with like S MS text authentication for, yeah,

696
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:37,454
-- probably 50 years
-- forever.

697
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,545
Kirk. We'll be stuck with it forever. That's the answer.

698
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:42,505
All right, I'm going to call it. This is fun. This is good.

699
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,439
Uh And, and seriously, if you're listening,

700
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,560
go watch that youtube video of the guy who makes the ISA card.

701
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:49,530
It's like it's mind blowing and amazing.

702
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,030
