Hello, everyone. Josh again.

1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,099
If you didn't listen to the intro from last week, I cover why?

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,409
This episode 42 is a Remaster and something we already did.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,579
So, go back and listen to that if you haven't heard it. But otherwise,

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,800
thanks for listening. And here is the thrilling conclusion

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,860
of podcast episode 42 on Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,829
If we continue on with the story, we end up on a Wit

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,110
Woodle

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,110
Six

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,520
which is the, I guess planet of Huma

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:28,889
Kula,

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,319
which is the leader of, I forget the name of his religion,

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,029
but they worshiped the great Arkle seizure.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,150
They're waiting for the time of the Great

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,599
Handkerchief. Is it when the world ends? Yes.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,029
The coming of the Great handkerchief because the universe was created by a sneeze.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,389
Right. Right. And they actually touch on this a little bit

17
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:49,459
at the, uh, on the rest of the end of the universe, but they obviously don't, that,

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,540
that's not part of the movie.

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,939
But, but anyway, this part, I found really bizarre because

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,229
it, this, this story arc isn't in the book or the radio show

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,250
and they, like, show up at this planet and

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,430
ZFA,

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,819
like,

24
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,459
kind of goes crazy and they go down to the planet and it's a bit ridiculous and it

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,699
doesn't really fit in any way and I don't feel like it even adds to the story.

26
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:08,072
Um,

27
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,362
I don't know, it's debatable.

28
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:12,002
The only, I mean,

29
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,763
I don't, I don't like it.

30
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:18,102
This is one of the things I really hate about this movie is this particular scene.

31
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:21,843
-- I suspect they were trying to maybe do some character development. I don't
-- know.

32
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:24,063
The one thing I wrote the one note I wrote from this whole

33
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:27,343
event other than it being ridiculous is that the Vogons are worse,

34
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:29,222
worse shots than stormtroopers

35
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:30,776
because they're shooting.

36
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:33,825
But then actually later on in the movie towards the end, let me,

37
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:35,825
let me find the note Marvin at one point says, well,

38
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:36,945
you get shot in the back of the head.

39
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:37,075
Bogans

40
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:38,396
are the, no, no,

41
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:39,176
he says,

42
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:40,706
I don't know what you guys are worried about.

43
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:41,986
Bogans are the worst marksmen,

44
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:44,875
marksmen in the galaxy and then he gets shot at the back of the head by the Bos.

45
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:49,825
-- Well, that's how Murphy's law works. I
-- know. Well, it's Marvin the robot.

46
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:51,085
It's awesome. Anyway.

47
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:51,865
Oh, actually,

48
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:55,949
so one thing I was wondering the background checks they did on Zaho,

49
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,000
right?

50
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,930
Because you can't become a president of the Galaxy without background checks

51
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:03,730
and apparently brain scans because he had to cut out parts of his brain.

52
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,629
-- Remember
-- that's what they say in the, the,

53
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:12,240
the movie and in the book he wipes his memory or something like that and,

54
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,440
and he buried certain thoughts very deep and that's why he,

55
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,270
and that actually ties into the total perspective vortex plot arc as well later on.

56
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:23,149
-- And a bunch of other things.
-- Yeah, that was missing from the felon.

57
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,600
Well, it comes way later though.

58
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,419
Well, I guess maybe that was sort of the gun was replacing that.

59
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,789
Yeah, that's true. The gun is, I think meant to be the total perspective. Vortex.

60
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,229
But you got to remember too, the Hitchhikers got to the galaxy.

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,660
-- The book is really like five or six stories.
-- Well, it's five books of alone. So,

62
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:41,789
yeah.

63
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,669
Right. Right.

64
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,070
And,

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,029
and so in the radio show actually does it

66
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,020
the last season of the radio show number five,

67
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:50,550
I think it is, they kind of go off the rails a little bit.

68
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:53,059
But other than that, they stick to the book pretty well and they,

69
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,710
they rearrange a couple of things, but for the most part they get it all.

70
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,509
But, but anyway, anyway, the Vogons capture Trillion, which,

71
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,380
yeah, whatever, not, not, not a whole lot of crazy security going on there.

72
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,589
But I will say that.

73
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,580
So then they go to Vos Sphere

74
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,800
and this is where I think things get

75
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,380
kind of,

76
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:11,850
I, I feel like the story starts to pick up and,

77
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,479
and from the security theme perspective, there's all kinds of crazy stuff.

78
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,220
One of the things I love is the spatula things that hit you when you think

79
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:19,779
religion.

80
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,440
That's fantastic.

81
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,080
Yeah. They were feeding off the mind energy if memory serves. Right. Right.

82
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,039
And the beauty of that though, in this, like

83
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,669
I

84
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,699
can so relate to this kind of,

85
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,039
from the standpoint of security is when you're dealing with a ton of

86
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,000
bureaucracy and crazy rules like thinking is obviously not a part of that,

87
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,300
right?

88
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:41,750
You're expected you follow the rules because you're supposed to follow the rules

89
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,000
and don't think about

90
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:43,509
it. I

91
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,669
can't help it.

92
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:49,110
Like some of our security stuff is totally like that where we have these rules about,

93
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,699
oh, change your password every 30 days.

94
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,339
Why? Well, because change your password every 30 days.

95
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,190
Granted, I don't dis is change of guidance on that. You kind of get the idea. Right.

96
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,949
Well, it's the, the problem part of it is, you know,

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,589
these rules may have been valid 30 years ago when they were

98
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,779
formulated for a specific subset of situations for which they were validated.

99
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,809
But then the problem, it's like PC I compliance.

100
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,639
Everybody's like, oh, we're going to require PC I compliance even though you, like,

101
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,410
don't process credit cards or whatever.

102
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,798
Well, a great example, the European cookie rules, right? You have to notify people.

103
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:20,899
You're using cookies on your website. Well, of course you're using cookies.

104
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,070
-- It's a website. That's how that works.
-- I

105
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,369
know, man. That's like,

106
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:25,570
I hate that.

107
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,500
So every single bloody website has that stupid warning.

108
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,570
Now that takes up like a big chunk of the screen, you have to, like, get rid of it.

109
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,299
And then the best part is if you actually do

110
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,869
clear your cookies and stuff every once in a while,

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,899
then you get it again and again and again and again,

112
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:40,429
-- you know, and it's just, oh, it's so annoying.
-- Right. Right.

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,720
And this is very,

114
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,410
I feel like a lot of security rules are like this

115
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,369
or my favorite now is everyone needs to run antivirus.

116
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,950
And this is basically every compliance thing in the world

117
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:52,029
says you need antivirus on your servers

118
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,470
and let's face it.

119
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,239
I think Tavis has shown us like antivirus is potentially

120
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,230
worse than what is trying to protect us from.

121
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:58,809
I mean,

122
00:04:58,929 --> 00:04:59,329
for sure,

123
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:02,630
the lower end level, which is basically all of it. I mean,

124
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,829
the biggest thing I always come back to is, you know, when you ask people, like, why,

125
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,709
why are you doing this?

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,750
Why should we do this?

127
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,709
And you know? Yeah, I mean,

128
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,070
because,

129
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,890
yeah, exactly, because I mean, is there actually,

130
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,769
can you actually even get antivirus for mobile devices?

131
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:19,609
-- I think there is some for Android.
-- Oh, yeah.

132
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,570
Yeah, you can get these terrible apps and they, like,

133
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,809
kill your performance and they don't really work because they don't, well,

134
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,130
you can get some things that will run his route if you let them don't

135
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:34,799
and all the other stuff just, it's, it's, it's garbage. I mean, I'm not going to lie.

136
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:38,519
It's kind of garbage and it's the sort of thing, people who use it are ticking boxes,

137
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:39,480
let's face it.

138
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,260
They're not doing it because they need it. And,

139
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,859
but I feel like there's, there's a fair bit of security like that, you know,

140
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:47,825
this is, but this is always going to be a challenge

141
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:48,644
is

142
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:53,774
you will always have security compliance and security rules that were put in place

143
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:56,785
probably for a good reason a long time ago.

144
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:58,625
But getting any of this to change

145
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,364
is very difficult. Like here's a great example is

146
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:05,184
I I watch a TED talk one time from this guy who basically,

147
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:06,584
he, he, you know,

148
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:09,765
he was complaining about car seats because people with small Children,

149
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:13,265
like the vast majority of them install their car seats incorrectly

150
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,579
and it's actually more dangerous at that point because the seat has

151
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,019
the risk of like your child flinging out of it in an,

152
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,820
in an accident.

153
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:20,869
So anyway,

154
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:24,029
what he did is he took like the crash test dummy of a two year old,

155
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,570
put it in various car seats and crashed, right?

156
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,179
Got the data off the dummy.

157
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,779
Then he put the kid in a seatbelt, like literally just a seatbelt in the seat,

158
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,779
crashed it

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,899
and he brings all his findings to uh it was some like safety organization that,

160
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,339
that specializes in this and he shows it to him and they're like, yeah,

161
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,119
all this all looks great, you know, whatever these would all pass.

162
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,420
He's like that last one there. That's just a seatbelt.

163
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,179
And they said, ok, that's fine.

164
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,980
And, and then he's like, what do you think of that?

165
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:51,640
They're like, look, man, we know putting a three year old in a seatbelt is just fine.

166
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,140
But he said,

167
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,350
where are you going to find any lawmaker that's

168
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,299
gonna be willing to talk about changing these things?

169
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:59,540
Because, you know, the first kid who dies in a car accident

170
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,579
in a seatbelt,

171
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,559
people are going to lose it.

172
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,049
Well, it's like the whole self driving cars,

173
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:07,059
we're holding them to a much higher standard than we hold human drivers.

174
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,540
They're still going to win because they, they are a much higher standard.

175
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,950
Well, and the fact that, you know, we have these like,

176
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,390
self-driving car crashes where it's like the self driving

177
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,559
car is just mos along and like gets t-boned,

178
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,359
like, you know, somebody rolls a red light or, you know, and,

179
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:24,320
and people are like up in arms about it and like, well, you know, at least,

180
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:27,829
like in theory, at least a self driving car has a chance of avoiding this, you know,

181
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,470
whereas a human driver definitely doesn't.

182
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,720
And

183
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:30,750
yeah. Right.

184
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,040
Well,

185
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,720
I've seen plenty of instances where the self

186
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,959
driving car actually avoided a bunch of problems.

187
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,959
One of my favorite is there's a video, I saw where there was a bicycler coming.

188
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,420
It was like an intersection, a kind of a four way stop sort of deal.

189
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,440
And there was a truck next to the self driving car.

190
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,350
But as the self driving car was pulling up to the stop,

191
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,640
it saw the biker way off on the left.

192
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:56,899
And so he knew there was a biker basically coming, pulls up and it waited longer than

193
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,950
it should have at this stop

194
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,989
as the biker drives past it because you couldn't see the biker because the truck

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,489
was next to it and it's like a human would have hit that dude.

196
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,790
Right. Like, let's face it.

197
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,299
But the car knew it was there and like, that's awesome. Right.

198
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:13,579
And if I had to guess there are probably 10 to

199
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:17,459
1 instances of self driving cars doing something better than a human

200
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,339
versus them, maybe making some sort of minor mistake.

201
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,059
And much more importantly, you know, once they identify the cause of the accident,

202
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,859
they can hopefully create some sort of software fix or something and then, you know,

203
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:27,679
update the fleet.

204
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:28,899
That's true. Yeah.

205
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,260
You know, because it reminds me of like all these airline accidents,

206
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:32,289
I'm reading about where

207
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,299
something terrible happens. So they come up with a corrective action and apply it

208
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,789
and when they don't, it's, you know, because there's this one classic air crash,

209
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,580
I forget them on the plane.

210
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,039
But like the door would fall off from the cargo hatch man,

211
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,400
you know, and of course, the thing would depressurize and everybody dies if the,

212
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,309
you know, pilot's really not on the ball.

213
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:53,479
And then it happens again three years later and it's the same,

214
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,059
uh it's like the same investigator.

215
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,919
He's like, he basically, his response is like, God

216
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:58,914
damn it. Like, I know what happened here.

217
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:01,474
I, you know, and like they were supposed to fix this and, you know,

218
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:04,744
that time around the FAA actually made it, like, mandatory to fix

219
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:08,375
as opposed to, like, please fix this. We think you should. Sure.

220
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:10,265
You know, and I mean, that's the biggest thing. Right?

221
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,114
Because like, how many times, well,

222
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,984
the fact that we have red light cameras in like a lot of cities, I hate this.

223
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:16,364
You know what I mean?

224
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:17,065
Like

225
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,119
that, that alone should tell you that people suck at driving,

226
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,650
the fact that they can't obey a red light typically at a busy intersection.

227
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:25,369
It's not like some,

228
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,239
you know, I could see like some rural intersection where there's like,

229
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,369
no traffic ever,

230
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,729
there'd be no economic value to putting it there because let's face it.

231
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,849
The purpose of red light cameras is to make money.

232
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:38,450
It's not to make anyone safer of any sort. Right.

233
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,179
Uh, I, I would disagree a bit because I mean, they do here.

234
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,460
Well, maybe it's different in the US than it is in Canada with the,

235
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,289
with the, the fine structures and how that money is allocated.

236
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,530
But the point is like here, I mean, there's red light cameras and speed cameras,

237
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,669
they, and they publish where the locations are, like,

238
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,859
they have to legally publish the locations even for the ones where it's like,

239
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,729
you know, where it's the mobile speed enforcement, like the photo radar trucks

240
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,890
and like, we know all the locations like

241
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,070
it's behind the stonehouse on the way mud and like on the pull off, you know,

242
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,960
pull off on the an, you know, on the whatever blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

243
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,729
And yet people still, you know, get nailed by these things constantly.

244
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,599
But the point is basically humans can't obey red lights and basic speed limits and,

245
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:17,090
you know.

246
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:17,869
-- Right.
-- And

247
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:21,369
yes. Exactly. Exactly. Right. Is, humans are terrible at this

248
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:24,469
and that's like the red light thing, especially that, that matters.

249
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:29,650
-- That's a safety thing.
-- Let's stay on this topic of self driving cars and when the

250
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,510
heart of gold gets to

251
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:32,229
Mathia,

252
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:36,109
they have uh IOT controlled missiles launched at the ship.

253
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,039
Now

254
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,559
this is a terrible idea.

255
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,880
If you

256
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:44,039
have missiles, please don't make them autonomous.

257
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:48,080
Well, but you kind of have to, to some degree because when you

258
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:52,650
don't know, reaction times are incredibly small in some situations.

259
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:55,200
So you have to have automated systems that can just, you know,

260
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,080
take care of the situation because

261
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,359
I mean, what happens when you only have 10 or 22nd?

262
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,820
Like, you know, I mean, the classic example of this is the US,

263
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,989
has been sent shooting down a civilian airliner

264
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,989
because they basically just, they didn't have the room to maneuver.

265
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,390
So they're like, well, crap, we have no other option. Shoot it down. Right.

266
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,270
They only had like, tens of seconds to deal with the situation,

267
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:18,090
which was a major part of the problem. Right. They were under that time pressure.

268
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,130
And do you think an autonomous system would have done something different?

269
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,150
Uh,

270
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,530
well,

271
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,770
I, well, it depends on how it's programmed.

272
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,419
I mean, part of it would be the autonomous system in theory.

273
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:32,289
Well, no part of the reason they shot it down, they got the time zones mixed up,

274
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:35,880
didn't we just talk about how bad software is there?

275
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,469
They had actual data that there was that flight

276
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,190
coming out of that airport at that time.

277
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,799
But because of the way the time zones were all

278
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,184
up because there were like three different time zones involved,

279
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:48,315
like where it was taking off from where it was going to and then like the time zone,

280
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:48,974
the US Finns

281
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:49,554
or something,

282
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:50,224
they, like,

283
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:54,424
basically messed that up and didn't recognize it as a scheduled civilian airliner.

284
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,664
Ok. Ok.

285
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,465
And also the transponder code,

286
00:11:57,474 --> 00:12:00,794
what happened is the military was flying jets out of the same thing.

287
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:04,145
And so the guy initially picked up a transponder code from a

288
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:08,294
military flight and that got attached apparently or something to the,

289
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:08,655
like

290
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,679
the civilian you know, radar track.

291
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:12,719
So again, I mean,

292
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:15,400
potentially an autonomous system would have identified it correctly and been,

293
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:16,039
like, nope,

294
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,640
-- that's a civilian airliner taking off on time. I don't know.
-- I don't know.

295
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,070
I still feel like autonomous missiles are bad.

296
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,559
Well, the reality is, you know,

297
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,609
weapon systems of the future are going to be more and more autonomous and again,

298
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:29,520
part of it is that reaction time, you know,

299
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,349
how are you as a human being going to deal with a drone

300
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,799
coming in at you with like a couple 100 ft away from you?

301
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,140
Yeah, I mean, I'm not generally in favor of like auto

302
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,909
responses because then, you know, we always had World War II.

303
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,590
What was it in like 1983 when the Russian, you know, launch detection system

304
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:47,400
-- was like,
-- right. Right.

305
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:51,359
It picked up something else and thought they were under attack.

306
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:53,640
It was, I think it was a reflection of the moon or something.

307
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,109
-- It
-- was

308
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,070
-- something ridiculous.
-- And,

309
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,130
and luckily that, you know, Soviet General guy was like, I don't think this is real.

310
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,979
-- Let's just wait a few seconds and minutes and see what happens. I love
-- it.

311
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:05,409
So, so the next thing

312
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,010
while they're being attacked by missiles is

313
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,390
they're, they're freaking out and trying to escape.

314
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,909
And Arthur says, why doesn't someone just push that button?

315
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:17,890
And everyone's like, oh, we can't do that and no one knows why though.

316
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,770
And he says, well, why

317
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:20,580
and I feel like

318
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,090
this comes back to our kind of compliance based security

319
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,849
advice or rather just old security advice maybe is,

320
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,690
you know,

321
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,039
people will say things like,

322
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:34,109
well, you need to change your password every 30 days or 60 days and you could say,

323
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,109
well, well, why?

324
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,979
And they don't know. Right. They, they don't know.

325
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:38,770
-- And,
-- yeah,

326
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,390
because I can't imagine an tacker is going to sniff your password and then, like,

327
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,710
wait for 90 days to use it.

328
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,179
-- Uh, well,
-- they're going to use it. Like, right away.

329
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,820
The bigger problem is just that people change your password a lot.

330
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,940
They either pick a really, really bad password

331
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:52,570
or they,

332
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:55,950
or they make other foolish choices around it.

333
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,619
Versus anyway, the idea is we have lots of security advice where you're like, oh,

334
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,640
you can't do that and then they'll be like, well, well, why not?

335
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,940
And we're like, I don't know.

336
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:05,869
And I mean, this,

337
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,659
this comes back to a lot of the discussions

338
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:11,219
we have where we try to talk about security from

339
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:14,109
a very practical standpoint and there's a lot of security

340
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,090
people that will disagree with the things we say,

341
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,479
but they probably can't back up their ideas

342
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,169
with any sort of RR reason.

343
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:20,690
Right.

344
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,840
No, it's, I mean, well, even I, you know,

345
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:26,489
I've stopped running antivirus and I do occasionally reinstall it,

346
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,880
scan my entire system and I'm like, well,

347
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:30,330
either I've got, like,

348
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,530
the root kit installed that is avoiding it or I don't have any viruses

349
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:36,479
and based on the fact that I still have money in my bank account,

350
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:37,200
you know,

351
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,809
it would appear that, yeah, you don't, well, and, you know, more to the point, like,

352
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,969
especially with, on Linux,

353
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:46,330
like, I know there are some Linux viruses but they're so rare.

354
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,789
Like they're literally, you know, it's just all advanced,

355
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,929
persistent threat in the Linux world actually.

356
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,090
You know, you know what's really funny about that is

357
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:57,349
I read a story about Os X last week showing that

358
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,309
the number of OS X malware detections went up by,

359
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,070
by like 1000% or something

360
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:03,250
last year.

361
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,630
And the researcher who found this basically said, look,

362
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,789
I know this looks really bad, but we're still

363
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:08,965
at

364
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:10,635
like tens of thousands.

365
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:14,044
And you got to remember like the Windows world is in the tens of millions.

366
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,755
Well, you, you cannot run Java, you cannot run flash,

367
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:20,905
you cannot run PDF or apparently Microsoft office again.

368
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:24,304
Microsoft office has zero days floating around again for it. I know,

369
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:27,025
you know, if you're not running in protected mode, your bones.

370
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:27,664
Well,

371
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:30,434
shouldn't we all just be using like office 365 now and then

372
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:34,284
-- it's Microsoft's problem
-- that still installs like the clients on your machine?

373
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:35,065
Oh, does it really?

374
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,809
I have no idea. I haven't used

375
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,690
-- it.
-- I had to edit some slides for RS A and keynote.

376
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,940
Their keynote templates were just like screwed up.

377
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,830
So I ended up having to use powerpoint

378
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,140
and yeah, it installs.

379
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,690
But what's interesting is, for example, like when you do a file, convert it,

380
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,049
like ships it off to Microsoft to convert the file and then ships it back to you.

381
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:54,190
Like it doesn't do it on the local system. And I'm like

382
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,539
Bar right then, you know, that's interesting.

383
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:59,570
-- And
-- there's a local client and it does some stuff in the cloud.

384
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,619
Why not just do like Google Docs?

385
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,859
Well, and when I say a local client, like, you know,

386
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:07,380
it's still like a couple 100 megabytes of installed stuff, right?

387
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,659
But there's a lot of stuff that goes on in the cloud that seems bonkers.

388
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,559
Well, it makes sense because you want to be able to have here's the problem, right?

389
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,580
People will still need or want but maybe need even

390
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:19,969
that full offline working experience.

391
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,979
Yeah, but like you can still do that. I mean Google Docs says offline mode, right?

392
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:28,000
But we're talking about stuff like Excel and powerpoint where you have like

393
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,770
97 billion features of which like,

394
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,969
you know, a 0.03% of people use that feature.

395
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:35,330
But it's like, you know,

396
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,659
all the different people using all the

397
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:39,049
-- different features ultimately
-- may maybe that's fair.

398
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:41,070
I, I admit that's one of the things I love about the group

399
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:44,994
docs experience because it doesn't have very many features because I, I like,

400
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:48,604
-- I'm really bad at word and
-- I use like three things in Excel

401
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:50,325
and I look at the rest of the interface and I'm like,

402
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:51,385
I don't even know what that does.

403
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:54,215
Like, I know how to use, like drop down filters and like,

404
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:54,835
you know,

405
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,604
you know what's actually really funny about that

406
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,674
is my wife is really good at spreadsheet.

407
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,005
She,

408
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,325
she got all this training in college and she

409
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,195
took all these classes and stuff and it was,

410
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:04,525
it was like a huge deal

411
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:05,435
and

412
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,250
every now and then I'll ask her for help.

413
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,170
But like, usually I just write a pearl script that does whatever I need it to do

414
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,260
it, like reads in a CS V file.

415
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,979
It does what I need done and then it outputs

416
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,410
a CS V file and then it just reimport that file

417
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:21,209
and it's really funny because every now and then she'll be like, how did you know how,

418
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:23,290
how, how do you have to set up to calculate that?

419
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,358
I'm like, and I wrote a Python script and

420
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,469
-- it's just funny.
-- No, I do the same with like

421
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,579
akin said and cut and people are like,

422
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,560
how did you make Excel do this?

423
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:36,199
And I'm like, I have no idea how that would work in Excel.

424
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,339
I know they say like, I know exactly what you mean. You gotta love it.

425
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:43,410
It's ridiculous. But anyway, anyway. All right. Uh

426
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:44,819
So

427
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:45,719
the Mariia

428
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,790
scene is also bizarre because it kind of magically shifts from Mariia

429
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,729
to earth

430
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,140
-- because they're rebuilding the earth.
-- Well, yeah, like the whole Sl

431
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:54,859
Bart

432
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:58,930
fast threats thing was like, I just found that scene so awkward.

433
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,900
You need to listen to the radio show and listen to SL

434
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,260
Bart

435
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,030
FSS conversation with Arthur. And it's

436
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,359
fantastic.

437
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,829
They, they really screwed up the conversation in, in the movie,

438
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,589
but on the radio show it's to die for.

439
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,510
It's one of my favorite scenes actually the way

440
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,829
he kind of threatens Arthur with the late,

441
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,780
the late Arthur death.

442
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,989
It's, it's very good and the voice is very funny

443
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,949
and just the whole thing is great.

444
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:22,150
So,

445
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,770
so find the radio show and listen to it and you won't be disappointed in that scene.

446
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,560
So anyway, I can ignore that just because I, I have the,

447
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:31,670
the happy memory of the radio show.

448
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,260
But then so, so they're on meth

449
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,810
and nothing overly exciting happens and then they go to the earth

450
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:40,619
because they're, they're making a new earth which is insane, whatever,

451
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,540
they're going to finish the

452
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,140
-- job.
-- But that,

453
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,530
that's actually like a huge point actually is

454
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,650
in the original story,

455
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,609
they were going to rebuild the earth,

456
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,689
but it would have to run again for like 10 million years.

457
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,869
It was just cheaper to come up with.

458
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,969
Well, that's when they thought, wait, Arthur Dent has the answer in his brain.

459
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,670
We'll just give him a bunch of money if he gives it to us is kind of where that ended and,

460
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,089
and, well,

461
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:06,089
whatever.

462
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,150
And

463
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,369
they, they kind of go back to Earth

464
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:12,609
and Arthur uh brutally murders the mice, which

465
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,219
I don't feel too bad about

466
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,780
-- it. But it's
-- like, well, they're just a manifestation of that.

467
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,930
-- What is it, like, 1313 dimensional entity or whatever?
-- So, are they dead though?

468
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:24,219
You think they get mad and, like, kill you or something? Right.

469
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:27,109
-- Like, I mean,
-- seriously, maybe they're more forgiving than us.

470
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,260
They were going to cut out Arthur's brain,

471
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,339
but that was just a purely practical thing.

472
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,020
And remember they remember from the book,

473
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,420
it was like we're just going to replace you with

474
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,119
like a whatever a little script that says like what?

475
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,770
No, I don't let's have tea,

476
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,459
you know, and then, and that's basically like 90% of what he said.

477
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:42,319
So yeah.

478
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,589
Really? How many people could we replace with like 10 lines of dialogue?

480
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:48,880
You know,

481
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,270
judging by the fact that we have interactive voice response systems on phones now,

482
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,760
I don't think we should discuss this because I think there's many

483
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,229
layers of nuance and misappropriation that could come into play here.

484
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,109
So we're just going to move on.

485
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,869
We we eventually get to the scene where the vo guns are shooting everyone.

486
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,000
Marvin says vo

487
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:10,069
guns are the worst marksmen in the galaxy, which I love because

488
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:14,930
if you had a group of terrible marksmen, why would you make them your,

489
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,270
I guess physical security.

490
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,439
It's, you know, the lowest bidder on the contract maybe.

491
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:23,339
I don't know, it, you'd think if you were overly bureaucratic, like the bogus.

492
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:25,969
Well, but think about, I mean, haven't you read about, like, those, you know,

493
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:28,270
these stories, like, I know locally there's been, you know,

494
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,660
there's a variety of officer involved shootings and like,

495
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,979
there's been cases where, you know,

496
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:33,844
they try gunfire with somebody and there's like, you know,

497
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:36,175
50 or 100 shots fired and they, like,

498
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:38,265
the guy's not critically injured.

499
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:39,935
Ok. So

500
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:44,574
-- that's a different problem.
-- So these things aren't as simple as, you know.

501
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:48,645
Well, no shooting at anything is surprisingly difficult to do,

502
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,594
especially in a very high pressure situation.

503
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:53,425
Actually, you and I were just talking about this before. The show is I shot,

504
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:54,135
I was,

505
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,010
we were talking about firearms and I, I shot competitively when I was younger.

506
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Like, I've shot like millions of rounds probably because I was like, I,

507
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,739
I was in AAA team that we would shoot 22 rifles at targets.

508
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,619
And like, I, I've got a box full of trophies actually, I was really good at it.

509
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:12,719
But, but anyway, the deal is though,

510
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,729
one of the things you have to learn to do is how to basically calm yourself.

511
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,079
So your heart's beating very slowly because obviously,

512
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:19,660
if your heartbeat you can't shoot.

513
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,560
And you got to think when you're in a situation like that where things are crazy,

514
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:24,920
your heart's going nuts.

515
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,219
You can't shoot straight

516
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:31,479
and honestly hitting a moving target is insanely difficult to do, even if you're,

517
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,260
like, fully prepared and rested.

518
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:37,000
Now, add in chaos. I get it right. I understand.

519
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,290
-- Well, and a target maybe even shooting back at you.
-- Well, that's true.

520
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,869
I, I've never been in that situation. Right. I've only ever shot a paper that c,

521
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,119
so anyway, I, I can, I can forget that. Right. But

522
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,739
anyway, anyway, Bogans are terrible. I love the part where Marvin shoots all the

523
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,099
Bogans with the prospective gun

524
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,189
and they all, like, start crying

525
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,319
on the ground.

526
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,900
The point of view gun, not the perspective gun

527
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:04,560
-- but the
-- point of view gun. That's it. Sorry, that, that's, that's something else.

528
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,410
And I was going to say we need the point of view gun.

529
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,050
Not so much because we need to make people see security,

530
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,010
-- but
-- we need to understand them.

531
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,609
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

532
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:13,170
Like,

533
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,250
seriously we need like normal people to shoot the

534
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,790
whole security industry with the point of view gun

535
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,979
so we can grasp their frustrations with us and what the actual problems are.

536
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,829
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I love that, that part. I actually did enjoy

537
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:27,410
and,

538
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,880
and I must say that Ellen Rickman doing Marvin's voice is

539
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,699
awesome because I love Alan Rickman and I love Marvin.

540
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:33,930
And

541
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,660
again,

542
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,359
uh, now that I, I feel that, that I keep bringing this up,

543
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:39,609
that the radio Marvin in the radio show is

544
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,410
unbelievably awesome.

545
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,839
He makes the radio show and, and in the movie, he was kind of minor. Honestly,

546
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,930
he put a reason big role.

547
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:50,020
I mean, without him, they, they wouldn't have gone anywhere.

548
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,640
I mean, he's a much better driver

549
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,589
remember in the escape plot

550
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,469
and with his hand and all that. But, um,

551
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,130
the other thing, uh, going back to that scene where, you know,

552
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,439
Marvin shoots all of the, uh, the Vogons

553
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,439
just before it, remember there was a group of

554
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,979
Vogons coming around the back. Uh

555
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,020
Ford Prefect charges them with his towel doing his little war cry.

556
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,989
And I mean,

557
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,089
and I think that's a really important point is like

558
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,060
you have to be able to actually identify real threats,

559
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:15,189
you know?

560
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:18,550
Not. Oh my God, what was it? Oh, yeah, he's got a towel run away.

561
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,829
Now, realistically speaking, if you actually read the books,

562
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,109
the towels can have some pretty significant powers, you know, like his,

563
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:26,670
for example,

564
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,079
has it soaked in micronutrients and it's got some

565
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:31,400
wires threaded into it for strength and some other,

566
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,260
you know, things and

567
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,719
you can apparently buy specialty towels with, you know, various other things.

568
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:37,939
So, you know, I think

569
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:38,609
that

570
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,729
the towel could be a realistic threat in that universe.

571
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:44,469
That's one thing I look at, you know, in our infosec is like

572
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:48,790
people, you know, a perfect example. Oh, here's a great example

573
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:50,650
tying back to passwords.

574
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,319
Uh Do you remember a few weeks ago or two weeks ago, somebody threatened to, like,

575
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:57,859
wipe a bajillion Apple accounts if they weren't paid a ransom.

576
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:01,010
And did you hear what the real deal on that is?

577
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,359
I did not.

578
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:07,989
So they have a password dump from like a bunch of other stuff of which some

579
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,619
are valid icloud accounts

580
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,939
because people use the same password everywhere. Oh, certainly.

581
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:15,880
Like if you've reused your password

582
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:19,319
and it's been dumped elsewhere, for sure. Yeah. So you can get into your icloud, like

583
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:20,209
from orbit,

584
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,000
assuming you don't have two fa enabled, which, you know,

585
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,280
Apple is becoming more and more aggressive about seriously,

586
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:30,390
you know, like I just set up a new ipad for my son and it, like, make, like,

587
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,500
I don't want to use two of a on it.

588
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,619
Right, because he's, you know, it would just be frustrating for him and, you know,

589
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,410
his kid's ipad, you know, and I had to make sure, you know,

590
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,569
that thing didn't get enabled and, you know, that's the thing.

591
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:43,670
And then the guy pointed out, you know, that Apple too has this list of accounts on a,

592
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,719
they're taking proactive measures,

593
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,329
you know,

594
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,469
maybe making people change their accounts or whatever.

595
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,719
But, yeah, I mean, and that's the thing that really gets me is, you know,

596
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:54,589
how often do we correctly identify the real threats?

597
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:54,949
You know,

598
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,709
just what always gets me about PC I compliance is every

599
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:00,560
time there's been a major data breach of credit card info.

600
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:03,859
They've always been at places that were PC I certified.

601
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:09,239
Yeah. I mean, that's everywhere with credit cards is generally certified.

602
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,670
It's,

603
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:12,380
it's complicated how it all works together and I

604
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,979
don't think it's a huge surprise to anyone that

605
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:18,069
PC I Compliance isn't a magic bullet.

606
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,750
Now, the one thing I would say though is

607
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,859
imagine what a lot of these organizations would look

608
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:26,050
like if they didn't have a PC I Auditor,

609
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,890
do they think they make certain changes?

610
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,339
It would be a total train wreck.

611
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,089
Well, like, back to that, what was it? The Dutch one, I want to say, did you

612
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,969
notar where they had, like, the viruses on their, you know, that certificate,

613
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:36,729
authority with the

614
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:39,089
workstation on the internet with viruses and stuff.

615
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,540
-- I mean,
-- how many, how many times have you heard about,

616
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,329
like flash drives or other gear that shipped with viruses on?

617
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,459
Because they're using literally someone's computer

618
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,689
to provision the software. It's crazy.

619
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:54,459
Well, yeah, the manufacturers, those, uh, digital, uh,

620
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,739
picture frames are shipped with the virus or

621
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:00,410
no, the phones now that are shipping the android phones that are shipping with, uh,

622
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,859
-- Trojan stuff, pre installed. Biwa
-- built in.

623
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,280
-- Yeah.
-- Like what? That was a couple of weeks ago and it's,

624
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,770
they still haven't pinpointed where in the supply chain that's happening. Which is

625
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,229
crazy to me. I mean,

626
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,239
I know it's terrifying.

627
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:17,359
I, I own one of the phone, the phone I have isn't on the list,

628
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:21,160
but it's part of that supply chain, which is horrifying to me.

629
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:22,869
You know what this reminds me of.

630
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,349
I don't remember if I've ever told this story before on the podcast and if I haven't,

631
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,599
I'm sure I'll tell it again.

632
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,469
Is

633
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,560
long ago

634
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,839
I worked tech support in I PE and when someone would need the installed discs,

635
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:36,560
we just literally made the disks off of the

636
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,910
local laptop that the tech support guys used.

637
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,660
And every now and then someone would call up and say, hey,

638
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,979
my virus program says you just have a virus.

639
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:46,839
We'd be like, oh yeah, that's a false positive. They have nothing to worry about.

640
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:47,160
Right?

641
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:48,939
And then one day I

642
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:50,280
was working on a Saturday,

643
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,300
it was a slow date and I thought I'm going to buy or scan

644
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,400
the computer here because I don't think we've done it in a long time.

645
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,939
And I wonder if the people calling are calling because there's really a virus

646
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:02,130
and there was really a virus.

647
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,689
And so we, we basically infected like everyone's computer.

648
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,229
And I remember I went to the boss and like, what do we do?

649
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,260
We, we've been, we've infected almost all of our customers.

650
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,390
-- We
-- clean it and we

651
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,900
bury it. The guy was like,

652
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,780
nothing, we're gonna do nothing.

653
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,810
Just don't talk about this. I don't want you to tell me about this.

654
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,760
-- If anyone calls and asks you send it to me, don't don't
-- worry about it.

655
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,750
I have to assume this is one of the reasons, you know,

656
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,109
a lot of I SPS now offer a security package which

657
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,500
is typically like a rebranded a V scanner from whoever,

658
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:30,819
you know.

659
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,660
Well, not specifically this but just in general, it's like,

660
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,900
-- you know, we tried, we offered something.
-- It's,

661
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,540
yeah, that's probably part of it.

662
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,329
But I mean, man, I just, I remember that it was, it was madness.

663
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,829
Anyway. Anyway, uh and that, that basically brings us to the end of the movie, right?

664
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:48,280
Is there any, any other points you want to hit on before we kind of sum this up here

665
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:52,640
a well back in the middle of the film, one of the scenes I most enjoyed

666
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:55,859
was the authentication scene between

667
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,040
Sao

668
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:57,229
and Ford.

669
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,959
Remember when he gets on the ship and he's like Ford is that you

670
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:04,819
-- the crazy handshake thing with the feet and the hands and
-- you know, yeah,

671
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:08,400
the whole little handshake, that little authentication dance they go through,

672
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,920
you know, with the heel clicks and everything.

673
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:13,760
I mean, the world has had secret handshakes for a long time. Is it a secret handshake?

674
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,790
I don't know. Is it a movie? Maybe whatever? But you, you have a valid point is

675
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,959
that that would not be unreasonable to have secret handshakes and whatnot in,

676
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:25,119
in an environment where you,

677
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,520
I, I guess had a lot of silly things going on.

678
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
So anyway, I enjoyed that.

679
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:33,319
So anyway, here's II, I wrote a little summary here for the very end is as,

680
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:36,959
as I'm sure anyone has figured out at this point that I'm not a huge fan of this movie,

681
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:40,000
but I love the story and I suspect a part of that is

682
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,680
a movie can't capture a lot of the nuance that a book can.

683
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,819
And the reason the radio show captures some of it

684
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:49,770
is because the radio show is like 23 hours long.

685
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:53,079
Well, it's like the original, the BBC TV series, right? Like it was,

686
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,520
-- right.
-- And that's really, that's like eight hours, right?

687
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:58,819
-- There was a lot of content and
-- that's true. And that's true.

688
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:00,099
And so anyway,

689
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,000
but the thing I kept thinking of as I was writing down my

690
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,630
notes and re evaluating what I saw and what was going on is

691
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,219
I, I feel like security has the same problem

692
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,859
where we have a book sized nuance

693
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,640
as to how things work together and how we explain everything,

694
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,609
-- but we only have the amount of time of a movie to explain
-- it.

695
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,530
-- Well, it keeps changing.
-- It does. And this is one of our struggles is

696
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:31,060
we can't distill a lifetime's worth of security knowledge

697
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:35,099
into a one hour class or a one page

698
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:38,209
like a little diagram or something like that. And

699
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,020
this is what I feel like is one of the challenges that, that we have to figure out.

700
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,410
And I'm not saying this is optional.

701
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:46,819
We have to figure out how to

702
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,180
tell people what they need to know how they need to know it.

703
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,500
And I feel like in the example of this movie

704
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,040
they failed

705
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,579
now, I think it might be impossible.

706
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:02,579
I don't know if I had to guess it's not, I think you just need someone who's capable

707
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,400
of telling the right story.

708
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,859
And, and additionally, Douglas Adams is not a screenwriter,

709
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,140
so he might be the reason

710
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,560
this wasn't very good Lord forbid. Right.

711
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:15,020
Well, you're also going up against, you know, the, the, the books just have.

712
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,060
It's like the, you know, it reminds me of Lord of the Rings.

713
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:21,420
But basically I think what it boils down to is apple pie. I knew this baker

714
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,510
who would not make apple pie

715
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:26,219
just wouldn't make it. He'd make Saskatoon pie, he'd make peach pie.

716
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:28,739
-- He'd make all the other pies.
-- Saskatoon pie,

717
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:30,050
Saskatoon berries.

718
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,770
You just gave me the technically correct answer.

719
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

720
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,760
It's, it's much better than a blueberry anyways Google

721
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,430
Saskatoon berries.

722
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:45,030
But the point is he would not make apple pie under any circumstances.

723
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,609
The reason being is everybody was like this isn't as good

724
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:49,930
as my mom's apple pie and then bitch about it.

725
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:50,979
So he's like, you know what?

726
00:30:50,989 --> 00:30:53,560
No, I'm just, I'm not competing with your childhood memories

727
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:55,180
-- and he's
-- not wrong.

728
00:30:55,189 --> 00:31:00,540
This is a huge problem people have is they remember what they want to from the past

729
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,270
-- and even security people do this and
-- even if it's corrected,

730
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,329
it might not be corrected.

731
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:06,500
You know, this whole thing of like, oh,

732
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,780
you know, don't let the Attackers into your network.

733
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,420
Well, yeah, now we have this thing called platform as a service

734
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,849
and we're going to sell them access for four cents an hour. It's true. Right.

735
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,109
You know, it's, it's,

736
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,380
I like almost everything I've written at the meta level

737
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,930
in the Linux Administrative Security Guide 20 some years ago

738
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:27,099
is now wrong. Like it's literally now the business case is no. Do exactly that.

739
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:27,709
Like, yeah,

740
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,270
let people install the software they want and run it as route if they want.

741
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,020
Like, who cares that they're paying us? Sure.

742
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:36,540
Yeah. You know, let them have access to hardware.

743
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,849
I remember Google talking about PC fuzzing because it's like, well, wait, you know,

744
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:43,339
we're selling access to GPUS and somebody might hack one of those Gpus and

745
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:45,989
then use that GP U to attack the rest of the hardware system.

746
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,130
Yes and no, I mean, they're,

747
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,569
they're overly altruistic compared to most or maybe they're not altruistic,

748
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:52,650
they just have different problems.

749
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,010
But you get the idea.

750
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,689
I looked up these Saskatoon berries and they don't grow anywhere near me,

751
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:59,630
which is probably why I've never heard of them before.

752
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,619
It's only a Canadian thing as far as I know. And it's very seasonal.

753
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,729
It does swoop down into portions of the US.

754
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:05,979
But,

755
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:08,130
but for the most part it looks like it's kind

756
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,010
of to the northwestern ish region of North America.

757
00:32:11,689 --> 00:32:13,920
Yeah. It's like Alaska gets them too lucky. Alaska.

758
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,160
We've been, we've been going out and out about this movie for quite some time.

759
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,180
Uh, fundamentally

760
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:20,150
it's,

761
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:21,280
I won't complain.

762
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,839
I don't feel like I wasted an hour and a half of my life re-watching this

763
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:27,219
to take notes and talk about a security

764
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:29,219
episode based on Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

765
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:29,979
But I didn't lie.

766
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,420
I probably would have had more fun with the book,

767
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,660
but it would have also been a 6.5 hour long podcast episode.

768
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:36,579
So there's that

769
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,979
of it as well. I mean, you figure we're over an hour now.

770
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:41,280
Well, it's like the Lord of the Rings, right?

771
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,819
You know, it's just, it's a big book and the movies, you know,

772
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:48,500
-- I don't,
-- I could, I could go on about that one too, but other security themes today,

773
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,469
there's probably some, I don't think there's a ton.

774
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:52,469
-- Oh, there's tons.
-- It's complicated.

775
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,020
-- No, we're not doing this.
-- Is that your new go to? I think that's your new go to.

776
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,390
It's a very easy way to stop a conversation. It's complicated

777
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,449
and people generally are willing to accept that as an answer I found.

778
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,569
And so it's kind of one of those, uh magic weapons, right where,

779
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:09,969
where it's, it's, it's not unlike again, we,

780
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:13,290
we talked about navigating bureaucracy or navigating people,

781
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,729
you can tell them it's complicated and more often than not,

782
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:16,890
they'll accept that as an answer.

783
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,609
So

784
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,500
there we go. There we go, everybody. It's complicated.

785
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:22,890
All right, folks, thank you so much for listening.

786
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,199
You can go to open source security podcast.com

787
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,239
and see

788
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,709
there will be no links for this show

789
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:32,069
because it's just about the movie.

790
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,060
But you can look at past episodes, for example.

791
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:38,349
And at the show, links on that, we will have links over to Twitter and Facebook

792
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,359
where you can connect with Kurt and I

793
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:42,040
and send us various notes.

794
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,319
I'm sure many of you will have opinions about this episode.

795
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:47,760
Please let us know, especially Kurt.

796
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,589
He loves feedback and you can yell at him all you want

797
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,800
and we will probably respond

798
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,689
and I guess nothing else. Thank you so much for listening.

799
00:33:55,819 --> 00:34:00,800
-- Until next time folks take care and Kurt, you have a fantastic day. You
-- too.
