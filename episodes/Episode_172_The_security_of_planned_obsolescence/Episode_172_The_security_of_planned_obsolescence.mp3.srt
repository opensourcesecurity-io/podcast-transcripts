Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 172

1
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:12,619
with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,850
So, what's new Kurt?

3
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,170
-- Well,
-- reduce, reuse, recycle,

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,969
what are you reducing, reusing or recycling?

5
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:23,170
So, in classic terms, if you want to, you know, be a bit kinder to the environment,

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,090
number one strategy reduce, you know, like,

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,870
don't drive your car as much or maybe don't buy that, you know,

8
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,370
Hummer number three or whatever and then

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,180
use, you know, which in, in electronic terms is classic, right?

10
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:34,729
There's like, like, because let's face it right.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,709
There's a lot of like five and 10 year

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,979
old computers out there that can still do something useful

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,180
for somebody if somebody that needs to browse the web

14
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:43,490
or whatever sort of or more to the point,

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,740
people that have old hardware that wants to talk to other

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,590
old hardware and they don't want to replace the whole system.

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,950
And so what Intel has done has been to remove a

18
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,819
whole pile of old software drivers off of their website.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,799
Yeah, I read that, that,

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,310
that's kind of a nutty story to be perfectly honest.

21
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:05,309
Well, I mean, I get it because from a support point of view, it just,

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,069
it's increased support costs, not just in hosting it and providing it, but in,

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,279
you know,

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,980
keeping it curated and also dealing

25
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,010
with people who maybe accidentally download the

26
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:17,110
old drivers instead of the new drivers or vice versa or whatever.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,519
But I suspect it's kind of more weasley in the sense of, you know,

28
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:23,959
if you can look at the old drivers for the old hardware, you can't use it.

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,440
Right. Right. And

30
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,300
we should probably clarify a bunch of this is. So

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,989
generally speaking, when you're using not open source operating systems,

32
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:38,559
you need drivers to make your stuff work.

33
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:41,940
And if you've ever used windows, which luckily I don't very often,

34
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:43,940
but you basically plug anything in.

35
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,889
And the first thing it will say is,

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,919
you know, we need to find your drivers and windows will look for certain drivers.

37
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,379
-- If you're lucky, you get that.
-- Right. Well, that is true.

38
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,860
Half the time it doesn't even recognize the hardware and you

39
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,300
got to give it the driver and then it's like,

40
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:57,720
00, what's that over there?

41
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,080
That is true. That is a very good point. And so

42
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:01,940
Intel

43
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,650
has historically and really every hardware manufacturer

44
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,169
that I can think of

45
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,320
-- has generally published drivers.
-- Well, the good ones, the legitimate ones.

46
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,550
Ok, that's fair.

47
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,830
But they generally publish drivers on the internet

48
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,210
and then you can go back later and download

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,240
some, like 15 year old driver for like the Scuzzy card you bought off ebay, whatever.

50
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,050
-- And then it basically works.
-- I've actually literally done that.

51
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,389
I've literally done that. I had some Scuzzy cards

52
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,339
that were like, it was like, it used an IBM chip set,

53
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,050
but it was on like a definitely not an IBM board because it was like under 200 bucks

54
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:37,059
and you could, like, flash them

55
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:40,250
into some L SI or something mode and get free

56
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,820
Nas to work with it with AJ, bought just a bunch of disks.

57
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,869
The longer the short of it is, is you could get crazy,

58
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,889
insanely high performance out of this $200 Scuzzy card with, uh, not scuzzy but sa a

59
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,619
controller card with like eight drives for like 200 bucks which, and you know,

60
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,100
your next

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,479
option is like 500 bucks,

62
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:55,979
right?

63
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,899
But anyways, yeah.

64
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,789
And so I guess part of the I'm going to make air quotes here.

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,589
The excuse is that these are mostly drivers for older

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,720
versions of Windows that are now end of life,

67
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,259
like Windows 98 Mexp

68
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,839
and older versions of Windows server like NT

69
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,710
and hm. Yeah, I kind of get it.

70
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,300
They are technically end of life and people shouldn't be using them.

71
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:17,250
-- But the reality is people are,
-- they sadly are.

72
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:20,259
And what's going to happen is people are going to type

73
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:25,059
the piece of hardware they need into Google with the word driver after it.

74
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,899
And they're going to end up on not

75
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,660
viruses.com

76
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,059
and they're going to end up mining Bitcoin.

77
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,339
Didn't you have a relative that ended up doing that for like a printer driver?

78
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,880
And that wasn't even like an out of date thing.

79
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,699
It was like, um, up to date, like they typed in what? Canon? Printer Driver X

80
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,460
-- and ended up in Russia somewhere or something. That,
-- that was my father And it took me

81
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,179
a long time to clean that mess up.

82
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,520
And actually he tried to buy a laptop last week and I made him

83
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:55,660
buy a chromebook because I basically said you can't screw this thing up,

84
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,899
you're going to buy it.

85
00:03:57,309 --> 00:04:01,179
And we'll see, I have full confidence in his ability to break it,

86
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,500
-- but we're going to find out some
-- people have to touch.

87
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:05,979
He's one of them.

88
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:06,779
Yes.

89
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,139
Again, like II,

90
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:13,929
I actually know of places that still have like Windows 98 and me in production.

91
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,880
And it's actually not that bad because it's actually not connected to any network.

92
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,480
Like I don't even mean an intranet. Like it's just not connected to any network.

93
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:25,109
Like a great example, being a friend of mine had a $60,000 cell counting machine.

94
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:27,579
Like you literally put a Petri dish in this machine

95
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,000
and it counts the number of growth

96
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:30,950
in the Petri dish

97
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,220
and it talks arc net to a Windows 95 box.

98
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,839
And the option is they can replace it for like 100 grand or

99
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,040
there's still a place,

100
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,600
there's still actually a couple of places that make Arc Net cards,

101
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:46,200
like ISA Arc Net cards

102
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,989
because their Arc Net card died. And they're like, what do we do?

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,109
And I'm like, you buy a new cell counter and they're like, it's 100 grand.

104
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:54,779
I'm like, tap, tap, tap. Hey, there's these guys in Germany, Austria, Australia.

105
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,959
There's actually a couple of companies that are like, you know,

106
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,950
for four or 500 bucks, here's an Arc net card that is isa

107
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,820
with windows 95 drivers.

108
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:02,160
-- And I'm
-- like,

109
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,890
or you just go on ebay and buy a lot of 200 Arc net cards someone's selling for.

110
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,119
-- Yeah, exactly. And hopefully one of them works
-- $7 plus $54 in shipping.

111
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:14,049
But

112
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,100
funny story,

113
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,739
you buy those cards on ebay and you may or

114
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,540
-- may not get drivers and
-- that's a good point that,

115
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:20,739
that's different now.

116
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:21,779
So

117
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,059
you're not wrong.

118
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,739
-- This is this problem is a mess.
-- See, this is why now I obsessively download and keep

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,959
all the drivers and software that I install

120
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,859
on my machines because I've been bitten by this

121
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,540
before where I've literally had or I've had

122
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:37,420
the case where they have the modern drivers.

123
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:38,679
But for example,

124
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,250
I need like an earlier driver to get it bootstrap

125
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,709
like to literally to get like windows to install.

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,839
I need like an earlier driver to get windows installed onto the hardware

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,489
and then I can upgrade the driver.

128
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,549
I don't have windows 10, I have windows seven, right.

129
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,200
-- Windows, seven upgrades to Windows 10, that
-- end of life

130
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,839
-- in January. Like you got to get rid of that.
-- Yeah.

131
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,519
And you get a free upgrade to Windows 10,

132
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,670
which I did.

133
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,709
But the problem is I can't install windows seven on my modern living room machine.

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,850
I had to go through some horrific process to get it installed on that machine.

135
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:06,420
You know, with some

136
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,359
futzing around with drivers and stuff to get the, you know,

137
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,480
the hard drive recognized, you know, but once it's on and upgraded to Windows 10,

138
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:11,950
it's fine.

139
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,890
You know, that's the other thing. Just, there's that video of that guy upgrading.

140
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:17,540
What is it D OS one point? Oh, all the way up to uh Windows.

141
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:20,720
I think he starts at Windows 1.01

142
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,309
point upgrading it and it worked,

143
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:26,809
-- which was pretty cool.
-- It even kept most of the settings. So

144
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,209
there's,

145
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,290
yeah, I'm not going to give you tech support on the show.

146
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:34,570
But there, there's, there's things you can do to avoid this particular process.

147
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,600
But I mean, fundamentally last time I ran into something like this,

148
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:41,260
I just basically paid Microsoft for a new copy of Windows because it was cheaper

149
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:45,209
than whatever I was going to have to do to make it all work.

150
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,149
So anyway, the point of this

151
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,890
bizarre tangent

152
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,500
is the concept of planned obsolescence,

153
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,369
which is something Kurt and I talk about a lot.

154
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,579
I know we've talked about it on the show in the past a little bit,

155
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,640
but it's something I've been thinking about all weekend

156
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,920
long since you mentioned last week we should discuss.

157
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,660
This is basically,

158
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:06,260
is it ok to murder old things,

159
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:10,640
especially most likely in technology? Because let's face it.

160
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,579
My, my toaster, generally speaking, isn't going to become obsolete, for example.

161
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,959
Whereas the computer I have in the basement

162
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,149
there is a very high chance it won't work.

163
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,679
In fact, I used to have some X 86 machines, not X 8664.

164
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,799
And it reached a point where just literally running

165
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:30,040
anything on them had become so much work.

166
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,894
I was like, screw it and I got rid of them.

167
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:33,065
Well, on the flip side,

168
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:35,894
my mother has a 2011 laptop on Maca works

169
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:38,635
perfectly fine and it won't upgrade to Catalina,

170
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:40,265
you know, Mac Os 10.15.

171
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:44,084
Whereas my dad's newer desktop will. And so, I mean, no offense, but

172
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:47,214
that laptop will continue to do what my mother needs it for

173
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:49,815
for easily 10 or 20 more years if the hardware doesn't break.

174
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:54,894
-- But
-- here's the thing. So I, I get this and I'm, I think I'm ok with it.

175
00:07:55,355 --> 00:08:00,644
I, I see there's two sides to this argument. There's the, you could say

176
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,899
Apple should support something forever, which I think is ridiculous.

177
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,890
Because, well, not necessarily forever,

178
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,720
but maybe we say some relatively long time frame.

179
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:10,750
Uh

180
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,059
Well, like your toaster, like, say 10 years,

181
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,519
I mean, because for example,

182
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,070
those smart TV s that come out and then get

183
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,880
like six months of support and then they're garbage.

184
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,200
You know, I will never buy a smart TV.

185
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:22,230
Uh You don't have a choice anymore.

186
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:25,869
If you're buying a TV, it's gonna have garbage on it. Actually. So funny story.

187
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,269
I, I recently bought a Samsung TV

188
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,309
and I bring it home and the first thing I did was I hooked

189
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,859
it up to the internet and I downloaded the update for it and it took

190
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:39,400
like three hours to update this stupid TV. I was, I couldn't believe it.

191
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:39,989
It was ridiculous.

192
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:40,864
Slow,

193
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:44,784
it updated itself and then I deleted all of its internet connections and it will

194
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:48,825
never ever talk to the internet again because I don't trust any of these people.

195
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:50,195
-- That's
-- basically my plan.

196
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:50,895
Right.

197
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,515
And there's, there's a youtube video,

198
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,085
I'll put in the show notes where this guy basically,

199
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:59,474
he, he put like a raspberry pie between his TV and the internet

200
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,409
and then he basically just like ran TCP dump on the raspberry pi and it is

201
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,700
-- bananas.
-- What he found. That's how they keep their costs down. Right.

202
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,179
-- Is, is through all this advertising and selling your personal data.
-- Right.

203
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,859
-- Exactly. Which is super annoying.
-- It's, it works for web browsers. It works for TV.

204
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,400
S, yeah, why not? And people think they're neat.

205
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,989
So, anyway, anyway,

206
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,530
ok.

207
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,070
So you're saying a computer manufacturer should

208
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,229
maintain their computers for 10 years?

209
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:26,390
Well, I, I don't know,

210
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,299
specifically 10 years because I think it should also vary because for example,

211
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:32,309
if I'm buying like an industrial piece of hardware that's like,

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,650
literally going into an industrial plant.

213
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,590
You know, I'm probably going to expect that to work for 20 or 30 years. And

214
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,260
conversely, I'm probably going to be willing to pay a bit more for it.

215
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,090
You know, if this thing is controlling my nuclear reactor or whatever.

216
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,979
What about, you know, computers and cars, right.

217
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,750
All the computer systems I've seen in cars

218
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,380
are garbage because they're immediately out of date

219
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,280
and like five years later they look absolutely

220
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,409
-- stone age
-- doesn't even take five years.

221
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:57,409
-- They usually look stone age by the time the car hits the show floor.
-- Yeah.

222
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:00,770
So I, I think part of it would be transparency of, you know,

223
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,760
how long will this device be supported for?

224
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,330
But I think in here the problem isn't,

225
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,479
it's not that Intel is having to support it or not.

226
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,330
They're doing something intentionally that

227
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,299
they don't have to like,

228
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:14,400
it's not like we're asking them to write new drivers for windows 10,

229
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:18,789
-- we're asking them not to throw out all the old stuff.
-- I do agree with that.

230
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,390
I think removing old drivers is super dodgy and I'm not a fan of that.

231
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,179
But I think that conversation is also slightly different from the conversation

232
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,270
of planned obsolescence because here is the example I will give you.

233
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:34,309
So

234
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:35,549
I buy a car.

235
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:38,179
I have a warranty period on my car

236
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,570
where after

237
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,109
three years or five years or 10 years or whatever,

238
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:46,630
I basically can't get it fixed for free depending upon what breaks.

239
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,309
And there's all kinds of, you know,

240
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,210
various legal ease around what does and doesn't count for the warranties.

241
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:55,510
And then after that, basically it's my problem to get it fixed.

242
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,260
And I can either, sometimes you could go to the dealership and they might fix it.

243
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,750
You might have to go to a mechanic.

244
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,466
But I bet you if you rolled in to a dealership with, let's say a car from the sixties,

245
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:10,395
they're going to say no way, get that thing out of here. We're not fixing it.

246
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:10,945
You know what?

247
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:14,955
I, I bet they would happily charge you whatever hourly rate they charge to fix it.

248
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:18,866
Actually, they might, they might charge you an astronomical.

249
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,015
I mean, getting parts might be a problem. But

250
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,825
the thing is, there's, there's no artificial

251
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,952
holding them back. They just have to find the parts.

252
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,581
There's no software, for example, that the right to repair with the tractors,

253
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:28,752
right?

254
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:30,632
All those farmers with those John Deere tractors

255
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:31,702
where they're like,

256
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:35,072
I just need to like diagnostically know which module to replace.

257
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:39,421
But because I'm not, you know, I don't, I'm not a John Deere tractor repair,

258
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:39,911
whatever.

259
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:42,312
I don't have the laptop that has the software that'll tell me, you know,

260
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:45,791
like your blank module or this part is worn out or whatever

261
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:48,580
and you need to, uh, you know, swap that out.

262
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:53,340
And so there's all that dodgy Russian software now, some other Middle Eastern or

263
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:54,859
European country

264
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:55,570
that

265
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:55,799
was the

266
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:56,609
most

267
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:57,039
comes

268
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:57,460
from.

269
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:58,440
Yeah,

270
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,489
I, I get, like, on the one hand,

271
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,909
I don't want the world to be full of really terrible old it gear,

272
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,750
especially if it's

273
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,900
to the internet too late.

274
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:13,039
But on the flip side, I mean, I remember staying at a hotel and it was in 1999

275
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,500
and the topic of their phone system came up and I'm like, oh, yeah.

276
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,909
Have you guys, you know, y2k, blah, blah, blah. Your phone

277
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:19,640
is like, no,

278
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,890
I'm like, oh, you know, you do know if it's going to work and I like, it's electro

279
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,000
mechanical. We're fine.

280
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,960
I'm like, yeah, you know what? Fair enough. You're not wrong.

281
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,739
I mean, it, because, you know,

282
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,919
it didn't have a lot of features like it didn't support voicemail or anything but,

283
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:34,049
you know,

284
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,650
-- it routed calls and
-- there's no bigger pet peeve of mine than when I go to my

285
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:41,979
hotel room and there's a red light blinking on the phone and it says you have a message

286
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,599
and I think I don't care.

287
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,979
I don't want the message and then I think I'm gonna listen

288
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:49,760
to this because it's gonna drive me insane just watching the light

289
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,489
and then it's always something stupid like an ad or they tell me, oh, you know,

290
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,489
you get to check out on Friday and it's like I know, shut up, leave me alone.

291
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,890
But whatever,

292
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:03,469
I've never understood the whole voicemail and phones in hotels,

293
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,690
-- especially now that we all have cell phones,
-- right?

294
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,489
Voicemail on all phones is terrible.

295
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,289
People who call me know there is zero purpose in

296
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,849
leaving me a voicemail because I'm not listening to it.

297
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:15,320
Yeah, just no,

298
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,429
-- but back to the planned
-- obsolescence. I mean,

299
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,130
planned obsolescence is one thing.

300
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,340
This is taking away a capability that existed and let's face it.

301
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:25,909
It's not like it costs until a lot of money to host these old files. Right.

302
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,950
-- This isn't costing them millions of dollars a year
-- maybe.

303
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,349
I mean, that, that's conjecture on our part.

304
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:36,549
We, we really don't know if they do or don't cost them any money to host,

305
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,030
but

306
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,760
you could make the argument in many different directions

307
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,989
that they should or shouldn't make them available.

308
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,630
But I think fundamentally removing these drivers is a,

309
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,320
probably a net negative for the universe.

310
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,119
Well, it's, I mean,

311
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,380
it's going to take something that previously is

312
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,830
kind of annoying and painful of like,

313
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:52,849
oh,

314
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,849
I've got to resurrect this windows 95 box

315
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,679
attached to some weird old hardware or whatever,

316
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,010
you know.

317
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,760
And ok, I I go to the, you know, the intel site,

318
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:01,750
download it, get it on a USB stick. Ok.

319
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,830
Get it on a slow enough USB stick that the Windows 95 machines.

320
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,369
USB one will actually talk to,

321
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,320
you know, all that kind of craziness.

322
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,770
But, you know, fundamentally you can get the driver, download it,

323
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,280
install it and you're on your way

324
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:13,530
now.

325
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,799
Yeah, you're going what?

326
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:15,369
You're gonna like,

327
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,219
look around dodgy websites and hopefully you're smart enough to remember

328
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:21,530
to send that file to virus total before you install it.

329
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:22,489
So here

330
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,450
is

331
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,460
my thinking on this matter,

332
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,909
this is new territory for us as a society,

333
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,940
we've historically not had this problem. We've had things

334
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,820
that you could say are end of life to where maybe the company goes out of business

335
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,390
or they just say we're not helping you with this product anymore.

336
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,630
I mean, like a great example is I have,

337
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,260
I have a lot of old video game systems in my basement,

338
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,830
right? Like it will pick on the Nes, the Nintendo entertainment system.

339
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,000
I literally have the Nintendo entertainment system I got in 19,

340
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,440
probably 8586 long time ago.

341
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,130
And Nintendo actually quite recently,

342
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,250
bizarrely enough said we're not fixing these anymore.

343
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,590
We're up until just a couple of years ago. I could have literally

344
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,849
mailed the unit into Nintendo and I'm sure

345
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:08,390
they would have charged me an astronomical fee.

346
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,950
See, and I would say that's a great example of a company doing the right thing. And

347
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:15,809
because I had one of those as a kid and I'm trying to think when they came up.

348
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,630
So that's at least 20 years of support right there.

349
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,710
I think that's for a consumer device. That is entirely reasonable.

350
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:25,950
I mean. Right. But I, I guarantee not every company works like that.

351
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,919
I mean, Nintendo is kind of special in a lot of ways, but I'm just gonna,

352
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,719
they're magic.

353
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:35,330
They are, they're, they're like, if, if Apple was awesome, they would be Nintendo.

354
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,630
-- So
-- anyway,

355
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,510
Apple with Nintendo build quality, that would be amazing.

356
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,849
Anyway, so

357
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,669
I don't think it's unreasonable for Nintendo to tell me we're not fixing your Nes.

358
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,559
And I don't think it would have been unreasonable

359
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,500
for them to tell me this in the nineties

360
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,609
because

361
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,710
that's ok.

362
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,690
But now we have this universe where we have these computers and

363
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,440
we have these devices that are a marriage between hardware and software

364
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,690
and sometimes services. Let's not even cross that bridge on this episode.

365
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,880
That's true. And yeah, I mean, that's a whole another story. Absolutely.

366
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,716
But if we just look at the hardware software perspective,

367
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:15,796
you could easily make an argument that like,

368
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:19,346
I have a 386 computer in my garage that I'm going to do some projects on.

369
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:21,995
I, I fished it out of a trash heap one day

370
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:27,085
and I was thinking it would be fun to have and the computer itself has no value. Right.

371
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:30,666
-- I need an operating system on that computer.
-- You say that? But I,

372
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,195
I'm guessing there's somebody out there that probably wouldn't mind having

373
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:37,851
386 in their spares pile to drive some industrial machinery,

374
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:40,101
-- but
-- they still need an operating system.

375
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:40,781
Right.

376
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:43,111
Well, they would hopefully have a backup of the one they're using. Right.

377
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:45,581
-- But
-- that's my point. Right. This machine

378
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,461
has no intrinsic value by itself.

379
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:52,702
Its value is derived from the software running on top of the hardware.

380
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,781
And that's a relationship we've never had before

381
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,892
as a society and we don't know what to do.

382
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,940
And you have two camps.

383
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,419
Basically,

384
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:05,290
you've got the one camp that says we shouldn't have all this planned obsolescence.

385
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,579
We need a way to keep this stuff alive and they'll say,

386
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,900
right to repair and running open source and whatever.

387
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,500
And that's,

388
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:11,280
that's awesome.

389
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,858
Now, I will say, I bet running Linux on a 386 today is probably not going to happen.

390
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,930
-- Uh
-- Depends. There's uh there are lightweight Linuxes for that stuff.

391
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,435
-- Actually,
-- this is, this is a project right here. Can I run Linux

392
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:25,733
on a 386? Actually, it might even be a 46. I don't know what it is.

393
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:28,954
It's old though, right? Can I run Linux on it? I don't know.

394
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:31,064
This is a project, I think.

395
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:33,755
Well, and by Linux, do you mean a modern Linux or are you going to go

396
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:35,875
Susan? You can go download Slackware 1.8

397
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:38,135
but that's no different, right.

398
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:43,234
Downloading the old version of Slackware I don't think is any different

399
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,260
then.

400
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,640
The, the problem with planned obsolescence of the old software I'm saying.

401
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,180
No, no, I want to see old hardware running new software. Right.

402
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:53,699
Because that's actually the,

403
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:57,160
the ideal situation here. I hear you typing in the background.

404
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,209
You're looking it up, aren't you?

405
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,859
Oh, there's, uh, you've actually got about a dozen choices.

406
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,989
What, man, I was hoping it'd be hard.

407
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:06,930
You know.

408
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:10,750
You know what the hardest part is gonna be is writing a freaking floppy disk.

409
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,050
Like I don't even know how I do that anymore.

410
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,770
Anyway. Anyway,

411
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,790
DD isn't the problem. I don't have floppies or a floppy drive.

412
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,040
Like I have no way to write a floppy.

413
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,310
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

414
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,689
I have no freaking

415
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,229
idea.

416
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,390
Anyway. Anyway,

417
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:31,489
actually, you can buy

418
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,150
-- like these uh floppy disks to USB converter
-- D

419
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,839
US missile command or whatever, end up using those.

420
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,869
Maybe where I can plug in like a USB drive and

421
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,930
it will make it look like a floppy disk to the,

422
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,560
but whatever, I'm, I'm off on if it's our tangent.

423
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,810
So you've got the perspective of people saying

424
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:50,290
like we should be able to keep this stuff alive forever.

425
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,130
And then you also have people that say, screw it, let it die, whatever.

426
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:54,890
And

427
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:01,589
I'm not going to say II, I see arguments on both sides of this. Right. I can understand

428
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,150
saying we should be able to use our hardware for a very long time because,

429
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,079
yeah, I mean, I have gear that there's nothing wrong with. I have a what?

430
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:12,709
Like 30 some year old Nintendo system in my basement that it works.

431
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,819
There's nothing wrong with it.

432
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,390
And

433
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,849
I mean, luckily there's no operating system on it.

434
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,829
A better example might be, I have a Nintendo switch

435
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,150
and someday there will be no support for that thing.

436
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,099
And so will I even be able to play some of the games I have on it

437
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,540
because a lot of them like to phone home and do things like that. Right?

438
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:34,780
-- I don't know. I don't know the answer. I lied
-- to you actually remember.

439
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,250
Well, I don't remember because I didn't care. Linux,

440
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,089
the Linux kernel dropped 386 support in like 2012.

441
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:43,680
So 46 and up only.

442
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,189
So you'd have to run some old version of Linux on it.

443
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:46,829
Ok?

444
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,229
But the point is there, if enough people cared,

445
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,819
it would still be there because people would take care of it.

446
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:54,540
But obviously people just don't.

447
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:59,750
And so there's always going to be some aging out of a lot of this old gear and that,

448
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,109
that is ok

449
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,739
in one way. Now, now I'm going to make it even more confusing for you.

450
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,310
So let's let's put this in the context of the electrical system

451
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:08,859
a

452
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,189
long time ago people had fuses in their houses

453
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:14,089
which were these little things you'd screw in.

454
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,729
Right.

455
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,930
-- Little piece of metal that would melt if it got too hot,
-- essentially. Right. Right.

456
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:20,880
And now we have breaker boxes.

457
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,530
Can you still have a fuse box? Like, is that even acceptable?

458
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,180
Yeah, I, the last place I lived had a bulldog breakers.

459
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:32,250
And, um, you can still, uh, the yacht industry still uses them

460
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:34,189
quite a lot. So you can actually still buy them.

461
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:35,859
Like, I can't buy them from Home Depot,

462
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,829
but I'm pretty sure ecall, uh,

463
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,520
that's like the major electrical supply place locally.

464
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,949
You know, they got like a warehouse full of fiber optics to everything.

465
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,579
Yeah. No, you can still buy those b,

466
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,560
like the, the fuses, the round fuses that you, like, screw in.

467
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,510
Interesting.

468
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,979
Yeah, like I said, like ships and stuff.

469
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,099
There's still a lot of industrial applications to use them.

470
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:55,510
I mean, well, look at car fuses, right?

471
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,439
Car fuses are still like a little two cent piece of metal

472
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,489
-- encased in plastic that you can see if it popped or not.
-- Yeah.

473
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,439
No, no, there's nothing wrong with fuses.

474
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:06,010
I'm just saying in a residential application

475
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,069
-- having fuses, dude,
-- you had knob and tube

476
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:09,550
wiring.

477
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,520
I know it was terrifying and I got it replaced

478
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,479
right away because I know how dangerous it is.

479
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,829
Yeah. And you can't, like, you can't,

480
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,359
I mean, if you, if you,

481
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:19,780
I actually kind of want to see what would happen if

482
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,410
you proposed building something new with that knob and tube wire.

483
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,010
You can't,

484
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,550
there's, there's electrical codes that say you can't.

485
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:26,709
And in fact,

486
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:32,430
it would not surprise me if you can't actually sell a house that has a fuse box in it.

487
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:35,369
Uh, you can sell it, but I'm pretty sure, like, you know,

488
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,099
if you ever got to get worked on, on it there, I think what it really boils down to is if,

489
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:42,119
you know, if like Home Depot or whatever doesn't stock it as normal, it's probably,

490
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,239
then it's too old for residential applications and you need to

491
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,089
replace it with stuff you can pick up at Home Depot,

492
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:50,310
-- which would mean a modern fuse box.
-- Here's my point of this.

493
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,920
They, they're called breaker boxes now, but here's my, here's my point is

494
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,229
when you have certain technologies they can become dangerous

495
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,589
and electrical is an easy one.

496
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,979
Gas is an easy one where there's lots of old gas equipment

497
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,150
that obviously you,

498
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,479
you're not supposed to have hooked up because it will either kill

499
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:11,260
you from carbon monoxide or it'll start a fire or whatever.

500
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,189
And

501
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,589
these things have real human safety concerns. So I understand it.

502
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,469
It's easy to say my house is full of knob and tube. Holy crap. Get that out now.

503
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,349
Whereas you could come back one day and be like this house is full of cat five.

504
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,390
Well, that sucks. Right.

505
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,819
Like who cares it's not, I don't dive full of Cat five which, uh,

506
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:29,959
plenum

507
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:31,030
rated versus non plenum

508
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:32,500
-- rated cable,
-- right? Ok.

509
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,630
Yes. Ok. I knew you were going to say that.

510
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,989
Well, it's funny because I actually just bought,

511
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:41,555
I bought some new category six cable and I decided what the heck YOLO.

512
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:44,334
I bought the cheapest 250 ft I could find on Amazon

513
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,145
and I'm going to put an end on, I'm just going to crimp a connector on each end and like,

514
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:50,094
you know, run some speed test stuff over it.

515
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,015
See what happens. But

516
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:53,954
I'm guessing even the cheapest category six cable

517
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:55,974
now will be totally fine for residential use.

518
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:59,375
So actually I was doing some research because I ended up,

519
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:04,474
I had to run a cable across my basement and no, you can still buy wire without plenum.

520
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:05,175
And,

521
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:07,775
but at the same time if it's one strand of wire,

522
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:09,900
you're, you're going to be ok.

523
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:10,099
Yeah.

524
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,810
No, it's when you have the rat's nest. That's right.

525
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,439
When you have, you know, thousands of cables, then the plenum is important.

526
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:19,979
-- So you don't die of asphyxiation if it lights on fire.
-- So yeah, to clear it. So plenum

527
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:24,209
rated cable, the plenum is the space above the hung false ceiling where the air,

528
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:25,869
you know, hotter, colder, whatever mixes.

529
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:26,685
And so Gle

530
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,594
rated cable doesn't give off toxic gas,

531
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:31,645
it just gives off the regular going to kill you slowly kind of gas not the,

532
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:33,665
I'm gonna kill you right away kind of gas.

533
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:37,895
And so, yeah, if you have an office fire with like traditional old cable, like, yeah,

534
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,594
that gas will kill you inside of a minute.

535
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,165
Right. Right. Right. Exactly.

536
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:42,405
So, so anyway,

537
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:44,974
man, we, we can help but the tangents today.

538
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,685
So anyway, the point is

539
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,550
computers are one of those things that generally

540
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,239
speaking don't have health and safety concerns,

541
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,800
I would say in general, in the past,

542
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,300
they didn't have these health and safety concerns.

543
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,920
But that has changed now, especially with the internet things and especially with

544
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,540
like computers on wheels, you know, self driving cars

545
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:05,979
or cars that have

546
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,569
computers that have a very strong component where

547
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,079
they can affect the steering and whatnot.

548
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,699
And, and I think that the,

549
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,375
the point is though kind of my long,

550
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:17,334
bizarre monologue I've had here for longer than I can remember now

551
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:21,314
is just the fact that we've historically not really had this problem,

552
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:25,895
especially not in technology and just generally speaking, not with any things

553
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:26,854
in general.

554
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:32,175
And so now this is a problem, we have to understand and we have to decide what it means.

555
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:32,814
And

556
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:36,375
I, to be honest, I have a strong suspicion

557
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,359
that

558
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,660
the government is going to be part of the answer.

559
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,579
And industry groups are going to be part of the answer

560
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,300
and consumer activity is going to be part of the answer.

561
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,680
-- I don't think it's going to be any one thing that
-- solves that, you know what

562
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,640
I'm going to go on a limb and say probably the

563
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,819
librarians will be the people you want to talk to here.

564
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:57,579
-- Well, librarians are always good. But why?
-- Well,

565
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:59,540
I run an industrial plant.

566
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,290
So probably I want to have somebody with, you know,

567
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,579
a librarian style skill set to ensure that

568
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,365
all the operational knowledge is documented and,

569
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,326
and we already do that right.

570
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:10,086
We've planned operation manuals and, you know,

571
00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:12,826
don't turn on this machine and then this machine because you'll trip the breaker,

572
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:13,765
set the thing on fire.

573
00:25:13,776 --> 00:25:14,005
Right?

574
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:18,385
But now, you know, let's make sure that we have spare parts and let's make sure

575
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:21,276
we not only have copies of that software but like backups

576
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,245
of those copies of software that we can get to.

577
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:26,235
Sure, you know, basically archival

578
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:28,556
of all the things we need to, you know,

579
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:30,645
keep this thing running and working because let's face it.

580
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:32,566
Right. Librarians, historically,

581
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:33,682
you know, they're

582
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:36,791
all about the preserving knowledge and ensuring we can still get

583
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,232
access to it and find it when we need it.

584
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:39,592
-- I don't
-- think you're wrong.

585
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:44,472
I need to think about this a little more, but I do feel like this is special

586
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:46,661
because old software

587
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:51,651
-- is problematic for different reasons than say old books are.
-- Oh, no, absolutely.

588
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:53,661
I'm just saying that that skill set though somewhat,

589
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:57,832
-- I can't think of anybody with a better, more relatable skill set
-- and Yes,

590
00:25:57,842 --> 00:25:59,791
I think you might be right there.

591
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:00,511
But

592
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,609
I don't know, I'm thinking of

593
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,869
like, right now, what I do is, you know,

594
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,640
every piece of software I download and install on

595
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,969
my machines I keep a copy of because,

596
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,239
yeah, someday I might need to reinstall it or

597
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,010
whatever. And I've had software that, you know, where I prefer the older version.

598
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,770
I don't like the new version or, you know, something along those lines. Right.

599
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,209
I remember one piece of software they changed all the hot keys,

600
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,959
right. So, the interface, like, and I'm like, I'm not relearning this.

601
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:23,420
No,

602
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,800
-- I'm staying on the old version until I get rid of it.
-- Right.

603
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:28,729
I've, I've been there before. Yes.

604
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:33,040
And, um, I mean, I've made it a point to actually get rid of most of my old hardware.

605
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,020
I actually gave away like, a pallet full of computers about two years ago.

606
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,130
Yeah, I, I did the same and now sort of the oldest thing in my house or, you know,

607
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,369
I have a couple of macs and then like a Raspberry Pi four and whatnot.

608
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:45,270
But, um, as far as this,

609
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,729
I think what I find so offensive about this removal of the drivers

610
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:53,800
is that it just seems so unnecessary, like, sure it probably cost them

611
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:56,890
money to keep this thing online and keep it available.

612
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:58,890
But at the same time, the benefit,

613
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,699
you know, the amount of hours it saves and the number of viral infections.

614
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:04,780
It saves, you know, for these poor computers.

615
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,520
Unfortunately,

616
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,839
that's an external cost for Intel that they don't have to care about.

617
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,369
Right. Right. Exactly.

618
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,290
And let's face it. Even if they do this,

619
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,420
is anyone gonna stop buying Intel gear? Probably not, not because of this.

620
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,040
What's the thought?

621
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,500
What if they decided to monetize it and charge a bucket download?

622
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,979
Would we be more ok with that or less? Ok with that

623
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:25,550
than simply removing it?

624
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:30,359
Iii I think it would have the same effect because I think most people running

625
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:33,699
old stuff are probably running it because they're not looking to spend any money.

626
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,390
And so if you try to charge them,

627
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,349
they're going to just go back to Google and they're going

628
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,339
to Google for their driver and they're going to end up.

629
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:41,439
II, I think it would have the same effect.

630
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,989
I suspect you're right. I don't, I don't think it would be better.

631
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,250
I mean, from, from my perspective, I,

632
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:51,489
I'm sensitive to the fact that Intel's job is to make money.

633
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,160
They are not a public trust now at the same time,

634
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,930
like maybe freaking donate these things to the internet

635
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:59,069
archive or something and just put a website up.

636
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,900
That's like, hey, you need to find it. Go to these guys. Come on.

637
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,050
They would have loved to host this.

638
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,569
I'm sure they would, they, they have all kinds of cool stuff there.

639
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,369
But I don't know, man, this one is

640
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,910
I, I'm, I'm gonna say I'm not happy with Intel, but I understand, you know.

641
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,949
-- Well,
-- a close parallel is these companies that have their old manuals online.

642
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:17,890
Right.

643
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,359
Because, you know, I try to hold on to manuals for stuff I have,

644
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,140
which has really saved my butt sometimes

645
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,349
because it's literally like with the manual,

646
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,869
it's a 12th fix and without the manual it's like, oh, good Lord, what is, you know,

647
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,790
what is the brown wire?

648
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,329
Why is there like purple?

649
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:31,969
Are there supposed to be purple wires?

650
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:32,949
Right?

651
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,000
You know, but with the manual, it's kind of like, oh like this, you know,

652
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,790
this component,

653
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,530
whatever something failed or just reset it or here's how you reset it, you know.

654
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,849
And there are some companies I forget offhand but there were

655
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,310
a couple of companies that remember a few years ago,

656
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,680
they like just dumped all of their manuals online onto a website.

657
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:50,170
Like not

658
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,750
like it was like PDF scans of the manuals and you know what?

659
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,939
They were ugly and they were horrendous to read, but they were there.

660
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,780
And that's fair.

661
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:03,199
And I do love when people put old things somewhere for preservation purposes.

662
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,660
And even not from the perspective of I need this to do some work,

663
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:11,180
I think just from the archival perspective,

664
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:13,550
there's value to society and

665
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:17,260
this comes back to the librarian kind of conversation is there's

666
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,500
value to society as a whole to keep these things available,

667
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:27,685
not even to use as much as just it's part of our past and we're throwing it away.

668
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:31,435
Well, you get to see the progression in some cases, right. I mean, sure,

669
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:32,035
I get that.

670
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:34,084
There's also some clear distinctions in the market

671
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:37,104
between consumer devices and say industrial devices where,

672
00:29:37,114 --> 00:29:39,915
you know, there's, there's that one Linux project where they're talking about,

673
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:40,805
you know, 50 year Linux,

674
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:43,635
like what happens when we want to install Linux on a device and then bury it

675
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:46,704
at the bottom of the ocean and it has to operate for 50 years without failing

676
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,579
because it, you know, it's controlling the pipe valve or something, right?

677
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,829
Or, you know, software in space.

678
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,189
You know, apart from, as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong.

679
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:57,469
But the only time we've repaired a satellite really is the Hubble.

680
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,630
Have we really ever repaired another satellite?

681
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:00,829
Sort of

682
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,239
like, I mean, the Mars Rover, they did that magic software update.

683
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,829
-- When the thing hacked itself,
-- we've done software updates.

684
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,020
I don't believe humans have ever retrieved an orbiting spacecraft,

685
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,109
repaired it and then put it back into orbit.

686
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,209
I think the closest would be Apollo 12.

687
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,880
Well, no, the Hubble space missions.

688
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,680
Remember we went and fixed the Hubble and replaced the mirror and stuff a few times.

689
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:26,449
I think that's the only thing we, we've touched Hubble. I think what twice

690
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,170
there were humans went to it.

691
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,689
They, they basically pulled it onto the space shuttle did things.

692
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,819
The only other instance similar to that I can think of is on Apollo 12,

693
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,459
they landed near one of the NASA space probes

694
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:43,689
and they, like, walked over to it and took some parts back to earth.

695
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:44,790
And

696
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,650
for real,

697
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,959
that was more to see how the weather or something

698
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,180
because they were in,

699
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:53,719
they were on the moon for a couple of years and it was just kind of a research project.

700
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,170
But that's,

701
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm not gonna lie. That's pretty freaking awesome.

702
00:30:57,979 --> 00:30:59,109
So, anyway, I guess

703
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,569
it's time to finish this up.

704
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:05,589
And this has been, I feel like a rambly collection of nonsense, but I will,

705
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:08,920
I will give you the last word. But I guess my comment here is,

706
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:11,709
I don't have any answers because I don't think

707
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,199
we, we have any of this figured out yet.

708
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:17,410
I feel like it is one of our new problems

709
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,339
in society is to decide what does all this mean?

710
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,550
Yeah, I'm going to agree. I guess just, you know, pay real close attention and ask

711
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,670
awkward questions. Like, how long will I get software updates for this thing?

712
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,989
-- And
-- I guess also hoard software

713
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:30,869
because

714
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,790
you need it.

715
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,050
-- Email
-- it to yourself,

716
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:34,359
right?

717
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:37,050
Until emails obsolete. And what do we do then?

718
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,760
-- Uh, email will never be obsolete.
-- Oh, man, you heard it here.

719
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,959
Amos last words.

720
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:42,750
-- The only
-- push

721
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,709
protocol we have.

722
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,800
Yeah, probably. All right. Anyway, I'm calling it. Thank you. Kurt, thank you
