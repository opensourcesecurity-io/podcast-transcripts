Hello and welcome to the 60th episode of the Open source Security podcast

1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,750
with myself. Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime. Josh Pressers.

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,119
How are you? Kurt?

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,440
Uh, disappointed

4
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:20,059
for any specific reason or just in general? Yeah.

5
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:22,899
Hurricane Harvey killed my vacation

6
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:23,399
that

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:23,860
I had,

8
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:26,940
uh, I had a flight through Houston tomorrow.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:27,540
Uh,

10
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:33,500
but Houston is under literally not figuratively nine trillion gallons of water.

11
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,479
That's crazy. II,

12
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,900
I guess on one side of things you're probably lucky

13
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,180
it happened before you left because being stranded somewhere is awful.

14
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:44,520
Yeah.

15
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,229
Yeah. No, it's, uh, yeah, I'm glad it happened before I left to know

16
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:49,310
after I left that

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,700
on the other hand, excuse to take a longer vacation.

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,299
That's exactly right. That's

19
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:57,569
exactly

20
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:57,979
right.

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:58,650
And I'm

22
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:58,830
just,

23
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,130
there you go. There you go. At least you found something good. It, it's,

24
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:03,459
yeah.

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:09,290
Anyway, for, for posterity's sake, Hurricane Harvey just hit Texas and it's,

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,290
it's bad.

27
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:15,720
-- It's really bad.
-- Uh, 48 inches of rain in two days, I believe in one area.

28
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,690
I think it's more than that. One of the airports is under a foot or more of water.

29
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:20,120
Yeah.

30
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:21,680
No, it's just the amount of rain is,

31
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,360
it's literally the most amount of rain ever measured in the,

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,349
uh contiguous US state. Uh United States.

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,069
So, like,

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,260
essentially the way that works is Hawaii gets a ton of

35
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:33,269
rain all the time because it's like a little island.

36
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,529
So it doesn't really count.

37
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:36,569
Um,

38
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,889
but like within the continental United States and, or Alaska, like, yeah, I mean,

39
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:44,639
4 ft of rain.

40
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,120
I, I can't imagine that

41
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,889
it's,

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,290
well, and I saw a thing on Twitter as well that they had to, like,

43
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,599
add a new color to the weather map

44
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:57,680
because the old color couldn't handle that amount.

45
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,730
Yeah, exactly. Like 4 ft is. I mean,

46
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,540
yeah, that's how tall my kids are.

47
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:04,980
So, I guess that's,

48
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:10,199
I don't, yeah, I don't know what to say. It's, it's madness.

49
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:11,389
Yeah.

50
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:13,460
Anyway, uh,

51
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,050
let's

52
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,820
maybe a happier topic is I got to see a total solar eclipse last week

53
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,960
and it was

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,539
that

55
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:23,830
I

56
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:26,190
didn't read about any mad max scenario,

57
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,720
breakdowns of society due to the influx of people.

58
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:28,860
It

59
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:29,419
was

60
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:32,880
surprisingly uneventful in that regard.

61
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:37,520
I was prepared with food, water and toilet paper and needed none of it.

62
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:39,660
It was very,

63
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,889
very well done nowhere I was, was insane.

64
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:47,130
And my understanding is nobody had to murder

65
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,919
anybody else and many people saw an eclipse.

66
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:50,850
So, I guess

67
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,970
from the,

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,259
let's all be friendly human scale, it was very successful from the, you know,

69
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,990
I'm hoping to see a dystopian mad max event.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,690
Uh that was a failure but, but the eclipse itself was great

71
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,929
and I got to see shadow bands which were crazy.

72
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,490
-- So,
-- what are shadow bands?

73
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,330
Oh, man. So this, I actually just found out about these.

74
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:12,539
I was watching uh the, the smarter everyday guy.

75
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,660
The Destin, I think his name is,

76
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,570
he had uh a video

77
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,570
about

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,470
the eclipse

79
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,669
and he talked about these things called shadow

80
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,139
bands and I never heard of them before,

81
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:27,130
but apparently, uh right before or right after totality,

82
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,889
you can get these weird, like, uh light and dark

83
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:35,490
bands on the ground and they kind of move around almost in a snake like manner

84
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:39,089
and, and, and scientists don't know what they are.

85
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,529
They, they,

86
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:42,029
they think they're atmospheric disturbances but nobody

87
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,449
knows for sure what causes them.

88
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,089
And so

89
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,710
it was one of those things I learned about this thought that's,

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,929
it'd be really cool if I see them and they don't always happen.

91
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,169
Right. So sometimes they show up at a clip sometimes they don't, you never know.

92
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,300
And at

93
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,619
the beginning of totality we saw no shadow bands, I thought, oh, well, you know,

94
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,369
maybe next time

95
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,210
and then at the end, like they were everywhere and it was, it was crazy.

96
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,369
It was so much fun though. Yeah, it was, it was good. I, I really enjoyed it.

97
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,089
I, I will definitely go back

98
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,410
and watch another eclipse.

99
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,630
So,

100
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:09,100
yeah,

101
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,110
it's weird, man.

102
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,419
That is the weirdest. I'm sorry, I'm just looking

103
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:12,570
at

104
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,630
that is the weirdest.

105
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,100
Ok. They think, yeah, they think it's basically the earth's atmosphere.

106
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,390
Magic stuff happens in

107
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:19,600
Voila.

108
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,660
They don't know.

109
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,230
-- And
-- that seems like one of the scientific

110
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:25,190
experiments where it's like we're pretty sure,

111
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,269
but we're probably wrong.

112
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,649
Well, and I kind of get it right.

113
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,380
Like, this isn't something that happens every day and you,

114
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,399
you can't make it happen in a lab.

115
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,470
It's

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:33,630
not

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,279
-- like
-- you can.

118
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:39,929
Yeah, do testing this. Like at scale would be difficult, I imagine. Right.

119
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,359
And my suspicion is after this eclipse,

120
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:46,049
they have a significant amount of data just because there are people everywhere,

121
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:46,920
recording

122
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,399
and there were, you know, scientists everywhere. And you had,

123
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,359
there was this huge weather balloon program that was going on,

124
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,630
in fact that the place I was at,

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,450
they launched a weather balloon with all these sensors and stuff on it.

126
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:58,859
And so that was really fun to talk to those

127
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,760
guys and just understand what they were up to.

128
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,600
And then of course, you could track it on the internet

129
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,950
and there were like,

130
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,970
probably hundreds of weather balloons launched across the,

131
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,040
the swath of the totality.

132
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:10,320
And so,

133
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,290
I mean, I imagine it has

134
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,970
some effect. Like I remember, um, going way back in time, uh September 11th, right.

135
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,040
There were no Jet Con trails for what, four days above the US.

136
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,440
And they studied the weather and it made a difference.

137
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,690
So, yeah, I imagine

138
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,970
it's so weird to think.

139
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,369
Like, yeah, it's only, well,

140
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,959
what I noticed here was the light quality was really wonky.

141
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,190
Right. It was like, kind of like golden hour type of light almost.

142
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,309
But, like, you know, at noon. So my brain was like,

143
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:36,420
uh,

144
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,450
you know, no, my brain did not like it did not enjoy it.

145
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,559
Um, it's very strange.

146
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,769
-- Oh,
-- yeah. It was just, it's not right.

147
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,369
You know,

148
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,470
it

149
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,529
just ain't right.

150
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,750
Uh, and the pinhole camera worked surprisingly well.

151
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:55,799
Uh, they do, they work well. Did you, did you buy any, like, dodgy sunglasses?

152
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:56,579
Off the internet?

153
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,429
No,

154
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,829
-- my son and I just made one with tinfoil in an Amazon box and some tape.
-- There you go.

155
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,420
-- There you go.
-- We work. It worked surprisingly

156
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,059
well.

157
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,320
Uh, for, you know, something that takes 20 minutes to do.

158
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,450
It took you 20 minutes to punch a hole in a box.

159
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:13,089
Well, we put some tinfoil and stuff over to make it really light

160
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:17,339
-- to get like a perfect little nice hole and all that.
-- I'll give you seven minutes.

161
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,140
But anyway,

162
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,679
well, ok, but you do

163
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,690
-- six year old.
-- Yeah, that's true.

164
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,540
No, I want to use the scissors then you just hope they don't stab their eye out.

165
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,359
Yeah.

166
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:32,739
So we didn't put any sunscreen in our eyes or anything like that. So, that was good.

167
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,320
Good, good, good.

168
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,260
But, uh, yeah. No, it was definitely solar eclipses.

169
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,119
Are a weird thing that, that's all,

170
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:39,829
it

171
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,220
kind of reminds me of these actual internet incidents of, like, weird, you know,

172
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,019
where an attack is actually, like, widespread and successful

173
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,260
because it is, like, literally that rare and weird,

174
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,730
you know, like the wanna cry thing, right?

175
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:56,489
Like, everybody just sort of stands there staring at it going, like,

176
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,690
-- what do we do now? You know?
-- That's a fair point actually.

177
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:01,890
Yes, it's,

178
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:03,279
huh.

179
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:04,829
I need to think about this.

180
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,589
You might, you might have a, that might be a blog post that you just came up with for me.

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,809
Uh, no, no, you're not wrong though. It, it definitely is one of those things that

182
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:15,940
humans aren't

183
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,190
used to and we don't quite know what to do. And in fact, when the sun goes away

184
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,329
it wasn't, I guess, like the bugs and the birds and all the,

185
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:26,329
all the critters that were around, they don't know what to do.

186
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:26,989
So,

187
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,250
it was

188
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,470
cool.

189
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,359
No, it's funny because like, part of me was like, oh,

190
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:30,510
it's just getting a little darker out.

191
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,950
No big deal. But it's like that doesn't happen at noon usually.

192
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,869
It, it got really, we saw stars, man in Totality.

193
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,140
It was cool. Yeah.

194
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,640
Oh, that would be amazing.

195
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:42,899
It was

196
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,880
very strange.

197
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,760
So, I guess on to happier topics, uh, you were mentioning some Blockchain stuff.

198
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,559
I came across an article by Jim Reiss, who is a friend of yours.

199
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,959
I know about what the cloud security lines is doing

200
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,890
with Blockchain and I thought, you know,

201
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:03,480
it'd be fun to kind of chat about Blockchain at that because

202
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,269
I think we've done it in the past,

203
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,910
but I don't think we've had like a superficial Blockchain episode.

204
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,420
So,

205
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,339
uh, yeah, this can be the superficial Blockchain episode.

206
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,470
Yeah.

207
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,920
So, I mean, one

208
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,309
Blockchain is one of those technologies.

209
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,500
It's basically like the web in many ways and that

210
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:23,029
there's a whole pile of potentially interesting use cases

211
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,359
and some of them might even make money

212
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,640
-- like, you know,
-- Bitcoin.

213
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:28,679
Yeah.

214
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,839
Uh

215
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,559
oh man,

216
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,409
just Bitcoin makes me angry because I remember looking

217
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,500
at it at six cents and I was like,

218
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,570
oh, this is totally a scam.

219
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,510
I'm not buying in

220
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,080
and I kick myself every day.

221
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:39,500
Uh But anyway, so,

222
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,789
so Bitcoin is interesting because this or Blockchain in general

223
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,400
like Blockchain even is such a broad family of technologies,

224
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:47,840
you know,

225
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:51,570
you've got public blockchains, private blockchains, things with side chains,

226
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,239
things with,

227
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,869
you know, transactions that can be reversed,

228
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,789
things that have where you can't transfer, you know, reverse the transactions.

229
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,739
Um

230
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,510
You know, the it's a lot like crypto in the,

231
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,080
the math behind it kind of lets you pick and choose

232
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,090
whatever properties you really need,

233
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,109
you know.

234
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:08,669
-- Well,
-- in

235
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,789
Blockchain means a lot of things today, I mean, back in the day,

236
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:14,080
it kind of originally meant

237
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,729
specifically the technology driving Bitcoin.

238
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,919
But now there's all these old coins that do all kinds of cool stuff

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,919
and

240
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:24,599
there's various technologies you can use. Um,

241
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,950
there's what, what is it, is it Open Ledger, I think is the

242
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,000
CS A is looking into for their, um,

243
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,239
continuing education?

244
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,150
There's

245
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,409
a,

246
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,299
there's a lot of options,

247
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,489
you know, the financial, uh there's a payment, uh

248
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:42,799
sorry, a payment industry consortium.

249
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:45,609
The name escapes me right now but it's all the usual players

250
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,330
and of course they're looking into a Blockchain thing for, you know,

251
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,619
transaction settlements,

252
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,309
uh

253
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,219
stock markets are looking

254
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,010
at this. Um,

255
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:58,250
all the insurance companies are looking at this for, you know, the paperwork,

256
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,520
um, the housing industry because, you know,

257
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,280
one thing I found out is it's pretty good in Canada and

258
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:05,369
the US but even in Canada and the US where we have,

259
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,330
you know, pretty solid rule of law and

260
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,510
generally good records

261
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,289
when you buy a house, you,

262
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:13,849
you still generally buy something called title insurance, which,

263
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:17,690
which basically says like you bought a house and it turns out

264
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,710
you didn't buy the house because the person

265
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,289
you bought it from doesn't actually own it.

266
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,219
Whoops

267
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:22,859
or

268
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,369
someone who doesn't own it. There can be liens against the house.

269
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,840
There can be like all this crazy stuff that can happen

270
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,210
with a property.

271
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,090
Yeah, exactly. There was a, a funny case here in Canada where a guy bought a house,

272
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,299
you know, and he thought he owned his backyard. Right?

273
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,010
Most people would think if you have a fenced in backyard that you own

274
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,210
and it turns out it was a separate parcel of land.

275
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,590
Yeah. And the guy came by and he's like you want to buy your backyard

276
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,640
and he said no. So the guy's like, ok, I'll put a fence up.

277
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,169
That's crazy, man. I mean,

278
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:54,989
yeah.

279
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,479
So anyways, one of the benefits of Blockchain is potentially

280
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,700
uh depending on which properties you choose and sort of how public you make it.

281
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,599
You, you can basically fix all those problems.

282
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,890
Well, you can fix some of the problems.

283
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,409
I mean, you can still have people doing weaselly things against house

284
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,140
stuff.

285
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,090
I mean, so actually this is something I, I learned,

286
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,710
I had a bunch of major work done on my house when I

287
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,390
bought it and I took out a construction loan to get it done.

288
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,179
Which by the way, if, if anyone ever gets any major work done on a property,

289
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,349
get a construction loan, even if you don't need it.

290
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,919
Because what happens is that title insurance?

291
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,919
You get that with a loan too.

292
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,150
And what happens is so I, I didn't know this.

293
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,349
I was educated by the maker on all this stuff and

294
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,799
I was like super excited to learn it and understand it.

295
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,200
But essentially like any of the contractors who work in your house,

296
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:44,409
any of them can put a lien against your house

297
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:45,590
for unpaid

298
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,700
-- or,
-- or like for like any reason they don't

299
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,700
even, not even unpaid, but just. Right.

300
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,719
Right. Right. And so essentially by having this title insurance then,

301
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,390
like, yes, a contract you can put a lien against my house. But it's not my problem.

302
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,950
Right. Because title insurance deals with it. Which is,

303
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:03,419
-- yeah, exactly. It's awesome. Worth
-- every penny.

304
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,729
That's actually really good to know.

305
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:06,729
Yeah. Yeah, I learned a lot.

306
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,080
But anyway, anyway, the,

307
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,400
the beauty of this though and I'm going to tie this back into the,

308
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:13,820
the open C pe model that,

309
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,750
that Jim talked about and I'll put a link to it in the

310
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,719
show notes is one of the challenges you get in any system is

311
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,520
people love to go back in time

312
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:24,130
and try to backdate things and pretend something happened in the past and, you know,

313
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,909
especially when you

314
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:29,385
like liens against property or you have like public notices saying, you know,

315
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:33,005
uh so and so died and now the estate is in probate, whatever.

316
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:38,744
And then people are like, oh, he uh lent me money uh uh 1010 years ago. And uh

317
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:42,565
yeah, let me, uh let me go get the receipt. It's in my car. Can I borrow your pen?

318
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:43,429
You know? And

319
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:45,599
no, he didn't.

320
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,229
But anyway, and so the beauty of something like Blockchain is

321
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:51,830
once something is stuck into the ledger,

322
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,190
-- it's, it's there forever and it's
-- immediate.

323
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:55,049
Yes and no,

324
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,909
there are there are you can,

325
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,669
you can choose blockchains with properties that allow you to

326
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:04,099
either modify or even delete transactions.

327
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,929
But in theory, you would also, even in that situation,

328
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,669
you could have somebody monitoring it that keeps

329
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,229
-- a, like a record of everything that was ever.
-- No, no.

330
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,250
Here's the thing though, is,

331
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,179
is what you're talking about is something similar to it.

332
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,390
It's uh Ethereum I think has the,

333
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,789
the smart contracts

334
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:20,929
that are built in

335
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:23,500
the ledger is not modified,

336
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,030
like

337
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:24,349
the

338
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:24,669
data

339
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,880
have ledgers that can be modified if enough people, for example, vote on it in

340
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:29,940
some

341
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,429
totally different. That's Bitcoin

342
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,200
you're really talking about here and

343
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,794
in some cases you do, uh

344
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:41,934
there are situations with certain types of documents or records

345
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:46,135
where you do need to be able to back out or cancel or destroy transactions.

346
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:49,135
And, and ideally, it would only happen in a situation where, you know,

347
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,135
like something obviously went horribly wrong

348
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:54,789
and you know, everybody agrees that something went horribly wrong.

349
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,219
So like, let's pretend that never happened.

350
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,190
And that was, was that,

351
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,440
-- that was a theorem that happened to you
-- where they got kind of ripped off for like

352
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,359
somebody

353
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,030
stole a million

354
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,229
of coin

355
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:03,880
and

356
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,210
they

357
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:04,929
found um

358
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,840
I forget what the flaw was in the, in the smart contracts, but

359
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:09,229
it was a good one.

360
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,760
in that instance,

361
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,520
what they did is basically everyone decided we're just going to go

362
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,909
back in time to this day and pretend nothing happened since then.

363
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,299
But of course, that creates a bunch of issues because then

364
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,260
anyone who traded anything with each other during that, I guess

365
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,059
magic time those transactions are now gone.

366
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,059
So you have to kind of go back after people and say please sir, you know,

367
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,099
can I have some more?

368
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,349
And of course they could say no and there's probably nothing you could do about it.

369
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:36,880
Not really,

370
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,080
there was a really good article talking about um

371
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,559
short sales of various uh Bitcoin and Bitcoin alter

372
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:46,080
was a crazy story man.

373
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,979
Well, but here's the reality, right? The financial markets um are complicated.

374
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,090
I've, I've read about them and tried to understand it.

375
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,219
And the conclusion I've come to is I don't have enough time

376
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,840
to read about it and actually even begin to understand it.

377
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:04,010
Yeah, I I agree that there's a lot of crazy that goes on and so

378
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:07,090
do, do you even want to try to explain what happens here?

379
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,130
So, but going back to Bitcoin

380
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,440
and Blockchain in general,

381
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:14,380
but the beauty of Blockchain is you get to choose

382
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:18,969
the properties of the Blockchain, right? So for example, an insurance

383
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:23,090
Blockchain for say a great example, ownership of houses, right?

384
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,619
You might want to actually choose, for example,

385
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,979
to be able to undo transactions so that if there is a fraudulent transaction,

386
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:31,789
you can undo it.

387
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,820
But you might also then require that like say for example, like half of the

388
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:37,979
available sort of consensus

389
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,710
people vote.

390
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,090
Yes, on that. Right.

391
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:44,830
So you can't just have like a few wonky people rolling back transactions.

392
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,799
You have to, you know, you have to have like a majority.

393
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,450
No, I mean,

394
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,039
no,

395
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:48,690
not at all.

396
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,450
That's, that totally defeats the purpose of having a public ledger

397
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,030
is

398
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,590
well, but the thing is you would still have the record of that event happening

399
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:02,039
which in and of itself is valuable but the consequences of that event are wiped out.

400
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,039
-- See, and that's part
-- of the beauty. I see what you're saying. And that's

401
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,950
-- like Bitcoin basically can't do that
-- today. Exactly. Well, and it,

402
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:12,719
and, and essentially if Bitcoin wants to be cash, it can't.

403
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,080
That's kind of the whole

404
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:14,280
point

405
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,690
of cash,

406
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,210
you

407
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,219
spend it, you get robbed too bad, it's gone.

408
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,460
It's not like Bitcoin is basically that you, uh, you get robbed and it's gone.

409
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,979
If you throw your wallet into a dump,

410
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:27,049
you,

411
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,989
you shouldn't do that, I guess is the answer.

412
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,260
-- So,
-- anyway, let's talk about the Cloud Security Alliance because

413
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,570
we're getting into precarious territory.

414
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:37,469
Yeah, if you want a quick overview.

415
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:41,890
So the idea is essentially, um, C pe continuing professional education. Right.

416
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,989
So a lot of security standards and,

417
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,789
uh, titles and, you know, like ISC Squared, CISSP or

418
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,710
whatever,

419
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,229
have a requirement for continuing professional education.

420
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,080
You know, you can't just like, write the exam pass and then, like,

421
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,150
coast on that for 20 years.

422
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,179
I, I think you can listen to podcasts.

423
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,909
So,

424
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,108
yeah, just hit that back catalog,

425
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,540
-- folks.
-- Exactly.

426
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:06,530
And so, yeah,

427
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,410
part of it is essentially depending on

428
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,130
which certification is and how they've structured.

429
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,319
It.

430
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,358
Basically, it boils down to, is a lot of them.

431
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:13,410
Kind of have you,

432
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,760
you need a certain number of points every year to maintain your certification

433
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,260
and you can earn points by doing various activities. Um, so funny story.

434
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,848
The CV E board

435
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:27,130
uh was uh the Miter Corporation was amused to

436
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
find out that actually being on the CV board

437
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,609
and doing that kind of stuff counts in a

438
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,099
lot of things for continuing professional education board.

439
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:34,239
So,

440
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,260
yeah, I mean, it does sort of make sense.

441
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:42,234
Um but even things like for some of them reading blogs, articles, reading um well,

442
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:42,765
magazine.

443
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,344
Do we have information security magazines anymore? I don't

444
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:45,655
know.

445
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:50,084
-- I don't think so.
-- I remember the trade eggs, man, I remember getting them in the mail.

446
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:52,354
This is, it's been years I,

447
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:52,614
I

448
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:53,584
think

449
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,834
I should see if I can sign up for them. That would be,

450
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:57,685
that would be fun to do.

451
00:17:58,155 --> 00:17:58,375
Yeah.

452
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,844
And things like, you know, going taking courses,

453
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:03,234
especially taking courses at more sort of,

454
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:04,824
well, things like blackout,

455
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:07,354
right? They have a quite a bit of training at Black Hat.

456
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:11,469
And so, yeah, so the idea is essentially you do these courses, you do these,

457
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:15,079
you read magazines, you read books, you whatever, do stuff

458
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,849
and you apply for your continuing education

459
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,930
credits and then you maintain your certification.

460
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,170
Um, the real pain in the ass is, and I can speak to this personally.

461
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,930
I had AC ISSP certification

462
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,439
and I let it lapse because getting the continuing education credits

463
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,550
and filing them was such a pain in the butt.

464
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,390
I just couldn't be bothered.

465
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,540
Yeah, I, I get that.

466
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,500
I've, I've let many,

467
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,459
many things like that expire just because I was too lazy to do the work to keep it.

468
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:43,589
Yeah.

469
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:46,229
So part of the idea behind using a Blockchain for this

470
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,750
is not just that it would make it somewhat easier to register these credits,

471
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:54,689
but that it would make it easier for various standards to consume these credits.

472
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,869
So, for example, if I go to black hat and take a training,

473
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:00,949
you know, that would apply to AC ISSP but it might also apply to,

474
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:05,140
but I, I don't really know any other uh certifications

475
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,079
to be off honest off the top of my head, like me plus a

476
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:08,800
bunch.

477
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,400
Yeah, there's, there's like a big pile of these globally.

478
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,099
Um But anyway, so, you know,

479
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,329
typically when you take a training or do something like that, it would apply to

480
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,449
probably most of the, you know, the certifications you have.

481
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:22,010
And so the part of the idea is is that

482
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,660
you have a situation with many producers and many consumers,

483
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:26,719
right?

484
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,400
So if you take like 10,

485
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,060
uh 10 things of training a year and you have 10 certifications.

486
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,319
Now you have to manage 100

487
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:39,459
of these relationships. The filing these things

488
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,579
is

489
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:39,810
a

490
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,760
pain in the butt.

491
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,709
Um, so the idea is basically essentially that you could have, you know,

492
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,229
somebody like blackout training.

493
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,719
Um,

494
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,780
you know, assuming you're willing to, uh, put this in the public ledger, you know,

495
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,599
say though, like, yeah,

496
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,760
like Josh Reser went and took the training on VPN security and

497
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,839
-- totally aced it, you know, because he's awesome. Of
-- course I did.

498
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,880
And uh you know,

499
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,900
the uh the teacher basically gave him a good mark to make him go away.

500
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,290
-- Um
-- That happened to me in college. Actually, I was in a,

501
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:09,040
I was in a programming class.

502
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:14,040
It was ac programming class and uh I was young and, and knew a lot of c

503
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,640
and I remember after constantly correcting the professor, he came up to me and said,

504
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:18,719
uh

505
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,689
if you never come back, I'll give you a B and I was like, done, you know,

506
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,810
and that was the end of that. And I was ecstatic,

507
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:27,859
but

508
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,839
there you go. Kids being a horrible pain in the ass can pay off sometimes.

509
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,180
Oh, the squeaky wheel gets the grace,

510
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,859
-- right.
-- Let's not pretend otherwise.

511
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,170
So, you know, what else I see as having value here is,

512
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,560
um, speaking of college,

513
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:45,050
one of the other things I was notorious for is there

514
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,380
were classes I would take where you had to um,

515
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,540
maybe submit

516
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,859
certain things

517
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,500
before the end of the semester.

518
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:55,560
And of course, on the day before the end of the semester I was up all night long,

519
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:58,510
doing all of the work I was supposed to have done all semester long.

520
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:58,959
Right.

521
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:04,000
Instead of all at once. And so there's kind of that, that fraud aspect you can help

522
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,119
reduce

523
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,520
where people can't backdate work.

524
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,760
I, I can't pretend I wrote this paper, you know, on the 13th of June

525
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,750
because I didn't,

526
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:18,920
but I also don't want to have like everything dated yesterday that I turned in today.

527
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:20,890
Right? I get it.

528
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,500
So, and, and part of this too is, I mean, again,

529
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,969
depending on the properties you choose and

530
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,849
how you choose to structure politically.

531
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,140
For example,

532
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,739
you can have a process to deal with sort of fraudulent

533
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,420
claims. Right? Because for example, there are some,

534
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,800
uh, I just took my border exam,

535
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,819
uh, license and it's all online. Right? It's, it's a, it's a 34 hour online process.

536
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:42,599
You do the web.

537
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,510
Uh, it's mostly so I have a little plastic car now,

538
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,969
which means I don't get like a multi $100 fine if I'm operating a boat and,

539
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:55,390
-- and
-- let me guess, I bet the vast majority of everything they talked about was, uh,

540
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,930
don't drink in boat

541
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,390
-- and don't be a dick,
-- right?

542
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,800
And wear your person.

543
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,369
And of

544
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,209
course, the life

545
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:03,060
fest, of course.

546
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,180
Yeah. But seriously do wear that folks

547
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,739
do

548
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,349
like,

549
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,869
really, please do.

550
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,839
Um Yeah, basically and you know,

551
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:13,719
there's some navigation stuff that was useful and some uh

552
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,430
anyways,

553
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,689
but back to this. So basically the idea is that,

554
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:18,540
you know, there are,

555
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,599
if you give an incentive for people to have certification,

556
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,650
which like we have because, you know, if you have certifications,

557
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,689
typically it's easier to get a job or especially in some parts of the world, right,

558
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,839
where you're certain through, you know, hundreds of, you know, applicants

559
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,219
and it's a good way to essentially do like a quick,

560
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,689
you know, filter, right?

561
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:40,270
Um

562
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,750
So there's all kinds of, you know, potential fraudulent claims,

563
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,300
like people taking exams for other people, people

564
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,310
becoming like diploma mills, right?

565
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,469
Like that classic thing where it's like, oh, yeah, totally.

566
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:53,979
We have VPN training here real good 50 bucks online,

567
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,270
blah, blah, blah, right?

568
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,459
And so part of this beauty of this too with the Blockchain

569
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,780
is that the consumers can not only choose kind

570
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,750
of what and how they consume these things,

571
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:08,459
but again, they can sort of make that information more public and share it, you know,

572
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:08,780
like

573
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:10,430
we've seen a lot of one,

574
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,589
you know, for example,

575
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,709
we've seen a lot of people with this certification take this course and then,

576
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,459
you know, people come back and complain about it.

577
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:17,400
That's interesting.

578
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:20,260
And so we need these feedback loops and then

579
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,699
where we can actually do something about it,

580
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:22,979
you know, so we could for example,

581
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:28,949
retroactively say like, oh, we're no longer going to um, accept, you know,

582
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:31,859
uh Bob's House of Pancakes and VPN education.

583
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,000
-- Yes.
-- You know.

584
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:38,310
And so, OK, but, but here is the question

585
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:39,270
is

586
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,550
why

587
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,390
do we need Blockchain to do this

588
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,979
instead of just, let's say having a mysql database somewhere?

589
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:51,160
So that's what came up. That was one of the central questions.

590
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:55,449
And so this has come up with several other things, but basically what it boils down to

591
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:56,329
is

592
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,449
if there is at least one

593
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,810
interested party in running this,

594
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:02,239
it will be alive,

595
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:06,209
right? And that's the benefit over a centralized like my SQL database.

596
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:10,449
Like a great example of this is Wikipedia, right? Wikipedia is awesome,

597
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,250
you know,

598
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,160
and anybody can download the whole thing. It's not that big. It's like what?

599
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,290
-- Hundreds of gigabytes I
-- think,

600
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,619
I think the downloads only like 16 gigs for the compressed archive.

601
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:20,989
I

602
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:24,770
-- think that's only the text, not the images and video and all that.
-- That could be

603
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,650
but regardless 16 gigs, right? Like no offense that fits on a phone.

604
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,260
Yeah. Yeah, it fits,

605
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:30,609
you

606
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:33,859
know, I know the whole thing can fit on a one terabyte drive.

607
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,660
-- Like
-- exactly. That's,

608
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,219
that's walking around storage nowadays, literally that

609
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:40,359
fits in your pocket

610
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,040
for like under 200 bucks

611
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:43,609
actually under 100 bucks.

612
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:44,000
And

613
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,790
right, it's

614
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,959
I was at best Buy just the other day man. And they had

615
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:52,920
a four terabyte portable hard drive for like, $200. And I thought this is,

616
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,449
-- my brain doesn't even know what to think of this.
-- I

617
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:55,609
know.

618
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:56,880
It's amazing.

619
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,079
So, but the problem with Wikipedia is, let's say, for the sake of argument,

620
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,969
wikipedia.org dies.

621
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,020
Well,

622
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,339
hm, ok. Everybody has a copy of Wikipedia. That's awesome. We haven't lost the data.

623
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,099
But how do we update it? Who has the true copy?

624
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:12,780
I do.

625
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,800
-- Right. Yeah,
-- exactly.

626
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:17,619
And see that's the problem that Blockchain solves.

627
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,359
We have a true copy. And like I said, as long as there's essentially one

628
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,060
organization willing to run it,

629
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,119
we still have that one true copy.

630
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,829
It's not just that there's some more going on here, that's really important.

631
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,199
And I think the most important aspect of this

632
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,839
is not that

633
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,239
it is that

634
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:41,160
I cannot change anything in the past. If I say

635
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,599
I'm now in charge of the open C pe program or what,

636
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,189
whatever you guys are going to call it.

637
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,079
And

638
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:50,209
I say I'm in charge, I'm the only one who cares.

639
00:25:50,219 --> 00:25:52,290
I can't go back in time and change things.

640
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,520
Right. Well, yeah, that's a big thing too. But I mean,

641
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,439
this whole thing presupposes that it still exists,

642
00:25:58,069 --> 00:25:58,569
you know,

643
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,270
and archive.org is a great example of this, right?

644
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,410
They're trying to sort of salvage a lot of our digital history.

645
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:05,140
Yes.

646
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:05,459
Yes,

647
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,050
-- they
-- are,

648
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,489
you know,

649
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,880
and quite frankly, if that stuff was in Blockchain,

650
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,800
they could just essentially be part of that

651
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,839
and then just

652
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:12,540
cop,

653
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,800
-- it doesn't quite work like that. I mean,
-- well,

654
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,260
-- it's,
-- I

655
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,479
-- know,
-- but if you look at, like, the Bitcoin Blockchain,

656
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,890
the Blockchain I've got on my computer is like hundreds of gigabytes at this point.

657
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,569
It's completely insane how huge it is.

658
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,770
Hundreds of gigabytes is not big anymore. My friend, it

659
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,010
is when you're on, like,

660
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,069
some crappy dial up connection and you connect for the first

661
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,420
time and you have to download all of the freaking block.

662
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,300
But I mean,

663
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,229
I would just run it on like an Amazon or Google computer engine machine with 10

664
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:45,109
-- gig feed.
-- Yes, we would do that. Although even then man, uh

665
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,780
that could get out of hand

666
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,140
downloading all of the Blockchain over your, your,

667
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,209
let me put it

668
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:51,390
in a

669
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:51,650
rule

670
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,040
thumb. If it, if it,

671
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:56,329
if it's important enough that somebody cares,

672
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,199
they can easily spend several tens of thousands of dollars on it

673
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,439
and several tens of thousands of dollars nowadays buys you so much compute time

674
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,390
and data transfer and data storage that

675
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,859
I, I literally without an envelope can't tell you how much that is.

676
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,300
It's probably really cheap.

677
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:15,119
It's also cheap now.

678
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:19,680
Like I know what my annual it budget is now and it's, you know,

679
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:21,859
it's in the hundreds of dollars per year.

680
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:22,930
It's

681
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:26,755
for my personal it. And I remember one year I spent $17,000 on computers uh

682
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:29,275
for your personal stuff.

683
00:27:29,635 --> 00:27:30,984
-- Well, when I was doing
-- contract

684
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:32,185
that could be.

685
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:35,234
Um And now I'm down to some raspberry,

686
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:37,694
I'm actually getting rid of my last two PC servers and I'm

687
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:40,155
going to go with some raspberry pies and removable hard drives.

688
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:43,155
Nice. I get tempted to do that every now and then.

689
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:45,594
I haven't pulled the trigger yet, but I think I'm getting close

690
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,119
because at this point, if I can buy a four gig hard drive for $200

691
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:51,800
I

692
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,880
already did that.

693
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,390
My kids,

694
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,839
my kids file server is just an external hard drive on the Mac mini in the living room.

695
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:58,859
Um

696
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:01,469
So I'm getting rid of those two last big computers.

697
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,569
So then, then the biggest computer I'll have is

698
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,930
laptop slash a Mac mini,

699
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,319
you know, and then a bunch of stuff in the cloud

700
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,459
which no doubt is like a gazillion data servers. God knows where. But

701
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,750
-- on my problem,
-- right.

702
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,119
Oh man, you got to love it.

703
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,890
You gotta love it.

704
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,560
So anyway, we're talking about Blockchain, not, not Kurt's cloud service bill,

705
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:26,300
-- which
-- well, and another benefit to this Blockchain is that it,

706
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,479
the barrier to entry is so much lower than a centralized server.

707
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:32,579
And that's

708
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,239
so here's, here's actually the problem is

709
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,670
once it exists, like

710
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:41,550
working with the Bitcoin network

711
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,069
is trivial today, you download the client,

712
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,709
then you download an insane amount of data off of the peer to peer Blockchain network

713
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,939
and then everything's fine. Right? And, and it does constantly update.

714
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:55,430
Now, my, my one complaint about the Bitcoin network as well is the,

715
00:28:55,459 --> 00:29:00,290
the volume of data you see coming in and out of your house is quite high

716
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,349
when the client is running just because of the peer to peer nature of it.

717
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,069
So there, there's that.

718
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,130
But, but anyway, anyway, I

719
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:08,390
ignoring that

720
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:14,719
if you want to run your own ledger, like you want to take open Blockchain or,

721
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:16,949
or open Ledger, what, whichever there's a bunch of.

722
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,319
So I actually know some of the numbers for this

723
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,079
outsourcing it.

724
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:20,780
We're

725
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,989
-- talking about less than 10 grand
-- a month, not outsourcing it.

726
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,280
Right. If, if you work with someone else, yes, that has the expertise to start it

727
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,479
off. But like if you wanted to do it on your own,

728
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,989
the start up costs are substantial because it's actually really

729
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,959
difficult to stand some of this stuff up by yourself.

730
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:37,359
Oh,

731
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,609
it's definitely nontrivial and more to the point.

732
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:42,010
There are smart people that will help you and more to the point,

733
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,099
you can just outsource the whole damn thing for like 10 grand a month or less.

734
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:45,800
You can.

735
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,680
And

736
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,939
that is probably the right way to do it unless you don't have 10 grand.

737
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:50,829
And then,

738
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:51,660
which is what I

739
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:51,969
say.

740
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,459
I view honestly a lot of this like electricity,

741
00:29:56,469 --> 00:29:58,510
electricity is not my core competency.

742
00:29:58,849 --> 00:29:59,709
I, I just pay

743
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:00,329
Core

744
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,060
Edmonton Power Corporation

745
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,300
like I literally just pay them like,

746
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,430
I don't know 50 bucks a month. I don't even,

747
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,170
-- I think it's 50 a month.
-- A $50

748
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,209
-- bill is super cheap because, or
-- maybe it's more,

749
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:13,760
I don't know.

750
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,170
But

751
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:17,229
regardless I pay Epcor and I buy a bunch of a PC Upss

752
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,900
to make sure the power doesn't, like, destroy anything here.

753
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:21,469
That's it.

754
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:22,750
II, I like,

755
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,750
I actually know how to rewire a house but it's just not applicable anymore.

756
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,140
It doesn't matter. It's so simple

757
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:28,540
anyway.

758
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:29,640
-- It's
-- like buying,

759
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,930
it's like buying bandwidth. I don't know how to buy bandwidth.

760
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:33,869
I just pay for an Aws instance.

761
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:37,680
Oh, you're not wrong.

762
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,430
You're not

763
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:38,699
wrong

764
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:43,479
and why, you know, I've, I've looked into these things about what it would take to.

765
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:47,619
Actually a big part of this is like, you know, who do you even talk to, to buy this from?

766
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,010
And are you getting a good deal? Don't know. Don't care.

767
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,939
I pay Amazon like a couple of 100 bucks a month or whatever, you know,

768
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:54,229
in the case of something like this.

769
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,290
Yeah. Yeah, I mean that, that's fair. That's fine.

770
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,699
Anyway. Anyway,

771
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,209
right.

772
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:07,430
-- I am
-- speaking to your, your. Ok. So we're now uh yeah, internet 150.

773
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:10,040
So it's 100 and 50 megabits per second. One terabyte

774
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,560
data allowance is 82 bucks a month.

775
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:16,170
Um, but I believe for an extra $15 a month you can buy unlimited,

776
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,890
unlimited amount of data.

777
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,349
So

778
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,410
I would assume 100 and 50 megabits per second is probably enough to run Bitcoin

779
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,719
a, a client.

780
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:28,469
You need like two megabits in each direction, man.

781
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:30,760
-- Oh, that's it. Yeah,
-- it's, it's not a lot.

782
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,010
My cell phone will do that.

783
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,880
Except in Kennedy, you're going to hit your overage in like five minutes,

784
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,520
right?

785
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,719
4.5

786
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:40,319
about

787
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,760
that.

788
00:31:40,969 --> 00:31:41,449
Yeah,

789
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,729
I've actually, I'm really proud of myself now.

790
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:47,310
I consistently get a 95% email warning on my cell phone.

791
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,040
Typically one or two days before my billing period ends.

792
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,219
Nice.

793
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:55,380
You know what's even better than that is having unlimited data and you don't care,

794
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:58,739
I'd have to live in the US for that to happen.

795
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,180
Right. Right. Because

796
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:00,829
that's,

797
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:03,339
I still love like of all the backwards technology

798
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:06,339
problems we have like we're getting cell phones mostly.

799
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:06,750
Right.

800
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,469
So

801
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,540
I'll give us points there.

802
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,130
So anyway, anyway, let's, let's tie up this Blockchain conversation is.

803
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,150
So, yeah, I mean,

804
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,150
I think things like what the CS A is doing here is really clever because

805
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:24,510
Blockchain is one of those things that has tons and tons of hype around it,

806
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,750
but I've yet to see anything like truly materialized that

807
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:29,439
that is used

808
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:30,160
has

809
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:30,750
not

810
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:32,219
emerged quite yet. Bitcoin

811
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:32,969
is

812
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:33,719
not really

813
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:34,489
a

814
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,229
-- app
-- today.

815
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:35,939
Right.

816
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:39,439
Well, and, and, but you look at like how many transactions per second,

817
00:32:39,449 --> 00:32:42,020
Blockchain is handling compared to say like Visa

818
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,250
and it's so many orders of magnitude smaller. I

819
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:46,939
mean,

820
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:50,160
this is why they just forked Bitcoin because there are some

821
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,459
of the miners were unhappy with the essentially block size.

822
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:55,260
Was it block size?

823
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:56,949
It was block size. Yeah,

824
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,949
-- they wanted to increase it. They
-- made it bigger so it can handle more transactions.

825
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,349
But yeah, it's still,

826
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:07,410
it is not going to be capable of handling transactions on a level

827
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,099
that we need in the modern financial world.

828
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,109
-- And
-- well, somebody pointed out the cost in electricity for a Blockchain

829
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,300
transaction. It's seriously hideous.

830
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:20,734
-- Bitcoin
-- is using so much electricity right now. It's not even funny. And,

831
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:22,864
and I mean, in all seriousness,

832
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:26,574
there are many downfalls to this currency and I think

833
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:28,765
that is probably the one that's going to murder it

834
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:29,604
because

835
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:33,385
-- no,
-- it's going to be the uh the the deflationary spiral that'll hit

836
00:33:33,785 --> 00:33:33,935
it.

837
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:34,984
I

838
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:36,324
yes,

839
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:42,285
-- but I question if we will hit that before it just becomes so uneconomical to
-- mine

840
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:43,535
becomes cheap

841
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:44,479
power,

842
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,099
power plus renewables.

843
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,579
It's, it's more than just compute power though, man.

844
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:50,459
I mean, we're, we're bumping into

845
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:54,060
just the ability to fab some of this Asic year at this point,

846
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,400
right? We, we,

847
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,640
we've just said a whole bunch of things, I bet.

848
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:57,869
So

849
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,250
basically

850
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:58,790
what

851
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:58,959
we're

852
00:33:59,109 --> 00:33:59,150
saying,

853
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,650
the long and the short of it is

854
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,489
Bitcoin is horrifically like literally like like

855
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,939
spiked mallet to the face, horrible

856
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,810
-- energy consumption to what it does. But
-- not only

857
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,550
that at most, there will be 21 million Bitcoins in existence.

858
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,739
And if I had to guess.

859
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,418
I bet there are currently a several 100,000 of them that have been lost forever.

860
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:22,699
Oh, easily.

861
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,889
Plus all the ones, the original Satoshi

862
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,909
guy, whatever entity mind and

863
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,030
have never really

864
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:29,530
know

865
00:34:29,728 --> 00:34:31,918
how many he has. I've heard he's a billion.

866
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,370
Yeah, it was a couple of million.

867
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,560
Um, but basically here's the problem, like you can hate on fiat money all you want.

868
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,719
But being able to print more money

869
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,760
as it turns out is kind of a useful,

870
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,438
super useful

871
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:45,000
it.

872
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:47,639
Well, and not just print more money. Right.

873
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,879
Let's ignore that.

874
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,080
Even if you can't print more money,

875
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:54,398
banks have financial vehicles that they,

876
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:57,239
they make money out of thin air essentially.

877
00:34:57,249 --> 00:34:57,668
Right?

878
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:58,698
And

879
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:00,839
with Bitcoin, you can't do that.

880
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:04,749
There's no way to do like fractional reserve lending with Bitcoin.

881
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,138
Well, there probably is,

882
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:11,039
but like that's a pyramid scheme at that point and you're going to fail, right?

883
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:12,350
Yeah,

884
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:15,189
I think honestly, I think Charles Strauss kind of talks about this, this,

885
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,189
he's a sci fi writer that does a lot of economics related stuff

886
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,550
and money is not

887
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:24,239
really meant to be like a store of value or a thing of value.

888
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,830
It's meant to be a lubricant to get that stuff moving.

889
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,699
You know, that's fair.

890
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,889
I mean, a great example of this is, you know,

891
00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:36,560
um, the house I currently live in has been sold and, you know, I, I lose it on the 25th.

892
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,090
Uh, but it would be nice to, you know, move into the house,

893
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,909
uh that we're buying

894
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,810
before that

895
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,060
except I don't have like a, you know,

896
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,389
a big pile of money handy to buy a house for like that week

897
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,840
in front of getting the money from this house.

898
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:54,070
So, you know, the, the bank provides bridge financing

899
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:57,969
and voila like magic happens and then there's like a week

900
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,750
of overlap where I can actually move all my stuff.

901
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:00,139
It

902
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:01,939
is terrible. Oh

903
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:03,689
-- God,
-- I am so not looking

904
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:03,840
forward

905
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:04,719
to

906
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:06,790
close to you. So you can't ask me to help.

907
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,310
Yeah. So, but basically, I mean, that's the point, right?

908
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,989
Money is meant to be a lubricant.

909
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,949
It's meant to get stuff going like a great example of this. I love it.

910
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,889
Like, like as much as again people hate on stuff like square,

911
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:20,709
I can now sell my couch and take a credit card.

912
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,780
Yeah, I suppose

913
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:26,330
I don't want cash because I'm gonna get robbed or something,

914
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,659
you know, but being able to take a credit card, like literally my kids,

915
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:33,080
if they decide to go into snow shoveling or lawn mowing,

916
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,209
-- they can take credit cards or you can email the money.
-- That's a great idea.

917
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:41,760
Actually give a kid a stripe reader and be like go go mow lawns.

918
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,399
Yeah.

919
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,179
Yeah, we were going to actually get some teenage on my parents' cabin,

920
00:36:46,189 --> 00:36:47,879
get the teenagers across the street.

921
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,239
Essentially, you email us a picture of the lawn, you go mow.

922
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,879
-- It, send us a second picture of the lawn. We'll email you the money.
-- Now.

923
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:58,010
Now this is where having the Blockchain would be great because

924
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,260
then they couldn't just keep emailing old pictures of the lawn.

925
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:01,919
Right.

926
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,620
Well, I'm assuming that they're not smart enough to modify the JPEG XF data and,

927
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:07,500
like, retake the dates and stuff.

928
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,899
But, and, and worst case scenario, you can have them, like, hold up, you know,

929
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:13,399
proof of life copy of the newspaper or whatever,

930
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:14,520
you know.

931
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,639
But I mean, and again,

932
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:19,110
-- they could Photoshop and stuff but realistically
-- reddit a ma

933
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,510
after mowing the lawn that way you can prove it.

934
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:22,949
Exactly.

935
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,629
But fundamentally like it gets to the point where the fraud

936
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:28,070
would be much more effort than just mowing the lawn.

937
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:28,340
Uh

938
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,719
man, never underestimate people.

939
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:34,709
There are a lot of people who are involved in fraud that do

940
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,929
way more work than if they were just running an honest business.

941
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,330
This is true.

942
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:40,919
-- It's the sad
-- truth.

943
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:41,199
But

944
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,600
yeah, I mean, that's the beauty. Like if you have a, you know,

945
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,239
a decent currency and not only a decent currency

946
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,379
but a way of actually transferring it around,

947
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:53,360
you know, people can go do stuff and create value and get paid for it,

948
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:55,639
but here's the thing. All right. So here's the question.

949
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,120
Ignoring your

950
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,659
economic lesson here on why real money matters is

951
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,399
Bitcoin is on fire.

952
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:07,840
How high do you think it's going to go before it comes crashing to the earth.

953
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,199
I think. What is it?

954
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:12,590
Uh Warren Buffett's quote about essentially your

955
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,350
ability to survive the market's irrationality.

956
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,139
No, you can't. The, the irrationality of the market will always win.

957
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:24,969
No, no, this isn't about market winning. My question is how high will Bitcoin go

958
00:38:25,189 --> 00:38:28,040
before it comes crashing down? Because you and I both believe,

959
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,350
I don't think, I don't think it will

960
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,729
crash per

961
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,350
I think we'll have, I think there will be definitely a correction.

962
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,270
But the problem is there's what's called a deflationary spiral built into

963
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,939
the currency and that there's a finite amount of the currency.

964
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:44,310
So you think the deflation will be slow and steady rather than

965
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:46,790
fire.

966
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,850
What happens if you had something like Mount

967
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,550
Gox where instead of the money being stolen,

968
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,939
the money was wiped out.

969
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:54,879
Fox got ripped off the

970
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:56,679
right.

971
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,879
Some of these Bitcoin exchanges are holding lots of coin

972
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,750
and if they, if they lost their private keys, the coin is gone. Like

973
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,010
these people are not good

974
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,159
at it has happened.

975
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,100
It's a lot of people.

976
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,600
So I my my thought is on the one hand, you have the irrationality of the market,

977
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,510
you have the,

978
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,909
the Bitcoin being used more and more for all sorts of wonky and legitimate things.

979
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:25,699
But then on the, you know, on the other side, you have this

980
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:30,219
like the money just goes away after a while because people lost

981
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:33,219
it or it got stolen and they can't spend it or whatever.

982
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,399
And I don't know what that rate is. I, you know, you'd have to have like a whole pile of.

983
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:36,939
And again,

984
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:39,580
this goes back to where I was trying to educate myself on financial markets.

985
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,820
And II, I have a general understanding of

986
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:44,810
kind of what kinds of charts and graphs I'd want to see. But I have,

987
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,659
-- I would not know how to interpret it.
-- But again, even ignoring all of that,

988
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:54,780
my suspicion is still that with the way Bitcoin works is there is a difficulty

989
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:59,540
and basically the, the network wants one Bitcoin to be generated every 10 minutes.

990
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,280
And if it takes less than 10 minutes, it raises a difficulty.

991
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,929
If it takes more than 10 minutes, it lowers it.

992
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,330
And so

993
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,860
at some point,

994
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,330
I suspect the cost of electricity

995
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,790
is going to become too expensive to be

996
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,060
actually doing any sort of legitimate Bitcoin mining

997
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,500
and, and that's when everything falls apart.

998
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,610
Well, and there's the, also the ugly fourth problem hiding in the sidelines.

999
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,629
You have a Bitcoin. How do you turn that into real money?

1000
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,489
No, seriously, because it's not

1001
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,379
because there's a lot of listeners who probably need

1002
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,530
to

1003
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:31,800
figure

1004
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,629
there are some shops that will take like Bitcoin, you can buy items there,

1005
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,070
there used to be a ton, there's a lot fewer than, than there were,

1006
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,110
you can

1007
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,030
trade them on exchanges. But

1008
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:43,169
real

1009
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:43,899
money,

1010
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,189
if you want cash. You're in trouble. I'm not gonna lie. It's hard to turn it into cash.

1011
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,000
It's, and here's the thing,

1012
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,219
you can probably turn one Bitcoin into cash on an exchange.

1013
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:56,320
But if you have, let's say 100 of them.

1014
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,090
-- Yeah. No way.
-- What if you have a million of them,

1015
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:02,179
then whatever Bitcoin Rich did, I mean,

1016
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:03,540
clue.

1017
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:07,699
But not only that, actually, I also read that the IRS in the United States

1018
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,179
is going to apply like they talk about using A I which I'm like, yeah, whatever.

1019
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:15,090
It's probably, you know, a pearl's regular expression.

1020
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,399
But, but anyway, they're,

1021
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:19,939
they're going to use technology to try to start uncovering

1022
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:23,090
-- like the real identities of people
-- that's already happened.

1023
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:26,300
Um Somebody applied A I to Bitcoin and some other

1024
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,800
-- stuff to find out sex trafficking payment for stuff
-- I heard

1025
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:29,040
about

1026
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:29,370
that

1027
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,159
and in that,

1028
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:30,689
that's

1029
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:32,189
really cool.

1030
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,760
Uh Well, and actually, so that's a funny thing too.

1031
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,280
That's something we didn't even talk about. But, but I know

1032
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,429
how Bitcoin is totally not anonymous,

1033
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:45,169
right? How it's not anonymous. But there's other things like Z cash.

1034
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:47,409
An example of an alt coin that Z cash

1035
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:51,030
actually has some really impressive anonymity built into it.

1036
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,399
So it solves some of those problems. But,

1037
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,520
oh man, we could probably have like 10 episodes about this stuff

1038
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,189
easily.

1039
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,389
-- It's so
-- complicated

1040
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:58,780
so

1041
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,290
long to

1042
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:01,389
buy Bitcoin, it can only go up just like

1043
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:01,919
that

1044
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,060
-- 2008.
-- That's

1045
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:04,760
right. Go in,

1046
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:06,100
go in hard. That's what I say.

1047
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:07,979
Sell

1048
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,439
your real estate to buy Bitcoin.

1049
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:09,719
Right.

1050
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:12,610
Exactly. Take out loans. Right. Go to your bank.

1051
00:42:14,189 --> 00:42:14,209
We

1052
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:14,469
are not

1053
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:15,500
good.

1054
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:15,939
Don't

1055
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,090
listen

1056
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,110
to anything. We say we are, we are not

1057
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:19,000
people.

1058
00:42:19,149 --> 00:42:20,800
We are also not lawyers or accountants.

1059
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,159
No, no, we're not.

1060
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:24,520
Oh,

1061
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:27,639
my goodness. I don't know, man, we'll see, I guess.

1062
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,239
And, but here's part of it too. Right. Long ago

1063
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,100
I remember saying like, Bitcoin has no future. This is dumb.

1064
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,560
And II, I had quite a bit of Bitcoin and I got rid of it all because I'm like, it just,

1065
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,280
it has no future.

1066
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,719
I, I think I traded it for like a $10 Amazon card

1067
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:40,899
and I'm like,

1068
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,790
I, I would have been Bitcoin Rich but I'm not.

1069
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:44,629
So

1070
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,949
it, it, whatever.

1071
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,110
And I still say like this,

1072
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,169
this currency has no future and it just keeps going up and I'm like,

1073
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:52,739
I'm gonna be right someday.

1074
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:57,790
-- You know,
-- I think part of it is, is for a certain set of users of money.

1075
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,780
Bitcoin really solves a lot of problems.

1076
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:03,639
And so they will continue to use it just like, like let's,

1077
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,179
there are still people who slept duffel bags full of $100 bills around.

1078
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,469
That's the thing

1079
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:15,649
I remember in the US. They changed the look of the $100 bill at one point

1080
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:20,120
and they said one of the reasons they did it is they were going to tell everyone,

1081
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:22,860
you know, the old $100 bills are no good anymore and trade them in

1082
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,699
and they figured there were,

1083
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:28,820
there was a significant portion of the economy that would become useless

1084
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,409
because they wouldn't really have a way to turn their old

1085
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:34,719
hundreds into new hundreds because everything they did was illegitimate.

1086
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,530
-- Yeah.
-- Well, I mean, you can't just show up.

1087
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:39,750
Well, that happened in, um, a couple of countries now where, you know, like Brazil,

1088
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,409
for example, where you had to, yeah, declare all your currency.

1089
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:46,189
And so people were getting their, like, housemaids and their, no, sorry,

1090
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:46,899
it was India.

1091
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,100
Remember India did that huge push to electronic currency.

1092
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,429
And so people are, like,

1093
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:54,300
trying to get their housekeepers and their maids and their chauffeurs to, like,

1094
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,159
declare money

1095
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,719
because you're only allowed to declare a certain.

1096
00:43:59,139 --> 00:43:59,580
Right?

1097
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:02,179
Because India, one of the problems they have is they can't,

1098
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:07,959
there's this huge, you know, black and gray economy that they can't collect tax on.

1099
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:12,679
Right. So, like, their government is continually broke because

1100
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,129
they, they don't have an economy that they can tax.

1101
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:16,620
Right.

1102
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,949
And so that happened.

1103
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:23,120
Um, but yeah, if you look at, uh, us $100 bills, something like, uh,

1104
00:44:23,129 --> 00:44:26,459
70% plus live outside the US,

1105
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:27,850
the

1106
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:28,270
money. That's

1107
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:28,810
crazy.

1108
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:32,379
Yeah. And that's N pr planet money. So they're probably not wrong.

1109
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,729
Yeah, they're, they're legit. I agree.

1110
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:36,310
All right.

1111
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,840
So, anyway, anyway, uh, any parting words,

1112
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,639
I think it's about time to wrap this one up.

1113
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,300
Uh, go along on beanie babies

1114
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,760
anyway.

1115
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,620
-- Uh,
-- no, that's literally all I got folks. Um,

1116
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,810
yeah, I mean, there's some good basic, uh, articles on Blockchain,

1117
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,020
especially on Wikipedia and whatnot.

1118
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,169
Probably want to read them just to get an understanding.

1119
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:02,899
-- Kind of like the web was 20 years ago
-- and let's face it. It's some cool stuff.

1120
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:06,340
I mean, I think like the CS A thing is the start of some,

1121
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,649
some new technologies we're going to see and I'm, I'm eager to see what,

1122
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:10,699
what else can come of it

1123
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:12,030
just because

1124
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:14,840
I feel like there's a lot of potential here and

1125
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,860
we just have to start uncovering some of it.

1126
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:17,959
So,

1127
00:45:18,169 --> 00:45:21,689
yeah. Well, it's, it's still a lot of it is finding those killer apps that

1128
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,639
make sense, make money and also make life easier.

1129
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,530
Exactly. And don't consume like 1/5 of the world's electricity.

1130
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:30,449
Yes,

1131
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:31,590
this is true.

1132
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:32,719
Alright.

00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:36,060
