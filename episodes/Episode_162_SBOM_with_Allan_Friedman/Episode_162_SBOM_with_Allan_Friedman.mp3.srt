Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 162

1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,590
with myself Kurt Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime,

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,310
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:15,630
Awesome. Thank you, Kurt. And I am very excited today.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,709
We have a guest,

5
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:19,790
Alan Friedman who is the director of cybersecurity

6
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:23,969
Initiatives at the National Telecommunication Information Administration.

7
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:26,049
That is a mouthful Alan welcome.

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,149
Thank you. Yeah, I'm

9
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,719
used to having to try to spell out the acronyms.

10
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:36,939
So from now on, we will just refer to your employer as the NTA I, right.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,000
That's correct. Ntiantia. I apologize.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:40,689
We're a

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,709
tiny part of the US Department of Commerce.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,189
Awesome. Very, very cool.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,639
And you are here to talk to us about a topic called software Bill of Materials,

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,520
which is something near and dear to curtain

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,299
I's heart and we speak on it often, but I will let you

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,430
explain what that means because you will do a far better job than either of us could.

19
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,659
Well, you know, it, it's not a new idea.

20
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:05,029
There's an international standard for a safety data sheet and in most of the world,

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,949
those barrels have to come with this list that says

22
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,470
here's what's in the barrel and here's what you do.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,910
If it falls over and start and gets people wet and the term

24
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:17,389
bill of materials comes from industry, it's decades old.

25
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:21,190
And if you're building a product, you need to know what parts you need.

26
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:25,529
And if you sell that product, you give an industrial context,

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,650
you give that bill of materials to the business that's downstream of you.

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,989
So if I buy

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,910
a 10 ton diesel generator today,

30
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:37,349
it will come with a list of every nut in every bolt so that

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,110
I know how to plan for owning it for the next 20 years.

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,400
But chances are if I buy that generator today,

33
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,959
it's going to be connected to the internet

34
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,080
and

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,690
I have zero insight

36
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:52,680
into what's in the software stack or what

37
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,160
are the third party components that are used?

38
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:55,959
And are they

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,309
the freshest and latest ingredients

40
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:02,680
or are they old and rotten and may do you know some harm to me in mine?

41
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:03,279
Yeah,

42
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,199
I bought a bunch of iot stuff with the explicit

43
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,100
understanding that I have no idea what's in this garbage

44
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,179
like straight up,

45
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,770
you know, and at one point while Josh had talked about this, but I had to basically,

46
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:17,039
I had to hard reset all my light bulbs in my house to get them working again.

47
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:17,559
I,

48
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,630
I remember hearing about that story, long time listener, first time interviewing.

49
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:22,800
Awesome. Awesome.

50
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,199
I guess my question is, yeah, I've noticed in life.

51
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,960
Everything I buy that I either put in my body or like on my body,

52
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,160
like skin products or whatever, you know, diapers for my kids back in the day.

53
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,089
Either the, yeah,

54
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,740
there's either an ingredient listing on the package that is comprehensive or

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,660
there's like a 1 800 number I can call and they're,

56
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,559
you know, pretty much immediate with.

57
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,279
Oh, ok. It contains and then they start reading.

58
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:44,080
How did the software industry avoid all that?

59
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,169
Well, I,

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:45,789
you know,

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,524
we you can spend a lot of time and you guys

62
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:51,115
have uh talking about the challenges of the software world,

63
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:52,865
but I think there are a couple of reasons

64
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:56,585
that are pretty evident about why we don't have this today.

65
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:00,035
Uh The first is actually comes out of the open source world

66
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:01,664
which is licenses.

67
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,074
I don't know

68
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:06,315
how many companies around the world until

69
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:08,815
quite recently could honestly say that they

70
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:12,154
knew all of the licenses that they were shipping and that they in fact,

71
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:14,625
were up to date and had the right permissions to use all of them.

72
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,029
I think that's in 2019. A much better understood risk,

73
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,289
right? That's something that

74
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:22,250
uh in the enterprise level,

75
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,630
every corporate risk officer thinks about very few folks in the start up land.

76
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,720
You know that if you go to exit, someone's going to be asking you for this.

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,550
There are tools that will do this automatically that can scan binary

78
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,649
and can scan reposes and sort of look to map licenses.

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,029
The open source community itself has become quite aware of this challenge, right?

80
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,330
You've got a lovely little project that you're working on and

81
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,770
along comes someone who commits some code to help out.

82
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:50,809
And it's wonderful until you realize. Oh wait,

83
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,470
that was GP L code. What do we do now?

84
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:56,119
And I think that's now a much better understood.

85
00:03:56,679 --> 00:04:01,110
One of the other reasons that we don't have this today is right.

86
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,429
Transparency makes people uncomfortable. Folks.

87
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,869
Given the option of sharing more data or sharing less data.

88
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,710
Most people are going to share less data, right? You get less risk by doing nothing.

89
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,750
There are a couple of ways that we can think around that. One of them is

90
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,290
no one has ever said I want less data, right?

91
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,309
Everyone wants to share, everyone wants the data themselves,

92
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,309
but no one wants to share it downstream.

93
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,869
And so we've tried to frame this issue

94
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:30,570
as a supply chain issue

95
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,750
and most of us are actually in the middle of the supply chain, right?

96
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,989
We take software from other people, we do stuff to it, we add to it

97
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,709
and then we often send it downstream and no one really knows where they are, right?

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,429
If you make an operating system, is that going to be used by

99
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,744
the customer itself or is it going to be folded into a

100
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,684
device that then that's going to be handed on to a customer.

101
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:55,644
So we're trying to help people appreciate that.

102
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:59,084
We're all in the middle of a supply chain and if we want the information,

103
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,845
we can sort of share it downstream as well. Nice.

104
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:04,765
I can totally relate to this, especially the licensing piece,

105
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:07,404
Kurt and I were both at Red Hat for a very long time.

106
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,440
And

107
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,529
obviously when you're shipping an open source operating system,

108
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,850
the licenses that were contained within it were a huge deal.

109
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:18,329
And that's something we paid an enormous amount of attention to now,

110
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,720
I guess from your perspective.

111
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,119
So we, we kind of understand the problem and I think

112
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,019
there aren't a lot of people in the industry today who don't get this,

113
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:28,380
which is great because I think even five years ago, people were like, what now,

114
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,420
what who I can't just use this stuff for free, what's going on?

115
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:35,339
So I guess from, from your angle. So what are you doing about it now?

116
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,850
Because this is a monumental problem. I think in a lot of places

117
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:43,600
and I like your, your term monumental because I think it helps capture the scope.

118
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:47,380
This isn't just a problem for one corner of the ecosystem.

119
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:49,160
This is something that affects us all.

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,850
And so our approach was to say, you know, let's let's swing for the fences,

121
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:58,679
let's try to capture the entire ecosystem as part of this discussion.

122
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,790
And we did that for a number of reasons. One because it faces all of us. But also

123
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:07,929
we saw that different corners of the digital world

124
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,299
were starting to advance this idea.

125
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,670
And one of the things that we at the Department of Commerce were worried about is,

126
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:15,980
oh, look,

127
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,579
there are some folks in the healthcare space

128
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:19,670
talking about doing a solution for health care.

129
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,119
Oh, look, some folks in the national security community which you know, works in,

130
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,320
in that vertical are interested in doing in that space.

131
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:29,459
And oh look, there's some open source folks that have their own solution

132
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:35,339
that's going to segment and fragment and that will lead to all of us being worse off.

133
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,000
And so we said, let's try to get everyone around the same table.

134
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,390
Now, us department of Commerce is one of the parts of the US government that

135
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:43,859
likes markets.

136
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,850
We, we like uh sort of open and productive ecosystems.

137
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,640
We like that magical word innovation,

138
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,369
but we also recognize that sometimes markets fail, right?

139
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,320
We talk about a security failure or market failure in security.

140
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:02,420
And so one of the things that I try to do in my role is to say,

141
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:07,950
how can the government catalyze solutions to market failures without regulation?

142
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,519
My corner of the government tends to try to say,

143
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,820
let's let's try to avoid regulation if we can.

144
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:13,989
So,

145
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:17,450
you know, and, and by the way, even if I wanted regulation,

146
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,029
no one gave me any legal authority to tell anyone to do anything.

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,350
So I don't have that power even if we wanted to. Now, no one gave me a budget either.

148
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,190
So if I can't

149
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,200
tell anyone to do anything

150
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,190
and I can't pay anyone to do anything,

151
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,679
the solution that we came up with is trying to

152
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,529
bring enough people in the room who want to make progress

153
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,859
and who believe that progress is better than the alternative, which could be

154
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:46,299
more dangerous regulation down the road from the US government,

155
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:47,309
from another government

156
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,929
uh that they said, let's try to do this on our terms, on the community's terms.

157
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,019
And so we have this thing that we call the multi stakeholder process.

158
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,290
And if you roll your eyes hearing it,

159
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,700
I'm the guy who has to say it day in and day out. But I think it the spirit behind it

160
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,950
is valuable, which is

161
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:10,579
let's convene and try to let the experts in the community

162
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:16,380
open source software, commercial software embedded devices.

163
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,779
And of course the end customer, you know, in this case, I mean,

164
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,260
the enterprise customer and talk about how this data can be useful to all of us.

165
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:28,109
Awesome. And now you guys run kind of day long workshops.

166
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:28,815
Noticed.

167
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:29,734
Yeah, here and that you do,

168
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:33,075
you're very good about allowing remote individuals to participate,

169
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:33,974
which is really cool.

170
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:37,065
So why don't as part of this? Why why don't you let, let's go the next step.

171
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,804
Now explain kind of what that means and how you've implemented it.

172
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:43,494
So our process starts with trying to

173
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:45,575
identify the problem. I I

174
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,030
I'm not trying to look at all of software security.

175
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,159
We're not trying to solve all of supply chain security. We're looking at this one

176
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:53,780
quote

177
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,520
unquote narrow problem

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,960
of what is transparency look like for third party software components.

179
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:04,080
Now, obviously, folks who know software know that's a big deal,

180
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,599
but we've tried to scope it well.

181
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,559
And then we work very hard to reach out to the broader community to say, hey,

182
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,979
we're having this conversation come play in our pool.

183
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:18,070
And if you can't make it to a meeting, we try to webcast,

184
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,559
we have a live call bridge so that folks can weigh in.

185
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,039
And from those initial meetings,

186
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,359
the community itself defines

187
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,799
how they want to approach the problem.

188
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,710
The analogy I like is, is we push but we don't steer.

189
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,900
I work very hard to make sure that this is a community led initiative.

190
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,320
And my job is to help make sure the the conversation moves forward

191
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,840
that we're not ignoring the minority voices.

192
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,919
But at the same time, any public process you have

193
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:50,690
uh you know,

194
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,830
outspoken is the generous term I think for the certain type of voice that's great.

195
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,450
And we try to make sure that those people don't

196
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,479
derail the conversation that we can continue to make progress.

197
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:06,239
So one question I have is so as a as a consumer, like an end consumer,

198
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,200
not even a very big one.

199
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:13,030
How can I find if the vendor publishes this data or you know, has it available?

200
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,340
Like is I, is there a registry of vendors that do this or is there some,

201
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,590
you know, standard I can look for on their website, some key term or something?

202
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:25,780
Oh, this is, this is a great question and I and the bad news,

203
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:26,700
I don't think we're there yet.

204
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,099
Right? We were talking about why

205
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,219
we don't have this today.

206
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:36,500
And I think one of the challenges is a very old chicken and egg problem, which is

207
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,239
no one is asking for it. So no one provides it,

208
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:41,539
no one provides it. So no one is asking for it.

209
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:43,719
And so a large part of this

210
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,299
is to shape

211
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:47,809
what do we mean by this and create

212
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,609
a market expectation.

213
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,969
And so to do that, we've had different working groups,

214
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,289
tackle it from different angles.

215
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,179
So one of them is just, hey, what is an S bomb?

216
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,229
We had this idea in our head or at least most of the people

217
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,739
who have been thinking about this all had some idea in their head.

218
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,599
But actually building out

219
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,200
the white board model, the shared vision took a while.

220
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,710
It took, you know,

221
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:13,500
69 months to figure out which part of the edge

222
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,599
cases we want to explicitly include which parts we don't,

223
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,479
what is a minimum, viable look like?

224
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:21,349
What are the things that we're going to save? For further down the road.

225
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:28,739
And so today we are now in a position where if you say I want an S bomb,

226
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,979
I have a much better chance of knowing what you mean.

227
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,919
I want to interrupt for one moment for those of you who are slow like me uh S bomb.

228
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,469
It took me longer than, than I'm proud of

229
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:38,799
SBA

230
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:40,830
is software bill of materials, right?

231
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:43,059
That's correct. And thank you for

232
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:43,239
a

233
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,590
couple of points on S bomb. One.

234
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,309
If you're on a bad phone connection,

235
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,130
it sounds like the other person is talking about F bombs a lot.

236
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,049
That's awesome.

237
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,789
The other thing I've learned is you've got to be very careful talking about

238
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,419
this particular issue while you're pacing around in an airport because you know,

239
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:01,700
talking about delivery of the bomb and how we're going to make the bomb.

240
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,460
That's just you. Yeah,

241
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,450
-- you don't want to go there. That's epic.
-- So as well.

242
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,229
Here's a question then what exactly is an S bomb?

243
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:14,140
Because like I'm thinking of it from the open source world of, well, I mean,

244
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,229
like a Ruby or Rails application might be a

245
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,159
good example where you'd have like a GEM file

246
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,140
saying no

247
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Gary or whatever, you know,

248
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,820
equal to or greater than or approximately version X

249
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,169
and then you build your software and you actually

250
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,260
get the gem lock that actually shows what you

251
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:32,539
ended up with.

252
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,349
And

253
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,869
I mean, is that an S bomb?

254
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:35,299
-- An
-- S

255
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,510
balm is the dependence component, the dependent components

256
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,109
and in graph form. So

257
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:47,270
what do we mean by that? So first, let's take a look at what a component is.

258
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,320
Component is a unit of software

259
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:53,030
that I use to build software that I didn't write. And again,

260
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,070
trying to cover as broad a terrain as possible but still limited.

261
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,750
So we're not talking about standards that you're implementing,

262
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:01,919
we're talking about things.

263
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,909
We, we use the verb include a lot.

264
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,460
Now we talk about a component,

265
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:10,030
what do we mean by a component unit of software that is definable

266
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,440
and identifiable.

267
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,950
Now, that gets us to one of the first challenges here, which is that naming

268
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,039
is a hard problem

269
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,539
in, you know, 3040 years of digital world.

270
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,809
We've solved naming

271
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,669
pretty much only once

272
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,719
and I can

273
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,419
has a budget of tens of millions of dollars to run the DNS, right.

274
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,590
DNS is how we can actually guarantee

275
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:39,159
that something is uniquely namable and reachable.

276
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,049
Every other solution that you come across in the naming world

277
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,059
involves.

278
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:48,299
Oh, this is easy, everyone just do what I do and of course, that doesn't scale.

279
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,859
So I'll give you an example of the naming problem. Are you using com dot sun dot Java

280
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,580
or com dot oracle dot Java?

281
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,260
Well, depends on when you started keeping your records.

282
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,880
There are so many different churn variables

283
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:05,880
in how we think about the organizational structure of software companies get

284
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,469
bought and sold uh projects get renamed projects get folded into other projects

285
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:11,090
that

286
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,250
saying

287
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,409
that we have a definitive name says that's a hard problem.

288
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,130
Not one I want to add that we are solving today.

289
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:20,169
The ultimate solution

290
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:25,229
is going to look something like federation ruby, you handle ruby names,

291
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:30,640
node, you handle node names this project or you know this open source foundation,

292
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,210
you think about names in there and then we have some sort of federation

293
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,859
to have unique regions

294
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:40,599
and then also rely on a number of canonical sources of aliasing, right?

295
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:44,479
This project is also known as this project is also known as this project.

296
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:45,530
So we've got our component

297
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,270
ideally, well, it has to have a version number.

298
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,919
Ideally, you've got a hash as well. That way I can verify that. Oh Yep,

299
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,770
we're talking about the same piece of software.

300
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,460
You didn't go and grab something from github

301
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,989
that had been back doored. We, we're talking about the same piece.

302
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,869
Now we have to put it in our graph

303
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:06,195
of dependencies, right? So my software uses this component,

304
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:08,505
it includes this component.

305
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:12,674
That component in turn includes the further on component,

306
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:18,005
this gets to the first question, which is how deep in the graph or the tree

307
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,455
do we want to go?

308
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:20,635
Obviously,

309
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,380
-- we want to go pretty deep, a stupid
-- question. Don't you want the whole thing?

310
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,989
I mean, I know, for example, with, um there was one product I was dealing with which,

311
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,520
you know, pulled in Kubernetes and one or two other things,

312
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,200
which meant it had something on the order

313
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,390
of 2000 software components being pulled in.

314
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,219
Now, you know, whether or not they're actually being used

315
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:40,799
by the ultimate software pulling them all in.

316
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,510
I'm, I'm not 100% certain, but don't you need to know all the ingredients kind of,

317
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,429
even if they're,

318
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,250
I don't know what's the word I want to use like inert or not being used,

319
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,770
but you need to know they're there, especially from a licensing point of view.

320
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,700
-- So
-- uh you know, I've had one security expert who said,

321
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,020
I want to know what's in my product all the way down to the sand.

322
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,770
That is an admirable goal.

323
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,789
One of the tradeoffs that folks made early on

324
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:02,950
was this

325
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,789
tension between completeness

326
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,080
and adoption,

327
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:12,380
especially when you're dealing with the commercial domain, right?

328
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,659
If in open source,

329
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:18,190
it's a little easier to be complete because depending on your build environment,

330
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,690
right? This is just make with a couple of extra flags,

331
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:23,359
github will do a lot of this today

332
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,030
uh automatically. And that's great. The challenge.

333
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,700
However, is if you have a choice between

334
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,419
completeness or adoption stakeholders early on

335
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:36,559
said I'd rather adoption and recursion.

336
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,270
So I

337
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:41,159
asked for my supplier one layer down

338
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:42,520
and ask

339
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:42,880
them

340
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:45,799
to get one layer down and so on.

341
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,500
Now there's going to be tension there just be some times where

342
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,229
I don't have the market power

343
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:55,070
to say, hey, I want this or there's going to be levels where it's opaque.

344
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,390
And the important thing is to acknowledge, to explicitly build into your model,

345
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,630
what you know and what you don't know.

346
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:04,380
And that's the final piece that we've tried to define

347
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,510
is

348
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,589
explicitly acknowledging

349
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:08,469
when

350
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:14,890
a component is a leaf in the tree, it has no further sub components. And when,

351
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,469
hey, I'm using this component

352
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:19,560
and I simply make no assertion about what's in that component.

353
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,260
So basically trying to turn all your unknown unknowns into at least known unknowns.

354
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:27,420
And then I guess shooting for what's practical over what's perfect.

355
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,739
Which, yeah, I know, I,

356
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,229
that makes a certain amount of sense there,

357
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,829
there's even a term good enough for government work.

358
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,849
But uh no,

359
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,380
in all seriousness, I think a

360
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:41,489
lot of the things that we are caring about if we're trying to staunch the bleeding,

361
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,430
a lot of this is, you know, what are the high level things that I'm worrying about?

362
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:49,290
You know, if, if it's a medical device, what's the operating system?

363
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,050
Right? If, if, if you know there's something that's keeping

364
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:54,540
someone alive in a power plant,

365
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,260
we should have a good idea of if we know for a fact that it's been end of life,

366
00:17:59,439 --> 00:17:59,890
now,

367
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,420
there's a lot of important stuff that is going to be deeply buried,

368
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:06,819
right? You know, what is the next left pad

369
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:09,130
that you and your organization need to worry about.

370
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,119
Well, that involves going pretty deep in the tree.

371
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,079
Uh And so that's the tension

372
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
of the minimum versus what we can hope to expect

373
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,359
either because we've got

374
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:20,410
people who care about security

375
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:23,280
or because we've succeeded in pushing adoption.

376
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:26,479
-- So
-- one question then have you worked with?

377
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:26,609
Um,

378
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,439
because I know this is something that's now kind of

379
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:31,560
finally coming into C I and CD BUILD systems.

380
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,290
I know some of the security scanners obviously

381
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,689
will try and figure out what you're shipping,

382
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,790
what version it is and warn you if it's out of date.

383
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,479
But more in general,

384
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,199
it seems to me like if you're going to build

385
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,400
an S bomb, you know, the,

386
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,459
the compile time is the place to do it because you

387
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:48,640
would actually know what's going in and what's not going in.

388
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,020
Yeah, a number of them are, a number of them are, you know, are,

389
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,800
are bigger proponents in this space.

390
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,920
And I think, you know, especially in the C I CD approach,

391
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:00,430
it just knowing what you're shipping,

392
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,859
not just at time of build, but at time of, right, that's been a big emphasis.

393
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:07,829
I think you're hearing a lot of folks

394
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,119
in the in the tool vendor space talk about left of boom, right?

395
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,880
How do you or shift left?

396
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:15,530
I think there's even a company by that name,

397
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,349
right? How do you empower people as their writing to know what's in there?

398
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:25,869
If your if your process involves blacklists or banned software or even, you know,

399
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,069
white lists for certain types of software,

400
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,030
then yes,

401
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,150
you absolutely need to be tracking this as you're writing and integrating

402
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,449
-- it into a process
-- because the one thing I'm realizing is I,

403
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:36,229
I don't,

404
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:39,069
there's no easy way to do this. It seems right.

405
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,229
It requires quite a bit of maturity in the software process

406
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,239
and having, yeah, those automated tools to make this happen.

407
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,530
And I mean, my understanding of most of the industries,

408
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,439
most of the industry is not that sophisticated.

409
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:53,310
I mean, the whole,

410
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,650
the fact that C I CD is still a new thing for many people.

411
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,770
-- No,
-- I think you're exactly right.

412
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,369
This is going to require tooling because it has to be done in an automated fashion.

413
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,930
Part of it is understanding the differences in who we're dealing with.

414
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:10,569
This is one of those areas that if you're

415
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:14,339
a newer organization and you've got a more modern process,

416
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:15,729
you're a smaller company,

417
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,650
this is actually going to be much easier for you.

418
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,969
You're using some of these up to date tools. I've mentioned that, you know,

419
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:21,680
github

420
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,250
will not only, you know, build your dependency graph, but they'll flag thing,

421
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,680
they'll flag libraries against which there's a CV E.

422
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:32,579
So that's great. If you're an older company, if you're an enterprise

423
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:36,125
and you know, your build pipeline has 18 steps

424
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:38,244
and it's, you know,

425
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:40,704
there are 18 different parts of your company that need

426
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,864
to sign off before you go to Gold Master.

427
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,564
Yeah. There, it's going to be a lot harder to shift this.

428
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:46,494
Fortunately,

429
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,454
those are the sorts of organizations that are realizing

430
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,535
that they need to get ahead of it at

431
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:50,964
the commercial level.

432
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,885
It's quite interesting to think how few companies in the

433
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:58,645
world who make software can actually answer the following question.

434
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,599
Do you ship Library X

435
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,109
coming from the CV world?

436
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,469
It was funny because there were always the three cases of number one,

437
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:07,510
the software so obscure, probably nobody ships it.

438
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,829
Number two,

439
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,680
everybody ships it like it's g

440
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,609
lipsy or open SSL libraries.

441
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:15,819
And then of course, the third case, the more common one where, yeah, we,

442
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:16,810
we have no idea.

443
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:17,520
And you know,

444
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,579
I think there's some really great high profile examples recently of VX works used in

445
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:27,750
just a huge number of satellite uplinks and medical devices and I CS tools.

446
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,869
One, how many people know that they have

447
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:31,520
in their organization? Right?

448
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:31,969
It's, it's,

449
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:36,969
it's buried deep in these things that are in turn buried deep in other things.

450
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:39,489
But two, some of the vulnerabilities in that

451
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,750
that were identified in VX works are actually open source

452
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,479
components that are in related products elsewhere in the industry.

453
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,689
And that's really the vision of trying to get visibility down into that.

454
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,930
What we do with that data,

455
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,979
how we use it is going to depend on where we are.

456
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:59,349
So let's compare, you know, a, a hospital

457
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,880
and a cloud deployment from a cloud deployment perspective.

458
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,489
It's not even clear what

459
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:07,280
your enterprise customer can do with this data.

460
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,609
I understand what you as a service vendor can do with it, right?

461
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:15,520
You need to be able to answer that question yourself. You know, what could

462
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:16,839
G suite

463
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,640
or sales force tell you that would help you make a risk based decision.

464
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,300
And at the other end of the food chain, if you're someone's, you know,

465
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,060
you're using an outdated web

466
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,489
app.

467
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,949
So the supplier has just

468
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,099
laughed the thing eight ways from Sunday,

469
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:34,709
but the whole thing sits on struts. What do you,

470
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,500
what do you communicate

471
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,579
to

472
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:38,849
your customer

473
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,020
so that they can make a good decision?

474
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,510
-- So
-- it's funny you mentioned this because I'm just

475
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,459
actually in the process of writing a report,

476
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:47,079
the CV for cloud services interim report,

477
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:49,530
which has we have the exact same questions, right?

478
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,050
So, ok, so I

479
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:54,032
there's a vulnerability in this cloud service, what can the

480
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:56,493
end customer actually do about it? You know, what do they care?

481
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:59,703
And I think at a minimum, it boils down to going back to transparency,

482
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,253
then they can make a decision about whether or

483
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:03,062
not they're actually going to use this product.

484
00:23:03,072 --> 00:23:04,473
And I think also,

485
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:04,973
well,

486
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:09,483
if I have two providers and one can and is willing to tell me what all

487
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:13,552
is in their service versus one who either cannot tell me or will not tell me,

488
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:15,926
you know, that speaks to the maturity and their capability.

489
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:16,485
Right?

490
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:19,166
Or even a case of where, you know, you,

491
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:21,985
you maybe have a third party auditor confirm that they know what's in it.

492
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:24,995
You know, I don't need to know what's in the service, but I need to know that, you know,

493
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,605
what's in the service you're publishing.

494
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:27,916
I mean, if I was going to bet money,

495
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:29,326
I would bet a large amount of money that there

496
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:32,936
are cloud service providers out there that don't actually know what's

497
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:37,755
-- in their services
-- agree completely. And I think you, you hit the, the,

498
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:40,189
you hit on our vision,

499
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,280
which is this has to be driven by market forces,

500
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,910
uh especially if we want to try to avoid

501
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,310
uh some regulation. So

502
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,239
today we're seeing it in a few organizations.

503
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:58,069
So for example, one of the biggest banks in the United States

504
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,030
already asks

505
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,709
for an S bomb. Now,

506
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,709
they don't care what format you give it to them.

507
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,729
They've just found

508
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,089
that if you can't produce it,

509
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,979
your development process is probably shoddy enough that it's going to

510
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:17,939
increase their costs of using your software and maintaining your software.

511
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:19,479
So

512
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:23,800
there and again, this is in the commercial world, they're gonna take 5 to 10%

513
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,319
off the top of your asking price

514
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,079
just based on the fact that you cannot produce

515
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:29,599
an S

516
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:29,839
bomb.

517
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,040
And I love that approach because it's sort of really driving home.

518
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,109
Hey, this is a good signal of process.

519
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,819
And I think the same is true in open source if I am building a project

520
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:42,280
and I'm trying to choose between two components

521
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,819
and one of them has the internal governance to say

522
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,219
yes, these are all components. We're making sure we're looking,

523
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,979
we're looking upstream,

524
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:55,930
we're making sure that whenever one of our components that we depend on

525
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,380
is updated, we're, we're doing

526
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:03,140
the refactoring. That's, that's a good, a sign of good quality.

527
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,060
And we're starting to see more and more organizations look

528
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,819
to that when they think about open source security.

529
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:10,260
So I guess my question would be why?

530
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:14,530
Well, I, I don't want to say you don't sound like you're against regulation,

531
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,880
but it sounds, would it be correct to say you sort of

532
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:21,439
-- regulation is a last resort?
-- I think that's a great way of saying it. Uh

533
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:27,069
I, my view and I'm going to make it clear, this is not speaking for any,

534
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,609
any governmental agency.

535
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,729
I think that we think you can think of it as a bell shaped curve

536
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,930
where you've got the leaders

537
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,640
in security, like leadership and security is never driven by government action.

538
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,349
So what we're trying to do today

539
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:47,329
is get the folks who are on the forefront of security to start thinking about this

540
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:49,099
so that we can understand how it's done.

541
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,489
We should

542
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:50,650
at

543
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,550
all costs,

544
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,079
try to avoid regulation when we don't know what it is that we're asking for.

545
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,699
Then as we sort of get into the middle of that

546
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,609
bell curve and more and more organizations are adopting it,

547
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,260
then we start to think about standards, draft contract language,

548
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,459
making it easier and cheaper for folks to adopt climb that adoption curve.

549
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:14,219
For me, the best approach to regulation is when we don't see that massive adoption

550
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,770
or when you just have some recalcitrate laggards at the end of the curve,

551
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,300
then you go after them with a stick.

552
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,989
I like that. That makes a lot of sense.

553
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,109
As you've been talking,

554
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,359
I keep thinking you're dealing with the best of the best regulation

555
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:28,910
is kind of how you tie them up and drag them along.

556
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,150
I know, I know so many orgs and you're, you're filling me with hope.

557
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:34,390
But I think back to the,

558
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,699
some of the things I've seen and these people are only going to

559
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,949
get on board if you force them to and drag them along.

560
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:44,910
Well, my other thought is we talk about regulation, but I

561
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,160
we're making sort of an implicit assumption that

562
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,130
it is good regulation that there's no,

563
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,780
for example, Gamification of the system or,

564
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,189
you know, uh unintended consequences that result in, you know,

565
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,180
everybody breeding more snakes and rats

566
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:03,020
-- to, to get the bounty on them or whatever.
-- Love, I love that story, right?

567
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,989
Perverse incentives are,

568
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,160
are a big part of it. You know, my, my phd is in, in applied economics.

569
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,780
So something I'm very aware of is is mechanism design.

570
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,280
But I think the, the other part of it is

571
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:18,180
if we're going to be asking everyone to do something,

572
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,079
we've got to be able to tell a story that it's turnkey

573
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,219
or at least cheaper and easier.

574
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:27,880
And so now that we've sort of fleshed out, this is what it is.

575
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,359
The next pivot is talking about tooling. How do we generate the data?

576
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,500
And you guys already talked about the importance of

577
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,900
thinking about the different your different build processes.

578
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,660
And then of course, how do we consume this data? Right?

579
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,099
The goal is to make sure that it's actually useful.

580
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,979
We're not having transparency for its own sake.

581
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,199
And so

582
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:47,780
if you know one of the things we're doing

583
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,670
is talking to the vulnerability management solution providers,

584
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,979
you know, rapid seven

585
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,020
q less tenable folks like that could actually

586
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,189
use this data to better protect their customers.

587
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,910
And once we know that this data can be useful,

588
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,270
then more and more people I think are going to start asking for it.

589
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,969
I love it. OK? I think we're nearing the end of our time.

590
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:09,849
I have one last question for you, Alan that I think everyone is wondering

591
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:14,459
where on earth did you get that fabulous jacket you wear at conferences?

592
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,469
Uh That, that started from the, the

593
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,219
the answer is quite boring.

594
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:22,900
I it was, it was just a lucky Amazon find,

595
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,489
but it started off because I wanted to start doing more policy discussions at

596
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,180
hacker conferences

597
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:33,780
and most policy discussions are really boring.

598
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,890
One of the things that I've never understood is

599
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:38,449
Washington DC is supposed to be full of,

600
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:39,359
you know, all of the,

601
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:42,979
the extroverts and the class presidents who are supposed to be good communicators

602
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,140
and events in Washington

603
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:49,114
are really tedious, even for people who love policy. That is really boring.

604
00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:51,584
Whereas you go to most hacker conferences,

605
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:56,324
the introverts who don't talk to anyone all day, just give spectacular talks.

606
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:56,484
Right?

607
00:28:56,494 --> 00:29:00,875
I think we don't appreciate how good quality most of the presentations we see are.

608
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:04,604
So I was trying to make policy panels interesting and I came

609
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:06,405
up with the idea of doing it as a game show.

610
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:09,744
And so that's why I got the shiny gold game show host jacket

611
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,949
and it's since become a way of making sure that people

612
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,839
who want to find me at a conference can find me

613
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,189
and that people aren't too afraid of the fact that

614
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:21,359
just because some random guy works for the US government,

615
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:23,229
he doesn't take himself too seriously.

616
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,160
That is absolutely fantastic.

617
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,359
So for those who want to get involved in the

618
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,719
bomb is what's the best way for them to get a hold

619
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,910
of you or to look at what the work you're doing is,

620
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:38,489
-- it
-- would be spectacular to have more folks, especially from the open

621
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:39,380
source community

622
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:42,250
involved in this process. It is open.

623
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,319
Anyone can join the easiest way to do it is to first check out

624
00:29:46,512 --> 00:29:50,363
the documents that are already published on our website and then shoot me an email.

625
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:53,322
My email is on the website and I'm happy to bring anyone who's

626
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,463
interested up to speed and I can tell you about the different working groups

627
00:29:56,723 --> 00:30:00,072
and how you can get involved. Ok. So let's wrap this one up.

628
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:03,863
Thank you so much, Alan for joining us. It has been an absolute pleasure.
