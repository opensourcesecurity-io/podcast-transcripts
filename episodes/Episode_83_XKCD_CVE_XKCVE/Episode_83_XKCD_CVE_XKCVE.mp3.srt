Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast episode 83 with myself Kurt

1
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,869
Siefried and my partner in Thought Crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,329
So, did you see that? Marvelous XK CD, Comic Kurt.

3
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:19,079
Yes, I did. And

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,229
I checked and I don't believe I actually have anything actionable to do with it.

5
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:27,600
-- And,
-- and what sort of actionable things do you expect to take away from that?

6
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:31,440
Uh Well, no, some of these could if they are true, be CV worthy.

7
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,469
It's a comic man. None of these are true.

8
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,119
Um Da da da da, da,

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:37,360
da,

10
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:37,669
da, da

11
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:37,830
da

12
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:38,950
da.

13
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:41,369
Technically speaking, for example,

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,490
the one in the middle critical under Linux 3.14

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,229
0.8 on system 390 UTC plus 14 times zone,

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,259
a local user could

17
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:49,900
potentially use a buffer overflow to change another user,

18
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,259
default system clock from 12 hour to 24 hour time.

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,209
Technically speaking, that violates the trust boundary

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,819
is that my assumption is that's not, well, I don't think any of these are real bugs,

21
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,259
right?

22
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,330
That's why I was looking at them and I was like, damn it like,

23
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,650
ok, start over with, what are we talking about,

24
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,089
-- ok, let's start there and then we'll, we'll go on.
-- Ok.

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,169
So XK CD is a, an online comic and if you don't know what it is,

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,209
why are you listening to this podcast would be my first question.

27
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,459
Yes, it's marvelous.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,019
Yeah. Uh, so they, they, they do a lot of very, uh topical

29
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,970
uh comics about, you know, very technical topics like black holes or, you know,

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,449
what happens if you pitch a baseball at the speed of light.

31
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,459
And the answer is it basically it's bad, don't do that.

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,480
And so in this case, they uh they kind of do

33
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:42,305
spoofed,

34
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:46,105
leaked list of major 2018 security vulnerabilities in the

35
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:49,464
form of CV E hyphen 2018 hyphen question marks

36
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:51,614
and then with a description after it

37
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:54,275
and um some of them are quite humorous and some of them are,

38
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:59,014
-- well, like I said, if they were, if they were true, they would technically need a CV
-- E.

39
00:01:59,375 --> 00:01:59,735
Yes.

40
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:03,824
Well, ok, look, they're, they're purposely comical, right?

41
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,120
This stuff isn't,

42
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,230
it's not.

43
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,500
II I looked at this and you were saying you were,

44
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,860
you were looking at it to see if there's any actionable items.

45
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,039
And I looked at this and thought

46
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:16,149
this is cleverly funny. It never even

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,830
occurred to me that any of this was real and I, I don't think it was supposed to be real,

48
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,160
right?

49
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,520
No, I'm pretty sure it's not.

50
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,990
But I mean, for example,

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,860
if Apple products did actually catch fire

52
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:29,500
when displaying emoji with diacritics again.

53
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:29,789
I mean,

54
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,160
there were those sun servers that I believe

55
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,710
the phrase they used was unanticipated thermal event,

56
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,160
uh, which was code speak for the power supplies caught fire,

57
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,490
right?

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,470
Uh You know, so like this potentially, I mean, well, the old comical error message,

59
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,320
you know, uh what is it?

60
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,699
LPT one on fire

61
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,960
which apparently was put in there because that was a

62
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,770
potential thing with some old tiny high speed lines.

63
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,839
Which actually, you know, what's funny is, is

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,369
long ago

65
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:03,770
there was a, a fire in a data center

66
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:08,410
and I remember someone shared around the, the logs of the Cisco router

67
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,679
and you could see the temperature on the router continuing to raise and the router,

68
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,279
of course, you know, screaming in the log, the temperature is too high,

69
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,190
the temperature is too high.

70
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,220
And it's like, yes, that's because like there's literally a fire.

71
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,460
That is why the temperature is too high.

72
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,300
Yeah, I remember that that was the uh the University of

73
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,160
uh what is it

74
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:25,350
in,

75
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:25,750
in,

76
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:27,630
in the Netherlands, was

77
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:27,880
it?

78
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:32,770
Yeah, that fire actually knocked out a big chunk of internet for Europe at the time.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,729
How exciting.

80
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,779
Yeah. Generally you're not supposed to keep firing your data center, you probably

81
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:39,149
outside

82
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,699
the data center.

83
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,309
That's what that fancy halon

84
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:43,679
systems for. Right.

85
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:44,149
Yeah.

86
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,410
Well,

87
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,380
and technically you're not supposed to use those anymore because they kill people.

88
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,619
So you're supposed to use water,

89
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,240
which is super good for computers anyway. Anyway. So, back to XK CD here is,

90
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,179
so, you know what the first thing is when I looked at this, my thoughts were, is

91
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,940
he's pretty harsh on Apple

92
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,050
when you, when you read this list, like it's not kind to Apple.

93
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:04,759
Uh,

94
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:05,270
yeah.

95
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:09,220
No, I mean, well, I think Apple, like a lot of vendors plays up the, we're secure,

96
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,160
we're secure.

97
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,149
By the way, here's a big list of security updates. Just please install it quickly.

98
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:18,329
Well, not only that there was the recent, uh, was it an Emoji or Unico?

99
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,600
It was a Unico character, right?

100
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,429
That could like crash any Apple device, minor bug.

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:23,910
Yeah,

102
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,929
it's, I'm always shocked at how some of these things escape.

103
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,470
Like I get that it's not easy to test some of these. But

104
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,190
yeah, when,

105
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,829
when it's like typing a character crashes the system or hangs it or whatever

106
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,950
or like that thing where they kind of messed up the route pass,

107
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,075
you know, uh, and anybody could basically just, you know,

108
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:41,114
try and do some administrative function and if they hit,

109
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,684
cancel enough times they were let out.

110
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:45,035
-- I remember
-- that one that was hilarious.

111
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:47,204
And, you know, and some of these are

112
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:50,244
not so much, well, they're not CV E worthy because they're like, you know,

113
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:51,994
they're operational issues like, uh

114
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:53,869
uh but

115
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,570
like, here's a good one and oversight and the rules allows a dog to join a baseball,

116
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,730
uh, basketball team.

117
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:01,399
Right. You know, I, I assume that's a reference to everybody.

118
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:02,869
Um,

119
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,540
and that's actually something I've been looking at is, you know,

120
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:08,730
should we be looking at expanding the scope of CVS

121
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:11,380
beyond software into services and maybe even business process?

122
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,890
Because a great example of this is

123
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:16,260
how many companies implement really good

124
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,070
two factor authentication and security. And the answer is actually quite a few now.

125
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:24,929
-- And how many of them have really good strong account recovery
-- setups.

126
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,149
Uh None of them.

127
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,179
Yeah, pretty much

128
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,239
so.

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,320
The reality is like, yeah,

130
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:34,950
I absolutely cannot break into your account and password,

131
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:38,549
but I can totally hijack your account and password by claiming to be you.

132
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:42,279
-- And, oh, I lost my wallet and forgot my password and got a bump on the head.
-- Right.

133
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,320
Right. Right. And you always hear about stories where

134
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,920
the bad guy calls up somebody. Right, and says I, I'm, I'm so, and so,

135
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:52,720
and here's how I can prove it.

136
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,029
And I seem to recall there, there was a story one time about somebody who lost,

137
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,359
I think it was their website

138
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,700
and they ended up like calling Amazon or paypal or someone.

139
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,920
And they gave them the last four digits of the credit card

140
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,209
that they then used to call the hosting provider and say,

141
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,690
oh, I'm so and so, and here's the last four digits of my credit card.

142
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,359
And they were like, oh, Ok. That must be you.

143
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,649
And it's like, wow, that was

144
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,839
good job guys.

145
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,390
Well, it's, that's the problem is it's not like these companies coordinate.

146
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,269
So like some companies have decided that, you know,

147
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,179
the last four digits of your credit card used to pay some bill are

148
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:22,910
well, oh,

149
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,329
that must be you then because you know that credit card number

150
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,170
and that's a super secret thing that nobody else would know.

151
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,480
Right. And then other companies are like, oh, the last four digits of credit card.

152
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,260
Yeah, here they are.

153
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,450
You know, they hand that stuff out like candy

154
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,480
or I remember one time hearing about the US asking

155
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:41,140
for the first three digits of your social security number

156
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,739
which are based upon where you're born.

157
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,820
So, like if you knew where someone was born,

158
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:48,739
you basically know the first three digits of their social security number.

159
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:49,899
Uh

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,529
Yeah. Well, sort of, it's,

161
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:55,790
it's where you were born as well as the date which of course,

162
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,619
like the age of somebody is not difficult, but basically the first three digits

163
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:02,690
are usually state and year kind of focused.

164
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,660
And so if you know, like someone's age within about 10 years,

165
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,609
you can almost certainly figure that out.

166
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,220
And I don't know if they fix that.

167
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,619
In other words, if you look at their Facebook profile,

168
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,070
you can probably get their

169
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,649
right. Exactly.

170
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,589
Well, just look at a picture of somebody. Right.

171
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:17,799
I mean,

172
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:21,380
the vast majority of people you can look at and guess their age within 10 years,

173
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,940
probably.

174
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:22,329
Well,

175
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:23,730
I know one clever thing I saw is I

176
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:26,079
know somebody that had to try and recover their Instagram

177
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,579
password because apparently some Russian dude yanked it.

178
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:31,230
And one of the clever things is, of course,

179
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:34,480
Instagram typically has a bunch of pictures of you.

180
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:37,260
So they asked this person to basically take a picture of themselves holding

181
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:41,329
-- up a sign with a random set of numbers and characters on
-- it.

182
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,250
I've heard of that before. I, well, Reddit does that for the A MA s, right?

183
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,170
Where you've got, you know, I'm, I'm so and so famous person.

184
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:50,114
Well, because obviously how else are you going to prove?

185
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,684
It's actually an A MA with that guy.

186
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:54,075
I always wondered what that OK, never occurred to me.

187
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:55,265
Right. Right.

188
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:56,494
Right. The mods would be like,

189
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:57,584
and this is

190
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:58,725
how do we know it's Vern

191
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:58,934
Schreyer

192
00:07:59,144 --> 00:07:59,804
for real?

193
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:03,005
-- So question what's going to happen now with the deep fakes?
-- Right.

194
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,684
I was, I was actually thinking about this the other day and,

195
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,804
and the reason I was actually thinking about it is

196
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:13,019
one of the things people used to do is hold up like a newspaper to prove

197
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,799
it was a certain date or something happened. And it's like, you know what, it's

198
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,299
really hard to fake that now, I mean,

199
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:23,929
even my terrible Photoshop skills can essentially make up a newspaper.

200
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,260
I just have to hold something up and then I can fill in the blanks. Right. So,

201
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:29,500
yeah, it's

202
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,969
-- these days,
-- well, here's a great example. Letterhead,

203
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,900
like, letterhead used to be enough to authenticate something. Right. Because,

204
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,080
you know, prior to laser printers,

205
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,400
-- it's not like you can actually very easily fake letterhead
-- or not even that.

206
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,559
It was expensive. Right.

207
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,840
Like most people weren't willing to spend the money to fake it.

208
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,789
And no, I know exactly what you mean. You can totally fake letterhead.

209
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,880
Well, it's like fishing, right? Phishing is basically fake letterhead, right?

210
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,960
Just with email.

211
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:54,489
Yeah.

212
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,849
Yeah. Phishing attacks. Yeah,

213
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,030
just to be clear because for a moment

214
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,590
there I thought you're talking about actual fishing.

215
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,190
Yes.

216
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:04,239
Alright.

217
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,309
So anyway, anyway,

218
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,219
let's get back to this list here just because I think it's hilarious and awesome

219
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:09,690
and,

220
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,119
and I must say my favorite one though here is

221
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,500
uh CV E 2018 dash question question question question,

222
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,400
which is all of them and you know,

223
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,450
ok, I'll get to this in a second.

224
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,960
It says a flaw in some X 86 CP us could

225
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:25,640
allow a root user to deescalated to normal account privileges.

226
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,599
And what's great is I love this because I read that and I'm like, wait,

227
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,030
that's not a bug and then I'm like, it's a comic, right?

228
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,280
Don't be like that.

229
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:35,669
But anyway, here's the other thing is when he put all the question marks in.

230
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:39,669
Thank goodness he put in question marks because if he would have made up numbers,

231
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,950
do you know what kind of, like, insane chaos would have resulted from that?

232
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,780
-- We would have had to very quickly publish a list of rejects and
-- probably

233
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,630
would have been duplicates

234
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,429
and, right, it would have been,

235
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,030
it would have been hilarious as someone who didn't have to fix it.

236
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,000
But if I was involved in any way and who knows? Right.

237
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,390
If you would have, like, for example, use some of my I DS,

238
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,609
then it would have made work for me.

239
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:02,940
So that would have made me happy. But

240
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:03,809
yeah,

241
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,489
now, now here's what I will say about this

242
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,729
is I have a feeling this comic will do more to raise CV

243
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:17,109
E awareness than anything miter has done for the last five years.

244
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,109
-- Well,
-- the problem is marketing security stuff is not easy.

245
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:25,280
It's, it's boring and nobody cares until it's in a web comic. Right?

246
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,270
-- Yeah,
-- pretty much, pretty much,

247
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:27,950
you know,

248
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,232
and some of these two are kind of borderline like X 86 has way

249
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:34,723
too many instructions that that in and of itself is not a flaw,

250
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,192
but it kind of points to the whole,

251
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:40,682
like the X 86 thing is getting so complex that we're getting those, you know,

252
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:42,422
unanticipated side effects.

253
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:42,822
You know,

254
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,903
I read that one and thought this one might actually be a

255
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:51,132
bug like for real because X the X 86 instruction said is enormous

256
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,583
and it is out of control and

257
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:55,315
it's not going to get any better.

258
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:59,265
-- Yeah.
-- Well, I like, I like the last one because it's a flaw and miter CV, database law,

259
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,635
arbitrary code insertion.

260
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:02,916
And that's actually something we're, we're working on because

261
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,716
it's not a problem yet because we basically, we don't really,

262
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:10,825
if somebody were to pass in like html formatted stuff, we kind of be like, well,

263
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:13,585
first of all, why, second of all they do escape stuff,

264
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:18,476
but there was the case of a CV E and in the description, they included sort of a,

265
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,830
the the rejects example,

266
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,340
triggered it

267
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,469
and it actually

268
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,599
broke somebody's, you know, CV, data department stuff, right?

269
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:30,429
Because it, it encountered that and it didn't handle it safely and,

270
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,909
and just for our viewers, they may not be aware.

271
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,150
Uh we decided some time ago that

272
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,349
uh CV E descriptions are, are not just ask you text anymore, folks,

273
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:42,030
they can also be unicode and emojis and stuff like that.

274
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:46,109
Um Because I asked because there was that security flaw that was labeled by a,

275
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:46,650
an emoji.

276
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,400
Well, look at this apple one that just happened. I mean,

277
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,869
you could put that unicode character in the description,

278
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,919
which would essentially mean anyone viewing the CBE

279
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,919
data is going to crash their Mac.

280
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,549
I wonder you guys should totally do that. That would be awesome.

281
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:03,280
Well, see.

282
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,690
And then so the second part is right now,

283
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,390
we don't really support line breaks in the descriptions which

284
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,710
drives me nuts because I would love to enclose,

285
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,309
especially on the open source side

286
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,340
if I could include code snippets, man. Oh, man, that would be nice as

287
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:16,530
the

288
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,130
art.

289
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,989
Yeah. Well, and you know, things like that have come up.

290
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,640
So I've been like, well, do we have a list of banned words?

291
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,080
-- Uh Is there a naughty list
-- because there are words?

292
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,070
Well, uh not officially, but the thing is there,

293
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,280
there are words that if they were put in the CV

294
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:36,229
database would of course offend various groups of people or people.

295
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,109
So, you know,

296
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,559
in general it's not been a problem

297
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,650
because it's mostly just boring technical descriptions.

298
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,309
But at the same time, I mean, what if somebody, I mean,

299
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:47,650
if you search for example, well, the open source world

300
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,809
there are projects with, you know,

301
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,539
-- rather shall we say rude names?
-- Oh, totally, man. Totally.

302
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:56,780
I mean, that's one of the things I always think about that would be hilarious.

303
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,080
Well, I know it was

304
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,219
a,

305
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,640
some years ago there was a security group called themselves.

306
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,530
I think the bearded warriors and they got people to like,

307
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,760
give them credit and advisories and I thought this is hilarious, right?

308
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,260
Like so and so would like to thank the bearded warriors for reporting this issue.

309
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,940
And I'm like, what if you named yourself, like something super inappropriate,

310
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,739
right?

311
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,820
You know, I want to thank, you know,

312
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:22,325
-- would they, I don't
-- know, I I like that.

313
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,984
You and I are both just quietly dancing around, not saying anything like that. This

314
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:26,294
is

315
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:27,585
the

316
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:29,114
word that are identified by their first

317
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:29,424
letter

318
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:30,135
is a family

319
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,054
show. And

320
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:35,364
if we say such things, I can't click the clean button

321
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:37,325
when I submit the podcast.

322
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,369
So anyway, and,

323
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,849
and the beauty of it is I have the power of the edit so I can fix it no matter what.

324
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,219
That's right. Maybe Kurt's been spewing obscenity at me for the last 10 minutes.

325
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:48,369
Nobody will ever know.

326
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:50,239
So,

327
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,530
uh

328
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:53,419
yeah.

329
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:56,460
Well, I do enjoy this list too because there's a couple in here that are, you know,

330
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,880
sort of e strays like the numpy.

331
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,460
So numpy is a uh numerical Python library. Well, for Python

332
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:05,719
uh so numpy 1.8 0.0 can factor primes in o log in

333
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:10,200
-- time and there and must be quietly deprecated before anyone notices
-- that

334
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,739
man, that one hits close to home for more reasons than I'm ever going to talk about.

335
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,559
But like

336
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,380
that, that's one of the things actually

337
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:23,380
that's funny about security is there are security issues that can happen

338
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:26,140
that are so bad. You, you have to keep them.

339
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,239
I mean, like, like, like meltdown was kind of like this, right?

340
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,359
Where it's like everyone shut up for a little while, right? Like, let's face it, man.

341
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,479
Could you imagine if a researcher showed up one day and said I can factor primes?

342
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:36,679
Well, like I,

343
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,559
it would be mass chaos

344
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,679
-- in a realistic amount of time. Right.
-- Right. Exactly. Right.

345
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,979
Anyone can factor primes, let's,

346
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:45,679
let's say that.

347
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,429
But it's, it would be

348
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,650
in a realistic amount of time without costing,

349
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,520
it would be, it would be insane what would result?

350
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:57,294
-- Because essentially we've broken, even
-- if it was just purely theoretical,

351
00:14:58,155 --> 00:15:00,835
you know, even if it was something like with today's hardware,

352
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:02,215
it'll take 10 million years.

353
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:05,494
Well, the problem with that is 10 years from now. How long is it going to take?

354
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,044
You know, like, like, remember des

355
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:10,864
des encryption used to be like who with today's hardware, it'll take up

356
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:11,114
to

357
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:11,244
AI

358
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:15,614
years. And then the eff built, built deep crack with, you know, was it

359
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:16,525
Asics or something?

360
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:18,645
And it was like, yeah, well, with Asa,

361
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:19,494
it's

362
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,445
now what days or weeks

363
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,909
and then a few years later, it's like your laptop,

364
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:30,349
there have been security papers written that were very theoretical in nature

365
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:31,150
that

366
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:34,710
I won't say we treated them like, oh my goodness, like do this now,

367
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,390
but there's definitely been

368
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:41,700
various mitigations put into place, let's say in like TLS, for example, or open SSL

369
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,080
that were based on purely theoretical research.

370
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,390
And in fact, funny enough a meltdown had theoretical research behind it.

371
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,460
It's just we were like, uh that sounds too hard. Let's not worry about it right now,

372
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,130
right. And then someone did it.

373
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:55,820
I think there's definitely a better understanding that

374
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,729
a lot of this theoretical stuff can be,

375
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:01,010
can become real a lot sooner and a lot more practically

376
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,049
than we planned. Like a great example.

377
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,719
Oh, you would need 10 million cor to do that in a realistic amount of time.

378
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,880
Oh, Amazon sells that now for a buck an hour.

379
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,409
Right. Right.

380
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,429
Right.

381
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,450
Um,

382
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,549
you know what, what kind of terrifies me is you look at the whole,

383
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,099
like Bitcoin thing and there's basically a global

384
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,030
shortage of GP US for all the various cryptocurrencies

385
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,789
or rather due to all the cryptocurrencies and the people mining them on these GP US.

386
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,440
And imagine if all these people with all these GP US decided to

387
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,590
turn it to like prime factoring of say some root certificates or something.

388
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,840
I, I don't know what the numbers are but

389
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,239
like what if the entire Bitcoin network decided we're going to factor this

390
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,219
prime number that is a root certificate for some important certificate authority.

391
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:50,719
I'm, I'm, I'm gonna get

392
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:52,799
over overly technical on you.

393
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:58,010
Uh Bitcoin uses a six because they are well past the point of using GP US.

394
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,640
And in fact, the Bitcoin algorithm

395
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,750
is more suited to A six because it is a relatively low memory, high CPU

396
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:08,550
algorithm. Whereas there are other coins

397
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,180
that are high memory

398
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,060
and well in high CPU obviously, but that's where you need the, the GP US to do that.

399
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,219
And now

400
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,709
I haven't kept up on all the different ones.

401
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,310
-- Yeah,
-- you're not, you're not missing much

402
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:24,939
to answer your question about if all the computing power in the world

403
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,819
was dedicated to cracking,

404
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,099
say a prime number that we know is in use for something important.

405
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,510
Today, I have a feeling we're, we'd still be OK

406
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,510
where you're,

407
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,829
you're still talking about probably thousands to

408
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,750
millions of years in many instances.

409
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,310
But, but at the same time,

410
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,420
I, I don't think

411
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:50,939
this line of reasoning is impractical

412
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,099
because

413
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,310
as the world continues to change and the way everything works,

414
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,089
the amount of computing power available is going up at,

415
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:02,060
at an alarming rate and it's becoming very cheap.

416
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:05,660
And so you got to figure like the total compute power of all GP

417
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,069
US today is probably going to be purchasable in Amazon in like 10 years.

418
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:10,939
That's crazy.

419
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:16,099
-- Well,
-- it's like uh what's this latest one? The um yeah, Samsung just,

420
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,869
it's not that they announced it, it's that they begin,

421
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:22,550
they began production of their new 30 terabyte SSD.

422
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,130
I saw that. That's insane. And it's like a normal size too.

423
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,920
It's not like a suitcase or something.

424
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,359
It's a 2.5 inch,

425
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:32,439
it's kind of a fat drive for a 2.5 inch drive.

426
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:35,189
Yeah, but still like to put that in perspective. That's like saying,

427
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:39,459
well, yeah. No, it's, it's tiny comparatively to like what? Let me put it this way.

428
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:42,180
What 30 terabytes of storage would have looked like 10 years ago.

429
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:45,010
Well, was it even possible 20 years ago?

430
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:46,859
No, like, actually possible.

431
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:50,560
-- I don't think it
-- was, it was like all the storage on the planet Earth. Right.

432
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,170
Pretty much. Yeah.

433
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:56,770
And now it's a single chubby, like, it's about what point, I think it's 0.75.

434
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,219
So it's the maximum height for a 2.5 inch hard drive.

435
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,089
But, like, that's basically a pack of cigarettes if,

436
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:05,449
for those of you old enough to know what cigarettes look like.

437
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,689
Everyone knows what a pack of, at

438
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,609
-- least in the
-- USA, you know, like,

439
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,810
yeah, I mean, this is 30 terabytes in a 2.5 inch form factor that draws it. It's crazy.

440
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:19,260
Probably only a single digit number of watts.

441
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:22,680
And apparently it's got 40 gigs of memory on it

442
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:24,650
for buffer because, yeah, I mean,

443
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,810
if you've got 30 terabytes even at SSD speeds you still need a big pile

444
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,640
-- of.
-- Oh,

445
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:30,260
yeah.

446
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,760
So, yeah, and, and it's, it's not cheap. It's like 20 grand. But

447
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:36,050
s

448
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:37,959
for 20 grand is,

449
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:38,839
that's

450
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:39,880
amazing.

451
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,589
Yeah.

452
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:42,010
And, and, you know,

453
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,459
in five years it's going to cost like, $4.99. Right? Because that's just how this

454
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,910
I've decided.

455
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,520
Like, so every,

456
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,989
every about 2 to 3 years I sort of re evaluate what

457
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,880
my baseline for a computer or any device I buy is.

458
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,199
So, and my current baseline now is minimum 1, 28 gigs of storage

459
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,319
built in.

460
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,459
Is that, that's

461
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,380
that's too small.

462
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:10,680
Lower. That, that's because you want a Mac only Apple provides such paltry amounts.

463
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:14,910
-- I'm talking also about phones, tablets,
-- everything. Ok. That's fair for a phone.

464
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,420
But even a phone I don't worry about because it's all in the cloud now.

465
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,339
Like, who cares?

466
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:20,699
Uh, I find it's annoying because when my,

467
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:24,010
my kids like to browse my photos on my phone and then it sucks up my data plan.

468
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,010
Right. Because if it can't keep it all,

469
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,150
see, that's why you get an unlimited data plan, Kurt and then you don't have to worry

470
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,390
about.

471
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,119
I live in

472
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:30,849
Canada.

473
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,819
Right.

474
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:32,819
Right. Right.

475
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:33,520
I know.

476
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,819
So, anyway, anyway, ok, we, we're in a hole we should talk about. You have a story.

477
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:41,540
You're saying antivirus maybe isn't bad.

478
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:45,150
-- Yeah.
-- So, well, well, antivirus, here's the problem with antivirus, right?

479
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,650
Is by definition it's not going to stop a lot of zero days.

480
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,239
So a lot and, and, you know, it used to be zero days, like w zero days,

481
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,180
but now it's like, no,

482
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:55,040
somebody gets a zero day shoves it into a

483
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,699
web based ad network and like goes and infects,

484
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:58,979
you know, a million computers.

485
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,680
Um, so anyways, what happened is these, these guy,

486
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:05,319
this company that makes this flight simulator, um,

487
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:09,030
they, uh well, like many companies got miffed with piracy.

488
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:11,819
So they included this component

489
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,459
that basically records,

490
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,819
uh, chrome user names and passwords that you enter into websites.

491
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,130
And uh

492
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:24,819
yeah, if you entered a fake serial key or mistyped your real serial key or whatever,

493
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,969
it would run this component and suck up all your passwords and user names.

494
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:31,630
And the company claims now that they've been caught doing this,

495
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,020
they claim that they never sent this data back to themselves, blah, blah, blah,

496
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,339
blah, blah.

497
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,469
But what's interesting is,

498
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:39,739
is the component they used is well known and it was caught by antivirus,

499
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:41,469
right? So

500
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:45,400
to quote, uh what this person said, just installed with a warning from zone alarm.

501
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,729
It thinks so this

502
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,280
program actually included a copy of this.

503
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:50,560
I don't know,

504
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:53,439
I guess you'd call it malware or hostile where

505
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:55,359
it's called test A exe which right away,

506
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:56,829
no offense if I see something called test

507
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:59,489
ad xe in something I'm downloading right away.

508
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,750
I'm like

509
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,359
I,

510
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:02,770
I like

511
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:04,089
it

512
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:05,140
has no place.

513
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,729
Yeah, exactly. So just installed with a warning from zone alarm.

514
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:12,660
It thinks that test dot Exen slash

515
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:12,969
T

516
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:13,880
slash something,

517
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,369
something is not a virus heuristic PSW tool when 32 security exploded Gen virus.

518
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,969
This apparently causes a wrist information on your system.

519
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,750
And the reply from the

520
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,619
flight simulator company is David. This is why we recommend you disable your A V when

521
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,469
any A V engines here are installer as a virus

522
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:34,569
which they are not also known as a false positive.

523
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:37,540
Now, granted A V does have false positives

524
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:40,329
that I've uh cli A V for a while.

525
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:44,680
For example, had a signature where if a file was double zip compressed,

526
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,760
it would flake as a virus,

527
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,729
which is just kind of ridiculous because there's a lot of

528
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:50,719
stuff that legitimately has zip files inside of zip files.

529
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:51,930
Um

530
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,400
But uh no, in this case, it's clearly not a false positive.

531
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,900
Uh And so I, I think basically

532
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,890
A V is kind of like that washing your hands thing where,

533
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:06,540
you know, if the attack can't get by a V then you know,

534
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,339
that that's a basic level of hygiene that maybe you should do because

535
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,469
you should be able to catch that kind of behavior in those attacks.

536
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,520
We should pick this one apart and let's start with A V.

537
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,209
I will, I will congratulate a V for catching this.

538
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:22,199
And I guess my view on A V is still that A V kind of sucks.

539
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,979
If you're on windows, you should definitely have it.

540
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,239
And I'm happy enough with the Windows defender because it's,

541
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,010
it's certainly good enough is

542
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,380
whatever. All right, if you have windows, you probably need it.

543
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,339
If you have other things, I figure it out. All right. Uh I,

544
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,420
I also feel like there are certain people that seem to

545
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,369
have a much higher regard for antivirus applications than they should.

546
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,859
And if you're one of them,

547
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:48,180
I would suggest you figure out who a guy named Tavis Ormandy is

548
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,290
and,

549
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,750
and read what he has done with antivirus applications.

550
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,170
It is it is one of those instances where

551
00:23:55,709 --> 00:24:00,160
it could be worse than not having any, but I'll, I'll let the reader decide for that.

552
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,459
But now more importantly is

553
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:09,619
why the heck would, could a company even imagine? This is a good idea. I just, I, I,

554
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:14,300
like there are certain lines, I would say where you can have some gray area of.

555
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,400
Maybe this is a good idea. Maybe it's not like a great example is

556
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:21,180
various applications will phone home and just like

557
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:23,459
secretly tell the mothership what you're doing,

558
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:23,859
right?

559
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,839
That's totally gray area that I'd lean towards. Don't do that.

560
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:31,040
But this is like this is so far from gray is not even funny.

561
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,939
Well, this is literally

562
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,550
the Sony, OK. The Sony BMG copy

563
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:37,170
root

564
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,430
kit

565
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:38,280
B

566
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,930
because the root kit thing was only affecting one machine.

567
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,109
It's

568
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:43,729
bad,

569
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:44,130
you know,

570
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,489
I should say one machine, but like your machine, right?

571
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,140
So I mean, well, but it's basically similar to that and that, oh,

572
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,329
we want to do DRM and protect our product.

573
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:51,729
And

574
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:53,390
so to do that, we at

575
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,810
this is just like depth of personal information, right?

576
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,130
There's man, there's just,

577
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,410
I can't even imagine in my brain what the

578
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,969
meeting must have gone like to justify this behavior.

579
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:09,699
And, and not only that like, who's the dirt bag developer who turned this on?

580
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,489
I mean, come on, you knew what you were doing.

581
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:14,839
No, I suspect it was, I mean, it's, it sounds like it's a small company.

582
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,930
So it sounds like it, you know, probably wasn't

583
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:18,930
well thought out as a decision.

584
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,770
So, I mean,

585
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,930
legally they are in some potentially hot water depending on the jurisdiction.

586
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,810
Uh, because, yeah, taking,

587
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,880
well, uh, great example, good thing. It's not past me or, uh, GDPR would be in effect.

588
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,719
And so, yeah, if it was past May then basically everybody in Europe could have, uh,

589
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,209
well, yeah, that, that could potentially get very ugly for this company.

590
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,400
Maybe. I mean, heck, let's face it.

591
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,849
This company quite conceivably just destroyed itself.

592
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:49,410
I mean, this is the sort of thing that's going to be really hard to come back from,

593
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,589
-- maybe,
-- maybe I will

594
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:51,709
pay

595
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:52,900
you money to get away with it.

596
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,739
Probably.

597
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:54,619
You're probably right.

598
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:01,619
This is a company that sells a flight simulator and like apparently a model,

599
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,000
like a single, like data file for a model of a plane.

600
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,849
So that gives you all the characteristics of the plane

601
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,569
so you can fly it and play with it and stuff

602
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,459
is 100 bucks for flying one

603
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,410
airplane. Well, no, you can fly multiple airplanes, right?

604
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,180
But so it's the, the module is the A 320 X.

605
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:19,550
So like, I guess it's a very popular airplane to flight sim, I don't,

606
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,890
I don't play Fight Flight Sims.

607
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,390
I don't know.

608
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:25,119
Um, but apparently these modules cost like 100 bucks. So I, I mean,

609
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,089
not super shocked that people are p

610
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:28,079
files.

611
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,650
Yeah, 100 bucks is pretty stiff. But ok.

612
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,959
So anyway, let's ignore the, the ethical decisions. Here is,

613
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,859
well, more of the point it would also happen if you mistyped your serial number.

614
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,089
So wait, if you just typed in the wrong serial number,

615
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,479
it decided you were a thief and stole your, your.

616
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,520
So, here's the other part of this, I guess is

617
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,180
I feel like

618
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,359
the operating system should have a way for Chrome to say

619
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:56,079
-- like, don't let anyone else touch these files,
-- right?

620
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:57,300
Well, no, no, it wasn't touching files.

621
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,270
It was kind of pulling like a last pass style thing where it's intercepting

622
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,000
your user name and password when you type them into fields and stuff.

623
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:05,760
Oh wait. So it was but even so like, why,

624
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,199
why,

625
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,209
why are you letting an application do this?

626
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:14,050
I feel like if an application is able to to secretly backdoor your web browser,

627
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,439
-- there's something terrible happening, right? That's
-- not

628
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,750
really explicitly allowed it. Like me having my last past

629
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:21,219
module

630
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,729
on Chrome and very explicitly like,

631
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,359
I really hope nothing else is looking at

632
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:28,479
my user names and passwords in my browser because

633
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:29,680
when you install

634
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,560
lastpass, when you install lastpass, you have to click a couple of OKS,

635
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:35,339
right? It's not secret.

636
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:38,979
It's not like you go to a website and suddenly you have last pass. I mean,

637
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:42,520
oh man, this this feels like

638
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,079
an opportunity

639
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,199
for especially Chrome

640
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:50,000
to improve some security here because just keep people, like,

641
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,359
unless I explicitly grant permission,

642
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:56,069
nothing needs to mess with user name and password fields ever.

643
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,010
Right. Like

644
00:27:57,229 --> 00:27:57,839
full stop?

645
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,069
Oh,

646
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,839
man, this is so messed up. This is,

647
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:04,000
it's, I mean, well, the problem is that

648
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:07,839
I think a lot of people, when they make security related decisions

649
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,000
quite often,

650
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,910
it's not that they don't think them through, it's that they're not,

651
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,119
you know, on the dunning Kruger curve of wisdom, they're not

652
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,339
qualified to think them through.

653
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,550
And so they, they do think them through to the best of their ability,

654
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,780
but their ability is not

655
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:25,099
sufficient to fully understand that.

656
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:27,880
Like for it, like example, if this had happened after

657
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,569
uh

658
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,890
after May

659
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,410
to understand that, you know,

660
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:35,260
the European, I think, is it the European data privacy commissioner or whatever,

661
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:35,939
what is it called

662
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:36,459
again

663
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:36,640
for

664
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:36,920
it?

665
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:37,920
Anyway,

666
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,250
the people in Europe that are enforcing this, I mean,

667
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,250
I believe my understanding of the fines for this are, it's

668
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,079
€20 million or 4% of your

669
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,430
uh income,

670
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,510
whichever number is higher.

671
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,390
But there's also some weird rules if you're a really small company.

672
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,500
And my, my guess is this place is really small.

673
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,329
But again, this is like this is like willful,

674
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:01,390
just badness

675
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,069
versus

676
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:03,890
let me this way

677
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,280
if you put. So if you ship software that includes a third party component that

678
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:12,910
a V vendors are concerned about, chances are you're doing something very bad

679
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:15,890
I know,

680
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:18,900
I agree. If, if. Right, I guess.

681
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,900
Ok, let's,

682
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:25,489
let's say that and maybe this is the best way to end it is if you are a software company

683
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:28,969
and your software is setting off antivirus applications,

684
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,849
you probably need to take a good hard look at what's going on

685
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,729
because

686
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:38,290
just saying it's a false positive, like, make sure

687
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,290
it's not.

688
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,089
Right.

689
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,459
Well, every single program I've ever seen that says, you know,

690
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:45,699
disable your antivirus or firewall so you can get the scene,

691
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,390
don't do

692
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:46,589
that.

693
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,959
You just know that

694
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,660
regardless of that, the thing is not well written

695
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,079
-- by definition cannot be.
-- Well,

696
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:54,699
you're absolutely right.

697
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,949
And I guess this kind of comes back to basic hygiene, right? This is

698
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:00,650
if, if you need to ask people to do this,

699
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:05,449
you have bigger problems than the antivirus and the firewall.

700
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,760
Oh man,

701
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,270
just

702
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,390
my brain. It can't handle this. This is

703
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm just gonna,

704
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:16,829
so the one, the one useful piece of advice I would thus say to people is so,

705
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,650
for example, whenever I download an installer,

706
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,709
even if you know something reasonably trustworthy,

707
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,189
I try to run it through Virus total.com,

708
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,189
I wonder.

709
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,550
And 99 times out of 100 it's fine.

710
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,709
And every once in a while though I've had stuff where,

711
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:31,540
yeah,

712
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:34,640
it has wires or it has something very questionable in it.

713
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,469
-- And I'm like, no,
-- what virus total said about, about this thing,

714
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,839
we'll have to, we'll have to look,

715
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:45,119
I'd be amazed if it's not already there. So, all right, man, I'm going to call it.

716
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,680
This is

717
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:47,920
like I can't handle this.

718
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:50,319
My brain doesn't know what to do. So, I guess. Thanks, Kurt.

719
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:53,959
