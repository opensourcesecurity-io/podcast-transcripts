00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:04,239
-- According to December 18th, we're getting
-- there. Don't roll your own crypto or

1
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:04,489
off.

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:09,789
Oh God. No, people can't even get password storage. Correct most of the time.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,909
-- No,
-- no one does.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,250
Well,

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,260
so I think this is funny is obviously we

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,869
talked about don't roll your own crypto for decades.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,260
And I feel like that idea has mostly sunk in and now

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,100
it's don't roll your own off.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,489
Yeah, because I see people doing this on a completely regular basis.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,750
-- I would say as well if possible, don't host your own
-- author.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,009
-- I think those are similar well,
-- descriptions.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,250
Well, I would say it's unacceptable to write your own a system that is just,

13
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,049
it's like writing your own crypto, you're going to get it wrong

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,860
the story.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,150
But if you do grab some, you know, there are some completely

16
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:48,529
finished off open source off systems that you can just grab and run.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,959
There's loads of them if you use

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,729
a web framework probably comes with authentication.

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,470
Exactly.

20
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,810
And I would say, ideally don't host the accounts,

21
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:59,119
allow people to use their Google or Facebook.

22
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,369
But also conversely, please do allow them

23
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:07,599
to not have to have a Google or Facebook account because I've, I used to be very much,

24
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,879
I don't want to make, create an account.

25
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:09,400
I want to

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,599
use my Google or whatever.

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,830
And I'm coming around now because there's all these

28
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:17,199
reports of people just getting randomly booted from Google

29
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:18,900
and it breaks everything.

30
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,330
And if you have your own domain name, you can sort of recover from it and, you know,

31
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:25,129
re-establish your email somewhere else and get things up and running again.

32
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:25,919
But, well,

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,199
that only works with

34
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:28,664
Google and your own domain.

35
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:32,124
You obviously can't do that with linkedin or Facebook or Twitter or whatever,

36
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:32,503
right?

37
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:33,444
That, that is,

38
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:37,204
that account is tied to Twitter. That's it. You can't lift it somewhere else.

39
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,204
-- So
-- you know what I'm really enjoying,

40
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:43,543
there are a handful of services I use like Feedle is a great example where on Feedle,

41
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:48,204
I have a user name and password. I have a login with Google,

42
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,564
I have and then they have log in with other stuff,

43
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:51,963
but I only use Google and user name and

44
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:52,337
password,

45
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:55,807
which means obviously I can click log in with Google to just get in quick and dirty.

46
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,288
Actually, Nintendo does this too on their account and, but,

47
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:01,188
but I still obviously can log in with the user name and password

48
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:04,608
if let's say Google decides I'm a bad person and they need to kick

49
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:07,157
me out for some reason because I agree that's one of the terrifying

50
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:10,086
things with some of these authentication providers is if you get the boot,

51
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:11,408
-- like, well, that's
-- all.

52
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:13,397
And what's also interesting to me is I've noticed

53
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:16,578
I enabled the advanced security on my Google account both

54
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:20,811
working for a personal, you know, so I'm forced to sign in with hardware tokens and,

55
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,272
you know, it's kind of a chore.

56
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:24,292
Everyone should do this if you're listening,

57
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:26,552
pause the podcast and go do that right now.

58
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:28,052
I would disagree.

59
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:31,352
I would say Google's default security is good enough for your mom and dad. But

60
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,751
if it's a corporate account or look, look,

61
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:37,031
congratulations to moms and dads listening, but

62
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:37,792
pretty

63
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,371
sure that's not our target audience.

64
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:40,651
So

65
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:41,212
yeah,

66
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:44,305
you, for example, are a super user account in Gmail.

67
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,186
You probably should be or in Google Suite or whatever it's called.

68
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:49,055
Now, you should be enabling that. But here's the thing that's the,

69
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:52,955
it's broken authentication with a couple of sites that basically

70
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,845
when I tried to log in using my Google account,

71
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:56,886
I just get an error and uh

72
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,136
the error was clear. It said essentially this service

73
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:03,205
is doing something that's, you know, not secure enough.

74
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:05,876
So I guess they're doing something wonky with the old author or whatever.

75
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:08,539
Um But a bunch of them just fail,

76
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:12,550
just doesn't work at all and it works everywhere else with a non uh

77
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,889
advanced protection Google account

78
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,759
we're talking about, don't roll your own crypto,

79
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,169
-- don't roll your own off.
-- And well, and this speaks to these people that are obviously

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,070
doing the off

81
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,169
wrong because advanced protection shouldn't break it

82
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:28,949
because it works with most things.

83
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,470
That's my point. I have proof that, you know, most of these

84
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:32,419
o or not, most,

85
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,852
many of these oth systems are not very well made because they

86
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:38,212
break when you turn on advanced protection and that shouldn't break it.

87
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:39,022
-- Crypto
-- and oth I

88
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:43,292
think are unique problems in the fact that there is perfect and there is

89
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:47,013
nothing and there aren't very many things that I think fall under that umbrella.

90
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:50,503
But these two are that where you can't have mostly OK,

91
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:54,882
-- crypto or mostly OK off the
-- failure mode is catastrophic as well.

92
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,173
That's the real problem doing account recovery.

93
00:03:57,182 --> 00:04:00,046
And I appreciate that some places are kind of clever about it, you know,

94
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:02,535
with nominate five relatives to recover your account,

95
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:04,755
stuff like that will work for normal people.

96
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:08,975
But by and large account recovery is impossible once they've gank your account.

97
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:09,936
Yeah, exactly.

98
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:11,656
Stay safe and, you know,

99
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,335
use those hardware tokens or at least a software token on your phone.

100
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:17,795
-- And
-- just don't, if you're a developer, like, don't, don't use

101
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,084
-- S MS.
-- Well,

102
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,776
I'm not going to argue that point right now

103
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:24,205
because that's a whole another can of worms.

104
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:24,876
But

105
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:26,006
the point is

106
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,709
if you're a developer don't roll your own crypto,

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,299
don't roll your own off. There are,

108
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,429
there are marvelous solutions

109
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,450
that can solve this problem for you.

110
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,839
-- Please use them
-- and more to the point outsourcing it

111
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,390
is probably cheaper because we looked at doing it ourselves,

112
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,929
like even just hosting it and running it

113
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:45,329
and we ended up paying, you know, we're paying 500 bucks a month for an off service.

114
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,390
That's 10 hours of time at

115
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,170
least.

116
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,679
And there's no way we can do it cheaper than that.

117
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,209
There's just no way we can run an off system.

118
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:54,769
High availability

119
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,089
-- with all the bells and features for that cheap. Yeah,
-- totally, man. All right.

120
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,769
December 19th is tomorrow.
