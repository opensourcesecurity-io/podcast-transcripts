Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast.

1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,300
Episode number 30 with myself, Kurt Siefried and my partner in crime, Josh Bresser.

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,979
30 episodes, Kurt, because we have 10 fingers. That seems like an important number.

3
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:18,450
So, yay for us.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,719
Yeah. Well,

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,430
I'm turning 40 this year so I can sympathize with this power of tens thing.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,010
It is a powerful concept and ironically it only exists because

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,250
we have 10 fingers and so we use base 10.

8
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,029
Whereas if we use base 12, it would be totally different.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,000
And I'm sure the base 12 fans out there would assure

10
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,790
us that all of math would be much easier and better.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,930
Yeah, I've always wondered about that. What happened?

12
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,209
-- If we had nine fingers or seven,
-- we have base nine math then,

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,169
I mean, that's just kind of the reality of it.

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,840
And in fact, there's, I, I read some articles one time talking about how, when you use

15
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,979
different bases, you end up,

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,500
the math is slightly different in some ways, it's easier in some ways. It's harder

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,540
because like, for example, in base 12, I guess, like a third,

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,839
which is what 0.3333333 that

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,500
repeats forever is not, it, it's actually a nice number.

20
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:13,019
Well, 12 is a very

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,809
nice number and that you can divide it by 12346.

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,309
Yes.

23
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,510
Which when you think about it,

24
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,250
like for dividing among a group of people is a pretty optimal, like, you know,

25
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,819
that's why we have 60 minutes in an hour.

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,910
Right? Because it's 123456,

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,750
you know, 1012 like that,

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,190
that gives you a lot of flexibility on how you want to divide this up.

29
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:35,069
Sure. Why not?

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,980
-- You know, I have no
-- idea. I've kind of wondered about that.

31
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:40,680
But, uh, anyways, well, so this kind of raises. Well,

32
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,690
um,

33
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,959
is there a metric second where there's 100 seconds?

34
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,660
And it actually works out reasonably close? Right.

35
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:50,540
Having 10 hours with 100 minutes.

36
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,860
I think it's 10 hours with 100 minutes with 100 seconds.

37
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,199
And I hope the French created this because I would expect no other group to do it.

38
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:01,730
Uh, I don't think it was

39
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:05,849
the French. It was hang on a second.

40
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,820
Uh, they don't,

41
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,860
uh, science fiction

42
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,580
uses it and then,

43
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,529
um, but it looks like,

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,350
yeah.

45
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,809
Anyway, it's nice.

46
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:18,300
Ah,

47
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,179
yeah, I'm done. I'm tired of talking about time and leap seconds.

48
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:21,759
Just

49
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,479
mess that is

50
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,770
it, whatever. I'm not even going to go there. All right. So, let's today instead,

51
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,529
talk about machine learning and security because machine learning is a super hip

52
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:36,309
topic these days and security happens to also be a super hip topic.

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,490
So let's put them together.

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,289
Yeah.

55
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,860
See, and this,

56
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,740
the weirdest thing I find about this whole topic

57
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,339
is the whole premise of the it industry,

58
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,940
the information technology industry is to automate

59
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,899
tasks and work with computers and software.

60
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,660
That's literally the premise of what we're doing

61
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,009
and yet people are resistant

62
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,470
to automating it work.

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,199
I don't know if they're resistant. Necessarily.

64
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,729
Some people might be, but that's, I mean, that's human nature.

65
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,419
We've had people resistant to literally all

66
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:10,369
change throughout history in every possible way.

67
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,479
But I, I mean, you look at the best Cis

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,309
Edmunds, you know, and they're also the Laziest human beings, you know. Right.

69
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,309
-- Because they've like literally turned their entire job into four pearl
-- scripts.

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:22,929
Yeah.

71
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,210
No, I'm always reminded of that XK CD comic,

72
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,100
which we should post a link to where he basically talks about the um you know,

73
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,289
if an action takes X number of minutes or seconds or

74
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,350
whatever times how many times you do it a day,

75
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,779
you know, how much time should you spend automating it to get the payoff?

76
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,080
Right? Because you shouldn't spend like a year automating a task.

77
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,449
It only takes say one hour per year to do.

78
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,509
But things like, for example, a great example, spam filtering of email, right?

79
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,380
Clearly, that needs to be automated and there's a payoff.

80
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:55,210
I don't think you could not spam filter these days.

81
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,940
Well, that goes back to your law of large numbers. Right.

82
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:01,009
If I get 10 spams a day I can handle that as a human being.

83
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,770
But when 99% of my email is spam,

84
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,919
you know, and it's like 10,000 messages a day.

85
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:09,550
I physically can't even click fast enough to get rid of it.

86
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,869
Yeah. That's probably fair.

87
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,679
I don't even want to think about how much spam I

88
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,428
actually would get if there was no filtering of any sort

89
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,750
on my email. I bet it's horrifying.

90
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:22,660
Oh, yeah.

91
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,989
Well, I mean,

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,750
I still run mail servers and just the amount of stuff I'm able to drop right away.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,100
Why do you do that? That's because of the mailing list. We have to still, it's, it's,

94
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:36,269
let me put it this way. We looked at a variety of mailing list providers

95
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:37,829
and they're like

96
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,450
by and large, they're just not good,

97
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,989
you know, they're, they're ok but

98
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:45,670
for what they charge it's honestly we just,

99
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,510
you know, it's just honestly we run, um, so on the incoming email, very simply put it,

100
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,660
it goes through spam Assassin and Cli A V which gets like 99% of the low hanging fruit.

101
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,970
-- Do you allow unsolicited mail to your lists?
-- Some of them we do and quite

102
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:07,390
well and, but interestingly we only get probably like two or three spams a day.

103
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,089
Um,

104
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,220
and honestly there's a couple of repeat offenders who

105
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,640
keep trying to post like conference calls or like,

106
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,179
you know, kind of industry

107
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,190
related spam to these lists

108
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,529
and, you know, and I quite often just block their domain,

109
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:20,899
right.

110
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,589
You know, the amount of actual spam spam, like, um, for,

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,980
for a long time I was getting a lot of spam about boat lifts, like to lift, you know,

112
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:31,709
like you drive your boat into it and lift your boat out of the water.

113
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:31,760
I

114
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,239
don't know why or how I got on to these lists.

115
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,470
But yeah, I was getting a lot of that spam for a month or two. And um,

116
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,529
the reality too is, I mean, most of the stuff,

117
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,179
it's just instant pattern recognition of my brain.

118
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,470
It's like, oh, it's an email in Chinese with pictures

119
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,010
that's not work related,

120
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,649
you know, I can just delete that.

121
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,750
Um,

122
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:50,429
you know,

123
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,410
so if I'm only spending like less than a minute

124
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,109
a day dealing with the spam to these lists,

125
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:54,609
it's like, you know what?

126
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:55,549
That's, that's ok.

127
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,779
Alright.

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,049
But long term I do want to kind of, you know, we

129
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:01,779
want to get rid of these lists for other reasons, like, you know,

130
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,799
integrating them properly with some other of our services.

131
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,869
Everyone knows that crappy web forums are the future Kurt.

132
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,269
Yes,

133
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,170
they are. We need more and, and even bonus points if they're written in PHP.

134
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,309
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know PHP. It's, it's, it works.

135
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,369
I had a discussion the other day with somebody

136
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,750
and they started picking on PHP as rightly.

137
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,750
So it deserves.

138
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,769
And I pointed out that I suspect Node is the new php.

139
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:34,899
So we have years of fun ahead of us without

140
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,489
a doubt for ridiculous security problems that nobody will fix.

141
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,630
Well, you know, that's the beauty of all these

142
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:45,160
things that are successful is one of the reasons they're successful quite often is

143
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,079
because anybody can contribute stuff and you

144
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,299
get that critical mass of like libraries and

145
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,230
software. So it's just like easy to do things.

146
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,670
But let's face it.

147
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,100
Most of these are not written by

148
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:58,000
like super competent professional software designers.

149
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,510
They're written by people who have an itch, they itch it, you know,

150
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,470
they scratch their itch

151
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,410
and then they publish it to github

152
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,769
or, you know, whatever now and it gets pulled into whatever,

153
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,399
essentially whatever package management system that language uses, you know,

154
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:10,750
like C

155
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:11,730
A for Pearl or

156
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:15,119
-- uh node for Js
-- or whatever. No

157
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,480
is N PM

158
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,359
PM.

159
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:18,660
Yes,

160
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:23,059
I remember, I read a thing that Larry Wall wrote.

161
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,000
This was,

162
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,220
oh my goodness. I bet

163
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,450
is that

164
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,299
people who might not know.

165
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:32,660
So there is a computer programming language called Pearl.

166
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,850
And if you use Pearl on purpose, you are a bad person now because Pearl is terrible.

167
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,619
But Larry Wall invented pearl like a million years ago and this was back when

168
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,679
kind of open sourcing your your magic language just wasn't really a thing.

169
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,220
And Pearl was one of the first and it quite frankly took over the world

170
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,420
and it was literally driving the internet for

171
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:57,910
a significant amount of time where every sic

172
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,140
a man on the planet was writing Pearl scripts because it was,

173
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:05,339
it was Shell and Pearl were pretty much the only two games in town back then.

174
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:06,420
Now

175
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,500
the other thing was, and this is something, you know,

176
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,600
for those of you that probably don't remember but like

177
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,619
parsing strings of text

178
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,339
in C and Well, C++ which was like actually a new thing back then was a nightmare.

179
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,500
Even in shell, it's terrible you need

180
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:24,010
in

181
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,820
a and, and the way the shell deals with

182
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:32,250
separators because it could be spaces, it can be line breaks.

183
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,349
It's, it's just a huge freaking mess man.

184
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,830
It's such a pain in the neck and yet

185
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,690
regular expressions are what really made pearl amazing.

186
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:42,558
But regular expressions are like pearl is terrible because

187
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,169
now you look at some of this old pearl code and it's,

188
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,849
it's designed in such a way that you can

189
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,690
just like literally put regular expressions anywhere you want.

190
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:51,650
And

191
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:54,780
so the this old code is a nightmare to deal with.

192
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:57,719
It was it's very easy to write, it's impossible to maintain.

193
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:00,239
So anyway, anyway, Larry Wall created Pearl, right?

194
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,919
And at one point uh this was when PHP was getting hip

195
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:06,539
because obviously PHP was becoming the dominant force on the web.

196
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,780
Which Pearl kind of used to be.

197
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:10,539
I remember writing Pearl CG I scripts, which is,

198
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,179
and you had Mad Pearl was like the big thing then with Apache.

199
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,979
But, but anyway, so PHP is becoming a thing

200
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:21,789
and obviously all of the snobby programmers are looking down on PHP as the, you know,

201
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,390
crappy, worthless language that only idiots would use.

202
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:26,809
And Larry Wall even says at one point that

203
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:29,500
you wouldn't want to read a book written by an amateur.

204
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,549
You wanna read a book written by a professional.

205
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,840
And I, I remember even back then thinking it's a good

206
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,200
point,

207
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,750
you're not wrong,

208
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,469
but

209
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,820
the reality is PHP is going to win and

210
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,989
it's going to essentially destroy Pearl's market share.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,190
And I think between PHP and Python, that is exactly what happened

212
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,409
and you can be that snobby guy and we see this

213
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:52,030
in security constantly where you have these snobby people that,

214
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,919
that are like, oh, I'm too good for that or,

215
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,099
or these people are dumb or this isn't gonna work or that.

216
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,000
And in reality it, nobody cares,

217
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,690
people want to get their job done and they're

218
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,330
gonna find the tool that does it for them.

219
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,229
Whether it's written by a professional author or a dude down the street,

220
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,880
that's just how it is.

221
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:11,859
You know, honestly, yeah, people need to get their stuff done and,

222
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,570
you know, this always reminds me of like the, the hamburger argument, you know,

223
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,140
uh I like a good hamburger.

224
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,450
I do not like mcdonald's, but I get that there's like, well,

225
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,859
several billion people that do like mcdonald's and they keep buying it,

226
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,559
you know, and

227
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,320
it's just, the reality is, you know, people need food,

228
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,770
people need scripts that work.

229
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,080
So, yeah.

230
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,799
And as much as I hate PHP myself, I've used it, you know,

231
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,330
because quite honestly getting something done in PHP quite often will take like,

232
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,200
20 minutes.

233
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,289
Well, there's, there's easier things now, but back in the day,

234
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,239
it was by far

235
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,599
the best option

236
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:50,159
and also what people forget too was getting it up and running on a web host.

237
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,969
They all supported PHP by default and my

238
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,070
QL by default,

239
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,260
anything else and you either had to install it yourself or beg them to install it,

240
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,340
which like let's face it, hosting providers,

241
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,549
they may get around to it, they may not get around to it. But, you know,

242
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:07,109
the reality is if all you have available is like a weirdly

243
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:10,630
shaped hammer called PHP and a big rock called my SQL.

244
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,000
You can build a house. It may not be a very pretty house, but,

245
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,760
you know,

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,419
it'll keep the rain off your head

247
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,320
and,

248
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,450
you know, you look at things like wordpress.

249
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,479
Wordpress is, you know, is the epitome of PHP and my SQL, you know,

250
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,700
b lodging it together.

251
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,010
Um

252
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,690
But it powers like how much of the web now

253
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,309
all of it, it's in the double digits. I know for sure by number of sites.

254
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,469
Right. Right.

255
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,130
So

256
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,000
yeah, and going back to automation, I mean, that's the thing, right is

257
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,989
I think we're still at this, like honestly,

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,630
I think we're at the entry level of automation and it,

259
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,859
because what always gets me is when you ask somebody, how do you build a system

260
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,880
that to me like right there,

261
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:55,200
I'm asking the wrong question like you, you have to build a system.

262
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,400
No,

263
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:58,320
you should just have like a program with like a manifest

264
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,960
and the manifest should say something like I need a,

265
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,150
I need a database

266
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,400
and I need it to be like geographically redundant for, you know, safety

267
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:08,559
and I need like PHP and this and that and the other

268
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,299
thing and then just you shove it into your system and boom,

269
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:13,210
the system makes things magically happen, right?

270
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:15,049
Which is what cloud providers are doing.

271
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:17,809
It's even easier than that in a lot of instances.

272
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:17,989
I mean,

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,890
you look at something like elastic beanstalk and it's just kind of

274
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,010
an an API you write against and then things magically work.

275
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,210
I mean, it's amazing.

276
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,549
Well, that's the next step.

277
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,479
And the problem there is though,

278
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,859
you have to rearchitect a lot of systems because like wordpress is a great example,

279
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:34,299
Wordpress expects to live on a pos

280
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,419
compliant file system that it can read and write from

281
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,979
and store uploads and cash files and all that other stuff.

282
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,570
And it gets

283
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,020
very grumpy if that's not the, the,

284
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,919
that's not what's there, you know, same thing with the database. Right.

285
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,599
It must have a, my SQL database,

286
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,159
not post

287
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:54,859
SQL, but my SQL or something, my SQL compatible, which, you know,

288
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,780
there are some options.

289
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,159
Now. There's a lot of options.

290
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:57,869
Yeah.

291
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,190
You know, and, and the reality is like we,

292
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,859
-- but
-- here's the other part of it is we're still talking about automation.

293
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:05,260
We haven't even really gotten to

294
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,880
machine learning or even artificial intelligence,

295
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,700
which are not the same thing.

296
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,559
And if you confuse them a machine learning or a I person will hit you on the head

297
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,049
with something heavy.

298
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,169
Can you actually just give us a 12th rundown on the differences between the two?

299
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,049
Yes.

300
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,809
And I will apologize to the experts because I'm certain

301
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,530
I will get some of the nuance wrong here.

302
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,369
I am. I'm certainly not an expert, but I've, I've been yelled at by experts. So

303
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,359
that's as close as you're going to get the

304
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:34,729
transitive yelling property. That's right. That's right.

305
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:38,409
And I, I'm, I'm sensitive to this because I've done it to a lot of people myself.

306
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,760
So essentially you've got two concepts,

307
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,849
machine learning is where you essentially,

308
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:47,210
you feed your pet a bunch of data and you kind of

309
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,320
nudge it in the direction you want it to go, right.

310
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,330
Whereas artificial intelligence

311
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:54,650
doesn't necessarily have to be taught,

312
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,390
it has the ability to adapt and grow on

313
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,080
its own without human intervention to nudge it along.

314
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,719
And so

315
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:04,219
logically kind of, if you, if you think about this on a,

316
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:08,130
on a graph of automation is kind of on the left,

317
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,400
machine learning would be closer to the middle and then

318
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:13,039
artificial intelligence is all the way on the right.

319
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,530
And so

320
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,229
it obviously true A I is very difficult, machine learning is hard but more dual,

321
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:24,849
-- even
-- limited A I which we currently do have in some forms is hard.

322
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,159
Right. Right. Well, I,

323
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,590
I don't know if you pay attention to this,

324
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:31,090
but I know I love reading stories about the Google A I.

325
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:31,729
And

326
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,049
they were saying for like Google translate the

327
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:37,489
A I basically invented its own intermediary language

328
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,849
because it was easier than trying to directly

329
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,729
translate things from one language to another,

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,380
which is that kind of stuff is amazing

331
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,299
when, when you have A is that do that because,

332
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:50,059
and that's fundamentally what an A I does is it,

333
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,030
you don't tell it how to solve a problem.

334
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,820
It figures it out on its own.

335
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,950
Now, on the other side, though,

336
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,299
you need obviously substantial resources and time to get your

337
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,940
A I to a point where it is actually usable

338
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,429
as opposed to machine learning,

339
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,940
which you can have up and running in a very short period of time.

340
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:05,799
Yeah.

341
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:06,200
Well,

342
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,130
and the thing I've noticed really with machine learning

343
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,119
is part of the challenge with machine learning is

344
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,280
you really need to understand the problem you're trying to solve with

345
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:17,030
machine learning so that you can feed it the appropriate data and

346
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:19,630
point it in the appropriate direction, right? Because

347
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,169
it kind of reminds me of, you know,

348
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,119
where you have these incentives for people to behave a certain way and you end up

349
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,719
getting something completely the opposite of what you wanted.

350
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:31,080
You know, my, my favorite always being call centers and call time.

351
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,429
They would, you know, measure, call center, call time.

352
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,799
So like you'd literally have people just hanging up on you,

353
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:36,719
you know,

354
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,330
like,

355
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,429
yeah, three minutes and 59 seconds into the phone call,

356
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,539
they would just hang up on you,

357
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,830
you know, so they didn't mingle their

358
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,159
me.

359
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:46,789
That comes back to we,

360
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,320
we discussed this early in a prior episode is you literally get what you measure

361
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,760
whether it is right or wrong. The results you want are what you will get

362
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:58,090
with machine learning

363
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,590
in general.

364
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:02,400
But,

365
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,890
and, and my, my example here is always

366
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,270
if you've ever run, well, I don't know if it's so much anymore,

367
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,700
but there used to be something called Bayesian

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,960
filtering for SP

369
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,090
where you would have ham being non spam

370
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,039
messages and spam obviously being the spam messages.

371
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,619
And I remember running a bay

372
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,169
and filter at one point when I, when I was foolish enough to run my own mail server

373
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,789
and

374
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:23,880
you essentially,

375
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,690
you know, you tell it OK, here's a bunch of ham and here's a bunch of spam

376
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:29,479
and that way it learns what to do.

377
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,000
And of course, invariably I would get the two mixed up at some point

378
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,599
and I would, I would feed it. The spam is ham or? Right.

379
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,500
And then you start reading your mail and you're like, something is very wrong here.

380
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,000
And it, it's totally like that right where you,

381
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,840
you also have to be very careful with machine

382
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:47,320
learning because if you feed it the wrong thing,

383
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:49,679
you're going to get the wrong results.

384
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,030
And so that's obviously one of the many challenges. Whereas A I,

385
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,419
I,

386
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:53,590
I,

387
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,599
I'm, I'm certain this is a possibility

388
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,650
but in theory,

389
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,960
if you have a good enough A I it will realize

390
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,349
you're dumb and it will do the right thing instead.

391
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,049
Well,

392
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,750
and part of the challenge too is um there's a

393
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,479
good ted talk on A I and machine learning and hiring

394
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:09,459
and, you know,

395
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:11,410
these companies are trying to optimize their hiring

396
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,459
process for a variety of perceived things like,

397
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:16,500
oh, we want people to stay a long time and

398
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,579
you know, we want people that work hard and things like that.

399
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,020
And you know,

400
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,510
the concern is do they end up excluding large

401
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,839
pools of candidates because of a variety of reasons,

402
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:28,089
like maybe women because they get pregnant and don't work

403
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,579
or people who are depressed and have medical problems.

404
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:33,280
All right, ladies, you make sure you send all that hate mail to Kurt

405
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,430
at

406
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:34,189
Kurt

407
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:34,619
Seaford.

408
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm against this to be

409
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,319
my concern is

410
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,930
see, and, but the bigger concern is not just that these systems may do this.

411
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,089
We, because of how A I and machine learning sometimes work,

412
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,050
-- we may not know that they're doing
-- it.

413
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,579
It is certainly a possibility and that can definitely happen where things

414
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,489
you have unintended results.

415
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,609
And so, all right,

416
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:57,160
let's tie this into security though because this is

417
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,930
kind of the whole purpose of this topic.

418
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,410
Yeah. So a few hours ago, uh

419
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,150
it's now being reported that

420
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,170
China. So for those of you that don't know, I,

421
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:08,959
and you've missed about

422
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,689
20 years of news.

423
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:15,839
Um China has a firewall essentially surrounding, you know, all

424
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,359
the internet in China

425
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:20,000
uh that they used to filter incoming and outgoing traffic

426
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,270
are good at walls, aren't they?

427
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:22,880
Yeah.

428
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,430
Well, you know, historically, they do kind of work,

429
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,040
sort of for certain values of work.

430
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,189
But, um,

431
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,920
and so what's happened obviously is, you know, you,

432
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,000
you put a wall up around the internet and block access to say, you know,

433
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,239
Wikipedia or whatever.

434
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,880
Well, people who want to read it are going to find a way to read it.

435
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,319
And typically that involves a virtual private network, you know, a VPN.

436
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,239
And of course, there's a lot of legitimate VPN users.

437
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:45,719
Like, well,

438
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:48,229
basically every business user on the planet

439
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:51,109
who's working remotely should be using a VPN

440
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,260
so they, uh,

441
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,560
they've been kind of playing whack a mole with VPN S for a long time and

442
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,900
then apparently today or yesterday they basically just

443
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,939
-- shut down access to all unauthorized VPN
-- S

444
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:07,839
and we assume unauthorized means VPN S they don't have the key for. Right.

445
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:08,750
Yeah.

446
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,339
Or, well, VPN S that, um, you know, aren't like some, for example, you know, they may,

447
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,869
I'm assuming be allowing access to like, maybe major corporations,

448
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,949
VPN so that their workers can get work done in China, right?

449
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,250
So essentially VPN S that would only be used by foreigners, you know,

450
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,949
because that's less of a concern for them.

451
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:27,439
Sure.

452
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,939
So what's interesting though is obviously, you know, it's like

453
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:32,199
Tor the, the onion router project,

454
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,839
you know, people have,

455
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,869
you know, people keep playing whack a mole and trying to block to r you know,

456
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,890
various governments and various network, Kennedy.

457
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:42,280
And of course, people keep finding ways around it, you know,

458
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,280
like a common thing now is, is to put your VPN traffic over, report 443 TP, you know,

459
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,229
http S like secure web.

460
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:50,959
Um you know,

461
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:52,209
and then of course they do things like

462
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,209
up the antibody doing deep packet inspection to

463
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:57,369
look at that and see if it's actually web traffic or VPN traffic and block it.

464
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,839
And now one of the nice things you can do with Google Compute engine is essentially

465
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:06,030
you can use google.com as an end point for like your API or your service.

466
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,020
So, unless they're willing to block, like all of Google,

467
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,349
-- you can get stuff out through Google, for
-- example,

468
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,589
-- they did block Google at one point, didn't
-- they?

469
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,300
-- They have?
-- And

470
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:19,229
I would imagine the reason they're unblocked is

471
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,949
because they're playing nice to some degree.

472
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,729
Well, I suspect that's part of it, but also I suspect the reality is Google is

473
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,270
so important. I mean,

474
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,630
you can have your homegrown search engine and that's awesome. But let's face it.

475
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,949
The reality is when it comes to search Google one.

476
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,930
Yes. Now what does this have to do with machine learning?

477
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,390
Well, for example, machine learning, um I know they've done

478
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,420
uh security studies and attacks, for example,

479
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,469
on V uh VPN traffic to identify voice traffic versus like web traffic or to look at

480
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,569
your web traffic and be able to actually identify

481
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:55,849
kind of which sites you're going to based on

482
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,829
the size of the data, right? Because for example, going to,

483
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,430
you know, cnn.com has a kind of a distinctive fingerprint,

484
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,290
you know how it loads and what it loads

485
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,530
and kind of the, you know, the timing.

486
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:11,920
And I, I remember I read a paper one time about this as well that you, they,

487
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,089
they were watching the packets from an SSH authentication session and, and

488
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,489
basically the cadence of packets that was going across the wire,

489
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:24,560
you could determine what keys a person was typing on the keyboard,

490
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,079
which is there's a lot of info in that metadata

491
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:31,349
and, and anyone who ever tells you metadata doesn't matter is,

492
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,119
is a lying fool to say the least because

493
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:35,349
you're absolutely right.

494
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,760
And I suppose this is a place something like machine learning could provide

495
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:43,099
immense value to a regime that is very interested

496
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:44,839
in keeping an eye on what's going on.

497
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:49,380
Well, and it's less about keeping an eye on what's going on and actively shaping it,

498
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:49,569
right?

499
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:50,260
Because we have,

500
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,619
you know what I really find it.

501
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,040
I mean, you want to talk about the ultimate machine learning and a I

502
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:58,430
you know, China's talking about rolling out essentially a social credit score.

503
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:02,469
So it's kind of like a a financial credit score, but it's a social credit score

504
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,660
in the sense of kind of how good a citizen are you, right?

505
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,130
And there's a, there's a really good episode of Black Mirror.

506
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,349
Yeah, we'll put a link to that in the show notes.

507
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:10,939
But

508
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,900
what's very scary for, you know, a lot of us Westerners,

509
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,020
this concept is that this social score will really

510
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:21,619
uh not so much shape and impact your life

511
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,060
but control it flat out because it'll affect,

512
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,180
you know, do you get to go to school? You know, do you get that job? Do you get to move

513
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,180
um things like that? And

514
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,349
it becomes that sort of ultimate scenario of we don't have to have

515
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,849
people policing you because we'll just get you to police yourself,

516
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,489
you know, like to put it

517
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:40,920
bluntly,

518
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,329
Josh and I have agreed that we are not

519
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:45,880
going to be talking about American politics for centuries.

520
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,449
It's just, it's,

521
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,520
yeah, there's for some reason.

522
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah.

523
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,489
You know,

524
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,130
it's just something that we've decided is not going to happen on our podcast.

525
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,180
And we've self censored that for a variety of reasons for some

526
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,750
reason.

527
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:58,569
Yeah.

528
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:02,790
And so, you know, this, on the one hand, I, I'm actually quite pissed off about it,

529
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,569
but on the other hand, I don't want the hassle

530
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:06,369
and this is

531
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,069
crazy to think about because you're essentially going

532
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:12,609
to have computers making decisions about a person's future

533
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,670
with something like this social score, right?

534
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:16,390
Although,

535
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,949
although now is this really that different from like your credit score in,

536
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:22,880
in? I don't, I don't

537
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,349
use the same kind of credit scoring. The United States.

538
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:25,670
We

539
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,170
use, we

540
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:26,500
use

541
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:26,859
FICO

542
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,329
and

543
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:28,119
you

544
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:28,800
know, on

545
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,449
Equifax,

546
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,160
they, they pay attention to a huge

547
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:35,785
number of indicators in a person's life.

548
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:36,545
And so

549
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:41,505
-- really any different. Well, of course, well, they are,
-- I have a $500

550
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:42,334
credit

551
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:47,104
entity item on my credit report from when I was like 20. And I'm like, what is this?

552
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,885
And I went, and Experian was like,

553
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,505
go to your bank and I went to my bank and my bank is like, I don't know what this is.

554
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:52,854
Go talk to Experian and I'm like,

555
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,500
-- ok, then
-- I isn't that stuff supposed to come off after seven years.

556
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,699
Uh, yeah, I'd have to check but, I mean,

557
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:01,410
it was there for a long time and nobody knew what

558
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,229
it was and there was no process to deal with it.

559
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,219
You know, I do know that

560
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,589
some years ago that was very true.

561
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,619
But my understanding is it's become significantly easier

562
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,469
to deal with this. Now, granted, I, I haven't had to so I can't say if it is or it isn't.

563
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:16,810
But

564
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,020
that's just from my, my mild understanding of this and,

565
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,849
but yeah, I mean, if you have a crap credit score,

566
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,579
you've got,

567
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,329
I know a lot of job,

568
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,349
uh, a lot of jobs now are asking

569
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,410
or flat requiring your credit score when you apply.

570
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:36,420
Um, and I can sort of see that maybe with a financial controlling position

571
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,579
where you don't want somebody with terrible credit who has

572
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:40,489
like a history of going bankrupt every two years,

573
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,270
you know, in charge of your finances,

574
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,099
although you should have checks and balances regardless, right?

575
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:47,719
But it worries me because, you know,

576
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:51,219
you get a bad credit score and it now impacts your ability to get a job.

577
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:54,160
It already impacts your ability to get other financial products.

578
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,920
Like if you have a bad credit score,

579
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,650
you don't get as good a rate because you're seen to be more risky. So

580
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,739
my concern is once you fall down that hole, how do you get out of it?

581
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,609
You wait seven years.

582
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:09,660
And like, that's actually the answer is you just have to wait for

583
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,800
your terrible credit to

584
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,619
just kind of uh time out or, or expire.

585
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,369
I don't think that stuff is happening as I

586
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,410
think there is that technically that seven year rule,

587
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,790
but my understanding is that data is there for a long,

588
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,060
I would totally believe that,

589
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,530
you know, or at a minimum,

590
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,420
they would have your credit score from 10 years ago and say like,

591
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,300
why did you go from 100 and 80 to, you know, 600?

592
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,560
Like, can you please explain it

593
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,640
because my

594
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,609
maybe, maybe so anyway, we need to tie this back to security because we keep going on.

595
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:40,900
This is a weird topic. But, but so here's, here's one of the things though is with

596
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:46,079
you, you have an article here, Amazon bought a place called Harvest A I

597
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:49,939
Yeah. Harvest dot A. I didn't even know that was a top level domain.

598
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:55,599
And essentially the premise of Harvest A I is in my opinion. Super awesome. Cool.

599
00:25:55,609 --> 00:26:00,920
Basically, they look at your usage patterns of like accessing your files,

600
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,239
accessing your services, you know, all that kind of

601
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,500
like essentially what you're doing on your computer uh and

602
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,609
talking to your corporate network for the sake of argument.

603
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:13,540
And then based on those usage patterns, they kind of say good or bad and if it's bad,

604
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,599
then they'll, you know, essentially start the security process rolling a bit.

605
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,530
And so, you know, the classic case being like

606
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:24,089
Bob is in America accessing his corporate VPN and then, you know,

607
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,619
all of a sudden an hour later,

608
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,339
Bob is accessing the VPN from China,

609
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,469
but that's not, you don't need a I for that, I mean,

610
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,880
Pearl.

611
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:35,979
-- But you know,
-- that's a simplistic example of, you know,

612
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:39,089
A I will help you catch all these weird different corner cases

613
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,530
like maybe Bob is sick and he's working from home versus,

614
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,229
you know, somebody is Impersonating Bob from a coffee shop, you know,

615
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,449
so tying in, you know, and different risk factors too, right? Like,

616
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,420
you know, if Bob dials in and starts like, looking at every single file or, you know,

617
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,479
reading and writing every single file, you know, that could be ransomware.

618
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,680
Um, you know, like in

619
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,780
there should never, for example, in most cases,

620
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,329
never be a user who like touches every single file or reads every single file.

621
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:08,319
You know, that's an indication that maybe they're copying everything or, you know,

622
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:09,260
encrypting everything

623
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:11,229
and you're going to have a bad day

624
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,550
and things like these usage patterns too, right?

625
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,819
Like what I find fascinating, for example, like the iphone,

626
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,310
my iphone is now like, I know where you live

627
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,699
-- and it's a little bit confused about where I work.
-- I watch you while you sleep.

628
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,069
Exactly. You know,

629
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,829
and it's also learning, for example that like, oh, you're gonna be driving here now,

630
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,219
I'm going to warn you about travel time because I know like when rush hour is,

631
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,750
you know, and this kind of level of helper is hugely beneficial.

632
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,030
But at the same time, it kind of terrifying.

633
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:41,709
Um now for something like harvest A I it's deployed with, you know, it's,

634
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:45,729
it's a company deploying it within their own walls as it were or, you know,

635
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:47,989
within their stuff on Amazon web services.

636
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,349
But what gets me is Amazon

637
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:51,540
web services already does like a lot of

638
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,069
analysis of bad behavior and they can do this without

639
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,170
having to even come close to looking at your data,

640
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,449
like even just things like network usage patterns, ra M usage, CPU usage kind of dis

641
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,949
guy or things like that are all

642
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:06,369
enough indicators with metadata

643
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:10,589
to kind of say like this is OK, this is normal or you know,

644
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,380
this guy is probably a bad guy.

645
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,670
Yeah. Right. And well, so here's the thing

646
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,880
that I always wonder about when we have these

647
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,900
kind of A I and machine parsing solutions.

648
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:23,619
So

649
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:26,709
we don't like people looking at what we're doing,

650
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,130
that's just kind of human nature. Nobody likes to be watched.

651
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,810
But if we know an A I is watching us, does that change?

652
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,959
Because so the reason let me back this up a bit first is

653
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,680
when you do studies on people

654
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,770
and they know they're being watched,

655
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:44,729
they change their behavior,

656
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:45,560
right?

657
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,130
And so obviously, if you know someone is spying on you,

658
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:54,579
you will act differently than if you don't know they are. Right?

659
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:01,859
And so does this, I, I wonder if this counts for that, if I know my company is using A I

660
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,540
to parse what I am doing,

661
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,869
if that changes the way I act necessarily versus

662
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,699
saying there is a person watching what I'm doing.

663
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,510
Well, that's come up.

664
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,189
So, for example, here in Alberta, we have a uh a government run health system

665
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,109
and obviously it used to be like paper records based,

666
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,699
right?

667
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,969
And they went to what's called Alberta Health Link. It's an electronic system.

668
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:25,880
And one of the biggest

669
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:31,849
uh changes and benefits was because it's electronic, they can now log all access.

670
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:36,040
And so for example, they can set like a privacy sensitive flag.

671
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,270
Uh for example, on famous people's files

672
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:42,569
and then review those accesses and be like, why did you look at this person's files?

673
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,119
Oh, you're his doctor and you're like,

674
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,729
fix them, right?

675
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,400
You know, that's ok or you're a nurse with this doctor or

676
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,260
you know, whatever.

677
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,369
But and then there's all these other cases where it's like, OK,

678
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,459
you have no reason to be looking at this patient's file,

679
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:55,109
you know, same thing with banks, right?

680
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,819
Banks, you know, log all access.

681
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,949
So the tellers, you know, it's like, oh, you know,

682
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:03,349
Kurt swiped his card at the teller station and the teller looked up all his data,

683
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,589
obviously, that's,

684
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,260
that's ok. But then,

685
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,239
you know, versus the teller just randomly looking up Kurt's data.

686
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,540
Oh, Kurt phoned and was asking a question.

687
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,420
Great, totally fine versus, you know, she's just randomly looking up Kurt's info,

688
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:16,180
right?

689
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:18,939
And so I would say, you know, part of this is, it's,

690
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:22,459
it's a little different when you're at work and you're working for somebody else,

691
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:26,099
you know, versus your, your behavior in private or your, you know, your own life.

692
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:28,859
I think, I think generally it's ok and it's gonna happen.

693
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,489
I mean, the metadata exists regardless it has to exist, right?

694
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,890
Because I have to access the file server to read a file.

695
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,930
You know, unless we have some like really insanely complicated

696
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,420
zero knowledge crypto

697
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:41,969
-- thing of a jigger to share our files,
-- which nobody has that,

698
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:42,550
that would be

699
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:42,689
the

700
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:42,910
same.

701
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,180
So I, I would like to think that, you know, knowing that, for example,

702
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:50,920
all your accesses are logged, maybe people abuse it less.

703
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,180
You know, this is quite frankly, for example,

704
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:57,890
why I actually still use firewalls is I still use

705
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,800
firewalls so that traffic that gets past the firewall is

706
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:03,219
much more likely to be something of interest.

707
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,380
You know, I'm basically trying to get rid of as much chaff as possible.

708
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,719
Well, and that's, that's fair.

709
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,420
I mean,

710
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,709
I, I kind of get that and I don't think you're wrong,

711
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:16,229
but I also suspect there is a

712
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,469
certain group of people

713
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,229
that don't understand many of these rules or what can be done.

714
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,510
And so they're just, they don't think or know

715
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,469
and they still can engage in these activities. But I guess

716
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:36,239
at the same time these people are probably also your riskiest employees and exactly

717
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,829
the ones you should be paying attention

718
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,589
to because they're opening attachments from,

719
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,949
who knows where.

720
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:44,550
And one of my concerns with this is that

721
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,550
we,

722
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,760
one of the challenges of some machine learning and a lot of a

723
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,709
I is we don't know how or why it got that answer,

724
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,160
right? But it did, you know the intervening neural network did the right thing.

725
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,859
And it identified that picture as a dog. Yay us.

726
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,989
So my concern is when things start to go a little wonky,

727
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,510
-- can we fix it? Can we even know that there's a problem
-- or is it wrong?

728
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,630
Maybe it's right and we just can't understand it,

729
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,969
which is crazy to think about,

730
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:13,109
you know, and, and that's what's interesting to me is

731
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:17,630
humans traditionally have always built machines that we understand,

732
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:18,380
you know,

733
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:21,099
and there can be machines with emergent behavior

734
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:23,099
like machines that are so complicated that like,

735
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:23,510
you know,

736
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,949
parts expand or contract due to heat in other

737
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,270
areas and then you get like wonky behaviors.

738
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,589
Um You know, my favorite being always is watching, you know,

739
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,050
you see a documentary on like steam locomotives

740
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:38,040
and these things are a nightmare like, oh my God, do you think your car is unreliable?

741
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,390
And you know, tough to, to operate

742
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:43,250
like a steam powered locomotive is like,

743
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,099
they're literally, I remember one, they're just like, oh yeah, pressure,

744
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:47,050
steam pressure is dropping.

745
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,089
It might blow up soon.

746
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:50,650
Uh I'm gonna start fiddling with the mobs

747
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,890
and then like five minutes later they're like,

748
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,079
ok, everything's back to normal.

749
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:55,849
-- We're ok.
-- Those things were insane.

750
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,569
How, how much, how much maintenance they took it.

751
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:00,680
You know what it always reminds me of is

752
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:05,920
there's always those computer systems that like when I leave on a trip,

753
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,380
I get a call and the kids are like, hey dad, the TV,

754
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,430
broke or this broke or the internet doesn't work.

755
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:11,150
And it's like,

756
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,579
how does this always happen when I leave? But you don't realize that that

757
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,060
every day

758
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:19,229
I'm fiddling with something to keep it running and I don't even realize I

759
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:21,969
do it in many instances and then I leave and three days later,

760
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:25,739
like, everything stops working and this is, this is how the world works.

761
00:33:25,989 --> 00:33:29,729
Everything is falling apart constantly and people are always, like,

762
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:32,339
holding it together with tape and, and bubble gum.

763
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,920
Yeah. And I've intentionally at home for my IT systems here.

764
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:40,020
I've intentionally like, purchased uh like a hardware-based, you know,

765
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,339
small firewall

766
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,900
that I intentionally do not allow myself to touch.

767
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,420
I, I forced myself to set it up

768
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,869
and it's not set up as optimally or as nice as I would like.

769
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,459
And I don't twiddle with it, but it's set up so that it works.

770
00:33:53,589 --> 00:33:53,920
Oh, man.

771
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,819
You know what you just reminded me of, I feel like on this,

772
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:59,540
on the podcast that a while back I was talking about the gym, I attend

773
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,119
that had their, their IP network range messed up because they were,

774
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,949
they were stealing like all the 172 networks.

775
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:06,890
So I can't get to Google.

776
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,070
So they fixed that.

777
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,110
Right. And all of a sudden Google's working now from the gym.

778
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,208
But I thought

779
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,409
I, I found out about this app on Android called Fing. Fing.

780
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:20,050
And it basically does like a wi fi scan of the network and,

781
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,489
and lets you know what's going on and I thought

782
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,379
I'll give it a scan and see what's going on.

783
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,929
Yeah, their whole network is flat.

784
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,929
They, they call it the guest network. No, not the guest network. Like, it's all flat.

785
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:30,679
I can see every machine in the place

786
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,600
and all the printers, all the computers, like every,

787
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,760
and part of me thinks I should tell them another part

788
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,478
of me thinks they're never gonna let me come back.

789
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:39,379
Yeah, I bring this up.

790
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:39,739
Well,

791
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,820
here's the problem if you bring it up and even if they don't shoot the messenger,

792
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,580
something bad will happen at a later point.

793
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,879
-- And they'll be like, hey, remember that guy.
-- Right. Exactly. Exactly.

794
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,260
And I don't need to deal with this. And so I closed thing and I left

795
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,280
and,

796
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,260
and Yeah,

797
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:55,969
I see that

798
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,090
a

799
00:34:56,438 --> 00:34:57,610
-- lot,
-- you know, with, where

800
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,540
should I point and no, just shut up.

801
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:00,909
You know,

802
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,000
and that's one of the sad realities of

803
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,919
the universe is when you tell people something,

804
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:09,750
they, they blame you. We, we, I had this once where

805
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:13,070
there was a bunch of security guys in this.

806
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,189
We, we had like a little meet up at a, at a pub

807
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:21,179
and we had a nonsecurity person kind of tag along a coworker of someone else.

808
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,290
And that later that night,

809
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:25,040
their Facebook got hacked

810
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:28,610
and they, they were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.

811
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,100
It was us because we're the security guys she met us and

812
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,290
all of a sudden it's like you guys clearly did this.

813
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,840
It's like,

814
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,729
look, all right, number one,

815
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,500
I don't know what your Facebook account is.

816
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,139
And even if I did, like, I don't care, there's,

817
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,739
I don't want to hack your Facebook account. There's,

818
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,020
well, not only that, it's like all Chinese

819
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,050
crap on it, right?

820
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,899
So it's clearly like just some random foreign hacker that got,

821
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:52,810
it was probably doing, you know, like Google juice spam linking or whatever.

822
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,399
And it's like, I don't speak Chinese,

823
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:56,889
I didn't hack your Facebook.

824
00:35:56,899 --> 00:36:00,179
I don't wanna but no, there's nothing we could say like we didn't,

825
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,479
that was our fault.

826
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,659
And this is totally what happens

827
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,290
and,

828
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,199
and I guess though this kind of all works its way back into this whole A I concept now.

829
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:13,129
Is, if we can measure behavior based upon A, I,

830
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:14,530
I imagine

831
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:17,149
there will be probably some false positives,

832
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,459
but I suspect it will remove a lot of false

833
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:23,100
negatives because when you have a human looking at this,

834
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:25,149
if, if there's someone you don't like,

835
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,469
you're going to find a problem with them.

836
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:27,899
Right.

837
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:30,310
And a is, well, as far as we know,

838
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,310
a is, don't dislike certain people more than others.

839
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,429
Well, you know, you mentioned that

840
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:39,780
and I would point out all those cameras from China with the face detection software

841
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,250
-- that don't see um African Americans. Uh
-- I

842
00:36:43,729 --> 00:36:46,889
imagine that is poor quality assurance testing on

843
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:49,330
-- the part of the Chinese company that
-- created the

844
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:53,120
but more to the point they didn't think to test this, they didn't think to, you know,

845
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:53,739
go

846
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,620
for extreme, you know, variations in skin color

847
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,889
and what, what problems are we going to have with a is where we're like, oh,

848
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:00,939
we didn't even think

849
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,100
to have that as a, as a problem

850
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,820
machine.

851
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:05,064
That could certainly be an issue.

852
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:06,324
But in theory with A I,

853
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,324
that will not be a problem because A I will

854
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:11,405
be able to correct such oversight on our part.

855
00:37:11,415 --> 00:37:12,665
But you know what this reminds me of

856
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:15,185
is I remember when, when Siri came out

857
00:37:15,395 --> 00:37:17,314
and there were all the hilarious videos from

858
00:37:17,324 --> 00:37:19,945
like the Scottish people trying to talk to Siri

859
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:21,635
Chip.

860
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:27,705
That's a pretty good accent. I'm impressed.

861
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,649
I I do not have a Scottish accent. So II, I barely have any accent.

862
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,699
I, I, I'm told I have an American accent, which I,

863
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,489
I'm skeptical. I speak English. So

864
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:41,550
we'll just say I have an accent.

865
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,000
I wouldn't know about that.

866
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,879
That's right. You're Canadian English.

867
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,639
I love it.

868
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,020
Oh, man.

869
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:50,939
All right.

870
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:51,679
So,

871
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,699
yeah, I don't know. This is, this is,

872
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:54,780
I think

873
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,189
around

874
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,760
all of this A I and machine learning is that we,

875
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,320
we are already in a situation where a lot of people

876
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,459
don't understand the technologies that they use on a daily basis.

877
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:07,110
Like not even a little bit,

878
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,699
but that's the point of the A I I think is

879
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,840
like, we'll,

880
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:16,199
we'll look at security here is how many people are doing security jobs today

881
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:20,280
that you could probably replace with a couple of 100 lines of pearl

882
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,020
and like, like looking at logs and things like that.

883
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,379
And this is where I can see the A I having

884
00:38:25,629 --> 00:38:26,860
immense value.

885
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:30,699
But I guess conversely A I is going to destroy

886
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:33,659
any sort of, you know, entry level position.

887
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,709
And so where are we gonna get our professionals from then?

888
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,189
I guess maybe we'll just hope the A I

889
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,129
keeps getting better and we don't need people anymore.

890
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:39,570
I don't know.

891
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:41,459
Well, and, and it's interesting,

892
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,860
you mentioned the entry level position because

893
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,620
that's actually one of my big concerns,

894
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:47,120
especially around CV E is that, you know, we don't, I'm,

895
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:49,919
I'm trying to build some on ramps for CV E so that we can get.

896
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,830
And when I say entry level people, I'm talking to people who are like,

897
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,129
already deeply interested in information security.

898
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,290
You know,

899
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,939
my, one of my bigger concerns now is like, what do we do with, like, you have, like,

900
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:03,030
let's say for the sake of argument, you have a bright 16 year old who's like,

901
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,570
I want to be a computer security person when I grow up.

902
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,850
So like, what courses should I take in high school?

903
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,610
Career choice kid,

904
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:10,139
turn,

905
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,449
turn around.

906
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,489
Yeah. So like, what, what should I do in high school?

907
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,429
And what should I take in university? And I'd be like, uh comp

908
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,139
I

909
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,379
maybe,

910
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:20,969
you know,

911
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,610
philosophy, go take as many philosophy,

912
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,169
you know.

913
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:30,169
And so, you know, and that, and that is a valid concern. Like, how do we,

914
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:32,530
how do we essentially get these people to train up

915
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,989
when we take all that easy work and like,

916
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,129
shove it into a computer?

917
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:36,790
I have no idea.

918
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,689
And this is going to be one of the great questions just with humanity in general.

919
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,090
I mean, look at self driving cars

920
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,159
when we have self driving vehicles,

921
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:47,919
we don't need people driving taxis or people driving.

922
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:51,330
Elon Musk is saying that's 3 to 6 months away for the Teslas uh

923
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,800
six months.

924
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,649
-- You know
-- what I'm assuming it's not like full self driving curb to curb,

925
00:39:57,659 --> 00:39:58,699
but it's more like, ok,

926
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,110
like if you're on the interstate, you can go take a nap. Now,

927
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,179
whereas before it's like you have to pay attention

928
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:05,229
and keep your hands on the wheel and,

929
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,830
like, what's the point of this again?

930
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,350
Right.

931
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,489
Well, and I love that,

932
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,389
even though the Tesla autopilot has gotten some bad press in the recently,

933
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,689
they're still, they, they did, they crunch some numbers and even with its problems,

934
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:20,939
it's still significantly safer than people.

935
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:27,030
-- It was 40% less crashes, which I that's, that's a huge amount.
-- That

936
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,899
-- is
-- amazing.

937
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:29,830
Well, you know, this is so funny enough

938
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,590
when we start talking about like a I

939
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,260
and kind of replacing humans because we're really bad at a

940
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:40,229
lot of things is there's always unintended consequences and for example,

941
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,669
the unintended consequence of self driving cars

942
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,989
is going to be there is organ donation will vanish,

943
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:47,629
right?

944
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,530
Because let's face it,

945
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,219
the vast majority of organs donated come from automobile accidents.

946
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:54,929
And now granted, I'm gonna say this is,

947
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,510
I don't think this is a bad problem to have.

948
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,310
I think it's good if less people are dying, right? Mind you. But,

949
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,209
but there's, there's

950
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:04,570
the savings on medical costs and body shops and like

951
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:05,300
just the,

952
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,270
the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars a year in

953
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,870
lost productivity because people are getting bashed up in car accidents.

954
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:11,699
Well, not only that,

955
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,489
what about parking tickets?

956
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:18,610
There are a large number of municipalities or speeding tickets, for example,

957
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:21,469
where these these cities,

958
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,820
like, like the,

959
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,540
the traffic enforcement makes up a significant portion

960
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,860
of their budget and that's going to disappear.

961
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,129
Right.

962
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:32,419
What I'm really curious about is how this is going to affect crime because,

963
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,489
I mean, committing crime, one of the

964
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,810
tenets of it is you need to be able to get away

965
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:38,870
Alexa

966
00:41:39,189 --> 00:41:40,310
getaway car.

967
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:40,929
Yeah.

968
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:41,770
You know, and,

969
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,330
and more to the point you can still get away but

970
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,760
now all the travel logs and all the metadata is there.

971
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:46,030
So

972
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:48,270
they have that anyway because I bet most of

973
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,385
these thieves keep their cell phones in their pocket.

974
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:50,794
So

975
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:52,985
it's hard to, you have to get a warrant for that.

976
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:55,895
You can't just be like go to the cell phone company. You'd be like, I want every,

977
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:56,665
you know what I mean?

978
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,945
And there have been cases of this,

979
00:41:57,955 --> 00:41:59,804
there was a murder case in Germany where they caught

980
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:01,945
the guy based on the cell phone records because he,

981
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:03,985
he was murdered out in the middle of nowhere in a forest.

982
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:05,764
So they pulled the cell phone records from that

983
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,685
area and then found this cab driver who,

984
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,425
well, ultimately turns out he did it

985
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:14,729
and, and, but you don't think that we're gonna have the same sort of requirements

986
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:19,129
for just general ride information from whoever happens to

987
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:19,580
vehicle.

988
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,989
I, I think we might not at first, but I imagine it will happen. But

989
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,199
additionally, though here's the thing, man,

990
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:30,550
if we have a I that can do various behavior recognition.

991
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,340
What happens when we have an A I watching,

992
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:35,850
like what every human being is doing on the planet in terms of where they travel,

993
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,340
kind of what they're buying all this stuff.

994
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:40,850
And all of a sudden they're like, this guy just bought like shotguns and he's,

995
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,389
he took it car out into the middle of the woods

996
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:44,530
and, you know,

997
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:47,489
and then he's traveling there later with, with his wife,

998
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,600
like something crazy is going on here, you know, what do you do then?

999
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,010
Do we have the A I basically say, hey,

1000
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,489
please go arrest this guy's gonna murder his wife in the woods

1001
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:57,580
and it's crazy to think about this stuff, man.

1002
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,560
I mean, it's very minority report, right?

1003
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:02,100
Well, we already have this to a degree with email, right?

1004
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,340
All my email gets scanned for spam.

1005
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,850
So it's a very specific use case of like we're gonna scan all

1006
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,629
your email and like chuck out 99% of it because it's garbage.

1007
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,139
And I'm like, sweet, I can live with that.

1008
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,810
And then people get upset, for example, because you have, um,

1009
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,330
ad insertion based on what your email content is,

1010
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:19,300
right?

1011
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,510
And so there's these varying degrees, you know, versus like, if, well,

1012
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,419
remember when Yahoo was found out to be running their, um, their email,

1013
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,260
you know, snarling project,

1014
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,459
you know, for, uh, on behalf of the

1015
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:31,639
organization,

1016
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,300
you know.

1017
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,699
Um, and so the, you know, it, it reminds me of, um, like in, in Britain,

1018
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:40,949
they have a stated goal of having a N pr automated number plate

1019
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:44,459
recognition cameras and they've put them on all the major highways and everything

1020
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,949
with the ex, like,

1021
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:50,649
one of the explicit goals is to deny the use of the highway system to criminals.

1022
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:51,919
Right?

1023
00:43:52,169 --> 00:43:54,610
Uh, if you watch the British equivalent of cops,

1024
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,489
now they actually have motorway cops that are dedicated to like,

1025
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,370
uh one of the main things they deal with is like you get an A N pr

1026
00:44:00,379 --> 00:44:03,889
hit on a vehicle of interest and they go chase it down and see what's up,

1027
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,050
you know, and

1028
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:08,689
uh quite often there is something up, you know, this car is reported stolen or

1029
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,179
um some of it was really interesting to me was this car is of interest.

1030
00:44:12,189 --> 00:44:14,969
It was reported to be associated with this address where, you know,

1031
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:17,729
this person lives that is maybe accused of this crime or

1032
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,949
is a known drug dealer or it's a known drug house.

1033
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,489
So in some countries, we've already got that going on,

1034
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:24,429
right?

1035
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:27,600
And apparently people are ok with it because, you know,

1036
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,570
I haven't heard any mass protests or

1037
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,780
-- any changes in the law in Britain. It's tricky
-- man.

1038
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,439
I mean, I, I can see it both ways where the,

1039
00:44:36,649 --> 00:44:38,399
the eff loving,

1040
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,280
you know, ac lu in me says

1041
00:44:41,419 --> 00:44:44,370
this is terrible. We shouldn't do this because

1042
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,280
we're going to catch

1043
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,879
somebody not doing anything wrong

1044
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,159
and get them in trouble.

1045
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,209
But another

1046
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,620
side to me.

1047
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,310
But,

1048
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:53,159
so here's what

1049
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,790
-- I think
-- the self

1050
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:54,100
cns

1051
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,639
piece is even worse than that.

1052
00:44:55,649 --> 00:44:58,489
You know, we're going to get people to just not do behaviors that

1053
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:01,340
are not a problem but they're going, you know,

1054
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,179
that's exactly part of it.

1055
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:09,050
And I guess in a free society we have to recognize that the rights of the people

1056
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,870
outweigh

1057
00:45:11,149 --> 00:45:16,719
any potential benefit we could derive from these sort of A I behavior programs.

1058
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:17,790
Well,

1059
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,719
we've already in some ways crossed these, you know,

1060
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:25,350
-- things. Um No,
-- we have, but this is not uncommon

1061
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:30,870
for humanity to make a step forward with some new technology and then to see it

1062
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:36,270
abused and then have to come in and somehow regulate that for the benefit of society.

1063
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,389
I mean, that's basically

1064
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,310
-- the story of humanity,
-- right?

1065
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,610
See,

1066
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,774
one of my biggest fears is we're getting to a point where it's

1067
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:46,915
becoming very easy to track and measure and stifle like political dissent.

1068
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:49,435
And part of having a healthy government system is,

1069
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:52,485
is having those healthy outlets for political dissent.

1070
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:55,715
Like I can go and protest and say rude words

1071
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:59,840
and then I feel better about it and I don't, you know, feel the urge to blow stuff up,

1072
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,229
right?

1073
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:02,550
Because I can't, I have no outlet, right?

1074
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:03,989
And the reality is there are parts of

1075
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,949
the world where things have escalated such that,

1076
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:10,409
you know, people think blowing stuff up is a valid form of political expression.

1077
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,229
-- You know, and I don't want to live in that part of the world or in that
-- kind

1078
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,870
of society because they can't protest or

1079
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:19,149
what it boils down to. I think a lot of it is, is when you have

1080
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,919
outlets for, you know, like, let's say,

1081
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:22,560
for the cigar and you have 10% of the

1082
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,520
population in your country wants things a different way

1083
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,600
and they feel that they have no outlet for that and they have,

1084
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:31,879
they're not being heard and they get pissed off and frustrated about it, right?

1085
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,939
Like the American election is a great example,

1086
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,830
not everybody's happy about the outcome,

1087
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,909
but they feel that they were heard by and large, you know,

1088
00:46:38,919 --> 00:46:41,479
same thing with when I vote in most elections.

1089
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:42,270
I,

1090
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:44,250
you know, don't get the outcome I want,

1091
00:46:44,439 --> 00:46:49,379
but I participated and I was heard and, you know, as ugly as the process was,

1092
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:52,500
it works for, you know, various values of works.

1093
00:46:52,669 --> 00:46:55,870
So while I may not be happy about the outcome, I'm at least,

1094
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:01,110
uh you know, sort of ok with it. And I don't feel a need for example to, you know,

1095
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,939
go overthrow my government because I didn't get the government.

1096
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:05,449
-- I want, we're going
-- to get a visit

1097
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:07,679
enforcement.

1098
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,669
-- My next trip to the US is going to be an annoying
-- fun time,

1099
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,270
which is Rs A.

1100
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:13,850
Yeah.

1101
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:16,590
Well, I mean, they're already, you know, asking,

1102
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,040
um apparently they were asking people to show them their social profiles.

1103
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,699
And again, you know, there's a great example like,

1104
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,330
you know,

1105
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,750
if you're traveling to the US and your social profile

1106
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,189
consists of like some really strong anti US rhetoric,

1107
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:29,629
you know, should they let you in

1108
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:34,110
uh anyone with any sense will create a Ringer Facebook

1109
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,389
profile where you post nothing but pictures of kittens.

1110
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:41,550
And then when the border control says, Kurt, show me your Facebook page.

1111
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,209
You can be like

1112
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:46,139
here it is. Aren't these some neat looking cats? I really like them a lot.

1113
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:47,909
This little one here is the cutest,

1114
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:53,399
I mean, but, and this is, I mean, I guess this is part of the challenge as well. Is,

1115
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,860
well, is, is it part of the, no, it's not really part of the challenge.

1116
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,709
This is, this is a place a I will be interesting because

1117
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,919
it will be much more difficult to hide.

1118
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:04,729
Well, and, and that goes to hiding and masking, right?

1119
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:07,899
You, there's the difference between hiding and a difference between masking.

1120
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:10,340
You know, where you, you, for example, you take up, uh,

1121
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:13,229
gardening as a hobby so that you can buy large amounts of fertilizer

1122
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:15,020
-- without looking suspicious
-- for

1123
00:48:15,149 --> 00:48:15,219
some

1124
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:15,739
reason.

1125
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:16,459
Yeah.

1126
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,669
Um,

1127
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,340
again, it comes back to, you know, on the one hand,

1128
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,469
I don't want to live in a police state, but on the other hand, I don't,

1129
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:24,830
II, I like

1130
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:28,189
having a society that is relatively crime free.

1131
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,419
That is a nice thing.

1132
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,909
But do you think you can have

1133
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,429
relatively crime free

1134
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,709
without police state, like behavior?

1135
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:41,179
I think, given certain

1136
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:44,179
economic systems where there was more equitable,

1137
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:47,379
equitable distribution of wealth we could certainly get, you know,

1138
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:50,550
because a lot of crime is based on, you know, people are desperate.

1139
00:48:50,709 --> 00:48:51,459
Right. Like,

1140
00:48:51,669 --> 00:48:54,330
um, there's people in my neighborhood that will basically, you know,

1141
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,389
take anything that's not nailed down and then try and sell

1142
00:48:56,399 --> 00:48:59,169
it at a pawn shop because they're just economically desperate.

1143
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,570
I don't like that. They're stealing stuff.

1144
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,969
But at the same time, I, I get that, you know, when you

1145
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,340
say, for example, are on welfare and only get, you know, $627 a month here.

1146
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:12,580
You know, the incentive to steal stuff to get an extra 50 bucks is pretty strong.

1147
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:19,830
Yes. This episode has delved bizarrely into countless social issues.

1148
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,350
Well, and that's, and,

1149
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:24,149
but that comes back to security. A lot of these,

1150
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,530
we're trying to solve a lot of social and human issues with technical controls.

1151
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:34,070
Like, for example, why should it be unsafe for me to accept an email from anybody?

1152
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,120
There is no way me accepting an email from anybody should result in like,

1153
00:49:38,129 --> 00:49:40,919
my life being destroyed because my accounts all get cleaned out.

1154
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:43,840
I agree completely and I blame email.

1155
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,610
I, I believe we,

1156
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,040
we went out of our way to make it

1157
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,199
convenient and my favorite whipping boy here is attachments.

1158
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:52,590
Email attachments shouldn't be a thing just period.

1159
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:55,760
And, and you can say no, you're wrong but I'm gonna say no,

1160
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,209
just look

1161
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:00,969
security report. I sent you a few weeks ago about the um

1162
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,979
it was, it was about high value targets

1163
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:06,840
and what real security can we do for them? And they actually had data

1164
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,659
and for high value targets,

1165
00:50:08,669 --> 00:50:11,300
they don't use attachments anymore because it's a known thing.

1166
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,969
Yeah, obviously you email somebody

1167
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,909
like a PDF saying, hey, here's a copy of my resume or hey,

1168
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:18,760
here's some data that you might be interested in or hey, I'm having trouble,

1169
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:19,860
you know, opening this file.

1170
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:20,879
Can you please help me?

1171
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,590
And of course, the file is infected with like some, you know,

1172
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,580
virus to hijack the guy's phone.

1173
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,689
And so a lot of these like human rights activists, for example,

1174
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:31,570
no longer do email attachments, they'll do you know,

1175
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:35,879
use a file service like say dropbox or box or whatever.

1176
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:36,090
Right.

1177
00:50:37,149 --> 00:50:40,840
Exactly. And then it becomes very easy from there to, you know, handle the file a lot.

1178
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:45,010
Say for like, so for example, with PDF si, don't open PDF S on my system anymore.

1179
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:48,010
I upload them to Google Drive and I open them in Google Drive,

1180
00:50:48,149 --> 00:50:50,409
which is totally the right thing to do.

1181
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:50,879
But,

1182
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:53,080
and here's what it comes back to though is

1183
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:58,719
we have done a very poor job of creating resilient systems.

1184
00:50:58,979 --> 00:51:02,820
And I think there's a variety of reasons for that. But I think fundamentally

1185
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:06,580
we need technology that is trustworthy to the point.

1186
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,760
You shouldn't have to worry about attachments or you

1187
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,100
shouldn't have to worry about downloading and executing things.

1188
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,080
It should just be,

1189
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:14,280
this shouldn't be a problem.

1190
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:14,790
And it is,

1191
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,770
and I know it's easy for me to say it shouldn't be a problem and it's really hard to

1192
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,580
solve because we both know how much work it

1193
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,780
is to actually get this stuff to work correctly.

1194
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,479
But

1195
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,000
that is really the, the bar we need to have.

1196
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,110
And unfortunately,

1197
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:31,179
I think people have just come to accept the crappiness of everything.

1198
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,219
And so they don't demand

1199
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:35,139
the, I guess quality

1200
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:39,459
that, that we, we need for society to function correctly.

1201
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,020
Well, I suspect this is one of the reasons that mobile phones have become

1202
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,639
and, or, or are in the process of becoming more the de facto compute platform.

1203
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:51,679
You know, it used to be desktops and then desktops and laptops.

1204
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:53,719
And now it's, in my opinion, from what I've seen,

1205
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:55,939
it's moving to cell phones and tablets

1206
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,610
and, you know, basically you have two players in town,

1207
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,330
you have Android and you have Apple's IOS.

1208
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,340
And while technically

1209
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:03,189
have Windows,

1210
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:07,929
-- Android is way ahead and it's totally a security nightmare man
-- because, well,

1211
00:52:07,939 --> 00:52:09,620
the challenge with Android is is

1212
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:13,989
if you are able to run an up to date version of Android from Google,

1213
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,149
then, then you're really quite secure.

1214
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,500
The problem is all these weird incentives by carriers to lock

1215
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,379
down the phones and not allow you to update them.

1216
00:52:21,649 --> 00:52:24,989
And so, like, that's why I'll never buy an Android phone because in Canada,

1217
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,590
most of these carriers do a terrible job of providing

1218
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,870
updates or supporting them for more than six months.

1219
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,070
I, I can't be using a phone that's like two years out of date. Software wise.

1220
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,979
No, I agree. And I bought a Nexus phone for this exact reason is because I,

1221
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:40,810
yeah, it's an, I bought

1222
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:43,139
it from Google where it's, it's unlocked

1223
00:52:43,379 --> 00:52:44,030
and

1224
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:47,350
it's updated once a month. I get my security update

1225
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,030
and everything is fine

1226
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:50,050
-- in theory.
-- Yeah.

1227
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,909
And I think I'm hoping more carriers will pull their heads out of there.

1228
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,979
-- You know what? I,
-- here's the thing though, people don't know or care.

1229
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:58,929
People are still buying these crappy phones

1230
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,550
and until there are economic demands that say they have to change their behavior,

1231
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,590
it will never get better.

1232
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:05,350
Right.

1233
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:09,229
And this is the same deal with email attachments

1234
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:12,649
and downloading and executing crap you find on the internet,

1235
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:15,189
like there is no economic incentive to do it.

1236
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:17,389
Right. It is just the sad reality.

1237
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:18,110
Yeah.

1238
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,270
Well, I'm hoping that's why, you know, some companies like, well, for example,

1239
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,550
you're a Nintendo run example, you know, from last

1240
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,189
I still can't download, come

1241
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:25,419
on,

1242
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,120
get it

1243
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:26,510
together.

1244
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:27,750
-- There's a
-- placeholder

1245
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:28,830
so you,

1246
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,389
you can't play this game either.

1247
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:35,320
Yeah. So,

1248
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,939
II, I think the good news is, at least we have two major platforms now that are,

1249
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:42,010
you know,

1250
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,129
um, well embraced by the public and reasonably secure because God,

1251
00:53:47,139 --> 00:53:50,699
can you imagine how terrible it would be if phones ran the equivalent of like,

1252
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,129
like a default windows install from five years ago?

1253
00:53:54,419 --> 00:53:55,919
They kind of do, man.

1254
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:58,330
It's, I think the thing that saves them

1255
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:04,020
is the Play Store because they've made it easier to download apps from the Play Store

1256
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:07,219
than they did to just go to dodgy internet sites and find them on your own.

1257
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:08,219
And let's face it.

1258
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:11,860
That is the fundamental problem windows had was you could,

1259
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:15,719
the whole ecosystem was built around finding dodgy

1260
00:54:15,729 --> 00:54:17,540
crap on the internet and installing it where?

1261
00:54:17,669 --> 00:54:17,739
Oh,

1262
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,780
yeah. No, it's, I ran into that last week. I was looking, um,

1263
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:24,379
I started playing a computer game and I wanted to check like,

1264
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:25,530
what are the requirements

1265
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:26,580
hardware wise.

1266
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:30,219
And so I was, you know, searching for like Hearts of Iron for, you know,

1267
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:30,830
hardware crime.

1268
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,860
I was trying to figure out basically, I was like, trying to price out, you know,

1269
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,479
what video card can I get at a minimum?

1270
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:34,899
You know,

1271
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,620
uh, CPU that kind of stuff.

1272
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:41,020
And I get to a website and it's like, oh, you know, it,

1273
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:44,459
it has these requirements and we have this helpful little like dot exc which you

1274
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:47,750
can download and run to see if your system meets the requirements and I'm like,

1275
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,010
no,

1276
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,979
definitely not running that. Like, there's no way this is legit,

1277
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,580
you know.

1278
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:58,580
Um Conversely I had to do this because uh the, that laptop I bought and loaded up the,

1279
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,189
the fan was acting wonky on it.

1280
00:55:00,419 --> 00:55:02,659
So I had to go to Lenovo and download some

1281
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,729
utilities from Lenovo, which it came from their website.

1282
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:08,899
-- So I'm, I'm hoping it's legit.
-- Was it signed?

1283
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:10,439
Uh No,

1284
00:55:11,449 --> 00:55:12,639
-- but
-- it had their brand,

1285
00:55:12,879 --> 00:55:14,520
it had their logo on it so that,

1286
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,570
you know,

1287
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,729
-- like bad guys never do that.
-- Yeah.

1288
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:19,110
So, you know, anyway, so I,

1289
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:21,870
I downloaded their diagnostic program from their website.

1290
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:24,879
It has their logo on it. But yeah, it was, it was unsigned if memory serves

1291
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:27,209
and windows of course, is like you really want to do this.

1292
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:29,929
And I'm like, no, I don't, but I have to,

1293
00:55:30,899 --> 00:55:33,709
you know, and this is one thing I look forward to actually is I've been

1294
00:55:33,899 --> 00:55:34,379
um

1295
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,979
there's actually a lot of Android apps I would like to run,

1296
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:39,520
but I don't want to get like a second phone, you know,

1297
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,439
and apparently now chromebooks are going to support Android apps

1298
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:44,179
this year. It's gonna be awesome.

1299
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,110
Yeah, I mean,

1300
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,679
because quite frankly that means I can get a chromebook and

1301
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,780
for sure there's like the whole software ecosystem is there,

1302
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:51,929
right?

1303
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:53,070
-- Everything I need, there's
-- just kind

1304
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,280
of stuff. Definitely,

1305
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:55,199
I look forward to it.

1306
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:56,719
-- Yeah.
-- So, you know,

1307
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,560
just,

1308
00:55:57,739 --> 00:56:00,199
yeah, I mean, if you make it easier for people, they,

1309
00:56:00,209 --> 00:56:02,909
they will do the more secure option if it's easier.

1310
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:07,260
Well, right. And I think that's kind of the whole idea. Right. Is

1311
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:13,120
we need to make security default and easy. And we've not done that and

1312
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:14,860
-- I, we may
-- never

1313
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:17,070
gone out of our way to stab people in the eye with a four.

1314
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:22,520
We've done amazing acrobatics to be very terrible to people. Yes.

1315
00:56:22,709 --> 00:56:23,610
Hopefully

1316
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:28,530
a I can help with some of this, but I will not claim it's going to save us all.

1317
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:30,810
But I think if anything is,

1318
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,889
it probably is our best bet at this point because I think it's, it's fair to say

1319
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,560
people aren't going to fix this stuff.

1320
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:43,709
I think it's a lot like crime. I mean, for example, if you get rid of 90% of crime,

1321
00:56:43,939 --> 00:56:45,080
that's a huge improvement.

1322
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:48,030
You know, if we can get rid of, um,

1323
00:56:48,899 --> 00:56:52,639
you know, 90% of attacks that would have succeeded in the past now,

1324
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:55,250
get blocked like ransomware type stuff, you know, imagine like you,

1325
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,360
you get a ransomware thing,

1326
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,379
you start encrypting all the files on the server and the server goes.

1327
00:56:58,389 --> 00:57:00,389
Whoa, that this does not seem right.

1328
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:03,899
I'm going to block your access for like 20 minutes and go alert it,

1329
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:05,280
you know,

1330
00:57:05,409 --> 00:57:08,879
right there. Like all your ransomware attacks suddenly become like

1331
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:12,320
annoying. Not like, oh, the buses don't work or?

1332
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,949
-- Oh, was it some public library got nailed.
-- Uh, I

1333
00:57:15,979 --> 00:57:16,000
say,

1334
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:16,389
I think

1335
00:57:17,419 --> 00:57:20,870
ST Louis public Library and I guess they paid the ransom because they

1336
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:24,699
apparently had backups, but paying the ransom got them back online

1337
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,929
much, much faster.

1338
00:57:27,439 --> 00:57:30,500
So, I mean, you know that right there, I mean, how much did they pay

1339
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,600
10,000?

1340
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,479
Whatever? It wasn't cheap.

1341
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,570
Yeah. So,

1342
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,820
you know, if these A I systems, I mean, the,

1343
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,879
I guess the good news is we're seeing attacks now that are

1344
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:43,639
painful enough to be a problem but not so painful that,

1345
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:45,080
that, you know, people aren't dying

1346
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,159
and

1347
00:57:49,149 --> 00:57:49,909
people are dying

1348
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,070
yet.

1349
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:52,639
Take comfort in that everybody.

1350
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:53,469
All right, let's,

1351
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:55,209
let's wrap it up, man.

1352
00:57:55,629 --> 00:57:55,699
Uh

1353
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,070
Thank you everybody for listening. It was a

1354
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:04,199
