Hello and welcome to the open source security podcast with myself,

1
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,779
Kurt Siefried and my partner and annoying people.

2
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:11,539
Josh Bresser.

3
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:12,890
Oh, no, that's wrong.

4
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,739
-- Annoying people at scale. Damn
-- it.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,920
Let's do it again. Uh Whatever use it.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,329
All right,

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:24,209
it's fine. It's all good. Uh Do I annoy people at scale? I probably do.

8
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:28,659
Well, I mean, if we were to insert a high pitched loud noise right now or hey, Siri,

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,600
turn off the lights.

10
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:33,080
-- I'm not
-- doing that. All right. That, that's fine. I'm ok with that one.

11
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:34,919
I wonder if I could tell,

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,380
I wonder if that would work. I always, I always use the room name

13
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:40,319
-- in addition to
-- light. Yeah.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,430
My theory on my watch is currently asking me which one I meant?

15
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:47,330
Oh, I see. Ok. Ok. We've just annoyed people two for the price of one.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,799
Now, their Siri is annoying them and I just know that

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,090
and this is exactly the show content is,

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,709
it's, it's the situations where it's not just sort of that initial annoyance,

19
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:58,229
but that like then the technology does something

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,470
stupid to make it even more annoying.

21
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:01,909
-- I mean, that
-- is true.

22
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,479
Oh, sir.

23
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:03,590
Still talking

24
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,649
Siri. Stop.

25
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:07,638
Which one is? I

26
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:08,528
lost my phone.

27
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:11,448
This is why I turned all that crap off.

28
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:12,278
Wow.

29
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:14,289
Ok. Wow. Stop Siri.

30
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:19,419
Oh wow. See this, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,779
So like a perfect example of this is when somebody sends out

32
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,690
an email to too many people like not using blank carbon copy.

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,419
And then you know somebody hits reply all saying

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,459
please stop and then it just evolves into madness.

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,230
We should start at the beginning before we get into this. Explain the

36
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:35,349
github issue.

37
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,510
-- That was the impetus of this episode.
-- Two things. It was the github

38
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:40,150
issue

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,459
where basically somebody did like a poll request

40
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,269
on a merge which seems reasonably normal.

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,610
But then they did like a bump T

42
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:49,019
and it

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,580
notified 400,000 people.

44
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,220
And, but the second thing is that,

45
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,000
that really triggered this for me is somebody posted on reddit.

46
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,800
They have a, a TV, as one does nowadays

47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,489
and it has Bluetooth support as they all do nowadays.

48
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:05,319
And his neighbor keeps trying to pair with it and so on his TV,

49
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,860
he keeps having to hit cancel

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,500
and there's no way to like block his neighbor from trying to pair to his TV.

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,779
I saw that one.

52
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,500
I feel bad for the owner of that TV.

53
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,440
And I recognize

54
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,710
that

55
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,429
there are a lot of really bad TV. S out there.

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,559
And II, I keep thinking like, I don't even know what I do in this situation.

57
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:29,149
Well, the, the, the one comment was basically just change the name to do not like,

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,309
do not use this one.

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,589
Maybe. I mean,

60
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,550
I guess,

61
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,399
-- or
-- the other thing I've seen is you, you change it to like a Z,

62
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,380
something so it alphabetically sorts to the bottom.

63
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,070
So they hopefully stop trying to use it.

64
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,789
Maybe. Maybe unless

65
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:44,479
I wonder if the neighbor is, actually, I, I didn't,

66
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,050
-- I didn't look
-- what if they have the same model of TV.

67
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,899
That's the thing. I don't, I don't know if they've talked to their neighbor.

68
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,539
-- I, I don't, that wasn't in the story. Do you
-- even?

69
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,119
But if you live in an apartment building, like,

70
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,779
do you just randomly knock on every door in 100 m radius?

71
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,919
That's true. Like, because I remember the first time I went wardrobe

72
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:02,369
and it was interesting because it was kind of

73
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,039
what I expected out in the suburbs with like,

74
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,460
ding a house, ding a house and then I went downtown and it was just like,

75
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,389
right,

76
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:11,130
because I drove by this one apartment building and all of a sudden and it

77
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,059
was an apartment building that had like the big kind of glass front which,

78
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,690
you know, lets the Wi Fi out, no problem.

79
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,259
And my,

80
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,130
my wi fi thing just basically barfed on me

81
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,580
because it all of a sudden saw like 300 networks

82
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:26,080
and, you know, that's the thing like modern Bluetooth, the specified range is 100 m.

83
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:29,729
It's obviously going to be a bit less in a, in a building, but still, even

84
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,619
20 m is gonna be tens of people, at least 10

85
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,520
people

86
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,559
at least.

87
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:37,270
And so,

88
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,149
and there's no way to like,

89
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,229
make it stop. That's, that's what drives me nuts with this.

90
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,809
Like my fire alarm doesn't have a bacon mode.

91
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,490
So every time I'm cooking bacon, I'm like

92
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,559
it beeps and then of course, the one in the basement, it's like, 000 my God.

93
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,410
The one in the kitchen is angry. I better get angry too.

94
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,750
It's like, oh, there's a fire in the kitchen.

95
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,270
And I'm like the one in the basement, I'm like,

96
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,690
just shut up like nobody's in the basement, nobody cares.

97
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:02,720
Like, so I'm actually getting rid of my nest smoke alarms because so I had two smoke,

98
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:03,690
two nest smoke alarms,

99
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,350
traditionally one for the kitchen and one for near the

100
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,690
furnace and they just started beeping all the time.

101
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:07,929
And I,

102
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,410
this was like years ago and I uttered Nest and they

103
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,059
sent out replacements because this was apparently a known problem.

104
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,949
And if you made enough noise, they would replace it free.

105
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,730
Otherwise they just kind of expected you to buy new ones.

106
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:19,949
And so I've got the, this, these two quote unquote,

107
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,528
new ones that are a couple of years old

108
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:22,319
and

109
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,239
it started eating batteries like I would put fresh six fresh batteries in

110
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:29,709
and like 20 minutes later it would be doing the chirp, like the battery is dying.

111
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:31,628
Oh, wow. So I'm just done with it.

112
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,158
Like I, I threw it out and I'm going to throw the other one out and I'm basically,

113
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,669
I'll be blunt, I'm looking for a not smart option

114
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:38,819
that has

115
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:39,319
a,

116
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:42,118
like a big button that I can easily get it to

117
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,148
tell it to be quiet for when I'm cooking bacon.

118
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,910
That's it.

119
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,910
That's all I want a smoke alarm. Now in my kitchen,

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,480
I mean, ok,

121
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,350
this raises,

122
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,359
I think some interesting points and especially from

123
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:55,589
the security implications of all of this.

124
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,959
So it's easy to say, oh ha ha. You contacted 400,000 people. It's easy to laugh at.

125
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,910
Oh, the dumb person keeps replying to the email thread.

126
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,739
But the reality is especially when we put on our security hats,

127
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,239
all of us have

128
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:14,720
-- like a limited amount of cognitive ability each day
-- and time.

129
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,589
This is why spam filters had to happen because I can't wait through 10,000 spams.

130
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:22,600
No. Exactly. Well, even it, it doesn't matter about time.

131
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:25,239
It's just the fact that even if I said Kurt,

132
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,170
your job today is to go through 10,000 email messages.

133
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:28,420
Right.

134
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,690
You're cognitively just not going to be able to do the

135
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,290
task after probably five or 10 minutes because it's just not something

136
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,500
that humans are good at.

137
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,890
And I think all of these kind of alarms

138
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,980
and all of these notifications and stuff,

139
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:43,070
you end up with the fatigue and you just don't notice it.

140
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,029
Alarm fatigue. Exactly.

141
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,790
Well, I love your comment where you're like,

142
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,779
I did the thing and get up, sent you an email. I'm like, yeah, kid up, sent me an email.

143
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,709
Absolutely. And all of that crap gets filtered into archives.

144
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,399
I mean, I do that too. In fact, what I do now is github

145
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,989
actually has a uh if you go to github.com/notifications,

146
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,720
it shows you all your notifications in a very handy and easy to parse format.

147
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,470
And that's what I use.

148
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,720
I don't even use the email anymore because I was getting way too much email and,

149
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,500
and I tried to like,

150
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,640
filter out the things I wanted to know and I still kept missing too much stuff.

151
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:14,880
Whereas the notifications are very nice, very easy.

152
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,910
I can quickly look at what's going on

153
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,429
and get a feel for it and

154
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,920
like when something goes wrong and there's like

155
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:23,684
some bizarro spam thread happening in an issue,

156
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:25,834
I can be like gone like we're done with you

157
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,144
versus getting 700 emails that I have to weed through.

158
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:28,984
So anyway, anyway,

159
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:32,684
my point of all this, I think, I think the thing for us to think about

160
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:35,165
and, and the real topic of the day

161
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,684
is just the fact that

162
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:39,345
we have all of these tools, we have all this technology,

163
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:43,265
we have everything going on around us and it's just like constantly buffeting us

164
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:46,464
-- with information.
-- No, I wouldn't say information.

165
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:48,595
It's, it's just random junk mostly.

166
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:50,584
I mean, information applies value.

167
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,239
Not necessarily. I think

168
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,750
they

169
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,359
like noise is information. It's not valuable information.

170
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:00,179
OK. Oh, we're going to a classic.

171
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,950
-- OK. Definition. OK.
-- Fair. It is information.

172
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,589
This is something I think about a lot in the context of security

173
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,399
is

174
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,070
how do you make sure that you're communicating in a manner

175
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:13,859
that

176
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,950
makes it understood that like when Josh comes

177
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,390
and asks something or says to do something,

178
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,730
this is important and you need to pay attention.

179
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:26,059
And I'm very, I'm extremely aware of this at work and I try really, really hard

180
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,029
to almost never

181
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,809
tell the organization like you have to do something.

182
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,309
Like for example, there was a really bad,

183
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:32,613
I had a

184
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:37,023
chrome thing, I think like a month ago where it was being actively exploited,

185
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:40,322
-- Cisa
-- sent out like three or four update chrome.

186
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,333
Now there's a bad thing happening in like two weeks. It was, I was like,

187
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,083
is this just the rest of my life?

188
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:48,803
Like every two, twice a week, we're supposed to update chrome now right away.

189
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:50,483
Perfect example of this, right?

190
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:55,562
And that was 11 instance where I told the company I'm like, please update

191
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,696
Chrome and please make sure automatic updates are on. It should be.

192
00:07:58,705 --> 00:07:59,985
But I want you to double check

193
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:02,955
and then then yes, we got another message from S uh

194
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,096
like a a day or two later

195
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:07,346
and everyone was like, you're gonna email us again.

196
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:08,135
I was like, no,

197
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:11,805
I emailed you once like that is going to have to be enough because

198
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:15,615
-- I can't do this every time it happens
-- and that speaks to things.

199
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:18,795
So for example, like in that situation, I was

200
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,000
you need to update chrome but yeah, make sure updates are enabled but sorry,

201
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,690
going back to github

202
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,799
notifications for a second, I just logged in, went to my notification settings

203
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,570
and there's like global settings like email, web and mobile blah, blah, blah.

204
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,000
Then there's custom routing.

205
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,659
So for each organization, I'm a member of,

206
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,020
I can route to a different email address but there's no way to selective.

207
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,380
No, it's not nice because there's no way to selectively say, like

208
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:41,919
for example, I'm a member of the CV project organization.

209
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,679
I don't, I don't ever want to get a notification from that project.

210
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,039
-- You
-- can just unwatched and then they go away.

211
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,609
I have to go unwatched.

212
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,909
You go to the project and then you unwatched it at the top.

213
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,539
So here's what I love is the CV project is list to my notifications,

214
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:55,580
but it's not a clickable link.

215
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,679
I have to go manually. Let's type this

216
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,219
in.

217
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:02,479
Yeah, this is not a good U I, it's a U I for engineers which means that

218
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,559
I'm shocked to learn this.

219
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,109
Ah Here's the fun part.

220
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:08,299
You have to go manually.

221
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:11,969
Unwatched every repo, I can't just globally unwatched an organization.

222
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:15,270
So I have to figure out which repo I'm listening to. So, here I go. I have to.

223
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,210
And this is a perfect example. I now have to go click on. They have 15 repos.

224
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,530
I have to open up all 15 repos and make sure I'm not watching one of them

225
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,719
and I don't think I'm watching any of them.

226
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:24,530
I don't know.

227
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,849
How do I see what I'm watching?

228
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,320
It turns out there's actually if you go to github.com/watching

229
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,539
and I am apparently watching 100 and 20 repost. Nice.

230
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,679
-- Oh, I have to look at this now, github.com/
-- watching.

231
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,880
So it's, it's basically everything you fork by default you're watching.

232
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,150
I am watching 34 repos

233
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:45,049
and here's the best part.

234
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:47,400
There's no bulk changeability here.

235
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,919
There's no like little check box at the top where I can check and it checks all of them.

236
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:55,200
I have to go click 100 and 20 times and change from all activity

237
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,570
to either participating or not. Oh, so there is actually a same setting.

238
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,969
There's participating in mentions,

239
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,210
only receive notifications from this repository when participating or

240
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,969
mentioned.

241
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,130
Why can't that be the default instead of all activity?

242
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,289
Also, it doesn't show me what activity I'm, I have to,

243
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,700
I have to literally click on 100 and 20 buttons

244
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:15,450
because the U I does not show me

245
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,700
what level I'm I'm watching at

246
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:18,559
by default.

247
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:21,859
It just says unwatched. Well, you can click unwatched, I guess.

248
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,929
And so I have to click this 100 and 20 times

249
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,659
and I can't just make a bulk change.

250
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,880
This is, this is,

251
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,619
this is exactly the problem I'm talking about is not

252
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,919
only is getting spamming the bejesus out of me,

253
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:38,039
but for me to not get spammed, I now have to take probably about a good hour of my day.

254
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,280
Right? And obviously

255
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:39,965
correct answer.

256
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:43,275
-- The answer is a script obviously.
-- But you know what I'm saying?

257
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:47,794
Like this is, this makes me somewhat physically ill in that I need to use github

258
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:48,635
for work.

259
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:51,234
And the solution obviously is everything from at

260
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,515
github.com goes into my archives and I just.

261
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:54,424
Right.

262
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:55,700
Yep.

263
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,369
That's the answer everyone has.

264
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,340
If, if 100 and 20 times 30 seconds, bam, that's an hour.

265
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,099
Right.

266
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:04,419
Yep. Yep. And, and so I think that's

267
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,099
like, it's funny

268
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,380
because all of this together

269
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,010
adds up to something important.

270
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,429
And I think this is even true of just a lot of security problems in general.

271
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,700
It's just often. Oh, that's not that bad. That's not that bad. That's not that bad.

272
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,289
And then you add up the 100 not bad things and you have a serious problem,

273
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,380
potholes, one pothole in the city and I'd be like, wow,

274
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,030
like whoever did that, I'm voting for them again.

275
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,049
But yeah. No, we don't have a pothole in the city. We have,

276
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:31,460
I would have to guess on the order of

277
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:35,130
millions based on how many are just on side streets alone.

278
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,549
And the thing is, most of them don't matter,

279
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,520
you know. But it adds up the perfect example.

280
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,049
There's a, there's a street train in front of my house

281
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,780
and the sidewalk above it is really crack.

282
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:46,049
Like if you're in a wheelchair, you would have a hard time getting over it.

283
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,809
Like, remember this is the story I keep telling where I was leaf,

284
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,130
blowing the dirt and dust off my sidewalk.

285
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,780
You know, because it's spring and

286
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,320
I'm trying to blow all the dirt and sand back onto the road from, you know, road grit

287
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,739
and like, I, you know, chunks of concrete came off.

288
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,960
And I'm like, if my little electric leaf blower, like I got the little baby DeWalt,

289
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,880
if it blows up chunks of concrete, that's not my fault. Like that's, that's a,

290
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:08,140
the sidewalks broken, you know. And so

291
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,030
how long is this going to take to get fixed?

292
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:13,450
And I just hope nobody in a wheelchair has to navigate these sidewalks because

293
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:17,840
right, every 30 40 ft you have an obstacle and it becomes impossible to.

294
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,229
I, I remember when I lived in my last place, there was a,

295
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,440
a guy in a wheelchair who used the road and I'm like, I hate this, I hate this,

296
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,039
but I totally get why he does it because

297
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,690
the roads are in better shape than the sidewalks.

298
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,940
I, I get that too.

299
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:30,719
They're actually, so, it's, it's funny you mentioned that.

300
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,900
So, where you live in Canada, if the sidewalk is crap,

301
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,979
it's the city's job to come and fix the sidewalk.

302
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,919
Yeah.

303
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,719
I, well, yeah, because the city comes out and replaces them every once in a while,

304
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,359
by the way, once in a while, I mean, every 50 to 100 years.

305
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,409
So, where I live

306
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:49,710
it is my problem to fix the sidewalks.

307
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:50,539
And if the city,

308
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,690
the city sends people out every couple of years

309
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
to inspect the sidewalks and if there's something wrong,

310
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,750
they will send you a letter that basically says

311
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,289
you can fix this now or we're going to come fix it and

312
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,770
we're going to charge you way more than it's going to cost you.

313
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,919
That's annoying because it's the,

314
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,330
they should be fixing this because they do it at scale and they should do

315
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,030
it a lot cheaper than me hiring some random contractor to think one little spot.

316
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,530
Whereas,

317
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,140
you know, the city, like when the city comes through and fills potholes,

318
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,380
they feel like hun like 100 potholes.

319
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,429
We have to stop talking about potholes. Did I ban you from talking about potholes?

320
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:20,940
And

321
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:23,750
this is my new thing.

322
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,460
I win a point.

323
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:30,429
Um But no, this is like, but I'm just looking at this and it's like 100 and 20.

324
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,789
I have to click 100 and 20 times at a minimum.

325
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,780
And then I have to also one click to click on UN watch.

326
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,710
Then I have to look at it and process what it is

327
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,539
and then I have to make a choice

328
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,859
and move on to the next one

329
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:45,989
or you just keep doing what you're doing now and ignoring all those males.

330
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,099
Yeah, exactly.

331
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,700
Well, and the other thing is moving forward if I, if I,

332
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,090
uh, clone or whatever, any repost or join any organizations,

333
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:56,330
I again have to go through this and there's, there's, as far as I can tell,

334
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,159
there's no way to set my default notifications to like, just by default only.

335
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,039
Like I'm looking at the notifications and there's,

336
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,840
there's a default notification email.

337
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,359
That's it. That's the only thing you can set. That's a default.

338
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:09,619
This is getting boring. Yeah. Well, and that's, and that's part of the problem too.

339
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,500
Is this again? This is because it's a death by 1000 cuts on its own.

340
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,679
It's not like whatever, who cares, but

341
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:19,280
it's like noise pollution. It just adds up and everybody has crap hearing now

342
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,890
because we're, you know, constantly being assaulted.

343
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,669
Ok?

344
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,000
I want,

345
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,419
I want to bring us back around to

346
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,929
the security angle because I think it's very interesting

347
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,700
and we're not talking about it at all

348
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:29,619
is

349
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,000
this is one of those instances where

350
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:35,429
there are going to be things from github.

351
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,239
For example, I'll just pick on github because that's what we're doing today.

352
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,260
There's going to be messages from github

353
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:43,030
that I need to pay attention to, for some reason.

354
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:47,219
-- Did you change your password? No, I didn't.
-- 00, I don't know if I get those or not.

355
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:48,969
I hope I get those. I should check that.

356
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:49,770
Yeah.

357
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:53,010
But, because you've got so much filtering on you don't know if you get them or not.

358
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,450
Right.

359
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,469
And, and that, I mean, like, that kind of stuff is exactly the point is there are,

360
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,039
or even ignoring those kind of messages.

361
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,619
Actually. No, I do because you know what? I just created a,

362
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:02,830
a

363
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,460
token,

364
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,690
an access token, forget, um, for a work demo I'm giving later today.

365
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,419
And the access token

366
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,570
sent me a mail that said someone has created

367
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,260
an access token for your github account and that,

368
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,219
that did the right thing.

369
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,179
So that's cool.

370
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,039
But

371
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:19,859
no, what, what,

372
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:23,159
what it is is your filters are sophisticated enough that it didn't just eat it

373
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,010
and most people don't have sophisticated filters. They just are like,

374
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,940
you know, filter all email like this.

375
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,890
Sure, whatever it doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

376
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,409
But anyway,

377
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:35,710
the point is there are things I need to see and there's things I'm going to miss and

378
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:40,140
this is one of the issues I have anytime I set up filtering on any kind of service is

379
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,460
especially as a security person. I know there are certain events I want and now

380
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,539
I have the choice. Do I

381
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,400
UN filter

382
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:51,549
and try to manually go through. Do I try to write

383
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,679
some Rube Goldberg filtering system?

384
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,880
Do you know what I mean?

385
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,210
And I mean, this is true of messages from your SIM system,

386
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:02,619
messages from your endpoint system messages from like everything

387
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,030
you're going to be overloaded with messages.

388
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,340
And of course, if you talk to vendors, they're gonna say, oh,

389
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:10,409
our super A IML system will filter only what you need.

390
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,599
And it's like, I don't think it will

391
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,969
freaking Google.

392
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,320
If I mark a message of spam, it looks like phishing.

393
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,599
About 20 minutes later.

394
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:22,989
I get like an administrative email saying a user has noticed a surge

395
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,320
in spam and phishing emails and it emails me and I'm like,

396
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,260
yeah, that, that was me that marked it as that

397
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,119
as

398
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,530
a, as a, as

399
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:29,669
a,

400
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,049
as a Google administrator. And so,

401
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,979
-- and like everybody like all the admins get these,
-- I'm not a Gmail admin.

402
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:37,590
I, I won't let them make me one. I'm

403
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,440
-- like, no, I'm too dumb to do this.
-- It's

404
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,260
-- just
-- so unspeakably stupid,

405
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,380
but they don't care.

406
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,239
Well, you know what it reminds me of is so the BC government next door to my province

407
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,859
had a heat dome last year, 600 people died

408
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,679
and there was an inquiry, of course, because

409
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,270
600 people died, you know,

410
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,770
we should probably figure out what happened and if we can make

411
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,969
it less worse the next time around or maybe even better.

412
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,330
And so one of the recommendations is, of course,

413
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,000
is to warn people when there's a heatwave coming.

414
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,400
So they've decided that they will warn people

415
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,920
when there's like a heat dome or heat wave thing coming

416
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:10,378
by. Using the freaking emergency alert system.

417
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,358
Like, on your phone. What else are they gonna use? Anything?

418
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,388
But that, because there's two problems with that one,

419
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:19,628
it's way too loud, like it's, it's way too much. You know what I mean?

420
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,489
It, it, all those shift workers that aren't going to get woken up because in Canada,

421
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:25,529
fun fact you can't disable that crap on your phone.

422
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:26,098
I've tried

423
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:26,868
on my, I

424
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:31,698
disabled mine. I don't know. You can or you can at least make it, not make noise.

425
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,379
I can't

426
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:37,319
because in Canada they use the, like the nuclear alarm code alert basically.

427
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,760
And it just screams until you tell it to stop.

428
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,280
And it's really awesome.

429
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:41,849
Like, you know,

430
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,760
with my one son who has his phone in his

431
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,119
backpack and his backpack starts screaming at the world.

432
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,130
But the second thing is also like,

433
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,920
not everybody has a cell phone and

434
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,719
essentially the people most vulnerable to the heat

435
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:55,219
are also the people who don't own cell phones

436
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,010
because if they could afford cell phones,

437
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,380
they might also be able to buy an air conditioner.

438
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,660
That's, that's probably fair.

439
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,930
The government did something we're going to warn people,

440
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,989
but like, they're doing it in the worst possible way. In my opinion,

441
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,079
I I think

442
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:16,079
what you just said is the second part of all of these problems is,

443
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:17,550
yeah,

444
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,599
I think there's a prevailing attitude of doing anything is better than nothing.

445
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:24,280
-- The goalkeeper's dilemma.
-- Yes, exactly. That,

446
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,979
-- yeah,
-- I have to dive left or. Right.

447
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,839
Right. Right. Yeah, if you stand there, you look like an idiot.

448
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:33,250
I think just alerts in general kind of fall into that category is

449
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,439
people think they need to do something.

450
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,319
And,

451
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,040
but then if, if everyone thinks that

452
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:41,910
you end up overwhelmed and I mean, this is like I said, of,

453
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,959
of security alerts is I want to make sure that,

454
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:47,160
that the people I work with understand that if I mail them,

455
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:49,560
it's really, really, really important.

456
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,359
And if I mailed them once a week,

457
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,199
they'd be like, oh, whatever, another mail from Josh, I don't care.

458
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:58,310
Well, I've, I've had people try and sell me a SIM and I'm like, no,

459
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:03,400
I will not because real simple now we have to, it's a puppy. We have to care and feed it.

460
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,119
-- Who's
-- going to do a lot of work. Yes. And, and

461
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,319
there are times you need it.

462
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:12,040
I mean, my suspicion is that the cloud security lines might never, we're lucky

463
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,089
because of how we,

464
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:13,619
how I

465
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:17,959
like how I've not just engineered our systems but our, like our, it culture.

466
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,079
Yeah. No,

467
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,719
there's literally nothing we can do that would be

468
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,439
better than what Google or sales force are doing.

469
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:25,119
For us.

470
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,810
It's that simple.

471
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,369
I, I think that's the other thing is people forget the

472
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:30,959
operational cost.

473
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,780
And now that I say that it's, they're basically externalized.

474
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,410
It's, it's classic security of,

475
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,900
I don't have to care about your pi I,

476
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,329
I'll just externalize that cost because if we get breached your pi I gets

477
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,770
sked,

478
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,329
somebody takes out a mortgage in your name. That's not my problem. Right.

479
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:48,380
We offered a year of free credit monitoring for $7.

480
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,079
And I'm kind of reminded, this is exactly what this is, is,

481
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:54,250
well, here's all the alerts we solve the problem.

482
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:54,989
Right.

483
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,750
-- What do you mean? You didn't read your alerts?
-- Yeah.

484
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,530
Yeah, we, we sent you an alert for that

485
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,849
but you also sent me, like,

486
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:05,250
I don't even know how many, if I type in github.com in my,

487
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:06,449
oh,

488
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,050
you know, I'm actually not getting that much email from github.

489
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,060
It's only like 20 maybe 30 messages a day. Now.

490
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,660
Is that all?

491
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,109
Well, it's like every time, well, part of it is,

492
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,900
I actually think I might have de notified myself on a couple of the CS, a repos,

493
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,420
like the main website where the, like

494
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:24,780
the devs are pretty active there.

495
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,699
Like,

496
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,319
I guess, I think that's what this boils down to because that's, you know,

497
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:29,709
that's exactly what this feels like is like

498
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,569
the data breaches with the externalized cost.

499
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:31,949
It's,

500
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:33,729
it's the same dynamics.

501
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,099
Yeah, alert, fatigue generally doesn't affect the person sending the alert.

502
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,229
It usually only ends up affecting the people receiving the alert.

503
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:44,969
I mean, this is even true. Think about if you have a SIM,

504
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,829
and you're getting tons of alerts

505
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,189
and you miss the alert of the attacker getting into

506
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,250
the web server and the web server gets hacked.

507
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,229
You know what they're gonna do?

508
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,359
They're going to say, ok, who didn't, who waive this alert?

509
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:59,640
Oh, you, Kurt, you weigh the alert. You don't work here anymore, right? I,

510
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,010
I fixed it. Everyone. I fired Kurt. He was obviously an idiot.

511
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,010
The problem wasn't that Kurt had 10,000

512
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,739
alerts.

513
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,609
-- He had to look at the problem was, he's just, I
-- mean, ok, I'll, I'll,

514
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:10,640
I'll tell this tale because it's, you know,

515
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,569
like when I worked at Red Hat Bugzilla sends out a lot of email alerts.

516
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,949
-- Oh, man, it was brutal. Yeah.
-- Fun fact. If you go to,

517
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,520
if you go to Bugzilla dot Red hat.com and search for my work email address,

518
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,739
the site is not broken. You just have to wait 2 to 3 minutes for the query to return.

519
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,119
Right. That's how many bugs I was filing and involved in a Red Hat.

520
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,739
Like, it's, it's into the thousands.

521
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,910
And so when I worked at Red Hat,

522
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,939
I was receiving on the order of 1 to 3000 Bugzilla emails per day.

523
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,250
And I remember some people kind of expected me to read all of them and I'm like,

524
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,780
no, like,

525
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,880
like literally everybody, somebody time somebody takes a person onto a bug or,

526
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,520
and I tried that, I remember trying to build filters

527
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:57,400
and then with Zimba, you could kind of build filters, but it was pretty

528
00:21:57,689 --> 00:22:00,630
yuck. And then with Gmail, the filters weren't as good.

529
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,130
So I actually,

530
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,359
at one point I was trying to use IMAP sync to download

531
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,349
my mail filter it locally using proc mail and reupload it.

532
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,920
This is clearly insanity.

533
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,949
And so I ended up just filtering pretty much the vast majority of it. And, you know,

534
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:15,420
only if a bug went public or something major

535
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,250
reading 1 to 3000 emails. That's, that's multiple full time jobs.

536
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:23,459
You can't do that. And look, here's so here's the thing that

537
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:28,339
always happens is, is like you'll say, oh, you can't, 1000 emails takes too long.

538
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,670
It, if I gave you enough time to do it,

539
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,219
you can't do it because humans can't read 1000 emails,

540
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,479
it's too boring and we quit paying attention.

541
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:38,859
It's like

542
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,040
I need to find it.

543
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,300
There's some test a university did at one point where they showed alerts to people

544
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:46,770
and eventually they changed the language of the alerts

545
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,810
and like nobody noticed because they were just clicking,

546
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,560
-- ok, like, as fast as they could, you
-- know, I'm reminded of, you know,

547
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:57,099
they've done studies with people with like police snipers and

548
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,780
also the airport security people watching the X ray machines

549
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,260
15 minutes. Then you got to swap them out.

550
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:02,680
Yeah.

551
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,689
Right. Exactly.

552
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,650
And last I checked those X

553
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,260
machine people.

554
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,859
I don't, I don't know, actually, I don't know how often they, they swap them.

555
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:14,819
It really depends on which airport and country. But most of them they're,

556
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,270
well, like every time they do the FAA test, right.

557
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,000
The, the airports fail 80 to 90% of the time. Right.

558
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,109
Like, I mean,

559
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,040
there was that famous case where somebody stole a sweater at a

560
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,750
checkpoint and the sweater had a fake hand grenade in it that,

561
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,709
you know, the FAA had been using as a security test.

562
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:29,030
So

563
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:31,530
they put the sweater on the airplane and the grenade falls

564
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,579
out and it causes a bit of an incident obviously because,

565
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:36,430
you know, at that point, you can't ignore it because the stewardess is like,

566
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:37,050
excuse me, sir.

567
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,030
Is that your hand grenade?

568
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,599
Why? Yes, yes, it is. Thank you for noticing.

569
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,209
Well, I'm always reminded of like if you Google this, like

570
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,599
just Google accidentally brought gun onto airplane

571
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,000
and there's so many cases of where a person is just like, I'm so sorry,

572
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:55,160
here's my briefcase and the stewardess is like, what? Like, I don't want your brief.

573
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,869
He's like just my gun is in there, please. I, I don't want any trouble.

574
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,930
I'm gonna be here quietly

575
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,280
and it's like, what?

576
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,800
Like I've accidentally brought knives onto planes

577
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,369
that are over the three inch limit and I'm like, whoops,

578
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,209
I've have, I ever accidentally,

579
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,050
I, I don't remember.

580
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,410
I'm, I'm certain I've accidentally brought banned items on airplanes in the past

581
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,310
or more than 100 mils of liquid,

582
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,319
-- whatever.
-- Maybe you smuggled some peanut butter on board. Apparently.

583
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,369
Peanut butter is a liquid.

584
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,599
-- I don't think peanut butter. No, no pastes don't count.
-- Oh,

585
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,729
-- they got sensible. Finally.
-- It's totally different,

586
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:29,609
I

587
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:32,839
think. Well, maybe, I don't know. That's the thing. Who knows?

588
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:34,319
You know, what else it reminds me of.

589
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:35,569
I remember when,

590
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,560
do you remember when the Ts A had their like warning levels and it was like green,

591
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:43,359
blue, red and purple and people were like, what, what do any of these even mean?

592
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,979
And it was like, you might as well use a, uh, a fruit as your,

593
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:49,479
your alert levels because they, they're meaningless to people.

594
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,160
Like, what is the difference between yellow and red? Nobody knows.

595
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,349
Well, that's

596
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:55,819
apparently today's big theme at RS A today.

597
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,030
So I know we're not supposed to be time temporarily

598
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,569
-- linked in the show because it might come out
-- later.

599
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:01,079
This will come out at the end of the week.

600
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,050
But so basically, apparently the biggest thing right now at Rs A is,

601
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,930
or was it yesterday?

602
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:07,930
The, the, the CIA guy was giving a talk about how this whole, you know, they,

603
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,979
they cisa declared that like shields up like

604
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:12,209
the Russians are getting grumpier than usual.

605
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,329
And basically, he was talking about the saying like,

606
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:16,290
this is shields up is not going away

607
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,119
like this is the new normal.

608
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,989
-- Wait,
-- wait. So he's saying like,

609
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,540
just every, everything's all right, alarm will never sound again.

610
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,619
Is that what he's saying?

611
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,680
Or is he saying,

612
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,630
like they're going to keep raising and lowering their shield warnings?

613
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:33,439
It sounds like, well, they issued the shields up warning in, uh, February.

614
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,310
Yeah, February 25th. It looks like,

615
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,839
-- and
-- it's never come down and it will never come down ever again.

616
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,069
Well, it's, I mean,

617
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,550
but now, now here's the thing though,

618
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,729
now it's meaningless,

619
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,560
right.

620
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,910
The Russians might attack any day now.

621
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,719
Well, what am I gonna do about it? Right.

622
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,839
And eventually people stop caring.

623
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:54,979
It's like, it's like all the, all the COVID stuff, man.

624
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,290
I, I saw some security people are like,

625
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,400
I can't believe how many people don't have masks at RS A and it's like

626
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,459
people are burnt out and they just quit carrying and this is what people do like

627
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,189
it like it just, it,

628
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,560
I believe the current,

629
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:10,930
uh, what is the current threat level?

630
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,689
No, I, you know, here's the great thing.

631
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:14,849
I cannot find the current threat level in Canada.

632
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,780
I can find a listing of our terrorism threat levels,

633
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,790
but the actual current

634
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:22,609
threat level, I, I cannot find it on Google.

635
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,989
So obviously it's not that important brush,

636
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:25,579
it's too,

637
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:26,020
pretty

638
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,449
much.

639
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:27,359
I

640
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:27,689
do,

641
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,319
-- I do need to go brush my teeth. I just ate,
-- you, brush your teeth every time you eat,

642
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,930
I'm too lazy for that.

643
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,869
Not every time. But when I, when I eat certain things because you can see these gaps.

644
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,380
-- I got like,
-- show me your teeth,

645
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,680
I got like four gaps in my teeth that are just

646
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:42,880
the right size for food to get jammed in there.

647
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,839
-- I see.
-- I see.

648
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:46,609
I still have a wire in the bottom of my teeth because when I got my braces,

649
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:50,619
they put like a wire on the backside of my bottom teeth to keep them straight

650
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,050
and

651
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,959
food gets stuck in it,

652
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,260
but they're nice and straight. So I'm OK with it.

653
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,910
So you have like a permanent, like basically a chunk of rebar in your mouth

654
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,219
to keep your teeth.

655
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,290
-- I did not even know that was a thing on the
-- back side of my teeth.

656
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,380
-- The, the, the, the orthodontist put it
-- in,

657
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,069
it's like glued on like it's permanent.

658
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:10,500
It's cemented on. I've had it since I was 16.

659
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,699
And what, I'm 43 now, like, I'm very old.

660
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,719
I've had it replaced once because it,

661
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:18,890
it like enough of it broke off that I went into an orthodontist.

662
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,339
They were like, yeah, we got to replace this.

663
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,569
I've literally never heard of this technology.

664
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,650
I've had it my whole life.

665
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,170
Like I know about braces, but I never assumed they could just,

666
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:28,079
yeah, we

667
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,680
wild

668
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:30,449
or whatever.

669
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,729
And then it's funny because my brother had one

670
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:34,010
and he decided he didn't like it one day.

671
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,400
And he's like, can I borrow your wire cutters? I was like, sure it's over in the thing.

672
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,219
I'm like, what do you need to cut? He's like, I'm sick of this wire in my mouth.

673
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:41,109
I'm like, wait, what?

674
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,969
Like, yeah, and he took a wire cutters and literally cut the wire out of his mouth.

675
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:45,589
And how can he get in there?

676
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:49,785
Kurt, I didn't ask questions. I was like, I have nothing to do with this.

677
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:53,734
Like, I'm not driving you to the hospital if you like sever something terrible.

678
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:56,785
-- Like this is dumb. He's going
-- to chip a tooth for sure.

679
00:27:56,974 --> 00:28:00,665
I don't know. I don't know, but his bottom teeth are not nice and straight now. So

680
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:03,744
not if you're doing dentistry with wire cutters,

681
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:08,849
that's basically how it used to work. All right. Anyway, we need to wrap this one up.

682
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:11,069
I, I feel like this.

683
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,689
All right. So, first of all, the story was funny, someone accidentally

684
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,800
alerted 400 people at github.

685
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,140
Like

686
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:17,800
that's

687
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:19,359
400,000.

688
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,680
It's a lot, there's a lot of people. It's, it is. It is.

689
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:25,709
And, and it's funny, we know alert fatigue is bad

690
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:28,719
and I, I guess here's a funny thing though about it all. We know it's bad.

691
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:31,369
We know it doesn't work and we still keep sending alerts because we,

692
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,599
we don't know what else to do.

693
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:33,869
I found our threat level.

694
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,839
I have to interrupt Canada's current level is medium,

695
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,520
meaning that a violent act of terrorism could occur

696
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,040
and has been at this level since October 2014.

697
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,890
-- I mean,
-- is it the definition of a violent act could occur? Like,

698
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,520
isn't that always true?

699
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah.

700
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,599
I mean, yes,

701
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:55,020
-- terrorists could attack
-- so that the threat levels are very low is highly unlikely,

702
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,800
low is, is possible but unlikely medium is, could occur.

703
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:02,640
High is, is likely and critical is, is highly likely and could occur imminently.

704
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:03,790
This is idiotic.

705
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,150
We've had terrorist attacks in Canada, like since 2014,

706
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,510
but we haven't changed the threat level.

707
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,800
So they, they clearly didn't

708
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,150
anticipate or catch them or even have a wrinkle of them.

709
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:16,719
But again, this comes back to the,

710
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,430
when I'm the alert,

711
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:21,500
I have to pretend I'm doing something

712
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,689
and the alert

713
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,780
just learn to ignore you

714
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,459
because you clearly don't know what you're doing.

715
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,530
-- And like, that's basically the lesson of all this.
-- Here's what I love under medium.

716
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,180
Additional measures are in place to keep Canadians safe.

717
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:35,060
Well, no offense.

718
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:38,280
But if you're doing additional measures for eight years, that's not additional,

719
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:38,780
that's just,

720
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:40,550
that's normal. Now,

721
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,880
I would agree. I'd say if it's more than a month or two, that, that's just normal.

722
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,910
If you quit smoking for eight years, I would say you quit smoking successfully.

723
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,790
-- I, I'd be comfortable with that.
-- Yes.

724
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,229
Like if you quit smoking for a week, I'd be like, hey, you go like, good job,

725
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,219
you know, I'll buy you a steak, whatever

726
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:57,540
a month.

727
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,109
No, but like, eight years that, that is a fundamental, like,

728
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,349
you've now built a habit.

729
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,369
I would agree with that.

730
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,150
And, and, yeah. Right. Right. Exactly.

731
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,180
So, I'm just staring at this page. It is just

732
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,599
what does the threat level mean for you?

733
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,349
Canada's threat levels do not require specific responses from the public? Cool.

734
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,089
Then, like,

735
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:17,770
what's the point? Then

736
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,300
again though,

737
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,410
I'm doing something. Look at me, everyone

738
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:24,780
-- that is what it comes down to. Oh, we
-- have

739
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,189
-- a
-- national security tip line,

740
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,650
huh?

741
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:27,839
Regardless of threat level,

742
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:30,400
Canadians should always remain alert to the danger of terrorism and report

743
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,500
any suspicious activity to the national security tip line 1 800 blah

744
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:35,930
or by contacting the police in their community.

745
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,369
Ok.

746
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:44,060
But they don't, they don't specify what constitutes suspicious activity.

747
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:46,000
So I guess, you know, we'll figure that out on our own.

748
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,900
And again, this is like,

749
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,750
I'm sorry, but, and this kind of feeds into it again is like,

750
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,260
again, this, this Externalizing the cost of security is like,

751
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:57,400
tell me about, you know, well, we do this with users all the time.

752
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,989
Like don't click phishing emails, report suspicious emails.

753
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,410
Ok. What's a suspicious email? Well, you know, it's

754
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:04,400
suspicious exactly.

755
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,599
Like literally what I love is what actually constitutes the

756
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:11,000
definition of a phishing email versus a spear phishing email.

757
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:16,689
It doesn't matter because as the person issuing the alerts I'm doing something

758
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,660
and now by me doing something, when you do click the link in the fishing mail,

759
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,680
it's your fault because you didn't listen to me.

760
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:27,609
And that's what all of this comes down to. All of these alerts.

761
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,079
Everything we're talking about.

762
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:32,219
Like this is, sadly, the foundation of a lot of security

763
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,439
is just, I'm going to make sure you can't blame me because I did what I needed to do.

764
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,300
Well, you did enough that you could pass the buck

765
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,209
-- and get like plausible deniability.
-- That's,

766
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,010
that's it.

767
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:48,290
And I think what, what it really tells me in all this, this means you don't,

768
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,719
you don't understand the problem first of all,

769
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:52,329
and you have no idea what to do about it.

770
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:54,050
And so it's easier

771
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:58,905
to issue ridiculous warnings and alerts on a regular basis and be ignored

772
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:00,775
than it is to actually

773
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,474
understand the problem and solve it.

774
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:04,035
And that's basically what it is.

775
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:04,675
And I think there,

776
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:06,854
there is a lot of security that's more about

777
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:09,694
making noise than it is about understanding the problems.

778
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:11,035
I mean, we talk about this all the time.

779
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,209
How many times when you ask someone for like, what is the data behind your decision?

780
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:19,280
You're like, shut up nerd, go away. That is completely normal in security.

781
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,319
I'm, I'm at the point now where I don't even want the data behind the decision.

782
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:25,219
I just want like the framing and the context behind it.

783
00:32:25,229 --> 00:32:27,910
Like what does this word mean to you? Right.

784
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,219
Like, just even simple stuff of, like, what, what do you like,

785
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:33,739
what defines a terrorist act?

786
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:34,800
Ok.

787
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,880
So, like, if you're going to warn me about terrorist acts, can, can you tell me, like,

788
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,560
this report, a suspicious activity?

789
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:42,160
Great. I'd love to. Can you tell me what that is?

790
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:42,569
No,

791
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:44,239
-- no.
-- Or even a hint

792
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:45,699
anyway.

793
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:46,739
Yeah, I,

794
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,239
yeah,

795
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,189
it's time to go but it

796
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:51,239
is what it is and,

797
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,150
and I don't envision any of this

798
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,599
changing anytime soon because unfortunately this is,

799
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:58,800
I guess, you know what I would say if you made it this far and you're still listening,

800
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,479
like be mindful of the messages you send

801
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:04,489
out and try to make them actionable and impactful

802
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:08,329
and don't, don't overwhelm people because if you do,

803
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,750
they just ignore you

804
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:13,520
-- and there's no coming back from that
-- on the flip side, I'm going to say if you, if,

805
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,010
if you get accused, being accused of crying wolf is bad, alarm fatigue is bad.

806
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,810
But at the same time, if you don't

807
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:23,130
cry wolf and it turns out there was a wolf behind the rock that you didn't see.

808
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:25,239
Yeah, you get thrown under the bus.

809
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,719
So maybe part of it is just a quick bit of education to people because

810
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,500
like maybe part of it is to literally sit them down and say, look, we can,

811
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,540
I can make sure you're always aware of threats,

812
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
but there's a catch

813
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:39,219
and that catch is I'm going to warn you every seven minutes about a threat.

814
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:40,329
-- Totally
-- reasonable.

815
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,660
-- Yeah,
-- I think that's where we land.

816
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,939
